5|$|The 36th Engineer Brigade {{is part of}} III Corps, and {{consists}} of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company, which is located at Fort Hood, Texas and three engineering battalions: 2nd Engineer Battalion, 20th Engineer Battalion, 62nd Engineer Battalion. Additionally, the 507th <b>Firefighting</b> Detachment and the 557th <b>Firefighting</b> Detachment are also assigned to the brigade.|$|E
5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful <b>firefighting</b> for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective <b>firefighting</b> system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{morning the}} wind shifted again, {{this time to}} the north. The <b>firefighting</b> finally started to show some semblance of organization, and efforts were waged to stop {{the fire in the}} {{neighborhood}} around Magstræde. This failed, though, when the fire took the soap factory on Magstræde around noon. The wind was now blowing northwest and the <b>firefighting</b> moved via Snaregade to Nybrogade, Naboløs and Gammel Strand, but failed to save Nybrogade.|$|E
5|$|A planned {{monument}} to the 1989 earthquake, the Marina Earthquake Memorial, focuses {{on the role of}} Phoenix in the Marina <b>firefighting</b> effort and will incorporate the original 16-foot-high (5 m) tower monitor from Phoenix as a centerpiece of the memorial design.|$|E
5|$|The {{base was}} {{reactivated}} on 15 July 1961, {{but the only}} personnel based there were a fifteen-man <b>firefighting</b> detachment. By 1962, when the base was again deactivated, only 128 of the original 668 buildings remained. The General Services Administration (GSA) wanted to sell the base {{to the town of}} Wendover, leaving only the bombing ranges and radar site with the Air Force. The base was renamed Decker Field, and again declared surplus in 1972. The base continued to be used occasionally for training by Air National Guard units, and the <b>firefighting</b> detachment remained until 1977.|$|E
5|$|A church {{close to}} the {{refinery}} {{was used as a}} point for families seeking information on relatives employed at the facility. So many people turned up that police requested that each family send only one representative. At the close of the day of the explosion, six people were missing, with no confirmed deaths. Overnight, several deep-seated fires were uncovered and <b>firefighting</b> continued the next day.|$|E
5|$|About 57percent of the university's {{students}} are women, and about 43percent are men. Their most popular major fields include {{those related to}} business, psychology, visual and performing arts, social sciences, and protective services such as law enforcement and <b>firefighting.</b> The student–faculty ratio in 2013–14 is 20 to 1. Tuition in 2013–14 is $7,863 per year for Oregon residents and $20,238 for all others.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Juan G. Ayala was {{promoted}} to his current rank on August 8, 2008, and is currently the Commanding General of 2nd Marine Logistics Group at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He aerved as the commanding officer of 2d Marine Aircraft Wing at Cherry Point, North Carolina, Marine Wing Support Squadron 271. During this period the Squadron was recognized as the Marine Corps’ MWSS of the Year for 1998 and received the Marine Corps Aviation Association's Jim Hatch Award. In 1999 the Squadron's Aircraft Rescue and <b>Firefighting</b> Section was recognized by the U.S. Navy & Marine Corps <b>Firefighting</b> Association as {{the best in the}} Marine Corps and Navy and received the Ogden Award. The Squadron participated in operations and exercises in Lithuania, Norway, Nicaragua, Haiti and counter drug missions along the U.S. Southwest Border.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} <b>firefighting</b> {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E
5|$|Following test Baker {{decontamination}} problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of piping and nozzles to cover exterior {{surfaces of the}} ship with a spray of salt water from the <b>firefighting</b> system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, {{in order to}} better understand issues surrounding forest wildfires, Gibbs trained for and received certification in wildland <b>firefighting,</b> becoming certified Type II Wildland Firefighter with Lake Dillon Fire-Rescue. Gibbs' first deployment as a volunteer firefighter was to assist fighting the Santiago Fire during the October 2007 California wildfire epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's Civil Service, {{created by}} the British colonial government, is a {{politically}} neutral body that implements government policies and provides public services. Senior civil servants are appointed based on meritocracy. The territory's police, <b>firefighting</b> and customs forces, as well as clerical officers across various government departments, make up the civil service.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Humanitarian Association of Volunteer Firefighters or Real Associação Humanitária dos Bombeiros Voluntários is a {{volunteer}} fire department which faces diverse <b>firefighting</b> challenges, from family homes, high-rise buildings to wildfires. It {{was established in}} 1877 and granted the royal title in 1904, which it retains. Its headquarters are located in Rua Santos Minho, with the station and engines facing nearby Rua Arquitecto Ventura Terra.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and <b>firefighting</b> personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's <b>firefighting</b> capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, so called {{because it was}} made up of firemen who were exempt from militia and jury duty. The company was led by veteran fireman Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{from the}} Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), {{at that time}} a {{volunteer}} organization, arrived {{under the command of}} Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson. As the fire grew, the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and <b>firefighting</b> crews from Brooklyn, Newark, and Williamsburg. Firemen battling the blaze were aided by water flowing from the Croton Aqueduct, which had been completed in 1842. The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1:00 p.m. that day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Firefighting</b> {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan {{to counter the}} American air raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional <b>firefighting</b> units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} and smoke. Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the <b>firefighting.</b> He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear the ropes and ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship's open bridge, which was designed to hold seven men.|$|E
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} <b>firefighting</b> efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} cut short when one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire. Commander Benitez directed the <b>firefighting,</b> trying both to save the ship and his crew from the toxic gases. The crew members of the Tusk rescued all except one Cochino crew member and convinced Commander Benitez, who was the last man on the Cochino, to board the Tusk. The Cochino sank {{off the coast of}} Norway two minutes after Benitez's departure. Benitez retired as a rear admiral from the Navy in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The second 28cm shell struck {{near the}} {{aircraft}} hangar {{and started a}} major fire. As the fire spread, it detonated explosives carried for the infantry, hindering <b>firefighting</b> efforts. The explosion {{set fire to the}} two Arado seaplanes on board: one on the catapult and the other in one of the hangars. The explosion also probably punched a hole in the armored deck over turbine room 1. Turbine 1 and generator room 3 stopped for lack of steam and only the outboard shafts from turbine room 2/3 were operational.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the <b>firefighting</b> efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka wanted to create a game which {{involved}} saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with <b>firefighting</b> as they thought it was an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Arlington's largest {{employers}} remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including dairy processing, mechanical shops, stores, and factories, became prominent after World War I, {{during a period}} of growth for the city. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced {{all but one of the}} mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted <b>firefighting</b> in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered <b>firefighting</b> efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of men {{volunteered for}} smoke jumping, showing their {{willingness}} to take great personal risks. When fire was detected by a lookout, smoke jumpers were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire. From base camps scattered through the forests of Montana, Idaho and Oregon, the men were flown as many as 200 miles to fire sites, carrying <b>firefighting</b> tools and a two-day supply of K-rations. For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the city}} gained {{autonomy}} from county council control as a unitary authority area, but {{it continues to}} form part of Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes. Policing in the city remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The police authority comprises 17 members, including nine councillors, of which seven are nominated by Cambridgeshire county council and two are nominated by Peterborough city council. <b>Firefighting</b> remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service. The joint fire authority comprises 17 elected councillors, 13 from Cambridgeshire county council and four from Peterborough city council. Nowadays the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade, one of few of its kind, effectively functions as a retained fire station, responding to calls as directed by Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{military}} and civil defenses {{were unable to}} stop the Allied attacks. The number of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was inadequate, {{and most of these}} aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, and a lack of coordination between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to firebombing attacks, the <b>firefighting</b> services lacked training and equipment, and few air raid shelters were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{cities were}} highly {{vulnerable}} to damage from firebombing {{due to their}} design and the weak state of the country's civil defense organization. Urban areas were typically congested, and most buildings were constructed from highly flammable materials such as paper and wood. In addition, industrial and military facilities in urban areas were normally surrounded by densely populated residential buildings. Despite this vulnerability, few cities had full-time professional firefighters and most relied on volunteers. Such <b>firefighting</b> forces that did exist lacked modern equipment and used outdated tactics. Air raid drills had been held in Tokyo and Osaka since 1928, however, and from 1937 local governments were required to provide civilians with manuals that explained {{how to respond to}} air attacks. Few air-raid shelters and other air defense facilities for civilians and industry were constructed prior to the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Most synagogues of Kraków were ruined during World War II by the Nazis who despoiled them of all {{ceremonial}} objects, {{and used}} them as storehouses for ammunition, <b>firefighting</b> equipment, as general storage facilities and stables. The post-Holocaust Jewish population of the city had dwindled to about 5,900 {{before the end of}} the 1940s. Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II. By contrast, Stalin forcibly kept Soviet Jews in the USSR, as agreed to in the Yalta Conference. In recent time, thanks to efforts of the local Jewish and Polish organisations including foreign financial aid from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, many synagogues underwent major restorations and serve religious and tourist purposes.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread {{over most of the}} City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated <b>firefighting</b> efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{were held}} {{six days a}} week at the Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10am to 1pm. They were {{frequently}} interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or <b>firefighting</b> duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral ID cards to show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one oboist was asked for a cat in exchange for a repair, as the starving repairman had already eaten several.|$|E
5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made <b>firefighting</b> difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The 130th was {{headquartered}} at Logistical Support Area Anaconda for {{the majority}} of the deployment. Throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom, the headquarters commanded up to 15,000 engineers at one time, conducting missions including bridging, humanitarian assistance, topographic missions, dive missions, <b>firefighting,</b> base construction, river patrols, mine detection, missile removal and many more. Brigade units redeployed to Hanau in late 2003 and early 2004. Most of the brigade's soldiers returned to Hanau on 5 February 2004 after numerous logistical delays. Most of the 130th Engineer Brigade's subordinate units would receive Meritorious Unit Commendation for their roles in the invasion of Iraq, though the Brigade's headquarters did not.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire {{started at}} the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major <b>firefighting</b> {{technique}} of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday {{into the heart of}} the City.|$|E
