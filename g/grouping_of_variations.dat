40|$|Abstract The chemometric {{data mining}} {{techniques}} using principal factor analysis PFA and hierarchical cluster analysis CA {{was employed to}} evaluate and to examine the borehole characteristics of geological formations of Enugu State of Nigeria to determine the latent structure of the borehole characteristics and to classify 9 borehole parameters from 49 locations into borehole groups of similar characteristics. PFA extracted three factors which accounted for {{a large proportion of}} the variation in the data 77. 305 of the variance. Out of nine parameters examined the first PFA had the highest number of variables loading on a single factor where four borehole parameters borehole depth borehole casing static water level and dynamic water level loaded on it with positive coefficient as the most significant parameters responsible for variation in borehole characteristics in the study. The CA employed in this study to identified three clusters. The first cluster delineated stations that characterise Awgu sandstone geological formation while the second cluster delineated Agbani sandstone geological formation. The third cluster delineated Ajali sandstone formation. The CA grouping of the borehole parameters showed similar trend with PFA hence validating the efficiency of chemometric data mining techniques in <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> in the borehole characteristics in the geological zone of the study area...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze sets of {{variations}} on Paganini's theme by three twentieth-century composers: Ferruccio Busoni, Ignaz Friedman, and Robert Muczynski, in order to examine, identify, and trace different variation techniques and their applications. Chapter 1 presents the purpose and scope of this study. Chapter 2 provides background information on the musical form "theme and variations" and the theme of Paganini's Twenty-fourth Caprice, Op. 1. Chapter 2 also deals with the question of which elements have made this theme so popular. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 examine each of the three sets of variations in detail using the following format: theme, structure of each variation, harmony and key, rhythm and meter, tempo and dynamics, motivic development, <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations,</b> and technical problems. Chapter 6 summarizes the findings from this study and attempts to compare those elements among the three variations. Special attention is given to the application of the motivic cells, which are drawn from the original Paganini theme, in the development of succeeding variations. This study shows how these motivic cells contribute to the construction of new motives and melodies in each variation. Additionally, this study attempts to examine each composer's efforts in expanding variation procedure to the areas of structures and tempo markings in succeeding variations...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the reliability of an isokinetic endurance task. After habituation, 10 physically active males completed three trials of an isokinetic endurance task on nonconsecutive days. The task was performed on a Cybex Norm dynamometer. It consisted of 30 maximal, concentric and eccentric, contractions of the hip extensors at 180 °/s. Reliability was assessed through technical error of measurement (TEM), relative TEM, <b>group</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> and intraclass correlation (ICC). During eccentric actions both average power per repetition (APR) and work done (WD) showed very good reliability. For APR the <b>group</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> was 8. 0 % and the ICC was 0. 93. The TEM and relative were 28. 9 W and 16. 3 %, respectively. For WD these values were 5. 6 %, 0. 94 %, 451 % and 12. 4 % J, respectively. By contrast, fatigue index (FI) demonstrated poor reliability with TEM, <b>group</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> and ICC values of 16. 2 %, 26. 1 % and 0. 32 %, respectively. The reliability from the concentric actions demonstrated more variable results. The <b>group</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> was low for both APR (5. 9 %) and WD (5. 3 %), however, the ICC values were lower than for eccentric actions with a score of 0. 85 for both APR and WD.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a pairing on local intersection cohomology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> pure Hodge structure, {{which we call}} the asymptotic height pairing. Our original application of this pairing was {{to answer a question}} on the Ceresa cycle posed by R. Hain and D. Reed. (This question has since been answered independently by Hain.) Here we apply the pairing to show that a certain analytic line bundle, called the biextension line bundle, defined in terms of normal functions, always extends to any smooth partial compactification of the base. We show that the the pairing on intersection cohomology governs the extension of the natural metric on this line bundle studied by Hain and Reed (as well as, more recently, by several other authors). We also prove a positivity property of the asypmtotic height pairing, which generalize results of a recent preprint of J. Burgos Gill, D. Holmes and R. de Jong, along with a continuity property of the pairing in the normal function case. Moreover, we show that the asymptotic height pairing arises in a natural way from certain Mumford-Grothendieck biextensions associated to normal functions.

The genetic diversity was analysed using {{principal component analysis}} and clusters were defined on the Euclidean distances. The wild populations of both subspecies were clustered together because of their fall dormancy and their prostrate growth habit. Among the cultivated populations, genetic differentiation in two major clusters corresponding to the Mediterranean types and the Nordic types was found. A population from Turkey showed a behaviour intermediate {{between the two groups}} with a vigorous growth in the different seasons and high seed production. The relationship between the Euclidean distance based on the morphological characteristics and the distance on the RAPD markers was analysed on 26 populations with a gen-eralization of the Mantel statistics.

40|$|Abstract. Product Line Architecture (PLA) plays {{a central}} role in {{software}} product line development. In order to support architecture-level variability modeling, most architecture description languages (ADLs) introduce architectural variation elements, such as optional component, connector and interface, which must be customized during product derivation. Variation elements are many, and design and customization of PLA at the level <b>of</b> individual <b>variation</b> elements are difficult and error-prone. We observed that developers usually perceive architecture variability from the perspective of variant features or variant design decisions that are mapped into <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> architecture <b>variation</b> elements. In the paper, we describe heuristics to identify configurations <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> elements that typically form such groups. We call them variation constructs. We developed an architecture variability management method and a tool that allow developers to work at the variation construct level rather than at the level <b>of</b> individual <b>variation</b> elements. We have applied and evaluated the proposed method in the development and maintenance of a medium-size financial product line. Our experience indicates that by raising variability modeling from variation element to construct level, architecture design and customizations become more intuitive. Not only does our method reduce the design and customization effort, but also better ensures consistent configuration <b>of</b> architectural <b>variation</b> elements, avoiding errors...|$|R

He was employed as both an organist and clergyman at the Cathedral after he obtained his first degree. He was subsequently ordained to the diaconate, later becoming vicarius (minor canon). In 1615, he published a collection entitled Sacred Hymnes of 3, 4, 5 and 6 parts for the Voyces and Vyols, which represents most of his known works. His other works include Preces (both for five voices), four settings of the daily canticles, several simple four-part anthems, slightly more complex five-part anthems, and verse anthems. Roughly a dozen of these works were recorded in the 1990s, and many were performed by the choir of Ely Cathedral, including Blessed be the Lord God; Hear, O Lord; Have mercy; I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; My Lord is hence removed and laid; O sing unto the Lord; O ye little flock; the Second Service (Cesar's) and Sing, O heavn's.
