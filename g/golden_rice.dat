25|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} at Syngenta produced <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice</b> 2. They combined the phytoene synthase gene from maize with crt1 from the original <b>golden</b> <b>rice.</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>rice</b> 2 produces 23 times more carotenoids than <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> (up to 37µg/g), and preferentially accumulates beta-carotene (up to 31µg/g of the 37µg/g of carotenoids).|$|E
25|$|In 2005, <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice</b> 2 was announced, which {{produces}} up to 23 times more beta-carotene {{than the original}} <b>golden</b> <b>rice.</b> To receive the USDA's Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), {{it is estimated that}} 144 g of the high-yielding strain would have to be eaten. Bioavailability of the carotene from <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> has been confirmed and found to be an effective source of vitamin A for humans. <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice</b> was one of seven winners of the 2015 Patents for Humanity Awards by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

25|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>rice</b> {{differs from}} its parental strain by the {{addition}} of three beta-carotene biosynthesis genes. The parental strain can naturally produce beta-carotene in its leaves, where it is involved in photosynthesis. However, the plant does not normally produce the pigment in the endosperm, where photosynthesis does not occur. <b>Golden</b> <b>rice</b> has met significant opposition from environmental and anti-globalization activists that claim that there are sustainable, long-lasting and more efficient ways to solve vitamin A deficiency that do not compromise food, nutrition and financial security. A study in the Philippines is aimed to evaluate the performance of <b>golden</b> <b>rice,</b> if it can be planted, grown and harvested like other rice varieties, and whether <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> poses risk to human health. Data has not been released yet.|$|E

40|$|Babesia microti is the causative {{agent of}} human babesiosis. Black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) {{are the only}} proven vector and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) serve as the main {{reservoir}} in northeastern United States. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine if B. microti is present in small mammals in southeastern United States and to compare strains found in this study to reference strains from around the world. Blood samples were obtained from cotton mice, cotton rats, a flying squirrel, <b>golden</b> mice, <b>rice</b> rats, Virginia opossums, wood rats, and raccoons in northeastern Florida. DNA was extracted from the blood, and portions of the B. microti DNA (from 18 S and β-tubulin genes) were amplified via nested PCR assays. Of the eight species tested, only cotton rats and raccoons tested positive for B. microti. Representative samples of the amplified DNA from these two species were sequenced and compared phylogenetically to reference strains of Babesia species. The B. microti found in the cotton rats most closely resembles B. microti sensu stricto, which is pathogenic to humans, and the B. microti found in the raccoons most closely resembles other raccoon strains of B. microti...|$|R

25|$|Critics {{of genetically}} {{engineered}} crops have raised various concerns. An early issue was that <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> originally did not have sufficient vitamin A. This problem was solved {{by the development of}} new strains of rice. The speed at which vitamin A degrades once the rice is harvested, and how much remains after cooking are contested. However, a 2009 study concluded that <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> is effectively converted into vitamin A in humans and a 2012 study that fed 68 children ages 6 to 8 concluded that <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> was as good as vitamin A supplements and better than the natural beta-carotene in spinach.|$|E
25|$|Because many {{children}} in VAD-affected countries rely on rice as a staple food, genetic modification to make rice produce the vitamin A precursor beta-carotene {{was seen as}} a simple and less expensive alternative to ongoing vitamin supplements or an increase in the consumption of green vegetables or animal products. Initial analyses of the potential nutritional benefits of <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> suggested consumption of <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> would not eliminate the problems of vitamin A deficiency, but could complement other supplementation. <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice</b> 2 contains sufficient provitamin A to provide the entire dietary requirement via daily consumption of some 75g per day.|$|E
25|$|The {{search for}} a <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> started off as a Rockefeller Foundation {{initiative}} in 1982.|$|E
40|$|The first {{generation}} of genetically modified crop varieties, currently most widespread in the maize and soybean sectors, sought to increase farmer profitability by improving agronomic traits. The next generation of biotech research is focusing also on breeding for attributes desired by consumers. Although not yet commercially available, a new variety of rice, known as ‘Golden Rice’, has been genetically engineered to contain {{a higher level of}} vitamin A. Thus in contrast with the current commercial applications of biotech crops, this new rice variety aims directly at benefiting consumers rather than producers. More specifically, it aims at improving the health of poor people in developing countries who rely on rice as their main staple food (or would do if it was cheaper) and whose diet is nutrient-deficient. This Paper analyses empirically the potential economic effects of such an innovation in an environment of heated debates about the risks and benefits of these biotech developments. The emergence of genetically modified foods is generating policy reactions that are delaying the development and adoption of what promises to be a high-payoff technology, particularly for the world’s poor. These policy reactions may lead to trade disputes, in which case the way this GMO issue is addressed in the WTO’s dispute settlement body could have profound implications for poor households in developing countries. consumer preferences; gmos; <b>golden</b> rice; <b>rice</b> policy; wto agreements...|$|R
50|$|In the 2008 Bayou Bucket Classic, the Cougars {{will meet}} with Rice at Rice Stadium {{as part of the}} Houston-Rice rivalry. It will be the 33rd meeting between the two teams, where Houston leads the series 24-9 and have won the last three meetings. During this season, the outcome of the game will have {{significant}} influence for the Conference USA West Division title. While Houston remains first in the division, a loss to Rice, and a win for Tulsa (9-2) against Marshall (4-7) would mean Tulsa, not Houston would be headed to compete against the East Division champion East Carolina in the Conference USA Football Championship. If Rice wins its game against the Cougars, and Marshall wins its game against the <b>Golden</b> Hurricane, then <b>Rice</b> would be the West Division champion. The game was picked up by CBS College Sports after Houston's 70-30 blowout victory against Tulsa.|$|R
40|$|Paddy {{is one of}} main farming {{commodity}} since rice is one of main food in Indonesia. Innovation adoption about paddy farming was meaningful, {{because there}} were land conversion from food farming to industrial land or plantation. This study aimed {{to know about the}} adoption of farming technical was used by farmers, then aimed to know the efficiency of farming. This study took place in Empat Balai Village Kuok Sub-district Kampar Municipality. The results of this study showed there were differences about faming technical between faming technical with SRI and conventional faming technical that was used for a long time. The differences between SRI paddy farming and conventional farming were the amount of seeds per planted hole and the use of fertilizers. The amount of seeds on SRI method was only 1 seed per planted hole, meanwhile the use of fertilizers was more prioritize on using the organic materials i. e. <b>golden</b> snail, <b>rice</b> water, and brown sugar. On the other hand, there was an increasing of paddy production from SRI method which reached the production of 3. 014, 51 kg per ha.

25|$|A study {{published}} in June 2016 evaluated {{the status of the}} implementation of <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice,</b> which was first developed in the 1990s to produce higher levels of Vitamin A than its non-GMO counterparts. This strain of rice was designed so that malnourished women and children in third world countries who were more susceptible to deficiencies could easily improve their Vitamin A intake levels and prevent blindness, which is a common result. <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice</b> production was centralized to the Philippines, yet there have been many hurdles to jump in order to get production moving. The study showed that the project is far behind schedule and is not living up to its expectations. Although research on <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice</b> still continues, the country has moved forward with other non-GMO initiatives to address the Vitamin A deficiency problem which is so prevasive in that region.|$|E
25|$|The International Rice Research Institute is {{currently}} further developing and evaluating <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice</b> {{as a potential}} new way to help address vitamin A deficiency.|$|E

25|$|On August 8, 2013 an {{experimental}} plot of <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> being developed at IRRI in the Philippines was uprooted by protesters. British author Mark Lynas reported in Slate that the vandalism {{was carried out}} by a group of activists led by the extreme left-inclined Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) (unofficial translation: Farmers' Movement of the Philippines), to the dismay of other protesters. No local farmers participated in the uprooting; only the small number of activists damaged the <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> crops because the farmers believe local customs which imply that killing a living rice plant is unlucky.|$|E
25|$|The cutoff between {{humanitarian}} and commercial use {{was set at}} US$10,000. Therefore, {{as long as a}} farmer or subsequent user of <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> genetics does not make more than $10,000 per year, no royalties need to be paid. In addition, farmers are permitted to keep and replant seed.|$|E
25|$|The genetically {{engineered}} <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> {{was developed by}} the University of Freiburg (Peter Beyer) and the ETH Zurich (Ingo Potrykus) from 1992 to 2000. It was considered a breakthrough in biotechnology at the time of publication and now can help to provide vitamin A to people lacking access to it in their diets.|$|E
25|$|Peter Bramley {{discovered}} in the 1990s that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial CrtI) {{can be used to}} produce lycopene from phytoene in GM tomato, rather than having to introduce multiple carotene desaturases that are normally used by higher plants. Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in <b>Golden</b> <b>Rice.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} {{details of}} the rice were first published in Science in 2000, {{the product of an}} eight-year project by Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg. At the time of publication, <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> was considered a significant breakthrough in biotechnology, as the researchers had engineered an entire biosynthetic pathway.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries, there are efforts to produce genetically modified rice rich in β-carotene. The idea is that this would help poor people, {{who can not afford}} a varied diet containing sufficient natural sources of vitamin A, meet their dietary needs. The <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> project is one such effort, and is already undergoing trials.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} {{that led to}} <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> was conducted {{with the goal of}} helping children who suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD). In 2005, 190 million children and 19 million pregnant women, in 122 countries, were estimated to be affected by VAD. VAD is responsible for 1–2 million deaths, 500,000 cases of irreversible blindness and millions of cases of xerophthalmia annually. Children and pregnant women are at highest risk. Vitamin A is supplemented orally and by injection in areas where the diet is deficient in vitamin A.|$|E
25|$|Since carotenes are hydrophobic, {{sufficient}} fat must {{be present}} in the diet for <b>golden</b> <b>rice</b> (or most other vitamin A supplements) to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is usually coupled to an unbalanced diet (see also Vandana Shiva's arguments below). Moreover, this claim referred to an early cultivar of golden rice; one bowl of the latest version provides 60% of RDA for healthy children. The RDA levels advocated in developed countries are far in excess of the amounts needed to prevent blindness.|$|E
