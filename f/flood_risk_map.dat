In it, production of flood risk maps is forseen as {{an important part of}} a flood risk reducing system, since this represents a very valuable document in the process of sustainable spatial planning. In the process of <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>map</b> production, irreplaceable role is played by one- and twodimensional hydraulic models. Collection and procession of reliable input data for hydraulic models (e. g. flood discharge, topographic data, hydraulic bed resistance) can be a very expensive and long procedure, of which complexity and price increases with desired accuracy level. Optimization of number and accuracy of input parameters is therefore a very grateful and economic task, which is usually performed by a method, called sensitivity analysis. The following thesis is a case study. It presents a sensitivity analysis of a hydraulic model on the change of a bed resistance. Hydraulic model was built by using Mike Flood software.

40|$|We are {{expected}} to experience {{a change in the}} earth’s future climate. Among the expected effects of climate change, the increase in precipitation raises the most concern in Norway. An increase in precipitation can result in floods, and lead to agricultural land at risk of being damaged. This study has highlighted to what degree the agricultural land in Norwegian municipalities are exposed to floods. This is done by using zonal statistics to calculate how much of the agricultural land in each municipality that is situated in flood risk areas. Each municipality is rated and then ranked in an index with the relative degree of flood exposure. The index is based on a national <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>map.</b> It is the municipalities with the largest share of the agricultural land, situated in the flood risk areas, who gets the highest degree of exposure. The results show that the most exposed municipalities are situated around the country, and the municipalities who are most exposed are typically situated around the biggest rivers. Since the index is based on a national <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>map,</b> the information can be used to put attention on and lead to further discussion about where the most exposed agricultural land might be in the future.

40|$|In Canada, flood {{analysis}} and water resource management, in general, are tasks {{conducted at the}} provincial level; therefore, unified national-scale approaches to water-related problems are uncommon. In this study, a national-scale flood risk assessment approach is proposed and developed. The study focuses on using global and national datasets available with various resolutions to create flood risk maps. First, a flood hazard map of Canada is developed using topography-based parameters derived from digital elevation models, namely, elevation above nearest drainage (EAND) and distance from nearest drainage (DFND). This flood hazard mapping method is tested on a smaller area around the city of Calgary, Alberta, against a flood inundation map produced by the city using hydraulic modelling. Second, a flood exposure map of Canada is developed using a land-use map and the satellite-based nightlight luminosity data as two exposure parameters. Third, an economic <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>map</b> is produced, and subsequently overlaid with population density information to produce a socioeconomic <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>map</b> for Canada. All three maps of hazard, exposure, and risk are classified into five classes, ranging from very low to severe. A simple way to include flood protection measures in hazard estimation is also demonstrated using {{the example of the}} city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. This could be done for the entire country if information on flood protection across Canada were available. The evaluation of the flood hazard map shows that the topography-based method adopted in this study is both practical and reliable for large-scale analysis. Sensitivity analysis regarding the resolution of the digital elevation model is needed to identify the resolution that is fine enough for reliable hazard mapping, but coarse enough for computational tractability. The nightlight data are found to be useful for exposure and risk mapping in Canada; however, uncertainty analysis should be conducted to investigate the effect of the overglow phenomenon on flood risk mapping...|$|E

Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) is used to carry out the flood risk assessment and Sentinel- 1 A SAR images are used to map flood extend and to ascertain whether the resulting map from the MCA process is a close representation of the flood prone areas in the study area.   The results show that the multi-criteria analysis approach could effectively combine several criteria including elevation, slope, rainfall, drainage, land cover and soil geology to produce a <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>map.</b> The resulting map indicates that over 50 percent of the study area is likely to experience a high level of flood.  For SAR-based flood extent mapping, the results show that SAR data acquired immediately after the flooding event could better map flooding extent than the SAR data acquired 9 days after.   This highlights the importance of near real-time acquisition of SAR data for mapping flooding extent and damages.   All parts under the study area experience some level of flooding. The urban land cover experiences very high, and high levels of flooding and the MCA process produces a risk map that is a close depiction of flooding in the study area.  Real time flood disaster monitoring, early warning and rapid damage appraisal have greatly improved due to ameliorations in the remote sensing technology and the Geographic Information Systems...|$|E

Flood damage depends on the hydraulic factors which include characteristics of the flood such as the depth of flooding, rate of the rise in water level, propagation of a flood wave, duration and frequency of flooding, sediment load, and timing. In this study flood depth and "flood-affected frequency" within one flood event were considered {{for the evaluation of}} flood hazard assessment, where the depth and frequency of the flooding were assumed to be the major determinant in estimating the total damage function.
