2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{hours after the}} earthquake, {{structures}} across Aceh {{were reported to have}} been severely damaged. The dome of the Samalanga Mosque, Pidie's central mosque, <b>had</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Massive power outages occurred throughout Pidie and Pidie Jaya as telephone poles and electrical poles tumbled. Several houses collapsed during the quake. Roads were also damaged. Preliminary data suggest that 14 structures <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> during the quake, including a minimarket in Pidie. Photos of destroyed houses and buildings were circulated on social media. Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management later [...] "many structures" [...] were damaged, of which 25 suffered heavy damage. Detailed information revealed that 72 stores <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> 15 houses <b>had</b> been destroyed, 1 mall <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> 5 mosques appeared destroyed and an Islamic school also <b>had</b> <b>collapsed.</b> It was reported that dozens of Islamic students were trapped under an Islamic School in Bireun Regency. Later reports revealed that 249 structures had been damaged in the quake, including 14 mosques and a hospital. The Indonesian National Disaster Management Board later confirmed that 686 structures were either destroyed or damaged.|$|R
5|$|The Uranian moons {{are listed}} here by orbital period, from {{shortest}} to longest. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> into a spheroid are highlighted in light blue and bolded. Irregular moons with retrograde orbits {{are shown in}} dark grey. Margaret, the only known irregular moon of Uranus with a prograde orbit, is shown in light grey.|$|E
5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, rather than as a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> {{had it not been for}} their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E

5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Offa had significant influence {{in the early years}} of his reign outside the traditional Mercian heartland. The overlordship of the southern English which had been exerted by Æthelbald appears to <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> during the civil strife over the succession, and it is not until 764, when evidence emerges of Offa's influence in Kent, that Mercian power can be seen expanding again.|$|E
5|$|The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Aurangabad Circle {{maintains}} {{and manages}} the Elephanta Caves. It {{is responsible for}} monitoring and stabilisation of the rock face, construction of supports to the cave structures where pillars <b>have</b> <b>collapsed,</b> and consolidation of cave floors and construction of a parapet wall surrounding the site. In addition, it maintains the visitor facilities and an on-site museum. The site receives approximately 1,000 visitors a day, more on Shiva ratri, dance festivals, the World Heritage Day (18 April) and World Heritage Week between 19 and 25 November for special events.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Jupiter {{are listed}} below by orbital period. Moons massive enough for their {{surfaces}} to <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> into a spheroid are highlighted in bold. These are the four Galilean moons, which are comparable {{in size to}} the Moon. The four inner moons are much smaller, the fourth most massive being more than 7000 times more massive than the fifth-most. The irregular captured moons are shaded light gray when prograde and dark gray when retrograde.|$|E

5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to <b>have</b> <b>collapsed.</b> He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle-Atlantic states, {{it caused}} little injury overall, though many boats and ships were capsized. To {{the north in}} New England, many churches endured {{significant}} damage, and shipwrecks led to 15deaths, with one other death owing to a building collapse. Due to intense gusts, hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed. Agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock industries also suffered substantial impairment, with considerable injury experienced by barns, crops, watercraft, timber, and livestock. Farther north, entire swaths of forest were leveled, and heavy snow blocked roads, paths, and turnpikes. Fruit orchards and sugar groves endured {{the worst of the}} storm, reducing the season's harvests. Private properties generally suffered damage to roofs, windows, and chimneys; several buildings throughout the region were reported to <b>have</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Overall, approximately $100,000 in damage and more than 16deaths were recorded.|$|E

5|$|Krovanh first {{struck the}} Philippines, {{resulting}} in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1,000families. The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person. Krovanh's effects {{were much more}} severe in China. In Hong Kong, eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred {{as a result of}} the typhoon's outer rainbands. However, Guangdong Province, Hainan Province, and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted. The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi. In those three regions combined, 13,000homes were estimated to <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> and a large swath of farmland was damaged. Two people were killed in China and economic losses approximated at ¥2.1 billion (US$253 million). Due to its positioning and track, of all areas in Vietnam only the country's more northern regions were impacted by Krovanh. Flash flooding occurred in those regions, and 1,000homes were flattened. One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam. Overall, the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons.|$|E
