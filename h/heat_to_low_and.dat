40|$|Wrinkling {{patterns}} in shape memory polymer (SMP) sputter deposited {{with a thin}} layer (10 s nm in thickness) of gold atop are systematically investigated under various conditions. Depending on the surface condition, heating temperature and pre-straining, different patterns of micro/nano-scaled wrinkles are produced. Although elastic buckling of the gold layer is the mechanism behind all types of wrinkles, the shape memory effect (SME) and thermal expansion mismatch (TEM) are the driving force for different patterns after <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> different temperatures, i. e. the evolution of wrinkle pattern {{is due to the}} SME after <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> <b>low</b> temperatures <b>and</b> the TEM after <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> high temperatures. The flexibility and convenience in using SMP to achieve different wrinkling patterns is demonstrated...|$|R

The chromosphere can accordingly be identified with the atmosphere within such magnetic elements as flux tubes. Attention is presently given to bright points associated with the intranetwork magnetic fields, which are heated by large-amplitude compressive waves whose periods approximate the 3 -min acoustic cutoff period.

40|$|The {{effects of}} heat and pH {{stresses}} on Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 10390 (coagulase positive) and strain ATCC 6020 (coagulase negative) were studied.

Both strains, however, were injured by heat and by pH 4. 5 and 9 as estimated by the decrease in their tolerance to the selective agents (sodium chloride and sodium azide) present in the selective medium. The heat or pH injured cells, however, regained their tolerance to the selective agents if they were pregrown in a non-selective medium before they were plated on the selective medium...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPoor heating {{performance}} and operating safety in low ambient temperature of Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) for Electric Vehicles (EVs) limits {{the development of}} EVs in cold region, because of no engines wash <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> use <b>and</b> <b>low</b> efficiency of electric heating. ASHP with refrigerant injection is a potential method to reduce the battery power consumption by increasing the heating capacity and operating safety of ASHP system. In this paper, a test bench which can be switched between with refrigerant injection ASHP system and traditional ASHP system for EVs aiming at cold region is developed. In order to analyze the influence of refrigerant injection porthole shapes to system performance, two scroll compressors with different injection portholes are refitted from comment electric compressor. The experiment {{results show that the}} heating capacity of refrigerant injection system is raised up to 27 % than that of the traditional system. The bigger area of injection portholes can and make help <b>to</b> increase the <b>heating</b> capacity when in-car inlet air temperature is higher. The research will also promote the industrialization and practicability of refrigerant injection system and EVs...|$|R

Friesen Conference, "Growing Old in a Changing Climate: Exploring the Interface Between Population Aging and Global Warming," MAY 25 - 26, 2011, Vancouver, BC. Dr. Tim Takaro "Special challenges for public health with climate change and aging populations: Waterborne illness" - Climate change is causing public health to {{pay special attention to}} the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations. Seniors are at increased risk for health effects from climate change for several reasons such as reduced physiologic capacity <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> income. They may also be at increased risk of waterborne infectious disease due to the diminished immune function in aging populations. This presentation will explore several potential public health responses to these vulnerabilities for seniors.   We also gratefully acknowledge a grant from the SFU Library 2 ̆ 7 s Scholarly Digitization Fund for videography and post-production editing.   See webpage {{for more information on the}} 20 th Annual John K.

40|$|Bacterial biofilms {{have great}} {{significance}} for public health, since biofilm-associated microorganisms exhibit dramatically decreased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and treatments. To date most attention {{has focused on}} biofilms that arise from the colonization of solid-liquid or solid-air interfaces. It is of interest that colonization of the interface between air and liquid, which can be selectively advantageous for aerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria, has been rarely studied, although it may present {{a major problem in}} industrial aquatic systems. In this work we investigated the role of a biofilm at the interface between air and liquid (pellicle) in the susceptibility of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to stress conditions. For a control we used a mutant that had lost its ability to synthesize cellulose and thin aggregative fimbriae and thus did not produce the pellicle. Resistance of bacteria from the pellicle <b>to</b> <b>heat,</b> acidification, and chlorination was compared to resistance of planktonic cells from the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth. Pellicle cells were significantly more resistant to chlorination, and thus the surrounding matrix conferred protection against the reactive sodium hypochlorite. However, the stress management of pellicle cells in response <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> pH was not enhanced compared to that of stationary-phase cells. A long-period of incubation resulted in endogenous hydrolysis of the pellicle matrix. This phenomenon provides a potential new approach to combat microbial cells in biofilms...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} of 1986 – 1997 the first 4 {{publications}} on the mechanical and metabolic properties of heat acclimated rat's heart were published. The outcome of these studies implied that heat acclimation, sedentary as well as combined with exercise training, confers long lasting protection against ischemic/reperfusion insult. These results promoted a clinical study on patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass operations aiming to elucidate whether exploitation of environmental stress can be translated into human benefits by improving physiological recovery. During the 1998 study, immediate-post operative chamber stiffness was assessed in patients acclimatized <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> intensity training in the desert (spring in the Dead Sea, 17 – 33 °C) vs. patients in colder weather (spring in non-desert areas, 6 – 19 °C) via echocardiogram acquisition simultaneous with left atrial pressure measurement during fast intravascular fluid bolus administration. We showed that patients undergoing “heat acclimatization combined with exercise training” were less susceptible to ischemic injury, therefore expressing less diastolic dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass compared to non-acclimatized patients. This was the first clinical translational study on cardiac patients, while exploiting environmental harsh conditions for human benefits. The original experimental data are described and discussed {{in view of the}} past as well as the present knowledge of the protective mechanisms induced by Heat Acclimation Mediated Cross-tolerance...|$|R
