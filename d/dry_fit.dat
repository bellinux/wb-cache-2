40|$|This article {{examines}} lake drying and livelihood dynamics {{in the context}} of multiple stressors through a case study of the “Small Lake Chad” in the Republic of Chad. Livelihoods research in regions experiencing persistent lake water fluctuations has largely focused on the well-being and security of lakeshore dwellers. Little is known about the mechanisms through which lake drying shapes livelihood drawbacks and opportunities, and whether locally evolved responses are enhancing livelihoods. Here we address these gaps using empirical, mixed-methods field research couched within the framework of livelihoods and human well-being contexts. The analysis demonstrates that limited opportunities outside agriculture, the influx of mixed ethnic migrants and the increasing spate of violence all enhance livelihood challenges. Livelihood opportunities centre on the renewal effects of seasonal flood pulses on lake waters and the learning opportunities triggered by past droughts. Although drying has spurred new adaptive behaviours predicated on seasonality, traditional predictive factors and the availability of assets, responses have remained largely reactive. The article points to where lake <b>drying</b> <b>fits</b> amongst changes in the wider socio-economic landscape in which people live, and suggests that awareness of the particularities of the mechanisms that connect lake drying to livelihoods can offer insights into the ways local people might be assisted by governments and development actors...|$|R

40|$|An {{indirectly}} heated solar <b>drier</b> <b>fitted</b> with a {{flat plate}} collector and a directly heated solar drier were compared with open air sun drying of cocoa beans under field conditions in St. Lucia. Sun drying was conducted on two surfaces, perforated steel and non perforated wood. The methods were examined for the ability to adequately dry fermented beans and effect on quality. Loading rates of 13. 5, 26. 9 and 40. 4 kg/m$ sp 2 $ were examined. Temperature increases of 15 $ sp circ$C and 20 $ sp circ$C above ambient were achieved in the indirect and direct drier, respectively. The solar driers were more efficient than sun drying units at removing moisture throughout at loading rates of 26. 9 and 40. 4 kg/m$ sp 2 $ {{but only in the}} initial stages at 13. 5 kg. External mould development was therefore reduced. Open air sun drying on the wooden surface proved more effective in the final stages at 13. 5 kg/m$ sp 2 $.

Glycerol concentration did not influence any of the parameters analyzed.

30|$|Certainly, {{the size}} of the fire must also matter. For example, Hessburg et al. (2007) showed that patch size {{distributions}} of low, mixed, and high severity fires in <b>dry</b> forests <b>fit</b> a negative exponential distribution. In their study, patch sizes ranged from 10 − 1 ha to 104 ha, with median patch sizes ranging from 50 ha to about 100 ha. Landscape mosaics patterned in this way likely presented fine to broad-scale patterns of patches, which functioned as “fences” and “corridors” to dispersal of processes, including seed dispersal. Interestingly, the seed dispersal gradients of many native species fall within similar ranges (Cain et al. 2000, Ness et al. 2004). It is likely that the pattern of fire mosaics influenced subsequent tree, shrub, and herb composition indirectly by limiting seed dispersal via burned patch size, and directly by filtering the seed rain.|$|R

The drying conditions were infrared power range 400 - 800 W, hot air temperatures range 50 - 70 Â°C and hot air velocity range 0. 5 - 1. 5 ms - 1.
