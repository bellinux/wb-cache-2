5|$|While both gun turrets were rotated by steam power, the new forward {{guns were}} loaded by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power,</b> unlike the {{original}} guns which were hand worked. Thunderer {{was the first}} ship to have hydraulic loading gear. From 1874, the forward turret alone was converted to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> operation for training (turret traverse), elevation and ramming. This allowed the turret crew to be reduced from 48 to 28; the aft turret remaining hand-worked as a comparison. Power operation was considered successful, although it was later implicated in the 1879 explosion.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Longwall mining is {{the only}} {{technically}} proven and established method worldwide for coal extraction at greater depth. In this paper, 2 D plane strain finite element models of longwall panels are developed and analyzed to understand the interaction of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> support with surrounding rock strata. Based on Indian geomining conditions, finite element models are developed including the structural components of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> support (like <b>hydraulic</b> legs, canopy, gob shield, pin joints, base and lemniscate link), the surrounding rock mass and broken rocks (gob). The study is focused to evaluate the strata behaviour for different capacity of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> supports those are installed in Indian longwall faces. Results obtained from finite element models are analyzed in terms of stress distribution in hydruaulic legs, abutment stresses and roof-to-floor convergence. Statistical relations between these output variables and geomining parameters are developed based on the data generated from finite element models and they {{are found to be}} correlated with the field measurements. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the fault of the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> and make her battle-worthy.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} <b>hydraulic</b> (<b>Power</b> assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5000|$|Crimping Tools: Used {{to apply}} {{terminals}} or splices. These may be hand or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered.</b> Some hand tools have ratchets to insure proper pressure. Hydraulic units achieve cold welding, even for aluminum cable.|$|R
50|$|The massive gun is far {{too heavy}} to be laid by hand, and the fort {{therefore}} contained a steam <b>powered</b> <b>hydraulic</b> system that traversed, elevated and depressed the gun, operated a pair of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> loading and washing systems, and powered the shell lifts that moved the 2,000-pound shells and 450-pound black-powder charges from the magazines into the loading chambers.|$|R
50|$|In 1757 Wilkinson {{patented}} a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> blowing {{engine for}} blast furnaces. The historian Joseph Needham likened Wilkinson's design {{to the one}} described in 1313 by the Chinese Imperial Government metallurgist Wang Zhen in his Treatise on Agriculture.|$|R
5|$|The first {{power-assisted}} steering on {{any type of}} vehicle dates to 1876, but little is recorded of the system. Other {{attempts were made to}} add {{power-assisted steering}} to motorized vehicles such as in the 1903 Columbia 5-ton truck and other heavy vehicles, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a practical <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> system was invented by Francis W. Davis. It was used on some armored vehicles and heavy trucks during World War II, but it took more than decades before the system was commercialized in passenger automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|Rotary fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E
5000|$|Naval {{artillery}} {{began as}} breech-loading cannon and these too required ramming. Large breech loading guns {{continued into the}} 1880s, using wooden staffs worked by several sailors as ramrods. Manual ramming was replaced with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> ramming with trials on [...] from 1874.|$|R
5000|$|CS Sovereign {{has four}} cable tanks. Two main tanks have {{capacity}} of [...] or 2,668 tonnes each. Two wing tanks have capacity of [...] or 432 tonnes each.

5000|$|Nash and Thompson was a British {{engineering}} firm established by Archibald Frazer-Nash and Henry Ronald Godfrey. (See also HRG). They were based in Oakcroft Road and specialised {{in the production}} of hydraulically-operated gun turrets for aircraft. The company was also an important manufacturer of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> radar scanners ...|$|R
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E
50|$|A front-loader or loader is {{a tractor}} with an {{engineering}} tool {{which consists of}} two <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> arms {{on either side of}} the front engine compartment and a tilting implement. This is usually a wide-open box called a bucket, but other common attachments are a pallet fork and a bale grappler.|$|R
5000|$|Vickers Mk [...] "G": Was a fully {{wire-wound}} type with inner A, A, B tubes, {{jacket and}} breech ring. A pneumatically operated Welin breech block was used {{and they were}} in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> mounts. The Vickers gun was similar to the Armstrong gun, but weighed 63.5 metric tons (62.5 metric tons).|$|R
50|$|Drum rotator is used {{to invert}} and rotate drums as well as {{transfer}} contents from one container to another. This type of drum handler features ring gear and rotator that can either be electric <b>powered</b> or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered.</b> Examples of drum rotators are tumblers, drum rollers, portable rollers and stationary drum rollers.|$|R
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Power</b> Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E

25|$|Independent <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> {{networks}} were also installed at Hull's docks - both the Albert Dock (1869), and Alexandra Dock (1885) installed hydraulic generating stations and accumulators.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> {{network is}} a system of {{interconnected}} pipes carrying pressurized liquid used to transmit mechanical power from a power source, like a pump, to hydraulic equipment like lifts or motors. The system is analogous to an electrical grid transmitting power from a generating station to end-users. Only a few <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> transmission networks are still in use; modern hydraulic equipment has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a hydraulic network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or water turbine driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|E
