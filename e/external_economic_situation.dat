The empirical analysis with aggregated data indicates that in the eight central and east European EU member states FDI and trade are complementary. This result is confirmed by an FDI enhanced gravity model which makes use of sectoral data provided by the Bundesbank's micro database direct investment (MIDI). The net effect of FDI on the trade balance is ambiguous, but FDI in high-tech industries clearly stimulates exports more than imports. Technological spill-over and the conglomeration of human capital seem to be important factors for the export performance. Against this background the prospects for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic look more favourable compared to the Baltic states.

The paper {{analyzes the}} changes and impact of the deteriorating <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> <b>situation</b> on (a) company-employee relational trust, and on the (b) perceived importance of “trust and long-term relationships with the company {{in the eyes of}} the customer” by respondent managers. Furthermore, our analysis also looks at the impact of management-to-employee communication on both trust perspectives. The results show a stable level of company-employee relational trust in the face of the current economic crisis, despite a high level of perceived organizational process changes and a sharp decline in financial performance. On the other hand, the perceived importance of “trust and long-term relationships with the company {{in the eyes of the}} customer” has increased substantially as the crisis has deepened, supporting our claim that relationships and the external relationship orientation gain importance in the time of crisis. There is also a strong link between the degree of open and frequent management-to-employee communication, and both perspectives of measured trust among top Slovenian employers...|$|E

Therefore it {{should be considered as}} a set of interacting logical layers, based on social, psychological, economical and technological aspects. Inside each layer which may be interpret as subsystems of entrepreneurship, there are defined internal relations and possible interactions similarly to information systems structure. Layers interacting each other are offering a set of ranges of optimum engagement of resources and elasticity on the external boundaries and regulations. Based on the above, entrepreneurship may be considered as a layered system interacting with the surroundings in optimum way. It is easy to see that the presented concept may be related either to single person or organization. Also it is strongly oriented onto Resource Based View (RBV) of the organization description. One of the main problems of entrepreneurship is quantitative aspect. How to measure changes of entrepreneurship? What should be assumed as an objective function? Which semantic models are adequate for computer aid of the entrepreneur? How to evaluate axiologically entrepreneurship? These questions are not resolved yet. The layered concept of entrepreneurship allows on quasi-quantitative approach. Interlayer interactions allow on computer aided approximations and introduce feed-back information to the system.

The growth slowdown {{in the last two years}} was broad based, affecting in particular the industry sector. Inflation too declined during this period, but continued to be above the comfort zone, owing primarily to the elevated level of food inflation. Yet, the developments on the macro stabilization front, particularly the dramatic improvement in the <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> <b>situation</b> with the current account def icit (CAD) declining to manageable levels after two years of worryingly high levels was the redeeming feature of 2013 - 14.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the world oil price {{increases}} of the early 1970 s and those that occured in the 1980 s, and the corresponding growth in revenue for the Nigerian economy had two major effects. First, it affected the official exchange rates and its determination, hence fiscal developments for the country. At the same time, the windfall also led to an unbalanced sectoral change within the economy. Both the internal and <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> <b>situation</b> since the oil shock had shown persistent imbalances requiring adjustments. In analysing the oil shock effect, a comprehensive assessment of the influences of exchange rates and structural adjustment problems employs the valuable strengths of the monetary approach aspects of exchange rates determination; particularly {{on the question of}} external payments adjustment and of inflation of domestic price levels. The function of exchange rate as an instrument of stabilization policy in an economy such as Nigeria is imperative. A relatively stable exchange rate standard in a world of significant variability is important in evaluating the impact of exchange rate changes on the economy; precisely because the financial infrastructures are at the developing state. When tight controls on the foreign trade sector also lead to the establishment of an unofficial market in foreign exchange, the question of stability would depend on which of the two markets adjust quicker. The market with the more rapid rate of adjustment can therefore provide a guide to exchange rate policy performance. In analysing the stuctural adjustments {{impact of the}} oil revenues, features of both national and global economic environment that are significant for macroeconomic performance, which are also proximately related to exchange rates determination are considered by using the dutch-disease framework. By laying emphasis on the fuction of exchange rates mechanism and the impact of the oil revenue increases at macroeconomic level, the large and persistent misalignment of real exchange rates and the general economic policies of the oil boom era are thus analysed in-depth...|$|E

The application of econometric and statistical methods to real estate valuation aims at the elimination of subjectivity on the appraisal process. But the unanswered question underneath this subject is the following: How important is the subjective component on real estate appraisal value formation? On this study Structural Equation Models (SEM) are used to determine the importance of the objective and subjective components on real estate valuation value formation as well as the weight of economic factors and the current economic context on real estate appraisal for mortgage purposes price formation. There were used two latent variables, Objective Component and Subjective Component, witch aggregate objective observed variables and subjective observed and unobserved variables, respectively. Factorial Exploratory Analysis is the statistical technique used in order to link the observed variables extracted from the valuation appraisal reports to the latent constructs derived from the theoretical model. SEM models were used to refine the model, eliminate non‐significant variables and to determine the weight of Objective and Subjective latent variables. These techniques were applied to a sample of over 11. 000 real estate assets appraisal reports throughout the time period between November of 2006 and April of 2012. The real assets used on this study are located on Lisbon’s Metropolitan Area – “Grande Lisboa” –, Portugal.

Recently, CNDCEC issued an auditing statement (n. 001) dealing with the compliance judgement over the Review relating to the primary data of the Annual Report. In our view, in fact, this very important source of information has to be controlled (not really audited) by another oversight board, i. e. the Collegio Sindacale and this due to many reasons involving the particular characteristics of the information that the Board of Directors intends to communicate through the issuance of its Review.
