40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{biodegradable}} packaging films based on a unripe green banana (Musa paradisiaca L.) with different plasticizers; glycerol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sorbitol at various concentrations (10 - 50 %). Banana films were produced by using casting method and physical properties of these films were determined. Banana <b>films</b> <b>with</b> 10 % of PEG showed the lowest water solubility (P≤ 0. 05) followed by <b>films</b> <b>with</b> glycerol and sorbitol.

40|$|Biodegradable edible {{films are}} both {{economically}} and environmentally {{important to the}} food industry as packaging and coating materials, as the industry seeks to find a replacement to traditional petroleum-derived synthetic polymers. The overall goal of this thesis was to design a canola protein isolate (CPI) -based biodegradable and edible film that provides excellent mechanical, optical and water vapor barrier properties. A {{better understanding of the}} potential of CPI for use as a film-forming ingredient could lead to enhanced utilization and value of the protein for food and non-food applications. In study one, the mechanical, optical and water vapor barrier properties of CPI-based films were investigated as a function of protein (5. 0 % and 7. 5 % w/w) and glycerol (30 %, 35 %, 40 %, 45 %, and 50 % w/w of CPI) concentrations. Overall, as the glycerol concentration increased for the 5. 0 % and 7. 5 % CPI-based films, mechanical strength and flexibility decreased and increased, respectively. Film strength was also found to increase at the higher protein concentration; however corresponding changes to film flexibility differed depending on the testing method used. For instance, puncture deformation testing indicated that film flexibility was reduced as the CPI concentration was raised, whereas tensile elongation testing indicated no change in extensibility between the two CPI concentrations. Film transparency was found to increase with increasing levels of glycerol and decreasing levels of CPI, whereas water vapor permeability was found to increase with increasing levels of both glycerol and protein. In study two, mechanical, optical and vapor barrier properties of CPI-based films were evaluated as a function of plasticizer-type (50 % (w/w of CPI), glycerol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG- 400)) and fixative condition (0 % and 1 % (w/w of CPI), genipin). CPI <b>films</b> prepared <b>with</b> sorbitol were significantly stronger than <b>films</b> <b>with</b> PEG- 400, followed by <b>films</b> <b>with</b> glycerol, whereas the flexibility of CPI-based <b>films</b> <b>with</b> glycerol was higher than <b>films</b> <b>with</b> PEG- 400, followed by <b>films</b> <b>with</b> sorbitol. In all cases, <b>films</b> prepared <b>with</b> genipin were stronger and less malleable than un-cross linked <b>films.</b> CPI <b>films</b> <b>with</b> glycerol were more transparent than <b>films</b> <b>with</b> sorbitol, followed by <b>films</b> <b>with</b> PEG- 400, and the addition of genipin significantly increased the opacity of CPI films. CPI <b>films</b> prepared <b>with</b> glycerol also showed poorer water vapor barrier property than <b>films</b> <b>with</b> PEG- 400, followed by <b>films</b> <b>with</b> sorbitol, however, no differences were observed in the presence and absence of genipin. In summary, as the plasticizer concentration increased or protein concentration decreased, CPI films became weaker, more flexible and clearer; however their water vapor barrier properties became poorer as both plasticizer and protein concentration increased. Moreover, CPI <b>films</b> <b>with</b> sorbitol and genipin were found to be stronger, less malleable and permeable to moisture than CPI <b>films</b> <b>with</b> or without genipin, and in the presence of glycerol or PEG- 400. Overall, CPI could be considered as a potential material for the development of biodegradable edible packaging in the future...|$|R
