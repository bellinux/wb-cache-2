25|$|Less than 30 pence {{in every}} pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes {{directly}} to projects {{designed to reduce}} emissions. The figures reported by the BBC and based on UN data reported that typically 28p goes to the set up and maintenance costs of an <b>environmental</b> <b>project.</b> 34p goes to the company that takes on {{the risk that the}} project may fail. The project's investors take 19p, with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits. In that respect carbon Offsets are similar to most consumer products, with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers, the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets, who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 2010, Norfolk Southern Railway Company {{agreed to}} pay $4 million penalty to resolve alleged {{violations}} of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and hazardous materials laws for a 2005 chlorine spill in Graniteville, S.C. Under the settlement filed {{in federal court in}} Columbia, S.C., Norfolk Southern will be required to pay a civil penalty of $3,967,500 for the alleged CWA violations, to be deposited in the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The alleged CWA violations, included in an amended complaint filed in March 2009, are for the discharge of tons of chlorine, a hazardous substance, from a derailed train tank car and thousands of gallons of diesel fuel from ruptured locomotive engine fuel tanks. For the alleged Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) violation for failure to immediately notify the National Response Center of the chlorine release, Norfolk Southern will pay a penalty of $32,500, to be deposited in the Hazardous Substance Superfund. Under the terms of the agreement, Norfolk Southern will provide incident command system training to environmental and transportation personnel; stock nearby Langley Pond with at least 3,000 fish to replace fish killed by the chlorine spill; and post the telephone number for the National Response Center to facilitate spill reporting. Further, the settlement includes a supplemental <b>environmental</b> <b>project</b> (SEP) valued at $100,000 to plant vegetation along the banks of Horse Creek to decrease erosion and sedimentation, thereby improving water quality in Horse Creek.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than ten}} years later, El Niño storms in April 1998 caused Williams Creek to change course due to debris blockage. [...] Williams Creek had been the major {{tributary}} of the Salt River near the treatment plant, so diversion lowered the volume of water available and caused the dilution ratios at the plant to exceed permitted levels. [...] Record stormwater flows also damaged the plant and the city applied for assistance under the FEMA-1203-DR-CA El Niño storm Presidential disaster declaration. [...] On 15 May 2003, the Regional Water Board (RWB) placed a Cease and Desist order on Ferndale due to discharges of treated wastewater which exceeded 1 percent {{of the flow of}} Francis Creek / Salt River stream system.

2500|$|Brower had {{incorporated}} Earth Island Institute in 1982.

[...] Projects were required to bring in their own funding, and often went their own way once well-established.

2500|$|Bispham {{was also}} the home of British {{independent}} sports car manufacturer, TVR, {{one of the main}} employers in Bispham, before production ceased in 2007 under owner Nikolai Smolenski. In May 2007 it was announced that Midlands based businessman, William Riley was proposing to bring back car production to Bispham, with two cars planned for production at a new purpose built factory, which would be on Bispham Technology Park, the MG XPower SV and another Premium MG XPower roadster and coupe.
