5|$|Jurassic Park's lead {{computer}} programmer, Dennis Nedry, {{having been}} bribed by Hammond's corporate rival Lewis Dodgson, deactivates the park's security system {{to gain access}} to the embryo storage room where he steals the valuable fetilized embryos. Nedry stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol shaving cream, supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry, the power <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the Tyrannosaurus injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Atwater: But Reagan did {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|On {{the way to}} {{the heart}} of the Island, Jack's group {{encounters}} the Man in Black's group. Jack tells the Man in Black that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel {{to the heart of the}} Island. Jack believes that Desmond can kill the Man in Black because he thinks Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing the Man in Black do not matter because he is going down to the heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and the Man in Black lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which the Man in Black predicted. A result of Desmond's act is an unforeseen side-effect of making the Man in Black mortal again. During a prolonged fight, the Man in Black stabs Jack in the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots the Man in Black in the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie De Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails. The two profess their love for each other and Kate leaves with Sawyer while Hurley and Ben follow Jack back to the pool.|$|E

He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> sat down {{on the stage}} — it was Valentine’s Day and he had a honey out in the crowd. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> played ‘Katie Mae’ to her.

500|$|Around {{the release}} of the film, Disney {{executive}} David Hoberman was quoted, [...] "I hope Nightmare <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us." [...] The film earned $50 million in the United States on its first theatrical run.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{preferred}} {{to be described}} as a clown rather than a comic: [...] "A comedian <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> hits people right on. [...] A clown uses pathos. [...] He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like." [...] "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, [...] "because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh." [...] His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.|$|E

He saw little value in the humanities and social sciences, and slashed funding for Isis, a journal dedicated to the history of science and technology and its cultural influence.

500|$|He {{joined the}} AAA Columbus Clippers for their playoffs. Kipnis batted [...]455 in five games, and hit for the cycle on September 17 in the Clippers’ victory that {{clinched}} the International League title. His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and what is he doing here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and they put him in the fifth spot ... What's that about?

500|$|He led the NHL {{in assists}} three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and {{finished}} in the top ten on 12 occasions. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E

500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerBalls" [...] portrays young {{children}} as almost entirely uninterested in reading. The South Park boys only exhibit excitement for their reading assignment {{based on the}} promise of offensive and controversial material in the book. Rather than finding any merit in the book, the boys are angry when they find the material inoffensive, prompting Cartman to declare he has been [...] "tricked" [...] into reading an entire book. Through {{the rise and fall of}} Butters' career as an author, the episode also demonstrates the perils of literary success and hoaxes. The episode also lampoons the notion that a book can be identified as the sole reason for a reader to kill somebody, particularly through Butters' reaction to The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Butters experiences blackouts after reading The Catcher in the Rye and chanting [...] "Kill John Lennon/Ronald Reagan!", until he disappointedly learns they are already dead. Later, a reader of Butters' book The Poop That Took a Pee <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> murders the Kardashians.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} of [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] was co-directed by Usher and music video {{director}} Chris Robinson, who also directed the video for the album's fourth single, [...] "My Boo". [...] "Confessions (Interlude)" [...] {{serves as the}} opening of the video. Set in a studio, Usher receives a phone message and finds out that he impregnated his mistress. After he speaks the spoken section of the interlude and gets in a car, [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] proceeds. Usher is set in a dark lit room, with only one chair. He occasionally shows a large ring on his ring finger. In the middle of the video, he lies on a piano and in his imagination, his woman and mistress are beside him. The next scene shows Usher in a brown car singing, <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> kneels before his woman to confess. She refuses to listen and slaps Usher, then leaves and he becomes shirtless. Alone, Usher stands in front of a wide mirror, which breaks into pieces accompanied by a roaring sound, ending the same way [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] started, with him sitting on a chair.|$|E
500|$|BuzzFeed {{compiled}} a list citing [...] "15 Times Jasmine From 'Aladdin' Was The Most Feminist Disney Princess". The same website included Jasmine rejecting traditional standards of marriage second on its list of [...] "27 Feminist Disney Moments That Unapologetically Smashed The Patriarchy". Ranking Jasmine second on a list analyzing [...] "Which Disney Princess Most Embodies Feminist Principles", author Shannon Larson of The Huffington Post appreciated the character for rejecting the idea of marriage being necessary, asserting her right to marry whomever and owning her sexuality, but criticized {{the fact that she}} does not complete her attempt to escape royal oppression. Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Jasmine fifth in her article [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Saraiya praised her personality, likening her boldness, curiosity, and skepticism of marriage to that of Belle while commending her for [...] "falling for a completely inadequate 'street rat' and whisking him out of poverty, instead of the other way around." [...] However, Saraiya labeled Jasmine's use of sexuality her [...] "only power", criticizing her for sending a negative message to young girls. When questioned about whether or not Jasmine is a positive role model because [...] "all she wants to do is get married", Larkin defended her character, explaining, [...] "That's not true. Jasmine says to a generation of little kids about marriage that the law is wrong. She risks everything—her safety, her comfort, everything she knows—and <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> finds a way to change the marriage law... Yeah, she's a good role model!' Really good! Whether it's connected or not, that person that the writers created that I got to portray, I'm so proud of her. And I feel like she was ahead of her time." [...] Meanwhile, Jasmine's inability to recognize Aladdin despite his disguise has been met with controversy, comparing this characteristic to the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman, and questioning the princess' intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|According to Walter Gratzer, {{the study}} of {{nutrition}} probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of qi developed, a spirit or [...] "wind" [...] similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma. Food was classified into [...] "hot" [...] (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and [...] "cold" [...] (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia. Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi. Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets.

With six children and five miscarriages, her primary vocation was motherhood, which prompted her to say: [...] "I'm not judgmental about women who work, but I was so besotted with my children I never wanted them out of my sight." [...] She was also considered a mother figure by her nieces, Ladies Cosima and Sophia Vane-Tempest-Stewart, and Diana, Princess of Wales. As the wife and ex-wife of two unfaithful men, she explained her marriage philosophy to the Times in 1987: [...] "I can never understand the wives who really mind, the wives who set such store by fidelity.
