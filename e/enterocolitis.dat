5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing <b>enterocolitis,</b> and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E

25|$|The {{small and}} large {{intestines}} may be affected by infectious, autoimmune, and physiological states. Inflammation of the intestines is called <b>enterocolitis,</b> which may lead to diarrhoea.|$|E
25|$|Clostridial <b>enterocolitis</b> due to {{infection}} by Clostridium perfringens is most commonly seen in foals under 3 months of age. Clostridial toxins damage the intestine, leading to dehydration and toxemia. Foals usually present with signs of colic, decreased nursing, abdominal distention, and diarrhea which may contain blood. Diagnosis {{is made with}} fecal culture, and while some foals do not require serious intervention, others need IV fluids, antibiotics, and aggressive treatment, and may still die. Other bacterial infections {{that may lead to}} <b>enterocolitis</b> include Salmonella, Klebsiella, Rhodococcus equi, and Bacteriodes fragilis.|$|E
25|$|Several {{clinical}} studies {{provide evidence for}} the potential of probiotics to {{lower the risk of}} necrotizing <b>enterocolitis</b> and mortality in premature infants. One meta-analysis indicated that probiotics reduce these risks by more than 50% compared with controls.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{conditions}} {{affecting the}} bowels include infectious diarrhoea and mesenteric ischaemia. Causes of constipation may include faecal impaction and bowel obstruction, which may in turn {{be caused by}} ileus, intussusception, volvulus. Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition of unknown aetiology, classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, that can affect the intestines {{and other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract. Other causes of illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction, and necrotizing <b>enterocolitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this is necrotizing <b>enterocolitis</b> (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects the bowels of {{premature}} infants. The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of sepsis, and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC. There is hope that a similar technique {{could be used as a}} quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of infant}} formula {{has been cited}} for {{numerous}} increased health risks. Studies have found infants in developed countries who consume formula {{are at increased risk}} for acute otitis media, gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), eczema and necrotizing <b>enterocolitis</b> when compared to infants who are breastfed. Some studies have found an association between infant formula and lower cognitive development, including iron supplementation in baby formula being linked to lowered I.Q. and other neurodevelopmental delays; however other studies have found no correlation.|$|E
25|$|Also called Hirschsprung's disease, it is a {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} the colon in which nerve cells of the myenteric plexus in its walls, also known as ganglion cells, are absent. It is a rare disorder (1:5 000), with prevalence among males being four times that of females. Hirschsprung’s disease develops in the fetus {{during the early stages}} of pregnancy. A genetic predisposition to Hirschsprung's disease has been linked to chromosome 13 where a missense mutation at an ultraconserved region impairs functionality of the W276C receptor. Seven other genes seem to be implicated, however. If untreated, the patient can develop <b>enterocolitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early {{breastfeeding}} {{is associated}} with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Reviews from 2007 found numerous benefits. Breastfeeding aids general health, growth and development in the infant. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing <b>enterocolitis.</b> Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, develop diabetes, or childhood leukemia later in life. and may enhance cognitive development.|$|E
2500|$|Autistic <b>enterocolitis</b> is {{the name}} of a nonexistent medical {{condition}} proposed by discredited British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield when he suggested a link between a number of common clinical symptoms and signs which he contended were distinctive to autism. The existence of such an <b>enterocolitis</b> has been dismissed by experts as having [...] "not been established". Wakefield's now-retracted and fraudulent report used inadequate controls and suppressed negative findings, and multiple attempts to replicate his results have been unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|On February 12, 2009, three Special Masters of the United States Court of Federal Claims {{rendered}} three {{opinions in}} three [...] "test cases" [...] that were proceeding in that court, {{each of which}} addressed causation issues relating to MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). [...] The opinions were critical of Arthur Krigsman and his testimony about autistic <b>enterocolitis,</b> which the court said that he described as a [...] "new form of gastrointestinal [...] disorder." [...] Typical of their criticism was the following passage found at page 199 of the opinion in the Snyder case: [...] "Doctor Krigsman was qualified to testify about gastroenterology [...] qualifications to establish the validity of {{a new form of}} gastrointestinal disorder, unrecognized by other authorities in the field, were ... sadly lacking." [...] The court noted that the [...] "medical textbooks" [...] do not recognize autistic <b>enterocolitis.</b> At page 27, the same opinion stated that [...] "Dr. Krigsman’s testimony about autistic <b>enterocolitis</b> as a diagnostic entity was speculative." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics {{recommended}} feeding preterm infants human milk, finding [...] "significant short- {{and long-term}} beneficial effects," [...] including {{lower rates of}} necrotizing <b>enterocolitis</b> (NEC).|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{immune system}} suppression, neutropenic <b>enterocolitis</b> (typhlitis) is a [...] "life-threatening {{gastrointestinal}} complication of chemotherapy." [...] Typhlitis is an intestinal infection which may manifest itself through symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a distended abdomen, fever, chills, or abdominal pain and tenderness.|$|E
2500|$|Thrombocytopenia {{that starts}} {{after the first}} 72 hours since birth is often the result of {{underlying}} sepsis or necrotizing <b>enterocolitis</b> (NEC). In the case of infection, PCR tests may be useful for rapid pathogen identification and detection of antibiotic resistance genes. [...] Possible pathogens include viruses (e.g. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, HIV), bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica), fungi (e.g. Candida sp.), and Toxoplasma gondii. The severity of thrombocytopenia may be correlated with pathogen type; some research indicates that the most severe cases are related to fungal or gram-negative bacterial infection. The pathogen may be transmitted during or before birth, by breast feeding, or during transfusion. Interleukin-11 is being investigated as a drug for managing thrombocytopenia, especially in cases of sepsis or necrotizing <b>enterocolitis</b> (NEC).|$|E
2500|$|Wakefield and {{his colleagues}} said they {{described}} features of regressive autism with bowel disorders, or what Wakefield would later call autistic <b>enterocolitis,</b> although these findings have been questioned, with claims that the association of features is substantially an artifact of preselection of vaccinated children with both developmental disorders and bowel symptoms for a UK lawsuit: ...|$|E
2500|$|Wakefield has {{hypothesized}} that autistic <b>enterocolitis</b> is an emergent IBD phenotype that follows {{from exposure to}} the vaccinations given to children during a period when their immune systems are rapidly developing. [...] Other research, however, rejects this hypothesis, and other groups have not reproduced Wakefield's findings. Researchers have identified {{a high incidence of}} bowel symptoms in autistic children before the MMR vaccine was licensed. It was also revealed that, prior to the publication of Wakefield's studies alleging a connection between the MMR vaccine and autistic <b>enterocolitis,</b> he had received over £400,000 from lawyers attempting to sue vaccine manufacturers. This conflict of interest, which Wakefield denies, has led many to criticize Wakefield and his results. The British General Medical Council has launched an inquiry into possible dishonesty by Wakefield regarding his research. In 2011, an article was published in the British Medical Journal which referred to Wakefield's 1998 paper as an [...] "elaborate fraud." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Family lore told privately of the firstborn son, Manny, born in 1886 but {{surviving}} {{for only}} three months, and carried off by tuberculosis. Even {{some members of}} the Marx family wondered if he was pure myth. But Manfred can be verified. A death certificate of the Borough of Manhattan reveals that he died, aged seven months, on 17 July 1886, of <b>enterocolitis,</b> with 'asthenia' contributing, i.e., probably a victim of influenza. He is buried at New York's Washington Cemetery, beside his grandmother, Fanny Sophie Schönberg (née Salomons), who died on 10 April 1901." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 February 1998, a paper {{written by}} Wakefield and twelve other authors about twelve {{children}} with autism was published in The Lancet. [...] In it, the authors claimed to have identified a new syndrome they called autistic <b>enterocolitis,</b> raising {{the possibility of a}} link between a novel form of bowel disease, autism, and the MMR vaccine. The authors noted that the parents of eight of the twelve children linked what were described as [...] "behavioural symptoms" [...] with MMR, and reported that the onset of these symptoms began within two weeks of MMR vaccination. In the published Lancet summary, known as the [...] "interpretation", the authors wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a BMJ {{follow-up}} {{article on}} 11 January 2011, Deer said that based upon documents he obtained under Freedom of information legislation, Wakefield—in {{partnership with the}} father {{of one of the}} boys in the study—had planned to launch a venture on the back of an MMR vaccination scare that would profit from new medical tests and [...] "litigation driven testing". The Washington Post reported that Deer said that Wakefield predicted he [...] "could make more than $43 million a year from diagnostic kits" [...] for the new condition, autistic <b>enterocolitis.</b> According to Deer's report in BMJ, the ventures, Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Ltd and Carmel Healthcare Ltd—named after Wakefield's wife—failed after Wakefield's superiors at University College London's medical school gave him a two-page letter that said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, Albert Sabin {{reported}} that an experiment, employing {{the technique of}} [...] "forcefully expelling the total amount [...] {{in the direction of}} the olfactory mucosa, immediately drawing it back into the pipette, and repeating the process 2 to 3 times", was unable to confirm the results of Jungeblut, but found that [...] "monkeys on a scorbutic diet died of spontaneous acute infections, chiefly pneumonia and <b>enterocolitis,</b> while their mates receiving an adequate diet remained well." [...] Following this, Jungeblut found that [...] "with an infection of maximum severity, induced by flooding the nasal portal of entry with large amounts of virus, vitamin C administration fails to exert any demonstrable influence on the course of the disease, but with a less forceful method of droplet instillation, the picture of the disease in control animals becomes so variable that the results cannot be easily interpreted; but the available data suggest that vitamin C treatment may be a factor in converting abortive attacks into an altogether non-paralytic infection."
