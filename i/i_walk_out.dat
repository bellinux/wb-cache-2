She enjoys shopping, traveling, and giving gifts and helps support {{her mother and her}} mother's husband in Florida. Regarding her short financial disclosure reports prior to her Supreme Court nomination, she has said, [...] "When you don't have money, it's easy. There isn't anything there to report."

Upon joining the Supreme Court, she took up residence in Washington but sorely missed the faster-paced life of New York.

60|$|Some do {{not walk}} at all; others {{walk in the}} highways; a few walk across lots. Roads are made for horses and men of business. I do not travel in them much, comparatively, because I am not {{in a hurry to}} get to any tavern or grocery or livery-stable or depot to which they lead. I am a good horse to travel, but not from choice a roadster. The landscape-painter uses the figures of men to mark a road. He would not make that use of my figure. <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> into a Nature such as the old prophets and poets, Menu, Moses, Homer, Chaucer, walked in.

Rabbits come to me with all sorts of {{troubles}}, when my own troubles are the only ones I care about. When <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> I can't hop and run; I must strut on my rear legs and wear an ermine robe! And the soldiers salute me and the band plays and the other rabbits laugh and clap their paws and cry out: 'Hail to the King!' Now let me ask you, as a friend and a young lady of good judgment: isn't all this pomp and foolishness enough to make a decent rabbit miserable?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Laddie lie near me," [...] must lie by me {{for some}} time. I {{do not know}} the air; and until I am {{complete}} master of a tune in my own singing (such as it is), I never can compose for it. My way is: I consider the poetic sentiment correspondent to my idea of the musical expression, then choose my theme, begin one stanza; when that is composed, which is generally {{the most difficult part of}} the business, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out,</b> sit down now and then, look out for objects in nature around me that are in unison or harmony with the cogitations of my fancy, and workings of my bosom; humming every now and then the air, with the verses I have framed. When I feel my muse beginning to jade, I retire to the solitary fireside of my study, and there commit my effusions to paper; swinging at intervals on the hind legs of my elbow chair, by way of calling forth my own critical strictures, as my pen goes on. Seriously, this, at home, is almost invariably my way. What cursed egotism! ...|$|E
6000|$|BEADLE.--But I submit, an {{obstacle}} to conversions is the intrusion and impertinence of that Swiss fellow with the baldric--the officer who answers to the beadle of the British Islands, and is pacing about the church {{with an eye on}} the congregation. Now the boast of Catholics is that their churches are open to all; but in certain places and churches there are exceptions. At Rome I have been into St. Peter's at all hours: the doors are always open, the lamps are always burning, the faithful are for ever kneeling at one shrine or the other. But at Antwerp not so. In the afternoon {{you can go to the}} church, and be civilly treated; but you must pay a franc at the side gate. In the forenoon the doors are open, to be sure, and there is no one to levy an entrance fee. I was standing ever so still, looking through the great gates of the choir at the twinkling lights, and listening to the distant chants of the priests performing the service, when a sweet chorus from the organ-loft broke out behind me overhead, and I turned round. My friend the drum-major ecclesiastic was down upon me in a moment. [...] "Do not turn your back to the altar during divine service," [...] says he, in very intelligible English. I take the rebuke, and turn a soft right-about face, and listen awhile as the service continues. See it I cannot, nor the altar and its ministrants. We are separated from these by a great screen and closed gates of iron, through which the lamps glitter and the chant comes by gusts only. Seeing a score of children trotting down a side aisle, I think I may follow them. I am tired of looking at that hideous old pulpit with its grotesque monsters and decorations. I slip off to the side aisle; but my friend the drum-major is instantly after me--almost I thought he was going to lay hands on me. [...] "You mustn't go there," [...] says he; [...] "you mustn't disturb the service." [...] I was moving as quietly as might be, and ten paces off there were twenty children kicking and clattering at their ease. I point them out to the Swiss. [...] "They come to pray," [...] says he. [...] "YOU don't come to pray, you--" [...] "When I come to pay," [...] says I, [...] "I am welcome," [...] and with this withering sarcasm, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of church in a huff. I don't envy the feelings of that beadle after receiving point blank such a stroke of wit.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2012, Novak {{was honored}} at the TCM Classic Film Festival where she {{introduced}} {{a screening of}} Vertigo. She joined in conversation with Robert Osborne for a Q&A session in which she discussed her career and personal life. The hour-long interview aired on TCM as Kim Novak: Live from the TCM Classic Film Festival on March 6, 2013. Novak broke down in tears while discussing Liebestraum. As she nearly sobbed {{in front of the}} audience, Novak said, [...] "I couldn't do a movie after that. I've never done a movie after that. I just couldn't do a movie after that." [...] The interview was an eye-opener for many fans who had wondered why Novak made so few films. Acknowledging that she never reached her potential as an actress, Novak revealed to the audience that she was bipolar and explained, [...] "I was not diagnosed until much later. I go through more of the depression than the mania part." [...] "I don't think I was ever cut out to have a Hollywood life," [...] Novak also commented. [...] "Did I do the right thing, leaving? Did <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> when I shouldn't have? That's when I get sad." [...] On the possibility of acting again, Novak said in another interview, with the fashion website LifeGoesStrong, [...] "Who knows what the future holds? It would take an awful lot to lure me out there, but I would never say never." [...] Also during the TCM Festival, Novak was honored in a handprint and footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. That same year, Novak received the San Francisco Cinematic Icon Award from the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society.|$|E

That went against my grain. It wasn't playing fair [...] [...] [...] This plot is not blindingly original; its elements are familiar from many other crime stories. But it does become intriguing because the writing is good and the characters are original [...] [...] [...] What I was not prepared for was the twist at the end, which doesn't seem to follow from anything that went before, and makes all of my speculation irrelevant. Am I holding the ending against the entire movie? Yes, I suppose I am. The Rich Man's Wife is not a great movie, but it's competent and effective enough, and I might have been tempted to give it a recommendation if I hadn't felt so cheated at the end. Somehow a movie like this establishes a contract with us, an unspoken agreement that some things cannot be doubted even though others are up for grabs. When a few of the sure things turn out to be tricks, that's part of the fun. But when everything is smoke and mirrors, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> wondering, where is Keyser Söze when we really need him?" ...|$|E

5000|$|While Dow Chemicals {{maintained}} that TCDD and 2, 3, 5-T caused no harm to humans, the EPA argued that these herbicides posted {{a threat to}} mankind. During experimentations, 2, 3, 5-T only contributed to $14 million of Dow Chemical’s profits and in 1979, this number would increase to $9 billion. This {{is one of the}} first examples of a company sponsored human testing in prison experiments. This approach was heavily criticized as being “inhumane” and the media often likened the experiments to Nazi genocide. These trials further placed the Holmesburg prison under racial allegations for primarily testing on black and non-white inmates. The EPA and the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) initially looked into investigating these trials, however the investigation was soon dropped due to the cost and resources associated. Many of the inmates who reached out to the EPA for legal advice were pointed away under the claim that once they had signed their consent waivers they were unable to charge the Holmesburg prison. The New York times quickly jumped onto this story and ran an article stating: “Somewhere almost certainly in the United States, are as many as 70 men who could help researchers determine the risks of human exposure to the poison called dioxin.” [...] What was perhaps most shocking in the article was the seemingly callous attitude and lack of guilt on the part of the researchers. In the article, Dr. Kligman went so far as to say: “All those people could have leukemia now—about one chance in 20 billion. And I could be hit by an asteroid when <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> on the street, but I don’t think I will.“ [...] Several patients disagreed with their treatment as “human guinea pigs” and took their grievances to court given the lack of government support. Several lawsuits were filed in the early 1980s against Dr. Klingman, the Holmesburg Prison, and Dow Chemicals. Most of these lawsuits such as that filed by Jones and Smith were “settled out-of-court … with settlements with the doctor, the university, the city, and Dow Chemical Company.” ...|$|E
