25|$|Another common reason {{nowadays}} for Global serializability relaxation is {{the requirement}} of availability of internet products and services. This requirement is typically answered by large scale data replication. The straightforward solution for synchronizing replicas' updates of a same database object is including all these updates in a single atomic <b>distributed</b> <b>transaction.</b> However, with many replicas such a transaction is very large, and may span several computers and networks {{that some of them}} are likely to be unavailable. Thus such a transaction is likely to end with abort and miss its purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{existing}} database systems, {{including all}} major commercial database systems, are strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL) based and already CO compliant. Thus they {{can participate in}} a CO based solution for global serializability in multidatabase environments without any modification (except for the popular multiversioning, where additional CO aspects should be considered). Achieving global serializability across SS2PL based databases using atomic commitment (primarily using two phase commit, 2PC) has been employed for many years (i.e., using the same CO solution for a specific special case; however, no reference is known prior to CO, that notices this special case's automatic global deadlock resolution by the atomic commitment protocol's augmented-conflict-graph global cycle elimination process). Virtually all existing <b>distributed</b> <b>transaction</b> processing environments and supporting products rely on SS2PL and provide 2PC. As {{a matter of fact}} SS2PL together with 2PC have become a de facto standard. This solution is a homogeneous concurrency control one, suboptimal (when both Serializability and Strictness are needed; see Strict commitment ordering; SCO) but still quite effective in most cases, sometimes at the cost of increased computing power needed relatively to the optimum. (However, for better performance relaxed serializability is used whenever applications allow). It allows inter-operation among SS2PL-compliant different database system types, i.e., allows heterogeneity in aspects other than concurrency control. SS2PL is a very constraining schedule property, and [...] "takes over" [...] when combined with any other property. For example, when combined with any optimistic property, the result is not optimistic anymore, but rather characteristically SS2PL. On the other hand, CO does not change data-access scheduling patterns at all, and any combined property's characteristics remain unchanged. Since also CO uses atomic commitment (e.g., 2PC) for achieving global serializability, as SS2PL does, any CO compliant database system or transactional object can transparently join existing SS2PL based environments, use 2PC, and maintain global serializability without any environment change. This makes CO a straightforward, natural generalization of SS2PL for any conflict serializability based database system, for all practical purposes.|$|E

40|$|The common {{wisdom is}} that <b>distributed</b> <b>transactions</b> do not scale. But what if <b>distributed</b> <b>transactions</b> could be made {{scalable}} using {{the next generation of}} networks and a redesign of distributed databases? There would be no need for developers anymore to worry about co-partitioning schemes to achieve decent performance. Application development would become easier as data placement would no longer determine how scalable an application is. Hardware provisioning would be simplified as the system administrator can expect a linear scale-out when adding more machines rather than some complex sub-linear function, which is highly application specific. In this paper, we present the design of our novel scalable database system NAM-DB and show that <b>distributed</b> <b>transactions</b> with the very common Snapshot Isolation guarantee can indeed scale using the next generation of RDMA-enabled network technology without any inherent bottlenecks.

40|$|For {{datacenter}} {{applications that}} require tight synchronization, transactions are commonly employed for achieving concurrency while preserving correctness. Unfortunately, <b>distributed</b> <b>transactions</b> {{are hard to}} scale due to the decentralized lock acquisition and coordination protocols they employ. In this paper, we show {{that it is possible}} to achieve scalability for <b>distributed</b> <b>transactions</b> by using a lock broker architecture, and present the design and development of such a framework, called PANOPTICON. Panopticon achieves scalability by divorcing locks from the data items and striving to improve lock access locality. A lock can be hosted at the lock broker or at a different server than the server that hosts the corresponding data item. The lock broker mediates the access to data shared across servers by migrating the associated locks like tokens, and in the process gets to learn about the access patterns of transactions. We show that the broker can drastically improve the lock access locality and, hence, the performance of <b>distributed</b> <b>transactions</b> by employing simple rules. Our experiments show that Panopticon performed significantly better than <b>distributed</b> <b>transactions</b> as the the number of data items and number of servers involved in transactions increase. Moreover, as the history locality (the probability of using the same objects in consecutive transactions) increase, Panopticon’s lock migration strategies improved lock-access locality and resulted in significantly better performance. ...|$|R
