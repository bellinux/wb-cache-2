[...] The third child of Scottish {{business}} manager John Gibson and English born wife Ellen née Lawson, he was schooled at Melbourne Grammar and the University of Melbourne. He briefly studied art at the National Gallery of Victoria drawing school, but concluded that art was not his vocation. He said of that time that [...] "with little resistance <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be guided into commercial fields".|$|E
500|$|... "Can't B Good" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by D. DoRohn Gough and Ne-Yo. It was recorded between 2007 and 2008 at SouthSide Studios, in Atlanta, Georgia. Although Jackson didn't write the song, Jackson described [...] "Can't B Good" [...] as a song reflecting her seven-year relationship with songwriter/producer Jermaine Dupri, saying, [...] "I'd been hurt before, and I {{was trying to}} protect myself. I'm glad <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> accept it. He's very attentive and affectionate, a beautiful soul".|$|E
2500|$|Van Gogh {{argued with}} Bernard and, especially, Paul Gauguin {{as to whether}} one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred, or paint what Gauguin called [...] "abstractions": {{paintings}} conceived in the imagination, or de tête. In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks {{in the fall and}} winter of 1888: [...] "When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know[...] [...] [...] But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall[...] [...] [...] And yet, once again <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big—another failure—and I have had my fill of that." [...] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.|$|E

5000|$|When Moen was convicted, {{his defense}} lawyer, Olav Hestenes announced: [...] "For {{the first time}} at this desk, <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> say that a travesty of justice has been committed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma, {{how can you}} go back in that way? We {{have agreed}} that that should be {{regarded}} as done and gone. He has been very unhappy, and now we see what remedy he proposes to himself for his misery. Do I flatter <b>myself</b> if <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> look at it in that way?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Quicksilver {{is searching}} for his sister in Wundagore when Magneto and the Young Avengers go to find the Scarlet Witch. After trying to abduct his nephew Wiccan so he can assist him in finding his sister, he is stopped by {{his father and his}} other nephew, Speed. After Wiccan {{suggests}} that maybe Magneto actually did want to make up for his past, he became angry and said, [...] "Nephew the last time <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> believe that..... My father tried to kill me". Quicksilver prepares to fight his father but when debris from his rampage strikes his sister it is found that the Scarlet Witch there is actually a Doombot in disguise. The journey takes Quicksilver and his comrades all the way to Latveria so they rescue the Scarlet Witch. After the Scarlet Witch turns herself in to the X-Men and the Avengers a fight breaks out between the two groups. After being knocked out along with all the other Avengers and X-Men by his sister, he is finally reunited with his sister.|$|E
2500|$|Halep {{began the}} year as the Romanian No. 2, ranked No. 47 in the world, 20 places behind Sorana Cîrstea. Her first three tournaments, ASB Classic, Hobart International and Australian Open, ended in defeats. Her first major tournament {{breakthrough}} came at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in May, gaining three of the biggest victories of her career. Halep defeated two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, and two-time tournament champion and former world No. 1 Jelena Janković (but saved 2 match points) to reach the semifinals, where she was defeated soundly by eventual champion Serena Williams in straight sets. She later said that [...] "What changed was that <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be relaxed on the court by taking the pressure off. I told myself to enjoy it and play with pleasure." [...] At the French Open, Halep suffered her second successive first-round exit at a Grand Slam, falling to Carla Suárez Navarro, despite taking the first set comfortably. She rebounded well, however, going on to win her first two WTA titles back-to-back, first at the Nürnberger Versicherungscup in June, where she defeated Andrea Petkovic in the final, {{and then at the}} Topshelf Open, where she defeated world No. 11 Roberta Vinci with the loss of just one game in the second round, before defeating Kirsten Flipkens in the final. She became the first Romanian tennis player to win back-to-back tournaments on different surfaces. She claimed her first Grand Slam match win of the year at Wimbledon, defeating Olga Govortsova of Belarus, before falling to Li Na in three sets. After Wimbledon, in July, Halep entered the top-30 rankings for the first time.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, that's all right,' I said. I {{tried to}} make my voice indifferent, for I was on guard against {{insidious}} friendliness. I had bludgeoned my mind into an attitude of safe hostility towards her, and I saw the old chaos ahead if <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> abandon it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monday, December 1st.--The {{last month}} of the {{worn-out}} old year 1851!

60|$|Still no sound. My {{heart beat}} {{so fast that}} I could almost hear it. The night was very dark.

2500|$|People with losses {{or other}} trauma, such as sexual abuse in {{childhood}} and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment and {{tend to agree with}} the following statements: [...] "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others.

I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> become too close to others." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward {{appeared}} on Headline Prime, hosted by Glenn Beck. When {{asked if he}} would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, [...] "It's funny. I was on Larry King Live once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke then, and I'll say the same thing here: Why would <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?" ...|$|R

60|$|He {{bowed and}} turned away, {{whispering}} {{as he passed}} to a footman, who at once approached me. <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be shown out.

60|$|Even before <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{acknowledge}} the perfidy {{of the woman}} with whom I had been so intimately associated, I began to understand her, when, early in the morning, a groom from the hotel brought me a note, asking me to drive over at once, as they were to leave that day at noon for the East.|$|E
6000|$|... "This evening Gertrude Lindsay and Jane Carpenter met {{me at the}} top of the stairs, {{and said}} they wanted to slide down the {{banisters}} and would do it if I went first.

40|$|I did {{not become}} a farmer or railroader like generations of my family before me–but I {{continue}} to rely {{on my hands and}} physical labor.

6000|$|... 'Of course, Papa,' said Anne; 'I {{know that}} my failure in {{self-control}} has done mischief, though I cannot tell how much. I laughed at the Hazlebys continually, in spite of Mamma's warning, and encouraged Lizzie to talk of them when I had better not have done so; and <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be led away by eagerness to hear that foolish lecture.

60|$|For just {{an instant}} <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be {{tortured}} by {{the hope that}} a miracle had happened, and here was Cesare Borgia come a good eight hours before {{it was possible for}} Mariani to have fetched him from Faenza. The same doubt may have crossed Ramiro's mind, for he changed colour and sprang to the door to bawl an order forbidding his men to lower the bridge.|$|E
60|$|They {{were all}} of opinion (and justly of opinion so far) that the new {{connection}} would be an excellent one for me. They all reproached me for taking a purely capricious dislike to a well-born and well-bred young man, and for permitting it to influence me, {{at the outset of}} my career, against my own interests. Pressed by these considerations, <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be persuaded to give the new pupil a fair trial. He accompanied me, the next day, on my way back to the rectory.|$|E
5000|$|Shinique Smith {{combines}} {{fine art}} media with everyday materials, such as found objects and clothing. She began to include used clothing {{in her work}} after reading a New York Times Magazine article about secondhand garments shipped to Africa from thrift stores. [...] She describes her process as a personal one: [...] "It all begins with emotion, an expression and <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> go on a journey {{in the making of}} each work, a journey of associations between object and color, between lyrics and fabric, between the viewer and me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Look here, Cranly, he said. You {{have asked}} me what I would do and what I would not do. I {{will tell you what}} I will do and what I will not do.

6000|$|... "How, indeed?" [...] I {{asked in}} my turn. [...] "From your mother {{you have heard}} {{something}} of the reputation that attaches to Bardelys. I {{was a man of}} careless ways, satiated with all the splendours life could give me, nauseated by all its luxuries. Was it wonderful that <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be lured into this affair? It promised some excitement, a certain novelty, difficulties in a path that I had--alas!--ever found all too smooth--for Chatellerault had made your reputed coldness the chief bolster of his opinion that I should not win.|$|E
6000|$|... "The noise nearly {{deafened}} me, and {{my nerves}} were so shattered {{that for a}} time I was helpless. I felt myself go up and up into the air, until soon I was far above the clouds. Then I recovered my wits, and when I began to come down again I tried to fly. I knew the Valley of Mo must be somewhere to the west; so I flew in that direction until I found myself just over the Valley, when <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> flutter to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|At last we were {{admitted}} into the cars, utterly dejected, {{and far from}} dry. For my own part, I got out a clothes-brush, and brushed my trousers as hard as I could till I had dried them and warmed my blood into the bargain; but no one else, except my next neighbour to whom I lent the brush, appeared to take the least precaution. [...] As they were, they composed themselves to sleep. I had seen the lights of Philadelphia, and been twice ordered to change carriages and twice countermanded, before <b>I</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> follow their example.|$|E
