40|$|The {{structural}} changes induced in fiber lignin by steam explosion was studied {{to better understand}} the effect of steam explosion conditions on bonding mechanisms of lignin containing fibers in self-binding <b>fiber</b> <b>boards.</b> In all the steam exploded lignin samples, the main lignin inter-unit linkage after 1 min treatment was the β–O– 4 ´ alkyl aryl ether that accounts for up to nearly 80 % of all inter-unit linkages. With increased steam explosion times a drastic decrease in the content of β-O- 4 linkages was detected, which was accompanied with the formation of new phenolic units and decrease in molar mass. However, at the same time, some condensation of lignin occurred as well. After steam explosion, the lignin was more prone to thermally induced condensation reactions. The formation of the new phenolic groups during steam explosion, and the enhanced tendency to condensate during thermal processing, most likely contribute to the higher bonding ability of steam exploded fibers when manufacturing self-binding <b>fiber</b> <b>boards.</b> WoodWisdom-EraNet and the national funding agencies (Tekes, INIA-Spain, Latvian Ministry of Agriculture) are acknowledged for the funding of ProLignin project.

40|$|Low-density wood <b>fiber</b> {{insulation}} <b>boards</b> {{are traditionally}} manufactured in a wet process using a closed water circuit (process water). The water of these industrial processes contains natural phenolic extractives, aside from {{small amounts of}} admixtures (e. g., binders and paraffin). The suitability of two fungal laccases and one bacterial laccase was determined by biochemical characterization considering stability and substrate spectra. In a series of laboratory scale experiments, the selected commercial laccase from Myceliophtora thermophila was used to catalyze the surface modification of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) using process water. The laccase catalyzed the covalent binding of the phenolic compounds of the process water onto the wood fiber surface and led to change of the surface chemistry directly via crosslinking of lignin moieties. Although a complete substitution of the binder was not accomplished by laccase, the combined use of laccase and latex significantly improved the mechanical strength properties of wood <b>fiber</b> <b>boards.</b> The enzymatically-treated TMP showed better interactions with the synthetic binder, as shown by FTIR-analysis. Moreover, the enzyme is extensively stable in the process water and the approach requires no fresh water as well as no cost-intensive mediator.

50|$|Tilt-up {{construction}} requires significant {{organization and}} collaboration {{on the building}} site. The chronological steps {{that need to be}} taken for a tilt-up project are: site evaluation, engineering, footings and floor slabs, forming tilt-up panels, steel placement, embeds and inserts, concrete placement, panel erection and panel finishing. Once the pad (casting surface or floor slab) has cured, forms are built on top. Dimensional lumber, a high quality plywood or <b>fiber</b> <b>board</b> that has at least one smooth face is typically used, although aluminum or steel forms are also common. Carpenters work from engineered drawings designed for each panel or element to construct on site. They incorporate all door and window openings, as well as architectural features and other desired shapes that can be molded into the concrete. Studs, gussets and attachment plates are located within the form for embedding in the concrete. The forms are usually anchored to the casting surface with masonry nails or otherwise adhered to prevent damage to the floor slab.|$|E

50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly cement bonded {{particle}} boards and cement fibre. Cement bonded particle boards have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement fibre boards have cellulose fibre, {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle boards and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement <b>fiber</b> <b>board</b> is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|E
