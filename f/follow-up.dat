5|$|The planet orbits at {{approximately}} 5% {{of the distance}} between the Sun and Earth every four days. The star was observed several times between 2006 and 2009, at first through the SuperWASP program and later through focused <b>follow-up</b> observations. Analysis of collected radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of WASP-13b, which was reported in a journal on April 7, 2009. A <b>follow-up</b> study published in 2011 investigated the cause for inflated planets such as WASP-13b, and re-examined (and re-constrained) its mass, radius, density, and age.|$|E

5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a <b>follow-up</b> study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most <b>follow-up</b> work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E

40|$|We have {{conducted}} a research on therapeutic <b>follow-ups</b> with delinquents on parole, in Metropolitan Montreal, {{by analyzing the}} following characteristics: the clientele's professional care, the proportion of subjects who use the therapeutic <b>follow-ups</b> during their jail term and parole, the relevance of treatment, and the beneficiary's legal status of parole. According to our results, 81 % of the subjects had classified clinical diagnostics at DSM III-R; 23, 33 % for double diagnostics; 14 % for substance abuse and 6, 67 % for mood swings. 85, 3 % of the clients receive treatment given by psychologists, making it the most popular. Officers estimate that therapeutic <b>follow-ups</b> are pertinent in 91, 9 % of the cases, when the treatments are given to individuals with behavior problems or mental health disorders, and in 86, 6 % of the cases, when dealing with clients who are less motivated to take treatment. The results also show that 61, 3 % of the subjects were involved in therapeutic <b>follow-ups</b> in {{the last months of}} incarceration. This percentage proves that subjects who receive psychological treatments during their incarceration are the most likely to continue during parole. Generally speaking, the results were very encouraging and contradict some statements to the effect that {{there is a lack of}} motivation in delinquents and that therapeutic <b>follow-ups</b> offered to parole clientele are impertinent. Results also show that the clientele who remains in psychological treatment is motivated to continue the treatment and that these <b>follow-ups</b> are considered pertinent by the clientele...|$|R

5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year <b>follow-up</b> with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (<b>follow-up</b> of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E

5|$|Initial DVT {{costs for}} an average hospitalized patient in the U.S. are around $7,700–$10,800. VTE <b>follow-up</b> costs at three months, six months, and a year are about $5,000, $10,000, and $33,000 respectively; in Europe, the three and six-month figures are about €1,800 and €3,200. Post-thrombotic {{syndrome}} is a significant contributor to DVT <b>follow-up</b> costs. Annual DVT costs in the U.S. are an estimated $5 billion or in excess of $8 billion, and the average annual cost per treated individual {{is thought to be}} about $20,000. As an example, if 300,000 symptomatic DVT patients were treated at costs averaging $20,000 annually, that would cost $6 billion a year.|$|E

5|$|Immediate {{treatment}} with 100% oxygen, followed by recompression in a hyperbaric chamber, will {{in most cases}} result in no long-term effects.

Three-month <b>follow-ups</b> on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS, and 7% from Type I DCS.

40|$|Lateral {{epicondylitis}} (tennis elbow) is {{the most}} commonly diagnosed cause of lateral elbow pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effect of single dose corticosteroid and autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection in the treatment of tennis elbow. Materials and methods: The 15 elbow of 15 patients (6 male and 9 female) was included in the study, who applied to our clinic with lateral elbow pain and diagnosed as lateral epicondylitis. A single dose of 0, 5 ml Bethametasone and 0, 5 ml Prilocaine mixture was applied to first group and single dose 1 ml autologous PRP was locally applied to the second group. Results: In the early <b>follow-ups</b> the results of corticosteroid group were better than latter <b>follow-ups,</b> however in PRP group the results were worst in early <b>follow-ups</b> but better results were obtained in later <b>follow-ups</b> according to Verhaar scoring system. Conclusion: According to our results, the beneficial effects of PRP injection in lateral epicondylitis increases over time but further studies with more patients and longer follow up durations should done in order to more clarified this subject...|$|R
