5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks <b>down</b> <b>lead</b> in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14â€“20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E

500|$|On April 11, 2011, it was {{reported}} by MTV News that [...] "Whiplash" [...] would be recorded by Selena Gomez & the Scene for their third studio album When the Sun Goes <b>Down.</b> <b>Lead</b> singer Selena Gomez is a Spears fan, and after Kurstin played her the track for the first time, she [...] "fell in love with it", unaware of Spears's contribution to the song. Gomez explained, [...] "I came and sang and saw that she had co-written it, so I was very excited. [...] It was an honor and I'm completely stoked."

It {{was the first}} single to be taken from the Rings Around the World album and reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart on its release in July 2001. The song was {{initially}} conceived as a duet but, after both Brian Harvey and Bobby Brown turned the band <b>down,</b> <b>lead</b> singer Gruff Rhys sang the entire track, using a vocoder on the verses to imitate another person. Musically [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] has echoes of Philadelphia soul and the [...] "plastic soul" [...] of David Bowie's album Young Americans and {{was inspired by the}} Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder track [...] "Ebony and Ivory". Rhys has claimed that he sees [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as [...] "fairly subversive" [...] because its polished pop style was {{in stark contrast to the}} [...] "macho" [...] guitar music the band felt was prevalent in 2001.|$|E
500|$|In April 2006 Yeovil {{became the}} first town in Britain to {{institute}} a somewhat controversial system of biometric fingerprint scanning in nightclubs. Individuals wishing {{to gain access to}} one of the town's nightclubs were asked in the first instance to submit their personal details for inclusion in a central system. This included a photograph and index fingerprint. Thereafter, each entry to one of the participating premises required a fingerprint scan. The scheme is no longer in operation. According to Nigel J Marston, Licensing Manager of South Somerset District Council, the scheme was short lived as, [...] "The company that originally supplied went through various changes of ownership and the project became unsupported. This allied to several of the venues closing <b>down</b> <b>lead</b> to the death of the scheme." [...] In February 2007, Yeovil Town Council {{became the first}} English council to ban the children's craze Heelys in the centre of the town and High Street. Skateboards, roller skates and roller blades are also illegal in the area. Councilors have stated this is due to [...] "numerous complaints about the activities of youngsters".|$|E
