25|$|Because {{thyristors}} {{can only}} be turned on (not off) by control action, and rely on the external AC system to effect the turn-off process, the control system only has one degree of freedom – when {{to turn on the}} thyristor. This limits the usefulness of HVDC in some circumstances because it means that the AC system to which the HVDC converter is connected must always contain synchronous machines in order to provide the commutating voltage – the HVDC converter cannot <b>feed</b> <b>power</b> into a passive system.|$|E
25|$|After {{the canal}} closed to {{navigation}} {{it continued to}} be used to supply water to various industrial activities at Morwellham Quay. The last of these was to operate a tin and wolfram mill at the Bedford United Mine, a supply which ceased in 1930. In 1933 the canal was purchased by the West Devon Electric Supply Co. Ltd, who constructed a hydro-electric power plant at Morwellham Quay using the canal and tunnel as a water supply. The power plant and canal now belong to South West Water, and still <b>feed</b> <b>power</b> to the National Grid.|$|E
25|$|An {{electrical}} substation {{was also}} erected {{to the south}} of the yard, to <b>feed</b> <b>power</b> into the overhead wires. Of 18,000 kilowatt capacity, it was fitted with four 4500 kilowatt rotary converters and was the largest substation on the network until demolished in the early 1970s {{to make room for the}} City Loop portals for the Caulfield Group. Additional sidings were also provided in the triangle formed by the lines bound for Richmond and Jolimont. Located on the site of the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, the ground was acquired by the Victorian Railways and the Essendon Football Club played their final season there in 1921.|$|E

25|$|The {{power plant}} is {{connected}} to the 330kV and 750kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750kV grid by a single generator transformer. The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant's own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the generator transformer to also <b>feed</b> <b>power</b> to the grid. The 330kV line is normally not used, and serves as an external power supply, connected by a station transformer to the power plant's electrical systems. The plant can be powered by its own generators, or get power from the 750kV grid through the generator transformer, or from the 330kV grid via the station transformer, or from the other power plant block via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems can be powered by diesel generators. Each unit transformer {{is connected to}} two 6kV main power boards, A and B (e.g. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal non-essential drivers and connected to transformers for the 4kV main power and the 4kV reserve busbar. The 7A, 7B, and 8B boards are also connected to the three essential power lines (namely for the coolant pumps), each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by the spinning down turbogenerators for about 45–50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start up. The generators are started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.|$|E
500|$|Each car is {{equipped}} with four three-phase asynchronous [...] motors, giving each three-car unit a power output of [...] In each car, the four motors are fed by the car's own insulated-gate bipolar transistor. They transform the 750volt direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three-phase alternating current used in the motors. The frequency and amplitude of the current fed to the engines varies depending on the train's speed. The MX3000 introduced regenerative brakes, that allow the electromagnetic brakes to <b>feed</b> <b>power</b> back to the power supply when braking. In addition, there is a back-up disc brake on each axle. Acceleration in the range [...] is limited to 1.3meters per second squared (4.3ft/s2). In this phase, the fully loaded train uses 5.0kiloampere. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This removes the need for shunting at the depots, and makes maintenance more cost efficient. Energy usage is reduced by 30%, estimated to save the operating company NOK13 million per year, compared to using the old stocks.|$|E
2500|$|With {{some other}} types of {{semiconductor}} device such as the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), both turn-on and turn-off can be controlled, giving a second degree of freedom. As a result, IGBTs {{can be used to}} make self-commutated converters. In such converters, the polarity of DC voltage is usually fixed and the DC voltage, being smoothed by a large capacitance, can be considered constant. [...] For this reason, an HVDC converter using IGBTs is usually referred to as a voltage-source converter (or voltage-sourced converter). [...] The additional controllability gives many advantages, notably the ability to switch the IGBTs on and off many times per cycle in order to improve the harmonic performance, and the fact that (being self-commutated) the converter no longer relies on synchronous machines in the AC system for its operation. [...] A voltage-sourced converter can therefore <b>feed</b> <b>power</b> to an AC network consisting only of passive loads, something which is impossible with LCC HVDC. Voltage-source converters are also considerably more compact than line-commutated converters (mainly because much less harmonic filtering is needed) and are preferable to line-commutated converters in locations where space is at a premium, for example on offshore platforms.|$|E
