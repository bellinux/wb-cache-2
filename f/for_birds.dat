5|$|Amateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) {{number in}} the millions. Many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species. Bird feeding {{has grown into a}} multimillion-dollar industry; for example, an {{estimated}} 75% of households in Britain provide food <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> {{at some point during the}} winter.|$|E
5|$|Blackdown and Sampford Commons have {{extensive}} surviving {{examples of the}} heathland, carr woodland and marshy grassland habitats that have developed on the acidic soils overlying the Greensand and Keuper Marls of the Blackdown Hills. The heathland supports a typical invertebrate fauna, including {{a wide variety of}} butterfly species, and with spiders notably abundant. The site is regionally important <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> which favour heathland habitats.|$|E

5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form {{there is a tendency}} <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.|$|E
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource <b>for</b> <b>birds.</b> More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E

5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcap}} has a {{very large}} range, and its population in Europe is estimated at 25–49million breeding pairs. Allowing <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population is between 80–196million individuals. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of insect life provided some food <b>for</b> <b>birds,</b> and birds in turn helped many species to become established on the island. The bodies of dead birds provide sustenance for carnivorous insects, while the fertilisation {{of the soil}} and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for herbivorous insects.|$|E

5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{has a very}} large range of 9,650,000km2 (3,700,000mi2), and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 17–31million breeding pairs.

5|$|The moult {{of their}} flight {{feathers}} can cause serious problems <b>for</b> <b>birds,</b> {{as it can}} impair their ability to fly.

5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the wetland nature of the Levels, the area {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant and bird species and is an important feeding ground <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> and includes 32Sites of Special Scientific Interest, of which 12 are also Special Protection Areas. The area has been extensively studied for its biodiversity and heritage, and has a growing tourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E

5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries <b>for</b> <b>birds.</b> Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E
5|$|Megachilid bees of {{the genus}} Anthidium use the hair (amongst that of various woolly plants) in making their nests. The seeds are {{generally}} too small <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> to feed on, although the American goldfinch {{has been reported to}} consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{territory}} is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing <b>for</b> <b>birds</b> to breed {{and the growth of}} a limited flora. The region is divided into the Princess Martha Coast, Princess Astrid Coast, Princess Ragnhild Coast, Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast. The waters off the coast are called the King Haakon VII Sea.|$|E
