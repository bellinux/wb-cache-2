5|$|The first match began under a {{cloud of}} Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance by Grace, though {{he would not have}} been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E

25|$|A {{question}} has been raised as <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money donated to the charities that run the shelters actually gets to the homeless people and the required services.

25|$|Sociobiological {{research}} is particularly controversial {{with regard to}} its application to humans. The theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of tabula rasa, which holds {{that human beings are}} born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success. In the final chapter of the book Sociobiology and in the full text of his Pulitzer Prize-winning On Human Nature, Wilson argues, that the human mind is shaped as much by genetic inheritance as it is by culture if not more. There are limits on <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> influence social and environmental factors can have in altering human behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} did {{not begin}} fund-raising until August 2002. <b>Just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money the foundation needed was unclear, with some sources claiming $35 million but others $60 million. One of the first fund-raising efforts involved {{the sale of a}} gold-plated commemorative medallion priced at $29.95 each. To urge the public to donate, Pope herself paid for advertisements which featured General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, poet Maya Angelou, and National Football League star Michael Strahan. On Veterans Day in 2002, the Lois Pope LIFE Foundation donated $2 million to the project. The same day, the Disabled American Veterans said its chapters would also begin fund-raising for the memorial. Shortly thereafter, the DVLMF launched a direct mail fund-raising effort as well.|$|E

25|$|The British {{conquest of}} the island in 1762 during the Seven Years' War {{proved to be a}} turning point in the history of Cuba and Spanish America in general. The British {{captured}} Havana after a three-month siege and controlled the western part of the island for a year. Britain returned Cuba in exchange for Florida in the Treaty of Paris (1763). The events revealed not only the weaknesses of the region's defenses but also proved <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the Cuban economy had been neglected by the Spanish. During the year they controlled Cuba, the British conducted an unprecedented amount of trade with the island. A year earlier France had secretly ceded Louisiana to Spain in compensation for its losses as its ally during the war.|$|E
25|$|After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this {{commercial}} vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk {{and sold it}} to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk. However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas. Although it is unknown <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> silver flowed from the Philippines to China, {{it is known that}} the main port for the Mexican silver trade—Acapulco—shipped between 150,000 and 345,000kg (4 to 9 million taels) of silver annually from 1597 to 1602.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Agadir Crisis Wilson was keen {{to pass on}} {{the latest}} {{intelligence}} to Churchill, e.g. that the Germans were deploying two divisions near Malmedy on the German-Belgian frontier, or were buying up stocks of wheat. Churchill and Grey came to Wilson’s house (4 September) to discuss the situation until after midnight. Wilson (18 September) recorded four separate reports from spies of German troops massing opposite the Belgian frontier. Wilson was also responsible for Military Intelligence, then in its infancy. This included MO5 (under George Macdonogh, succeeding Edmonds) and the embryonic MI5 (under Colonel Vernon Kell) and MI6 (under “C”, Commander Mansfield Cumming). It is unclear from the surviving documents <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of Wilson’s time was taken up by these agencies, although he dined with Haldane, Kell and Cumming on 26 November 1911.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{backing from}} Sony, Media Molecule were unsure {{about exactly what}} {{direction}} {{they were going to}} take the game. They also worried about whether people would understand, or even like the game, but these worries were dispelled after its first presentation. Media Molecule were {{aware of the fact that}} Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> backing Sony were devoting to the game—much more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{dedicated}} {{their time}} to creating memorials and funds in Lloyd's name post death. A significant amount of effort was put into creating these, which shows <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of an impact she made {{on the life of}} her students. There is not much released to the public about Lloyd despite her being a figure who fought for educational programs to benefit women at a time when progressive movements had not taken preeminence. This is most clearly shown in a correspondence between the editor of A Biographical Dictionary and Mary T. Bromage, who spent significant time on a biography of Lloyd over whether she {{should be included in the}} dictionary. The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements that women have made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from the Fed, say, at 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents. We can’t tell for certain because the Fed won’t tell us. The Fed publishes information but not enough for you {{to figure out what the}} hell happened,” Aguirre said.|$|E

This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to [...] high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about [...] high.
