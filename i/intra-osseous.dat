40|$|Abstract Introduction Mazabraud's {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} but well-described disorder characterized by fibrous dysplasia in single or multiple bones associated {{with one or more}} soft-tissue myxomas. In this report, we describe what is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first case involving an <b>intra-osseous</b> myxoma. This finding supports, and could provide new insight into, the pathological association between fibrous dysplasia and myxomas. Case presentation In this report, we describe the case of a 49 -year-old Caucasian woman known for years to have fibrous dysplasia in the left femur and tibia who presented with progressive pain in her left leg and soft swelling in the left quadriceps region. After surgical intervention with excision of the soft-tissue mass, the diagnosis of Mazabraud's syndrome was confirmed. During follow-up, our patient presented with a painless mass located on the lateral side of the left knee, next to a second, <b>intra-osseous</b> lesion with the same characteristics in the left lateral tibial plateau. The histopathological examination was consistent with a soft-tissue <b>intra-osseous</b> myxoma. Conclusion In the international literature, 67 cases of Mazabraud's syndrome have been described so far. To our knowledge, the present case report is the first to describe the combination of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and intra-muscular as well as <b>intra-osseous</b> myxoma. </p...|$|E
40|$|Statement of the Problem: Jaw bone lesions {{are common}} {{pathologic}} conditions. The role of ultrasonography in {{evaluation of the}} extra-osseous lesions is con-firmed, however, this imaging modality is not the diagnostic routine for the <b>intra-osseous</b> jaw lesions. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the efficiency of ultrasonogra-phy in diagnosis of <b>intra-osseous</b> jaw lesions concerning their size and content and also to study its correlation with the histopathological findings. Materials and Method: For this study, 15 patients with <b>intra-osseous</b> jaw lesions in the maxilla and mandible were selected from those referred to the Department of Oral Surgery. Panoramic imaging, computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and ultrasonography (USG) were performed for all the lesions. The size of the lesions was measured by USG and then compared with CT or CBCT. Moreover, the correlation amongst the echographic patterns and histopathologic results was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The proper {{interaction}} of bone tissue – the natural porous biomaterial – with a porous coated <b>intra-osseous</b> implant is conditioned, among others, by the implant porous coating poroaccessibility for bone tissue adaptive ingrowth. The poroaccessibility {{is the ability}} of implant porous coating outer layer to accommodate the ingrowing bone tissue filling in its pore space and effective new formed bone mineralizing in the pores to form a biomechanically functional bone-implant fixation. The functional features of the microtopography of <b>intra-osseous</b> implant porous surfaces together with the porosity of pore space of the outer layer of the porous coating are called by bioengineers the porostructural-osteoconductive properties of the porous coated implant. The properties are crucial for successful adaptive bone tissue ingrowth and further long-term (secondary) biomechanical stability of the bone-implant interface.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This parallel-group, randomized, {{clinical}} trial {{was designed to}} evaluate the clinical outcome of deep <b>intra-osseous</b> defects following reconstructive surgery {{with the use of}} a synthetic hydroxyapatite/equine Type I collagen/chondroitin sulphate biomaterial (Biostite), as compared to a bovine-derived hydroxyapatite xenograft (Bio-Oss). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis, 11 females and 13 males, aged 30 - 64 years, seven smokers, were selected. Patients presented with one interproximal deep <b>intra-osseous</b> defect (<b>intra-osseous</b> component >or= 4 mm) as clinically and radiographically evaluated. Immediately before surgery and 12 months after surgery, pocket probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and radiographic depth of the defect (DEPTH) were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirteen defects were treated with Biostite (test) and 11 defects with Bio-Oss (control). In the test group, PPD amounted to 7. 8 +/- 1. 3 mm before surgery, and decreased significantly to 3. 6 +/- 1. 6 mm 12 months following surgery, while in the control group PPD significantly decreased from 7. 5 +/- 2. 0 mm pre-surgery to 3. 1 +/- 1. 0 mm post-surgery. At 1 year, CAL gain and DEPTH gain were 2. 9 +/- 1. 9 and 2. 5 +/- 1. 4 mm, respectively, in the test group, and 4. 0 +/- 2. 4 mm and 3. 1 +/- 1. 8 mm, respectively, in the control group. No statistically significant differences for PPD reduction, CAL gain and DEPTH gain were detected between the groups.

Methods: Twelve pairs of <b>intra-osseous</b> periodontal defects in 11 patients received the application of EMPs on the exposed root surface (EMP). One of the two defects received randomly, as an adjunct to EMP treatment, a tetracycline-coated e-PTFE membrane (MEMP). At baseline, 6 - and 12 -month probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and probing bone level (PBL) were measured. Results: After 12 months, the EMP defects showed a significant mean PPD reduction of 2. 86 +/- 0. 75 mm, a mean gain in CAL of 1. 28 +/- 2. 04 mm, a mean PBL gain of 1. 63 +/- 1. 21 mm and a mean increase of recession (REC) of 1. 56 +/- 2. 30 mm. The MEMP defects showed a significant mean PPD reduction of 3. 02 +/- 1. 55 mm, a mean gain in CAL of 1. 65 +/- 1. 29 mm, a mean PBL gain of 1. 58 +/- 1. 92 mm and a mean increase of REC of 1. 38 +/- 1. 63 mm.

Aim: To systematically study the detailed cytomorphologic features of ameloblastoma and to evaluate the role of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in its preoperative diagnosis. Materials and Methods: In this study, FNAC was done on 26 cases of <b>intra-osseous</b> jaw lesion, clinically diagnosed as odontogenic tumor or developmental odontogenic cysts and detailed cytopathological interpretation was carried out and the results were correlated with the corresponding histopathology. Results: Of the 26 cases, 15 were found to be ameloblastoma and sensitivity of FNAC in the diagnosis of ameloblastoma was found to be 86. 6 %. None of the <b>intra-osseous</b> jaw lesion was false positively diagnosed as ameloblastoma in FNAC and hence the specificity was found to be 100 %. Conclusion: Presence of cohesive epithelial cell clusters exhibiting smaller basaloid cells with peripherally placed tall columnar cells and occasional large squamous cells either adjoining the basaloid epithelial clusters or in isolated group aids in the specific cytological diagnosis of ameloblastoma and FNAC offers an excellent diagnostic aid that may {{play a significant role in}} preoperative presumptive diagnosis of ameloblastoma along with incisional biopsy...|$|E

Typical features of cherubism include a painless bilateral, symmetrical enlargement of the jaws, misalignment of teeth, and <b>intra-osseous</b> central giant cell granuloma-like lesions, which are usually evident in early childhood. Treatment of cherubism consists of local curettage of the lesions, jaw contouring, intralesional steroid injections, and systemic calcitonin administration as well. Calcitonin therapy for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws is well documented, and favorable results have been achieved. However, fewer reports have been presented in regard to calcitonin administration for cherubism. In the present report, a 14 -year-old boy with cherubism who had <b>intra-osseous</b> cherubic lesions in his mandible was treated with an administration of 200 IU systemic calcitonin every other day via his nasal passage for duration {{of more than two}} years.

40|$|Members of the BMP and Wnt protein {{families}} play {{a relevant}} role in physiologic and pathologic bone turnover. Extracellular antagonists are {{crucial for the}} modulation of their activity. Lack of expression of the BMP antagonist noggin by osteoinductive, carcinoma-derived cell lines is a determinant of the osteoblast response induced by their bone metastases. In contrast, osteolytic, carcinoma-derived cell lines express noggin constitutively. We hypothesized that cancer cell-derived noggin {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of osteolytic bone metastasis of solid cancers by repressing bone formation. <b>Intra-osseous</b> xenografts of PC- 3 prostate cancer cells induced osteolytic lesions characterized not only by enhanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, but also by decreased osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Therefore, in this model, uncoupling of the bone remodeling process contributes to osteolysis. Bone formation was preserved in the osteolytic lesions induced by noggin-silenced PC- 3 cells, suggesting that cancer cell-derived noggin interferes with physiologic bone coupling. Furthermore, <b>intra-osseous</b> tumor growth of noggin-silenced PC- 3 cells was limited, most probably {{as a result of the}} persisting osteoblast activity. This investigation provides new evidence for a model of osteolytic bone metastasis where constitutive secretion of noggin by cancer cells mediates inhibition of bone formation, thereby preventing repair of osteolytic lesions generated by an excess of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Therefore, noggin suppression may be a novel strategy for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases...|$|E

Materials and methods: Five cases of <b>intra-osseous</b> hibernoma of bone that presented over the last year. The imaging and histopathology is reviewed. Results: All cases were identified in asymptomatic middle-aged to elderly adults as incidental findings with bone sclerosis in the axial skeleton. MRI showed lesions that were T 1 hypointense to subcutaneous fat and hyperintense to skeletal muscle and one showed contrast enhancement.
