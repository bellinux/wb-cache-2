2500|$|Tin is a soft, {{exceptionally}} weak metal (MH 1.5); a 1-cm thick rod will bend easily under mild finger pressure.

Below 13°C (55.4°F) tin changes its structure and becomes 'grey tin', which has the same structure as diamond, silicon and germanium (BCN 4). This transformation causes ordinary tin to crumble and disintegrate since, as well as being brittle, <b>grey</b> <b>tin</b> occupies more volume due to having a less efficient crystalline packing structure. Tin forms Zintl phases such as Na4Sn, BaSn, K8Sn25 and Ca31Sn20. It has good corrosion resistance in air on account of forming a thin protective oxide layer. Pure tin has no structural uses. It is used in lead-free solders, and as a hardening agent in alloys of other metals, such as copper, lead, titanium and zinc.|$|E

The proto-sulphuret of iron, {{the native}} per-sulphuret of iron, arsenical sulphuret of iron, native yellow sulphuret of copper and iron, grey {{artificial}} sulphuret of copper, artificial sulphuret of bismuth, and artificial <b>grey</b> sulphuret of <b>tin,</b> all conduct the voltaic battery current when cold, more or less, some giving sparks like the metals, others not being sufficient for that high effect. They {{did not seem}} to conduct better when heated, than before; but I had not time to enter accurately into the investigation of this point. Almost all of them became much heated by the transmission of the current, and present some very interesting phenomena in that respect. The sulphuret of antimony does not conduct the same current sensibly either hot or cold, but is amongst those bodies acquiring conducting power when fused (402.). The sulphuret of silver and perhaps some others decompose whilst in the solid state; but the phenomena of this decomposition will be reserved for its proper place in the next series of these Researches.|$|R

50|$|At 13.2 °C (about 56 °F) and below, {{pure tin}} {{transforms}} from the silvery, ductile metallic allotrope of β-form white tin to brittle, nonmetallic, α-form <b>grey</b> <b>tin</b> with a diamond cubic structure. The transformation is slow to initiate {{due to a}} high activation energy but the presence of germanium (or crystal structures of similar form and size) or very low temperatures of roughly −30 °C aids the initiation. There is also a large volume increase of about 27% associated with the phase change to the nonmetallic low temperature allotrope. This frequently makes tin objects (like buttons) decompose into powder during the transformation, hence the name tin pest.|$|E
50|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations in Europe and California banning most uses of lead, and similar regulations elsewhere, the problem of tin pest has returned, since some manufacturers who previously used tin/lead alloys, now use pure tin. For example, the leads of some electrical and electronic components are plated with pure tin. In cold environments, this can change to α-modification <b>grey</b> <b>tin,</b> which is not electrically conductive, and falls off the leads. After reheating, it changes back to β-modification white tin, which is electrically conductive, and can cause electrical short circuits and failure of equipment. Such problems can be intermittent as the powdered particles of tin move around. Tin pest can be avoided by alloying with small amounts of electropositive metals or semimetals soluble in tin's solid phase e.g. antimony or bismuth, which prevent the decomposition.|$|E

She put on her oldest {{waterproof}} and gardening-hat and her ever-slipping goloshes, for the weather was {{on the edge of}} more rain. She gathered fire-lighters from the kitchen, a half-scuttle of coals, and a faggot of brushwood. These she wheeled in the barrow down the mossed paths to the dank little laurel shrubbery where the destructor stood under the drip of three oaks. She climbed the wire fence into the Rector's glebe just behind, and from his tenant's rick pulled two large armfuls of good hay, which she spread neatly on the fire-bars. Next, journey by journey, passing Miss Fowler's white face at the morning-room window each time, she brought down in the towel-covered clothes-basket, on the wheel-barrow, thumbed and used Hentys, Marryats, Levers, Stevensons, Baroness Orczys, Garvices, schoolbooks, and atlases, unrelated piles of the Motor Cyclist, the Light Car, and catalogues of Olympia Exhibitions; the remnants of a fleet of sailing-ships from ninepenny cutters to a three-guinea yacht; a prep.-school dressing-gown; bats from three-and-sixpence to twenty-four shillings; cricket and tennis balls; disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their twisted rails; a <b>grey</b> and red <b>tin</b> model of a submarine; a dumb gramophone and cracked records; golf-clubs that had to be broken across the knee, like his walking-sticks, and an assegai; photographs of private and public school cricket and football elevens, and his O.T.C. on the line of march; kodaks, and film-rolls; some pewters, and one real silver cup, for boxing competitions and Junior Hurdles; sheaves of school photographs; Miss Fowler's photograph; her own which he had borne off in fun and (good care she took not to ask!) had never returned; a playbox with a secret drawer; a load of flannels, belts, and jerseys, and a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic; a packet of all the letters that Miss Fowler and she had ever written to him, kept for some absurd reason through all these years; a five-day attempt at a diary; framed pictures of racing motors in full Brooklands career, and load upon load of undistinguishable wreckage of tool-boxes, rabbit-hutches, electric batteries, tin soldiers, fret-saw outfits, and jig-saw puzzles.|$|R

40|$|Tin-rich organ pipes {{are often}} {{affected}} by localised {{deterioration in the}} form of grey pustules, pinholes, cracks and exfoliations at the surface. Two main types of decay of tin-base materials that might have a similar appearance, i. e. the surface of the object covered with dark grey pustules, are known. The first is the allotropic transformation of white metallic tin into <b>grey</b> <b>tin,</b> the so-called tin-pest The second form of decay is due to corrosion {{in the form of}} localised oxidation of tin. The identification of the causes of deterioration is of main concern because, whereas oxidised material can be treated, an object that suffers tin pest cannot be reconstituted. In the present paper the results of investigations on ancient tin-rich organ pipes affected by localised degradation are presented. The study of the composition and the microstructure of the pipes has been coupled with the results of analyses on the corrosion products. It was shown that oxidation clearly has {{a significant role in the}} deterioration of tin pipes, but it was not possible to establish if the allotropic transformation took place or not, because of the low probability of detecting the residual <b>grey</b> <b>tin...</b>|$|E

40|$|Stanene (single-layer <b>grey</b> <b>tin),</b> with an {{electronic}} structure akin to that of graphene but exhibiting a much larger spin-orbit gap, offers a promising platform for room-temperature electronics based on the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect. This material has received much theoretical attention, but a suitable substrate for stanene growth that results in an overall gapped electronic structure has been elusive; a sizable gap is necessary for room-temperature applications. Here, we report a study of stanene epitaxially grown on the (111) B-face of indium antimonide (InSb). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal a gap of 0. 44 eV, in agreement with our first-principles calculations. The results indicate that stanene on InSb(111) is a strong contender for electronic QSH applications. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Introduction During {{the last}} twenty years, {{a large amount of}} {{experimental}} and theoretical work has been carried out on the study of electron energy spectra of semiconductors and semimetals with tetrahedral bonds. Bonds of this type exist in crystals with diamond structure and their alloys (diamond, silicon, germanium, Ge x Sn 1 x alloys, <b>grey</b> <b>tin)</b> crystals. Theoretical efforts for predicting group IV materials that are likely to have direct gaps have been concentrated in two areas. The first is the investigation of materials where the cubic symmetry is broken and the zone-edge states are folded back {{to the center of the}} zone as in the models of porous silicon [1, 2], and SiGe superlattices [3]. The second area focuses predicting the properties of IVIV alloys with the diamond structure [4, 5]. This in fact alters the chemical and structural environment of the bulk material in a uniform way.

40|$|The {{advent of}} the National Transonic Facility (NTF) brought about a new {{application}} for an old joining method, soldering. Soldering for use at cryogenic temperatures requires that solders remain ductile and free from tin-pest (<b>grey</b> <b>tin),</b> have toughness to withstand aerodynamic loads associated with flight research, and maintain their surface finishes. Solders are used to attach 347 Stainless-Steel tubing in surface grooves of models. The solder must fill up the gap and metallurgically bound to the tubing and model. Cryogenic temperatures require that only specific materials for models can be used, including: Vasco Max 200 CVM, lescalloy A- 286 Vac Arc, pH 13 - 8 Mo. Solders identified for testing at this time are: 50 % Sn - 49. 5 % Pb - 0. 5 % Sb, 95 % Sn - 5 % Sb, 50 % In 50 % Pb, and 37. 5 % Sn - 37. 5 % Pb - 25 % In.

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{observations}} of the response of bulk samples of several lead-free solder alloys, exposed to temperatures below the allotropic transition for tin for extended periods, are reported. Tin pest has been observed in Sn- 0. 5 Cu, Sn- 3. 5 Ag, Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu, and Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu alloys at both - 18 degrees C and - 40 degrees C. The process is slow and inconsistent, usually requiring several years, but may eventually result in complete disintegration of the sample. No tin pest was detected in Sn-Zn- 3 Bi or in the traditional Sn- 37 Pb solder alloy after exposure for up to 4 and 10 years, respectively. It is suggested that nucleation is affected by local composition and that extremely small amounts of either intentional solute or impurity are influential. Growth of tin pest {{is accompanied by a}} large volume change, and it is likely that stress relaxation ahead of the expanding <b>grey</b> <b>tin</b> front is a controlling factor. A stronger matrix would be more resistant in this case, and at the temperatures of exposure Sn- 37 Pb is stronger than either Sn- 3. 5 Ag or Sn- 0. 5 Cu. The absence of tin pest, to date, on actual joints is attributed to their restricted free surface area and the greater strength associated with very small samples...|$|E
40|$|Several two- and {{three-dimensional}} {{materials are}} known to present a gapless band structure, in which conduction and valence bands cross at the intrinsic Fermi level. Notable examples are graphene and Weyl semimetals, which present a linear Dirac-like dispersion in vicinity of their band touching points. Examples exist also of gapless materials exhibiting a contact point between quadratic valence and conduction bands. A parabolic node appears, for instance, in graphene bilayers in the AB stacking configuration and in three-dimensional materials such as mercury telluride (HgTe) and <b>grey</b> <b>tin</b> (αSn). Although the existence of quadratic gapless semimetals in three dimensions {{has been known for}} a long time, these materials continue to attract extensive attention because of the rich phenomenology stemming from their soft gapless bands. This Thesis addresses many-body effects in three-dimensional parabolic semimetals in the weak-coupling Fermi-liquid regime, which arises when the Fermi level is away from the gapless point. The system is studied with the low-energy spin 3 / 2 Luttinger Hamiltonian, which stems from the constraints imposed by crystal symmetries, in the presence of long range Coulomb interactions. In particular, this Thesis addresses the evaluation of the linear density-density response function. Its knowledge allows to describe collective plasmon excitations, screening, and effective inter-particle interactions. The main original result of this Thesis is the analytical calculation of the density response function within the Random Phase Approximation. The dynamical dielectric function is then applied to the determination of the plasmon dispersion relation and to calculate the DC mobility of the many-body system in the presence of screened Coulomb impurities...|$|E
