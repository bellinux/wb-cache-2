40|$|AbstractConvenient, economical, {{and reduced}} labor fish harvest and {{transfer}} systems {{are required to}} realize operating cost savings {{that can be achieved}} with the use of much larger and deeper circular culture tanks. To achieve these goals, we developed a new technology for transferring fish based on their avoidance behavior to elevated concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2). We observed this behavioral response during controlled, replicated experiments that showed dissolved CO 2 concentrations of 60 – 120 mg/L induced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to swim out of their 11 m 3 “growout” tank, through a transfer pipe carrying a flow with ≤ 23 mg/L dissolved CO 2, into a second 11 m 3 “harvest” tank. The research was conducted using separate groups of rainbow trout held at commercially relevant densities (40 – 60 kg/m 3). The average weight of fish ranged from 0. 15 to 1. 3 kg during the various trials. In all trials that used a constant flow of low CO 2 water (≤ 23 mg/L) entering the growout tank from the harvest tank, approximately 80 – 90 % of the fish swam from the growout tank, through the transfer pipe, and into the harvest tank after the CO 2 concentration in the growout tank had exceeded 60 mg/L. The fish that remained in the growout tank stayed within the area of relatively low CO 2 water at the entrance of the transfer pipe. However, the rate of <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> from the growout tank to the harvest tank was more than doubled when the diameter of the transfer pipe was increased from 203 to 406 mm. To consistently achieve <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiencies of 99 %, water flow rate through the <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> pipe had to be reduced to 10 – 20 % of the original flow just before the conclusion of each trial. Reducing the flow of relatively low CO 2 water near the end of each <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> event, restricted the zone of relatively low CO 2 water about the entrance of the <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> pipe, and provided the stimulus for all but a few remaining fish to swim out of the growout tank. Results indicate that the CO 2 avoidance technique can provide a convenient, efficient, more economical, and reduced labor approach for <b>fish</b> <b>transfer,</b> especially in applications using large and well mixed circular culture tanks...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to quantitatively evaluate {{the relationship between}} silvering of the skin of juvenile coho salmon, due to the deposition of the purines guanine and hypoxanthine, and adaptation to seawater. It was hypothesized that maximum purine deposition occurs at the time these fish normally enter seawater, that the retention of accumulated skin purines is dependent on seawater entry and that the quantity of purines stored in the skin is greatest in <b>fish</b> <b>transferred</b> to seawater {{at or near the}} normal migratory period. To test these hypotheses, four groups of <b>fish</b> were <b>transferred</b> to seawater at monthly intervals and sampled for skin purines from February through June. Fish held in freshwater served as controls. Skin purine concentration was determined by enzyme assays. Guanine deposition in the skin of fish held in freshwater until April reached a maximum on April 19. Guanine in all treatment fish declined sharply in mid-May. Guanine in the skin of <b>fish</b> <b>transferred</b> to seawater {{during the course of the}} experiments increased again by mid-June; no such increase occurred in fish held in freshwater beyond May 17. Hypoxanthine levels were much lower than guanine levels in all treatment groups and fluctuated only slightly from February through June. Skin guanine and hypoxanthine levels at the end of June were significantly higher in <b>fish</b> <b>transferred</b> to seawater in April and May than in freshwater controls. Coefficients of condition of fish in all treatment groups decreased from February through June, but were significantly lower in <b>fish</b> <b>transferred</b> to seawater in February and March than in freshwater controls at the end of June. Percent mortality of treatment groups transferred to seawater decreased as the time of transfer approached June. A biochemical role for purines during seaward migration and adaptation to seawater is suggested. It is concluded that the physiological changes associated with parr-smolt transformation, seaward migration and seawater entry are interdependent processes and that the deposition or re-utilization of skin purines may play a vital role in their successful completion...|$|R

40|$|A {{new system}} for gentle {{transfer}} of fish (Whooshh <b>Fish</b> <b>Transfer</b> System, WFTS) has been evaluated at the AquaGen Atlantic salmon broodstock premises. Transfer of broodstock between tanks {{was carried out}} by WFTS and the traditional hand-carry method which includes a MS- 222 anaesthesia step. Transfer of fish by WFTS {{was carried out by}} using sedated (AQUI-S) and not sedated fish. The state of the fish were evaluated in terms of stress, behaviour, welfare, possible post-transfer delayed mortalities or other irregularities for up to one week after transfer. Generally, only modest stress reactions were determined and these were mainly related to fish handling operations before transfer, particularly when not sedated fish were loaded into the WFTS. The WFTS transfer itself did not impose an additional stress load. The hand-carry method was equally good, although the method is more labour-intensive. The use of the WFTS seems to eliminate the need for the MS- 222 step. No mortalities or other irregularities were observed throughout the experimental period. We were not able to identify particular issues where fish welfare was clearly compromised. For safer and less cumbersome feeding of fish into the WFTS, it is recommended that the fish are sedated before transfer...|$|E
40|$|The Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, {{exists as}} remnant natural populations in two rivers of {{south-east}} Queensland, Australia, and several translocated populations. Lungfish habitats have been impacted by agriculture and forestry, alien plants and fish and by river impoundment and regulation of flows. The species has been listed as vulnerable under Australian Commonwealth legislation. A proposal to construct Traveston Crossing Dam on the free-flowing main channel {{of the upper}} Mary River could seriously threaten the lungfish. The dam can be stopped by Commonwealth legislation if important populations of lungfish in the Mary River {{are likely to be}} significantly impacted by the new dam. This paper assembles evidence that impoundment of the Mary River and regulation of river flows are likely to decrease and fragment important lungfish populations, disrupt the breeding cycle, reduce juvenile recruitment, and isolate and decrease habitat availability/quality {{to such an extent that}} the species is likely to decline. Proposed mitigation strategies include <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> facilities, provision of flow releases from the dam (environmental flows) to sustain lungfish habitat and breeding downstream, and translocation of hatchery-reared juvenile lungfish into suitable natural habitats.

40|$|FISH PRODUCTION: Brood year 2008 {{production}} and experimental hatchery & supplemental crossed eggs {{continue to be}} incubated and chilled water at 380 Fahrenheit for the month. Temperature units are {approx} 960 TU's {{at the end of}} the month. Hatching was observed at {approx} 900 temperature units (TU's). The 2007 Brood year (BY) has approximately 773, 477 juveniles on hand at the end of December, averaging 30. 6 fish per pound. Fish tagging operations wrapped up on the 5 th. Transportation of fish to acclimation sites is tentatively scheduled to begin January 12 th. FISH CULTURE: Production pond cleaning continues on a weekly basis, and feeding continues to be performed two days per week due to the colder river water temperatures. Eggs in the incubation continue to be tempered in 38 degree water and temperature units recorded daily. On the 20 th the river became too inclement for normal operations as the intake screens were covered with ice, at that time we shutdown two river pumps and turned on wells four and six to get 6, 825 gallons of water. This was the operation at the facility for twenty-four hours at which point we were able to get back to normal operations. WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 14, 756 gallons/min. The river pumps are supplying 13, 571 gallons per minute. Well pumps No. 2 and No. 4 are operating and supplying 1, 185 gallons/min. More on well pumps in the well field maintenance section of this report. ACCLIMATION SITES: Preparation of acclimation sites for <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> was the main focus for the month of December. Each week thermographs that record water temperature have the data disc changed at the acclimations sites. Ford Excavation with assistance from YKFP maintenance has started clearing snow out of the Easton acclimation site. VEHICLE MAINTENANCE: The snowmobiles were taken in to have annual maintenance performed. The full-size John Deere tractor needed and was taken to Barnet Implement in Yakima. The tractor needed a new clutch installed and was picked up on the 31 st. SHOP BUILDING MAINTENANCE: On the 12 th the facility domestic water hydro pneumatic tank and its system malfunctioned. The problem persisted and had to be dealt with multiple times; first it caused the tank to over flow and floods the shop. Wallace Electric was called and after extensive monitoring of the tank, compressor and electrical operations an electrical relay switch was replaced. Weekly cleaning and tool inventory continues to be a priority. The shop is home to our liberation truck along with <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> equipment, fish pump and seine nets. ELECTRICAL BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The large generator is located in the electrical building and is checked daily for routine inspections. HATCHERY BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The incubation building is being used to clean and repair isolation buckets, egg incubation baskets and troughs. An experiment involving remote site incubators (RSI's) continued through the month. Chad Stockton, WDFW, records flows and monitors emergence of fry on a daily basis. Chad is working with Steve S. and Curt K. on the RSI's research along with spawning channel fry emergence. RIVERWATER COOLING FACILITY: The one pump in operation in this building is checked daily during our routine inspections, the variable pump is supplying water to the artificial spawning channel. RIVER PUMP STATION MAINTENANCE: All four river pumps are in operation and pumping {approx} 13, 571 gallons/min to the facility. The building is cleaned monthly and the air burst system is cycled daily during the morning checks. The crew continued weekly changing of the graph paper on the river temperature thermograph throughout the month, continuing this activity as part of the daily checks routine. WELL FIELD MAINTENANCE: Wells No. 1 and No. 4 were in operation and supplying 1, 185 gallons/minute to the facility and incubation building. Weekly test well readings are recorded and sent via fax to CH 2 MHILL. Also weekly well meter readings are recorded. Well No. 5 had been determined to have a faulty drain valve while trying to operate the pump for emergency water usage. It was determined that water was not able to drain and began to flow out from the test hole (TH 9). Charlie and Simon pumped out the remaining water from the test hole prior to replacing the valve. The valve was subsequently dug up, replaced and tested for operation.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} food safety {{practices}} and biosecurity measures of a Chilean salmon farm. The farm participated in detailed discussions on biosecurity and farm food safety practices and, {{in addition to}} the biosecurity measures, the following all play important roles in ensuring fish health and reduction of mortalities and outbreaks: optimum stocking density, respect and coordination between different farm sites in relation to the Area Management Agreement, and quality of smolt during <b>fish</b> <b>transfer.</b> From this and other studies, it is evident that we need to look for a balance between biosecurity measures and management factors; however, we are still unable to quantify biosecurity measures. One practical and cost-effective way would be to look at past epidemiological and mortality data and the period when biosecurity measures were applied {{to see if there was}} an association between application of biosecurity measures and subsequent reduction in mortalities and infections. If yes, then this is a good sign signifying that the strict biosecurity measures are working. Similar to Good Aquaculture Practices, biosecurity measures need to be adopted as a whole package, and the reduction of one point may have significant consequences on the whole process.

40|$|The {{effect of}} 17 beta-estradiol (ED on osmoregulatory {{performance}} was {{examined in the}} euryhaline killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Fish were injected once with 1, 2 and 5 mug g(- 1) E- 2 and, 6 h after injection, transferred from I ppt seawater (SW) to full strength SW (40 ppt) or from SW to I ppt SW. In another set of experiments, fish were injected four times on alternate days with 2 mug g(- 1) E- 2 and then, 6 h after the last injection, transferred from I ppt SW to SW or from SW to I ppt SW. Fish were sampled 18 h after transfer (i. e., 24 h post-injection), and plasma osmolality, Na+ and Cl- concentration and gill K+-pNPPase activity (a reflection of the sodium pump) were examined. Transfer from I ppt SW to SW resulted in significantly increased plasma osmolality, but did not affect gill K+-pNPPase activity. A single dose of E- 2 (1, 2 and 5 mug g(- 1)) prior to transfer from 1 ppt SW to SW increased plasma osmolality and decreased gill K+-pNPPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Prolonged treatment with E- 2 increased plasma osmolality and decreased gill K+-pNPPase activity in I ppt SW-adapted <b>fish.</b> <b>Transfer</b> of fish thus treated from I ppt SW to SW increased plasma osmolality and did not alter gill K+-pNPPase activity. Transfer from SW to I ppt SW had no significant effect on plasma osmolality or gill K+-pNPPase activity. Only the highest single dose of E- 2 (5 mug g(- 1)) prior to transfer from SW to I ppt SW decreased gill K+-pNPPase activity. Prolonged treatment with 2 mug g(- 1) E- 2 decreased gill K+-pNPPase activity only following transfer from SW to I ppt SW.

40|$|Rainbow trout {{gastroenteritis}} (RTGE) is {{an emerging}} disease of farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reported in Croatia, France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The impact of RTGE at the site-level varies, and daily mortalities of 0. 5 - 1 % are common. Gross lesions include severe enteritis with congestion and oedema, and the segmented filamentous bacterium "Candidatus arthromitus" {{has been suggested}} as a possible aetiological agent. This paper presents findings from a prospective longitudinal epidemiology study that took place from June to November 2006 in 12 RTGE-positive UK sites, examining the impact and presentation of the disease, spread pattern, risk factors for disease presence and severity and the efficacy of current control strategies. RTGE was present {{in a total of}} 164 production units across the 12 sites, representing 39 % of all stocked units. Fish losses due to RTGE totalled 61. 4 tonnes. The plotting of epidemic curves revealed a propagating epidemic pattern in 51 % affected units, suggesting RTGE is infectious. This was supported by risk analysis of fish transfers and site layouts, which revealed an increased risk of becoming RTGE positive after contiguity or <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> to and from a previously affected unit. Conditional multivariate logistic regression analysis identified eight variables significantly associated with the presence of RTGE. Seven variables were risk factors, including higher stocking densities, mortalities due to predation or handling, higher water temperature, higher daily feed input and contiguity or fish movement to and from a previous case. One variable was protective: the absence of an aeration system in a unit. General linear modelling identified a significant association of mean feed input per fish during an outbreak with RTGE cumulative mortality. Finally, great variability was observed with regards to the control strategies targeted to RTGE in these sites, suggesting an absence of a common strategy. In feed NaCl treatments apparently presented a palliative effect if given to affected fish during the clinical outbreaks, but they did not prevent recurrence...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{treatment}} and flow rate on young Atlantic cod juveniles {{was investigated in}} a 36 -days experiment. Four different flow rates (10, 20, 40, and 70 times the effective tank volume per day) were set up in triplicate tanks within each of three rigs with recirculated, UV-radiated, and untreated water, respectively. Each of the 36 tanks was stocked with 200 weaned cod juveniles at a mean weight of 0. 048 g. Fish mortality was recorded daily in all tanks, and growth (wet weight) was determined {{at the end of}} the experiment. The microflora in the rearing water was investigated by means of PCR-DGGE and flow cytometry. Observed mortality was significantly higher at low flow rates while otherwise unexplained mortality (presumed to be due to cannibalism) was lowest in the recirculation system. No correlation was found between survival and growth. Growth was significantly affected by both water exchange rate and treatment, as the juveniles from high flow rates and the UV-treatment showed elevated growth rates. Both growth and survival scaled in accordance with metabolic factors like oxygen saturation and unionized ammonia. Bacterial concentrations increased in all tanks and treatment from the beginning of the experiment to the end. The UV-treated and untreated water started at typical seawater concentrations (0. 5 − 1 × 10 'raised to the sixth power' mLˉ¹) and increased five to tenfold during the experiment. The recycled water tanks started with bacterial concentrations 2 – 5 times higher than the UV- and untreated experiments at the time of <b>fish</b> <b>transfer,</b> and ended up with 10 times higher concentrations in the end. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles separated the recirculation tanks, including the respective inlet water, from the flow-through systems, with one exception (the highest flow rate). Eighty-five% of the sequences clustered within the Gammaproteobacteria, further divided into four distinct clusters. One of the clusters was only detected in the recirculation system, and showed highest affiliation to bacteria belonging to the Alteromonas/Pseudoalteromonas genera. In contrast, bacteria belonging to the family Vibrionaceae were detected in the flow-through systems...|$|E
40|$|FISH PRODUCTION: Final {{shocking}} of eggs {{was finished}} in the incubation. Egg enumeration for the 2008 brood was completed and the eggs are being incubated in 38 degree Fahrenheit chilled water. Don Larsen of NOAA made a request of eggs for research purposes {{and was able to}} acquire supplemental line eggs 10, 555. Estimated density at the time of ponding in Mid-March of 2009 is approximately 43, 869 fry per raceway after calculating an average fry loss of 2 %. The end of the month totals for the 2007 brood reports 773, 807 juveniles on hand with an overall average of 31. 4 fish per pound. Tagging continues on the 2007 brood and is on pace to wrap up in early December. FISH CULTURE: Ponds are cleaned as needed and due to the colder water temperatures, the feeding frequency has been changed to three days a week. All ponds are sampled {{at the end of the}} month. Growth for production fish are adjusted accordingly as temperature dictates feeding levels. Torrential rain on the 12 th turned the Yakima River extremely turbid. Fish tagging operations were halted and the ensuing conditions at the facility intake screens became a concern. Water flow to the wet well became restricted so the decision was made to shut the surface water (river) pumps down and turn on well pumps No. 1, No. 4 and No. 6 to run water to the facility head box. This operation continued for twenty-four hours at which point normal operations were optimal and fish tagging resumed, although the river didn't clear up enough to feed the fish until the 17 th. WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 14, 822 gallons/minute. Well No. 2 is pumping water at a rate of 530 gallons per minute. All four river pumps are in operation and pumping 14, 292 gallons/minute. ACCLIMATION SITES: Cle Elum staff has been working to prep the acclimation sites for the upcoming <b>fish</b> <b>transfer</b> before the snow falls. Thermographs at each site are changed weekly. AMB Tools performed routine maintenance on the compressor and Brown and Jackson pumped out the septic tank at the Jack Creek acclimation site. VEHICLE MAINTENANCE: Snow tires are now on all vehicles and snow blowers were installed on the John Deere tractor and lawn tractor. The snowplow was also installed on the Ford one ton. The four Snowmobiles were serviced by Yamaha Jacks of Ellensburg. MAINTENANCE BUILDING MAINTENANCE: Clean up occurs on Fridays of each week. HATCHERY BUILDING MAINTENANCE: Water has been turned on to vertical incubator islands one and two. After eggs were transferred to vertical stacks cleaning of troughs began. WDFW crew inventoried eggs from isolettes and then transferred them to the vertical incubators. RIVER PUMP STATION MAINTENANCE: All four pumps are in operation and supplying the facility with 14, 292 gallons/minute of water to rearing ponds. WELL FIELD MAINTENANCE: Well pumps No. 1, No. 4 and No. 6 were turned on to supplement water flow to the facility as mentioned previously. Well No. 5 was powered up but a winterizing valve malfunction wouldn't allow operation, we are currently working on it at this time. Well No. 2 is pumping 530 gallons per minute and supplies well water to incubation and chiller. The pumps meter is recorded weekly. Test holes are monitored weekly and results are faxed to CH 2 MHILL afterward.

40|$|There {{is concern}} {{that many of}} New Zealand's inshore fish species are being overfished {{to the extent that}} fishing effort will have to be reduced to ensure the {{continued}} existence of some species as commercial stocks. A dual solution of both reducing the total level of <b>fishing</b> effort and <b>transferring</b> <b>fishing</b> effort to alternative fisheries to alleviate the problem is possible. This report examines the economics of <b>transferring</b> <b>fishing</b> effort to southern bluefin tuna capture off the South Canterbury / Otago coast, and is therefore an example of the problems and potential in <b>transferring</b> <b>fishing</b> effort. The study pays particular attention to the extension needs in developing fisheries using the results of a census of skippers in the region. Two chapters have been included to give the reader some background to the southern bluefin tuna fishery and the South Canterbury/Otago fishery. From this information the potential benefits of development, the direct cost of catching bluefin and the opportunity cost of foregoing catching traditional species have been estimated. The indirect costs of providing the necessary infrastructure for development were estimated from the survey. The survey also provided information on the readiness of fishermen and their vessels to undertake southern bluefin tuna fishing. This paper does not consider the effect on the traditional <b>fish</b> stocks of <b>transferring</b> catching effort to alternative fisheries. However, consideration is given to the economics of transferring catching effort to alternative fisheries regardless of the reasons for having an effort reduction scheme. The cost benefit analysis has seven scenarios based {{on the extent to which}} developing the bluefin fishing is able to alleviate the present inshore fisheries management problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The {{flathead}} catfish Pylodictis olivaris {{is a large}} {{predatory fish}} that has been introduced widely beyond its indigenous range {{to the detriment of}} many native fish communities. It disperses rapidly within and among river systems, but its potential to use saltwater or brackish waters for migration and exploitation of marine prey resources is unknown. We evaluated the salinity tolerance of juvenile flathead catfish exposed to NaCl and synthetic seawater (0 – 34 ‰) in direct-transfer acute toxicity tests. The 96 -h median lethal concentration (LC 50) for fish exposed to NaCl at 188 C was a salinity of 10. 0 ‰ with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 9. 0 – 11. 1 ‰, whereas the 96 -h LC 50 for fish in synthetic seawater (Instant Ocean) at 188 C was 14. 5 ‰ (95 % CI, 13. 7 – 15. 5 ‰). To determine whether fish could survive the transition from freshwater to brackish water and then back to freshwater, <b>fish</b> were <b>transferred</b> from freshwater at 188 C to water with a salinity of 8, 11, or 14 ‰ for 24 h and then returned to freshwater for 48 h. Fish exposed to synthetic seawater with a salinity of 8 or 11 ‰ for 24 h had more than 95 % survival for 48 h after transfer to freshwater; however, no <b>fish</b> <b>transferred</b> directly to synthetic seawater with a salinity of 14 ‰ survived the 24 -h exposure period. Additional acclimation tests with fish that were exposed to synthetic seawater in which salinity was increased daily by 4 ‰ yielded an LC 50 of 15. 8 ‰. Our results provid...|$|R

40|$|Noboru KASAHARA* * and Kohei YAMAUCHI* Changes in {{seawater}} adaptability, gill {{and kidney}} Nil. +, K+-ATPase activities, and serum thyroxine levels of underyearling broodstock masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masau, smolts in Mori Branch, Hokkaido Fish Hatchery, were investigated {{during and after}} smoltification. The occurrence of smolts judged from the external appearance (body silvering and pigmenta-tion of dorsal fin margin) started in May, peaked in July, and decreased thereafter. High Nil. +, K+-ATPase activities in the gill were observed between early June and early August, while the activities in the kidney were highest in late July. Serum sodium concentrations of the <b>fish</b> <b>transferred</b> directly into seawater (30 % 0) showed the lowest levels in late July, which coincided with the highest activities of Nil. +, K+-ATPase in the both gill and kidney. The peaked concentrations of serum thyroxine were observed in late May and mid-June. These results suggest that gill and kidney might be involved in ion regulation during smoltification, and that thyroxine might play a role on the physiological characteristics in the smolting underyearling broodstock masu salmon...|$|R
