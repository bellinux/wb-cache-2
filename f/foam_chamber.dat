5000|$|Life jackets for {{outfitting}} large commercial transport {{ventures in}} potentially dangerous waters, such as coastal cruises, offshore passages, and overwater air flights, consisting of either a single air chamber or {{a pair of}} (twin or double) sealed air chambers constructed of coated nylon (sometimes with a protective outer encasing of heavier, tougher material such as vinyl), joined together. For use aboard ships they may be constructed of <b>foam.</b> Twin air <b>chambers</b> provide for redundancy {{in the event of}} one of the air chambers leaking or failing to [...] "fire", for example if the thin air cell fabric is sliced open by sharp metal fragments during emergency evacuation and egress. Most life jackets for leisure use are of the single air chamber type.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAluminium-based single {{films were}} {{pulled out of}} a melt using {{circular}} wire frames and characterised {{with respect to their}} stability under varied conditions. Pure Al, AlSi 9 and AlSi 9 Mg 0. 6 alloys as well as particle reinforced composites based on the same alloys but adding different amounts of stabilising SiC or TiB 2 particles were prepared. The velocity at which films were drawn was varied to investigate their solidification as well as their oxidation behaviour. In order to study the influence of the oxygen content of the <b>foaming</b> atmosphere a <b>chamber</b> was manufactured that allows for pulling single films under defined conditions. It was found that films without Mg were less stable than Mg-containing ones and even the addition of particles to such Mg-free alloys results in no improvement. In contrast, films made of AlSi 9 Mg 0. 6 were more stable and required only a small amount of oxygen (> 200 ppm O 2), but in general some oxygen has always to be present to obtain a stable film. It was found that the more particles are contained in the composite and the slower the film gets pulled, the lower the required oxygen content is...|$|R
30|$|During the {{experimental}} operation, excessive foam {{on the surface}} of the aeration tank was observed. Nevertheless, the treatment process and the permeate quality were not affected. It was only encountered at MLSS of over 40  g/l. The foam removal was done manually by means of water flushing. A secondary option was to drain a portion of activated sludge to reduce sludge concentration. On a regular basis, sludge was drained from the aeration chamber to reduce thick <b>foaming</b> inside the <b>chamber</b> caused by the high density of sludge. The foaming was due to shortcomings of the pilot plant as well. It is not expected to occur with the same magnitude in a commercial-size MBR because the sludge- recycle ratio would be more accurate and well planned during design, with careful consideration of SRT, temperature, and the influent quality. This does not guarantee that the foam issue will be completely eliminated but MLSS value of 40  g/l during operation is not a standard operation parameter. It will vary from application to application. The MLSS should be limited to a certain level, depending on the foaming situation. At MLSS less than 20  g/l, the foam formation stopped completely. The temperature of the reactor was closely monitored from December to July. The reactor’s temperature varied between 21 and 32 °C, which was lower than the high ambient temperature of Sharjah. The temperature interval was ideal for bacteria activity, and obviously the temperature was not controlled. In general, the bacteria are under water surface with no direct sun light; hence, no effect of temperature on the sludge. It only affected the excess foam, which formed due to dead bacteria.|$|R
