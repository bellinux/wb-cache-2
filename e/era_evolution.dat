2500|$|The La Lagunilla {{market was}} {{established}} and {{named after the}} La Lagunilla neighborhood, just outside the historic center of Mexico City. In the pre Hispanic era, this land was a small lagoon, which connected to the larger Lake Texcoco. This lagoon was important as docks for barges bringing merchandise into the Tlatelolco market. The activities of ancient Aztec markets were commented upon by Bernal Díaz del Castillo and other conquistadors who marveled at their size and variety of merchandise. However, all Aztec markets were outdoors, consisting of stands {{set up by the}} vendors themselves and taken {{down at the end of}} the day. During the colonial period, the lagoon dried along with the rest of Lake Texcoco and only the name serves as a reminder of the area’s former geography as “la lagunilla” means “the small lake.” [...] The neighborhood of La Lagunilla was built over this dried lagoon. Originally, the neighborhood was filled with mansions for the upper classes. Many still remain, as they have never been replaced by more modern constructions. As the area’s economy has been strongly linked to commerce since the Aztec <b>era,</b> <b>evolution</b> of the area into a lower-class neighborhood brought in large scale commerce.|$|E

In Part 1 of a 2 -part position article from the commission, diversity as a concept and its dimensions of personality, character, ethnicity, biology, biography, and organization are introduced. Terms commonly used to describe diverse individuals and groups are reviewed. The history of diversity and inclusion in US society and health care are addressed. The posteCivil Rights <b>Era</b> <b>evolution</b> of diversity in medicine is delineated: Diversity 1. 0, with basic awareness, nondiscrimination, and recruitment; Diversity 2. 0, with appreciation {{of the value of}} diversity but inclusion as peripheral or in opposition to other goals; and Diversity 3. 0, which integrates diversity and inclusion into core missions of organizations and their leadership, and leverages its potential for innovation and contribution. The current states of diversity and inclusion in RRO are reviewed in regard to gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The lack of representation and unchanged demographics in these fields relative to other medical specialties are explored. The business case for diversity is discussed, with examples of successful models and potential application to the health care industry in general and to RRO. The moral, ethical, and public health imperative for diversity is also highlighted...|$|E

40|$|The current {{management}} of early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) {{is to start}} an intensive treatment as soon as possible. To avoid under/overtreatment, {{it is important to}} identify reliable <b>ERA</b> <b>evolution</b> biomarkers. HLA-G molecules has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a role in disease regulation. HLA-G antigens are expressed as membrane bound and soluble isoforms (mHLA-G, sHLA-G) that act as ligand for immune-inhibitory receptors (ILT 2, ILT 4, KIR 2 DL 4). Expression of HLA-G is influenced by a 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon 8 of the gene, where the deletion is associated with mRNA stability. We analyzed 23 ERA patients during a 12 months follow-up disease treatment for sHLA-G, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 10 and TNF-alpha levels in plasma samples by ELISA, mHLA-G and ILT 2 expression on peripheral blood CD 14 positive cells by flow cytometry and typed HLA-G 14 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism by Real-Time PCR. Disease status (DAS 28), ultrasonography with power Doppler and laboratory data were checked. Cytokine levels confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of the treatment. sHLA-G, mHLA-G and ILT 2 expression inversely correlated with DAS 28 disease scores. The frequency of 14 bp deletion allele increased in patients with disease remission. Based on these results, HLA-G may be a candidate biomarker to evaluate early prognosis and disease activity in ERA patients...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{knowledge}} of UV-resistance mechanisms in microorganisms is reviewed in perspective, {{with emphasis on}} E. coli. Dark-repair genes are classified into "excision" and "tolerance" (ability to produce a normal copy of DNA from damaged DNA). The phenotype of DNA repair is rather common among the microorganisms compared, and yet their molecular mechanisms are not universal. In contrast, DNA photoreactivation is the simplest and the most general among these three repair systems. It is proposed that DNA repair mechanisms evolved in the order: photoreactivation, excision repair, and tolerance repair.
