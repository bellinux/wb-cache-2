We show that while <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> experience more frictions than homogeneous ones, they are also less conformist. Homogeneous groups {{minimize the risk of}} miscoordination, but they may get stuck in an ineffcient equilibrium. <b>Diverse</b> <b>groups</b> may fail to coordinate, but if they do, they tend to attain effciency. This fundamental tradeoff determines how the optimal level of diversity varies with social and economic factors. When it is vitally important to avoid miscoordination, homogeneous groups are optimal.

Trust has been regarded as especially critical when police have sought to develop more positive interactions with <b>diverse</b> <b>groups.</b> Previous {{research has focused on}} citizen levels of trust in police; understanding how police officer s perceive others however and how this shapes their trust in members of <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> is still developing. As such, our study contributes valuable information regarding police perceptions of trust in minority group members; an area that has hitherto been under - researched in policing studies, particularly in an Australian context. To understand how police recruit perceptions of socialization, interaction, and living and work choices affects their perceptions of trust in <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> of people data were collected from a population of Police Recruits (PRs) and Protective Service Officers (PSOs) (N = 1609) during pre-service awareness training. These were used in a Stepwise OLS model to ascertain opinions of trust in people distinguished by race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality and gender difference, age and differences in training group. We found police recruit levels of trust in <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> of people are positive since the results show socializing and experiencing positive interaction whilst socializing with people from <b>diverse</b> <b>groups,</b> and the age of the participants has a significant positive impact on the perceptions of trust police recruit s in members of <b>diverse</b> <b>groups.</b> However, once operational training ends and professional life begins, awareness training undertaken at the academy {{may not be enough to}} positively alter police officer levels of trust in <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> of people over time...|$|R

The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids.
