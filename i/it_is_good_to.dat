5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{removed the}} twin houses {{to build his}} much larger Mahandrihono residence, which was {{decorated}} with silver birds and chains. He also expanded the compound and added a second enclosure of voafotsy wood (replaced annually) around {{the exterior of the}} stone walls. Mandraimanjaka was removed and in its place Andrianampoinimerina built a house with a small tower, which he named Manjakamiadana ("where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> rule"), designating it as the residence for the royal sampy (idol) called Imanjakatsiroa and the guardians assigned to protect it. Two other idols were kept nearby: Ifantaka, kept in a house in the Bevato compound, and Kelimalaza, guarded in its house at the Ambohimanga neighborhood of Ambohimirary. Under Radama I, the stone wall was reinforced with palisades that enclosed three houses, two of which were twin houses like those that Andriambelomasina had built. Ranavalona I enlarged the compound's courtyard and expanded Manjakamiadana. She constructed the stone walls that currently enclose the compound, as well as its two stone gateways. Ranavalona II re-added palisades to the compound's stone walls. She demolished Manjakamiadana and in its place constructed two hybrid Malagasy-European pavilions using wood from the historic and spiritually significant Masoandro house, which had been removed from the royal compound of Antananarivo by Ranavalona I. French general Joseph Gallieni used these European-influenced buildings as his summer residence {{in the early years of}} the French colonial period. In 2013, Andrianampoinimerina's original house, the reconstructed tombs, and the two royal pavilions are preserved in the compound, which also includes a watchtower, a pen for sacrificial zebu, and two pools constructed during the reign of Ranavalona I.|$|E

Sandé said people didn't know what do with her, it was just her and her piano, which was very stripped, it was completely different from what everyone was used to and different from everything that was currently out. However, she stressed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be different and not predictable.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} {{that all these}} documents were written by humans, who used human judgment as to whether to note something. For example, once in Europe, German air raids and picking up dead bodies from the sea were fairly common occurrences. At some point, they became too common to report. The Deck Log might mention an air raid on one day but the War Diary might make no mention of it. A week later, the opposite might be true. The clearest picture comes from reading all the documents.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have someone to come home to, and that is why he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|The British {{magazine}} PC Gamer Steve Owen {{praised the}} game's challenge and [...] "cute" [...] graphics, but criticised the interface. Frederick Claude of Coming Soon Magazine also complimented the graphics as [...] "highly detailed", and the [...] "very simple" [...] user interface, although he criticised the repetitiveness {{and lack of}} multiplayer support that would later be introduced with a patch. GameSpot Trent Ward agreed about the graphics too, lauding them as [...] "fantastic", and also complimented the [...] "realistic" [...] voice acting performance, and the humour, although he criticised the artificial intelligence as [...] "flawed". His conclusion was that the game [...] "just doesn't fly". Bonnie James of The Electric Playground also liked the graphics, {{as well as the}} [...] "lovely" [...] opening sequence, but found the music [...] "horrible". Computer and Video Games Alex Huhtala concurred about the graphics, describing them as [...] "large and colourful", but commented that the humour wears off after a while, although he felt <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> begin with.|$|E
500|$|When first {{published}} in 1945, The North Ship received just one review, in the Coventry Evening Telegraph, which concluded [...] "Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care. His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up {{in a kind of}} wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity. Mr Larkin's readers must at present be confined to a small circle. Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature?" [...] A few years later, though, the poet and critic Charles Madge came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments. When the collection was reissued in 1966 it was presented as a work of juvenilia, and the reviews were gentle and respectful; the most forthright praise came from Elizabeth Jennings in The Spectator: [...] "few will question the intrinsic value of The North Ship or the importance of its being reprinted now. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> know that Larkin could write so well when still so young." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Trumpeldor, {{the leader}} of the Jewish {{settlers}} who were killed at Tel Hai in 1920, served as the primary role model of the Betar. A disabled man with only one arm, he led his people in the futile defense of the settlement and died with the words, [...] "Never mind, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> die for our country" [...] (Hebrew: [...] "אין דבר ,טוב למות בעד ארצנו"). This was particularly significant given that the Jews did not yet have a country: Trumpeldor was referring to sacrificing one's life in order to further the establishment of an independent Jewish state. The words of Shir Betar ("The Betar Song"), written by Jabotinsky, include a line that quotes Trumpeldor's last words to [...] "never mind". As the song expresses, Betar youth were to be as [...] "proud, generous, and fierce [...] " [...] as Trumpeldor, and as ready to sacrifice themselves for Israel.|$|E
2500|$|According to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted {{to murder}} Edward {{in such a}} way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in [...] ) which, {{depending}} on where the comma was inserted, could mean either [...] "Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good" [...] or [...] "Do not kill Edward; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> fear". [...] In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and none whatsoever of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a red-hot poker have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella's orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded Joan of Arc and other near contemporaries after their deaths.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese {{women will}} {{sometimes}} {{be forced to}} take jobs after marriage to supplement their husband's income, however, some women are unable to work, {{because of the lack}} of domestic support at home. [...] Husbands seldom help with the housework, forcing women to stay home rearing children and taking care of domestic tasks. many believe a good housewife's job is to stay at home and look after the house. [...] Housewives may allow their husband to help in some small tasks, however, they are worried if they see their husband taking too much time to do domestic chores. [...] Housewives believe the house is their charge and do not want their husbands accusing them of neglecting their responsibility. Japanese women overall completed 95% of unpaid housework, while among full-time workers women still completed 60% of the housework, an unparalleled proportion among OECD countries. In 2000, 84.6% of women and 88.5% of men agreed that women should still be responsible for household jobs although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have employment. In 2004, 67.4% of new mothers left their previous job for their first birth.|$|E
