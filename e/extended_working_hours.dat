40|$|Abstract—Improving {{productivity}} {{is one of}} the main concerns of apparel industries. This paper provides the idea how productivity levels changes at different time during normal <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> in apparel industries. A noble approach is also proposed to optimize the productivity level. There are many factors which act as obstacles to higher productivity. Unskilled workers, physical fatigue from <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> without rest, misplacement of worker at workstation, lack of training, lack of knowledge, awareness are few factors related to worker which directly affect the productivity. Fatigue lowers average productivity, measured as output per worker hour, for almost all of the apparel industries. As the overall daily performance of each worker is not same and the change in their performance defer from one worker to another worker bottleneck creates in the assembly line. During the investigation attention is concentrated on how physical fatigue of workers influences the daily production rate and how to optimize the productivity. If physical fatigue exists, loss due to fatigue can be reduced to a remarkable label. Here, a study has been carried out to find out the effect of fatigue on productivity and to form a framework to improve the productivity based on the overall performance of workers by reducing fatigue...|$|R
40|$|Within nursing, {{there appears}} to be two {{enduring}} sets of assumptions: firstly, that woman with children should prioritise the care of children; and secondly, that nursing standards require nurses to put their profession above other priorities.

In a female dominated profession, we find the profession resisting attempts to make the profession more accessible to women with young children. The career progression of women with children is inhibited and this is driven in part by a determination to maintain ‘traditional’ employment practices. It develops Heilman's argument that gender perceptions, by both males and females can be biased against women and these produce gender inequalities in employment. These findings are relevant across many areas of employment and they are significant in relation to broadening the debate around equal opportunities for women...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} minimum wage policy on {{employment}} and <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> {{is crucial for}} assessing the overall effect of this policy. A large number of scholars studied this issue from both the theoretical and empirical perspectives, but still no consensus was reached. Under the background of economic rebalance which is a transition from the export-oriented economy towards domestic demand-oriented economy in China, this issue is triggering more intensive debate. This paper aims to provide new reliable evidence to this hot debate and fill the knowledge {{gap in the literature}} as well. In the paper, a three-year pooled cross-sectional micro data obtained from the large dataset of China General Social Survey covering 28 out of the 34 provinces are used. By establishing regression-adjusted difference in differences models in the short and medium term respectively, a comparative analysis of minimum wage effect on employment and <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> is conducted. The estimation results imply that the negative effect of minimum wage policy on employment and <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> is not very severe: although in the short term it will harm the low-wage male workers' employment and <b>extend</b> their <b>working</b> time, as time goes on, the negative effect will disappear. The Harris and Todaro model could give a possible explanation to the result. Besides, the paper provide the second explanation that the increase of labor productivity may create a space for the increase of minimum wage without hurting employment. In terms of the <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> effect, the increase of minimum wage will <b>extend</b> the <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> for male workers in the short term, but reduce it in the medium term. We attribute this result which is different from many studies in the developed countries to the monthly wage dominant system in China. The longer <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> for male workers in short term may be explained as male workers who remain employed have to <b>extend</b> their <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> to compensate their increase of wage.

40|$|Abstract: A {{literature}} review of 105 {{studies on the}} effects of extended daily working hours was conducted. Potential negative effects of <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are discussed: More accidents on the job; more accidents off the job; reduced duration and quality of sleep due to moonlighting; sleepiness; reduced alertness; fatigue; adverse effects on performance; prolonged toxic exposure; adverse effects on health; increased absenteeism; problems communicating with managers; and problems while driving home. Potential positive effects of <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are discussed: Less travel time and costs; more time for the family, social life, and domestic duties; increased satisfaction with working hours; fewer handovers; and less overtime. No firm conclusions can be drawn because of the partly contradictory results and the methodological problems of many studies.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this review}} {{is to examine the}} effect of shift work and <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> on {{occupational}} injuries. A calculation based on four studies shows that the risk of occupational injury during afternoon shifts was 6 % lower than that during morning shifts. The same kind of calculation showed that the risk of occupational injury during night shifts was 15 % lower than during morning shifts. A review of eight studies showed that the risk of occupational injury was 41 % higher for 10 -hour working days compared to 8 -hour working days. On the other hand, working 12 -hour days increased the risk of occupational injury by 14 %. When working more than 12 hours per day, three studies showed a 98 % increase in involvement in occupational injury. The results of this study showed that shift work considerably increased the risk of occupational injury in the USA, but not in the other countries. <b>Extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> was related to elevated risk of occupational injury.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of an eight-hour working day and forty eight-hour working week {{was the result}} of many years of struggle of the workers of Europe and America, demanding respect for their rights, including the right to leisure and family life. Currently, in many European countries, average working time is shorter than that established by the International Labour Conference in the Convention of 1919. The longest – 40 <b>hour</b> <b>working</b> time – valid in Greece, Malta and in most countries of the former socialist bloc (with the exception of Slovakia and the Czech Republic). In the so-called fifteen countries (EU- 15) average weekly <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> (excluding overtime) in 2007 was 37. 9 hours. According to official statistics in all countries of the European Union, the actual working time is longer than that specified in collective agreements. Employees work the longest in Austria, Greece, Great Britain, the Czech Republic and Poland, while the shortest is in Luxembourg. It was observed that there is an inverse relationship between working time and work efficiency. In countries, where workers have the most days off from work and/or shortest time, labor productivity is the largest (eg, Luxembourg, Sweden, Ireland, France and Germany). The effects of fatigue for workers not only have an impact on staff competencies, but also imprint their mark on the sphere of social life and the whole economy.

The savings can be largely estimated by comparing whole-campus electricity consumptions between typical weekdays and weekends (or holidays). Energy overheads caused by the <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> (two more hours per working day) were also estimated. A limited shutdown scenario (similar to a typical weekend schedule) and a more aggressive shutdown scenario (similar to a typical holiday schedule) during the weekend periods are presented.

40|$|Background: Work-family {{conflict}} {{is related to}} poor psychological and physical health, absence and deterioration of relationship quality at home. Work-life balance is related to improved well-being, motivation and productivity. Objectives: To examine the relation of demands and resources at work and work-family conflict and work-family balance based on the job demands-resources model. Material and method: The analyses were conducted {{on the basis of}} data from European Social Survey Round 5 2010 / 2011. The sample used consisted of Norwegian workers with at least one child living at home. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted, in order to examine the significance of demands and resources related to both directions of work-family conflict and work-family balance. Results: Work pressure, number of work hours and <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are associated with work-family conflict. Opportunities for advancement and support from co-workers are associated with reduced work-family conflict. A secure job and a job which requires learning new things are associated with reduced family-work conflict. Number of working hours and <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are associated with reduced work-family balance, while autonomy, support from co-workers, appropriately pay and the opportunity for advancement are associated with work-family balance. Conclusion: Demands at work have a great significance for both work-family conflict and work-family balance, and indicate that reducing demands at work can reduce conflict and promote a balance. Resources also have significance, and indicate that resources at work can reduce the level of conflict and promote a balance...|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we aim to}} weave {{together}} {{a number of areas}} of literature in order to highlight gender inequality in IT-enabled service work in the global economy. As women’s participation in labour markets increases (ILO, 2007) along with the expansion of service sector work (ILO, 2008), expectations emerge that suggest increased opportunities and gender equality beckons. Global capitalist development involves the mobilisation of large numbers of women workers and women's participation has increased over time at all income levels (2011). However sex segmentation is endemic, with women often concentrated in industries where profit margins are protected by shrinking labour costs, <b>extending</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> or reducing the number of formal workers (Heintz, 2006). Labour market trends are linked to a common rhetorical theme which suggests that ICTs are driving and enabling work transformations, and that women are likely benefactors (ILO, 2001; Mansell, 2001). This is coupled with the increasing outsourcing and offshoring of IT-enabled service work, which some view as being key to promoting development, offering opportunities for women to enter the workforce and to become involved in enterprise (Morgan et al., 2004). Investment in technology generally and ICTs in particular is often touted as an instrument for bridging the gap between developed and developing countries and accelerating economic growth, yet these assumed economic and social gains—for both women and men—are dubious at best (Mansell, 2002; Avgerou, 2003) ...|$|R
