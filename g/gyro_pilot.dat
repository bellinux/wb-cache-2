5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and {{to test the}} {{radio-control}} equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry <b>gyro</b> <b>pilot</b> kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|E

The GoGo Gyro has cables which {{are strong enough}} to enable the GoGo Gyro to lift the GoGo Marine. In addition, the Gyro is {{actually}} two vehicles combined—the part that forms DaiBouken's helmet is an exploration vehicle called Met Lander (Metto Randā). Forms DaiBouken's back and helmet, Super DaiBouken's spine, Ultimate DaiBouken's abdominal area, and the cabin of the GoGo Trailer's tractor unit.|$|R
