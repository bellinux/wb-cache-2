The main elements of the cascade are considered the inlet nozzle (restriction), measuring chamber and the measuring nozzle with the measuring slot (displacement between the nozzle head and measured surface). The purpose of the analysis was {{to point out the}} impact on the metrological characteristics of the air gauge. In particular, attention was paid to the airflow through the measuring slot. Here, the complex phenomena take place, among others the supersonic areas and a “bubble ring,” which cause discontinuity and hysteresis in the static characteristic. On the other hand, the air stream expansion after the restriction (inlet nozzle) is observed in the measuring chamber. The point of the above discussion was to work out some recommendation on the nozzles geometry and the localization of the back-pressure measuring point in the chamber...|$|E

That is, those, obtained by period-doubling cascade, Devaney's and Li-Yorke chaos. Moreover, in <b>discussion</b> <b>form</b> we consider inheritance of intermittency, the double-scroll Chua's attractor and quasiperiodical motions as a possible skeleton of a chaotic attractor. To make our introduction of the paper more clear, {{we have to say}} that one may consider other various accompanying concepts of chaos such that a structure of the chaotic attractor, its fractal dimension, form of the bifurcation diagram, the spectra of Lyapunov exponents, etc. We make comparison of the main concept of our paper with Turing's morphogenesis and John von Neumann automata, considering that this may be not only formal one, but will give ideas for the chaos development in the morphogenesis of Turing and for self-replicating machines. To provide rigorous study of the subject, we introduce new definitions such as chaotic sets of functions, the generator and replicator of chaos, and precise description of ingredients for Devaney and Li-Yorke chaos in continuous dynamics. Appropriate simulations which illustrate the morphogenesis phenomenon are provided...|$|E

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Naval ship {{acquisition}} {{is widely}} {{thought to be}} too expensive, too long, too uncertain, and too risky. Throughout the ship development process, decision makers at all levels are afflicted by unreliable estimates and projections of cost, performance, schedule, and risk of competing alternatives. In this context, ''decision makers'' includes senior Navy leadership, program officers, and ship design managers, all of whom make decisions affecting the eventual product. How can estimates and projections of cost, performance, schedule, and risk be improved? To some extent, decision making {{in the face of}} uncertainty is an inescapable part of the development of naval warships due to their unrivaled complexity. This is especially true {{in the early stages of}} ship development. However, analysis indicates that the quality of cost, performance, schedule, and risk estimates could be substantially improved by actions addressing the root causes of poor estimates. This paper examines four root causes of poor cost, performance, schedule, and risk estimates and projections in the context of ship information development and flow. Eight solution vectors are identified that can provide higher quality estimates and projections earlier in the design process, reducing the uncertainties faced by decision makers, saving expensive engineering labor, and increasing assurance that the delivered ship will satisfy requirements. The relationship of particular solution vectors to the particular root causes is provided in tabular and <b>discussion</b> <b>form.</b> Acquisition Research Progra...|$|E

It is believed that {{the results of the study}} will contribute to the improvement of teacher training programs as it reveals to what extent the learning environments provided to pre-service teachers have constructivist qualities and to what extent these teachers are trained within a constructivist approach. In the study, besides employing a qualitative research method namely case study, the research design “Single Case with Embedded Units” was used. In order to maintain the reliability and validity of the study, data and methodological triangulation were performed. The research study took place in 2011 - 2012 fall term, in Pamukkale University Education Faculty Science Teaching Department.

40|$|A {{new survey}} coordinated by the French expert centres for rare {{pulmonary}} diseases investigated French pulmonologists' diagnostic and therapeutic practice for {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF) and explored changes since a previous survey in 2011 – 2012. From May 16 to August 30, 2014, 524 pulmonologists were contacted. Those following at least one patient with IPF were invited to complete a questionnaire administered by telephone or e-mail. 166 (31. 7 %) pulmonologists, 161 (97 %) of whom had participated to the first survey, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 46 % and 52 %, respectively, discussed the cases with radiologists and pathologists. Out of 144 pulmonologists practicing outside of expert centres, 80 % indicated referring patients to those centres. The 2013 French practical guidelines for IPF were known by 92 % of pulmonologists involved in IPF, 96 % of whom considered them appropriate for practice.

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to study the {{decision}} making process {{and implementation of the}} principle of political participation and influence for Roma minority in Sweden. The results regarding the decision making process is structured through a discourse influenced policy analyses. Problem picture and recommended measures in the political documents representing the decision making process are analysed through theories of minority rights and equality. The implementation is seen through, by the author given minority discourse and the work in the roma council and analysed by the same theories already mentioned. The results show that regarding the decision process the aim of art. 15 in the framework convention is based on the idea of equality while the Swedish documents relates more to an idea of the right to speak for the group. Regarding recommended measures, the framework convention gives several recommendations on specific measures for political participation while the Swedish documents focuses on the general politics of the state. The results of the analyses of the implementation shows that those actors in the discourse, comparing the political participation for romas before and after the implementation of the minority policy creates a positive view of the principle, while those relating the principle to real influence in the political decision gives a more negative view of the implementation.

This paper presents Finnish experience in defining criteria for assessing the potential welfare impacts of a transport plan or policy. These criteria are to be used co-operatively by the planners and decision-makers. An important issue is the link between the formation of the objectives and the actual evaluation of impacts, as well as the underlying values and views that influence the selection of planning methods and practises. The criteria were drafted based on a literature review and preliminary discussions with national transport authorities. The preliminary criteria were selected and put into order by using the multi-criteria method MACBETH. The process involved active co-operation with the national transport authorities, as well as with other interest groups. The draft criteria were prioritised based on the opinions of selected representatives of national and regional authorities and transport planners. In this paper we focus on the priorisation process of the criteria, as well as discuss the validity and usability of the criteria created. Furthermore, the suitability of multi-criteria analysis in the context of regional transport planning is discussed, in addition to the consistency requirements between the criteria and the multi-criteria model. The criteria have been created in an ongoing Finnish study that aims at supporting regional transport planning, concerning the impacts that changes in the {{transport system}} may have on the welfare of the communities and individuals.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the construction and}} poetics of time in Anglo-Saxon literature through a holistic approach to works of history, science, exegesis, and poetry. St Augustine conceived of time as distentio animi, the distention of the mind, and the thesis argues that the texts under <b>discussion</b> <b>form</b> responses {{to the problems of}} being in time, by looking to the stillness of eternity. Chapter one demonstrates how the scientific, historical, and exegetical works of the Venerable Bede form a sustained project to construct time. In the conversion of King Edwin in the Historia Ecclesiastica, the famous flight of the sparrow in the hall emphasises the meaning that Christian time gives to both individuals and communities. Bede’s works both lay the foundation for the poetry of the later chapters and are texts worth studying in their own right. The second chapter investigates two Old English saints’ lives. Elene affects historicity by beginning with a precise date, though incorrect. The duration of the narrative of Andreas comes to a biblically significant forty days. Through study of the likely sources of these poems, {{it can be seen that}} the poets made deliberate choices to construct time in their narratives. The poetics of time in these two works suggests that the two are alike both as saints’ lives and in their approaches to time. Temporal markers within Beowulf provide clues to when certain events take place, as the third chapter discusses. The diurnal cycle that structures Beowulf on the micro level continues to the macro, and the poem as a whole depicts the day and the night of Beowulf’s life. The poem also engages in the elegiac mode, defined in chapter four as one in which time is largely unmarked, causing instability. The speakers of the Old English elegies are trapped in the present while their minds experience the distension described by Augustine; they recall memories of the past but to do so is painful. For some, time can come to seem ‘as if it never were’...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to prove that neither 1 Peter 3 : 19 nor 1 Peter 4 : 6 refers to the Christian {{doctrine}} the ‘Descensus Christi ad Inferos’. The meaning of these two verses has long been debated (cf. Dalton 1989 : 27 - 28), and is very often seen as a reference to Christ’s descent into Hades (cf. Feinberg 1986 : 309). This study will be done by means of a parallel study. The first part of this study will involve the doctrine of the ‘Descensus’; looking at its origin and its development. It will be argued in this section that the roots of this doctrine can be found in Jewish-Christianity and not pagan mythology as has been suggested (cf. Bousset 1907 : 224 ff&Beare 1945 : 145). The discussion of the doctrine is necessary, since we do need to know more about the doctrine to see whether it is the referent in 1 Peter. The second part of the study will then engage in the meaning of 1 Peter 3 : 19 and 4 : 6. This section will be very context driven. We will start with an introduction to 1 Peter, discussing all the preliminary questions (i. e. author, date, audience&form). This will be followed by a structural analysis of 1 Peter. Here it will be argued that the letter should be understood in terms of metaphors, with the ‘Diaspora’ as the controlling metaphor (cf. Martin 1992). The verses under <b>discussion,</b> <b>form</b> part of the third metaphor-cluster namely the ‘Sufferers of the Dispersion’, while the name of our subsection is’ The Righteous Sufferer’. By means of the grammatical analysis, and the influence of the pseudepigraphal book 1 Enoch, it will be shown that these verses do not allow themselves to be interpreted as references to the Descent of Christ into Hades.

40|$|This {{research}} study {{focuses on the}} discourse of a community of student teachers and a peer tutor in an English language teaching teacher education programme. The chief aims {{of this study are}} (1) to examine the features of the discourse in online and face-to-face modes of communication, (2) to investigate the community practices, and extrapolate how the student teachers and the peer tutor build and maintain their community, and (3) to elucidate what roles the modes of communication play in shaping the discourse from this context. Discussions were held between participants in face-to-face settings and via computer-mediated communication (chatroom, <b>discussion</b> <b>form</b> and blog interactions), and these are analysed from a corpus-based discourse analysis perspective. Due to the lack of corpus-based studies on computer-mediated discussions, this research is unique in its treatment of the data, with both quantitative and qualitative corpus-based analyses utilised. Moreover, the student teachers’ attitudes and reactions to the study are provided through questionnaire, interview and e-mail data to strengthen the findings. This data thus offers a valuable insight into the discourse between this specific community, and the student teachers’ personal feelings towards the use of face-to-face and online interactions during their course of study. Findings emerging from the corpus, namely the Teacher Education Corpus of Student Teacher and Peer Tutor Interactions (TEC-SPI), suggest that the discourse between the student teachers has a number of functions, namely narrative, cognitive, affective, and evaluative. Through such functions, the student teachers are forming and representing their identities, and appear to show some evidence of growth and identification with the professional teaching community over time. Moreover, the student teachers and the peer tutor are very much aware of maintaining co-operative interactions, where politeness, face-saving strategies, and relationship building are evident throughout the data. Both online and face-to-face interactions have distinct affordances for the student teachers, and indeed the benefits of such forms of communication are recognised by them. Findings such as these can assist the language teacher education arena in obtaining {{a better understanding of the}} processes student teachers undergo in their learning to become teachers, but also of the various modes of communication now at our disposal, which may be exploited to inform future practices...|$|E

Since their publication in 1987, nearly sixty countries have adopted the ISO 9000 series of Standards including the United States, Canada, Japan, and members of the European Community. Since 1992, the ISO 9001 Standard, Quality Systems - Model for Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation, and Servicing, has been applied to the development of software. In the United States, ISO 9001 certification was originally viewed as a requirement for selling products in Europe. Today, however, organizations are seeing the need to invest in the improvement of quality to improve profitability. ^ This study explores the impact of ISO 9001 certification on United States software development organizations. By studying the ISO 9001 Standard, and how it is applied to software development, insight can be gained concerning its impact on software quality, customer satisfaction, development productivity and software process improvement. Therefore, this research serves as an exploration of the ISO 9001 Standard as a quality management system for the process of software development.

40|$|This {{research}} {{looks at}} the application of online teaching techniques and resources {{in the field of}} creative design education. Teaching creative design principles and delivering content around this topic is often viewed as being more suited to a hands-on, face-to-face style of delivery. Yet online techniques can be extremely effective in these creative fields. This paper describes the findings of a five year study, involving more than five hundred participants from various age groups, cultures and locations, and compares face-to-face teaching methods with online delivery of creative course materials. The study highlights {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each technique. Results from each method, including learning outcomes, student satisfaction and engagement clearly demonstrate that online techniques are highly effective in transferring knowledge and providing students with the skills needed for developing effective creative outcomes. Yet there are other more subtle advantages that are often overlooked, including the fact that participants in online groups had a tendency to be more daring in their work. The relative anonymity provided by online methods led to students taking greater risks with their creative works and overall achieving better creative outcomes. Risk taking and experimentation is an important element of creative learning and online methods show potential to improve this area. Although knowledge transfer and outcomes were more effective with online approaches, the level of student engagement and satisfaction was lower. Clearly the nature of face-to-face personal interaction was a preferable form of engagement for student participants. An interesting exception to this was for students who are normally more excluded in face-to-face interaction scenarios. These participants, often distanced due to language, culture or physical issues such as disabilities, performed significantly better in online groups and also reported higher levels of engagement and satisfaction. This project also developed and compared several different types of online resources and delivery. The use of more personalized online resources proved to be much more effective in terms of student engagement. With large group recorded lectures showing much lower engagement than the same information being presented in a personal <b>discussion</b> <b>form.</b> With online delivery of teaching materials becoming more widespread, the application of online teaching in creative fields is an important area for future development, this research has demonstrated the potential for online delivery in creative courses as well as defining some key principles in targeting these resources and developing effective content and delivery.

We are, of course, talking about the well-known Historia Salonitana and De administrando imperio (DAI) documents. The rst document was created around 1266 by the chronicler Thomas the Archde- acon from Split, while the second was created in the mid- 10 th century and is most commonly connected to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porp- hyrogenitus. Both, therefore, hold records of events which occurred several centuries before they were recorded in the aforementioned documents. It is un- certain, however, whether these writers had access to any other documents, or their writing was based solely on verbal communication and legends, as was still customary at the time. As per the title of this brief contribution, the topic at hand is the “archon” Porin who is stated as one of the causes of the events. Thomas’ Histo- ria Salonitana does not mention it at all, while the DAI mentions him in the 30 th chapter. It is widely accepted that part of the DAI was not a result of Porphyrogenitus’ editing, but inserted later by an unknown author. This is based on the observation that the style and literary character of that chapter is noticeably different because it is written in <b>discussion</b> <b>form.</b> Regardless of who the author is, historians claim that the data contained in this chapter is more accurate and more relevant for historical research than that referring to similar topics which are des- cribed in the 29 th and 31 st chapters of the DAI. Porin was introduced to the topic precisely {{at the time of the}} settlement and adoption of Chri- stianity which came after the war with the Francs. Similar events to these are also described in the 31 st chapter of the document (allegedly written by Porphyrogenitus), however, that chapter talks about Porga, rather than Porin. The sentence preceding the mention of Porga also mentions that the Croats settled during Porga’s father’s rule, whose name, unfortunately, was not recorded. Regardless of historians’ doubts about the rele- vance of all the claims in the 31 st chapter of the DAI, the fact that Porga’s name was recorded twice in the same section of the document increases the cre- dibility of the assumption. Other sources from the Early Middle Ages do not mention either of these two Croatian rulers, so historiography attempts to equalize them with Duke Borna (around 810 - 821 ?) who is also mentioned in the records of the Royal Frankish Annals. Broadly determined linguistic ru- les allow the transformation of the name Porga to Borna, while the lack of connection to Porin from the 30 th chapter is interpreted as a mistake in writing Porga’s name. Through discussion of the contents of the 30 th chapter of the DAI, historians have come to the conclusion that it merely retells the 29 th and 31 st chapters with the addition of the text which could ful l certain needs in altered political requirements which Byzantium had for Croatia in the last quarter of the 10 th century. It is also assumed that the origin of some of the information found in the document could be from Croatian traditions. Historians have on numerous occasions pointed out that it is proba- ble and highly likely that Croatian national tradition distorted the main point of earlier events. The order and interpretation of certain epochs, as described in these events, emphasize a more important event which had signi cantly occupied the interests of the nation. This is especially true regarding claims re- corded in the DAI. Considering these circumstances, this document brings about a new and very different assumption which signi es that Porin was not the rst Croatian duke, as Croatian historiography interprets the in- formation from the DAI. He could have been a part of the mythological narration and tradition which in the 10 th century referred to its supreme God – the 31 st chapter speci cally con rms him as “God of the Croats” – whom the Croats worshipped until the conversion to Christianity in Dalmatia in the be- ginning of the 9 th century – and, possibly, a decade or more after the adoption of Christianity. The form of this “ruler’s” name is very similar to the form of the name of the supreme Slavic God – Perun. Similarly, the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani from the beginning of the 9 th century men- tions in its First chapter that the Lombards have fo- und salvation in baptism after their arrival in Italy. The Third chapter of the same document states that one of the stations during migration, before the- ir arrival to the Apennine Peninsula, was also the colonization of Rugiland in Podunavlje after the Goths had, in alliance with the Alemanni, defeated the native Rugilandians and taken them as slaves to Italy. The same chapter further notes that the eva- cuated space was later occupied by the Lombards who lived there for a long time and established the- ir religion. Since the aforementioned document was created during the rule of the Carolingian Empire, it is very likely that that religion was not Christianity (which would surely be mentioned), but their old “pagan” religion which they practiced since ancient times. The continuation of that record is also interesting because it states that the rst “rulers” in that new homeland were Godin and Peron, followed by Klafon. Claffo (around 495 - 505 ?) was known from other sources, but about Godin and Peron we only know from the mentioned record in the Gothic Code. Since those names are placed immediately adjacent to the information about their ancient reli- gion and since they sound exactly like the Germanic Odin and the Slavic Perun, the question is does this refer to terrestrial or celestial rulers? Any mention of the Nordic Odin and Slavic Perun in the same context seems peculiar because they are infused with old, pre-Christian beliefs of various peoples; however, it is not improbable because during their migrations the Lombards have lived near Slavs for centuries in various regions of Europe, sometimes with very good relations. Therefore, based on the mention of Peron (Pe- run) in the Gothic Code, it seems that the assump- tion that Porin from the 30 th chapter of the DAI also refers to mythological narration, similar to the Lombard, is not too bold. The narration would mean that Perun as the celestial ruler, similar to the Lombard deities, “protected” the Croats in their migration from the North to the South during the end of the 8 th century. Subsequently, in the intricate manner of carrying on tradition this supreme deity was transformed into a ruling “dynasty”. From that standpoint, a new meaning is given to the detail in the recorded narration which states that precisely during his time in their new homeland, the Croats abandoned their ancient religion and adopted Christianity. So we assume that Porin is actually the ce- lestial ruler Perun whose name the author of the 30 th chapter of the DAI recorded in a subtly different way and in a different function than that described in original tradition. Therefore, it is assumed that Perun – the god of ancient Slavic and Croat religion became Porin – the first duke of the Croats in their new homeland...|$|E
