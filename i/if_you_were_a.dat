25|$|Women’s {{participation}} on {{the home}} front was essential to the war effort. Leading into the Second World War, the ‘breadwinner model’ indicated that married women belonged in the home, with men working. Men were supposed to work and play in the public domain with the private realm supposedly being the domain of women. The outbreak of World War II forced society to rethink women’s role outside of the home. The largest contribution by the majority of Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, through their domestic abilities and skills; women were able to support the nation and the war effort. The government called upon women to participate in volunteer programs. Women began collecting recycled items such as paper, metal, fat, bones, rags, rubber, and glass. Clothing was also collected by Canadian women for free distribution overseas. They also prepared care packages to send to the men and women overseas. Canadian women were responsible for maintaining the morale of the nation. All over Canada, women responded to demands made upon them by not only selling war savings stamps and certificates but purchasing them as well, and collecting money to by bombers and mobile canteens. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> young unattached woman in 1939, the war offered unprecedented opportunities {{on the home}} front. Young women were given a chance to move away from home, go to parties and dances in the name of patriotic duty.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes coached at Harrow School until 1936. Cricket {{was very}} {{important}} to the school, and they were following the lead of Eton College who had appointed George Hirst as their coach. However, Rhodes's personality and generally critical nature did not communicate well with privileged schoolboys who were accustomed to getting their own way, and he was eventually replaced with the more genial and sympathetic Middlesex professional Patsy Hendren. This was in contrast to the success Hirst enjoyed at Eton. According to Bowes, Rhodes had vast technical knowledge, but unlike Hirst {{did not know how to}} get the best out of people. [...] " [...] could not relate to beginners. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> Test match player looking to get advice, Wilfred was superb." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} pre-dating Batmans release in June 1989, a popular culture {{phenomenon}} rose known as [...] "Batmania". Over $750 {{million worth of}} merchandise was sold. Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered: [...] "That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> comic book fan it was pretty hot." [...] Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, Batman written by Craig Shaw Gardner. It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989. Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed [...] "it is less movie than a corporate behemoth".|$|E

It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way. In disheveled jeans and floral frocks, he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out, and set the ball in motion for a radical, millennial idea of androgyny." [...] Cobain's way of dressing [...] "was {{the antithesis of the}} macho American man", because he [...] "...made it cooler to look slouchy and loose, no matter <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> boy or a girl." [...] Music and culture writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd wrote that with Cobain's style of dress “Not only did he make it okay to be a freak, he made it desirable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} {{an homage to}} the film The Jazz Singer, about a son with a strict {{religious}} upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer.

[...] Lisa tells Homer {{that there are many}} Jewish entertainers, including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner and Mel Brooks, the latter of which shocks Homer. In Krusty's flashback, he and his father walk down the street in a parody of a scene from The Godfather Part II. In the Simpsons house, Krusty plays The Concert for Bangladesh. In Krusty's studio, there are pictures of him with Alfred Hitchcock and The Beatles. At the end of the episode, Krusty and his father sing [...] "O Mein Papa", a 1952 song originally by Eddie Fisher. Bart quotes a passage from Sammy Davis, Jr.'s 1965 autobiography Yes, I Can.|$|E
500|$|Nicole Perlman, who was {{enrolled}} in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009, was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on. Out of those, Perlman chose Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's Guardians of the Galaxy, due to her interest in space and science fiction, adding, [...] "I think [...] were a little taken aback when I chose Guardians, because there were ones {{that would make a}} lot more sense <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> romantic-comedy writer or something like that." [...] Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the Guardians universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in in early 2012 to contribute to the script. Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because [...] "it didn’t work" [...] for him; he would use the film The Dirty Dozen as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel. Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no Walkman; he stated, [...] "In Nicole’s script everything is pretty different... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the WGA works. They like first writers an awful lot." [...] In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script, however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.|$|E

They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.'

2500|$|The Jazz Singer was parodied {{as early}} as 1936, in the Warner Bros. cartoon I Love to Singa, {{directed}} by Tex Avery. Its hero is [...] "Owl Jolson", a young owl who croons popular ditties, such as the title song, against the wishes of his father, a classical music teacher. Among the many references to The Jazz Singer in popular culture, perhaps the most notable {{is that of the}} classic MGM musical Singin' in the Rain (1952). The story, set in 1927, revolves around efforts to change a silent film production, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talking picture in response to The Jazz Singers success. The plot of the Simpsons episode [...] "Like Father, Like Clown" [...] (1991) parallels the tale of Jakie Rabinowitz/Jack Robin.

[...] One of the most widespread memes was noted by The Washington Post and New York magazine who observed a proliferation of over-the-top and fake tributes to Harambe. [...] "The idea is, the more intense and more sincere-seeming the expression of mourning is, the funnier the joke." [...] For example, the [...] "Dicks out for Harambe" [...] meme {{can be seen as}} a fake tribute to an incident that would normally engender sincere mourning. As Aja Romano of Vox wrote, [...] "If you were a progressive, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock what you viewed as the hypocritical haranguing of the mainstream while avoiding real issues of social justice; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> conservative, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock liberal hysteria." [...] One meme is a play on conspiracy theories, such as [...] "Bush did Harambe", a reference to the 9/11 conspiracy theories. In Australia, people joked about supporting Harambe's corpse as a write-in candidate on the ballot for the federal election. Public Policy Polling included Harambe in their polling for the U.S. presidential election.
