40|$|Modern aircrafts are {{becoming}} lighter and more flexible to meet fuel efficiency, endurance and other requirements. The structural modes therefore occur at lower frequencies {{and there is}} an increased coupling between the structural and rigid body modes. A general approach is to design control laws for the rigid body modes and then apply filters which avoid the excitation of the structural modes. However this approach is not possible in lighter and more flexible aircrafts, due to the coupling of the structural and rigid body modes. In this report several control methods are developed to prevent a flexible wing aircraft from fluttering. State space models with a flight envelope ranging from 40 Knots <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Speed</b> (KEAS) to 90 KEAS are used. The models consist of 182 states, 8 inputs and 13 outputs. The models are reduced using various model reduction steps like truncation, (modal) residualization and balanced truncation. After this model reduction different control techniques, namely Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, Linear Parameter Varying control and L 1 Adaptive control, are investigated using different examples and applied on the flexible wing aircraft...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{discharge}} plasma {{was used}} to activate air to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for promoting the oxidation of ammonium sulfite by air forced oxidation method. The effect of applied voltage and the <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> in discharge reactor on the generation of ozone {{as well as the}} oxidation kinetic of ammonium sulfite were analyzed and discussed. The ozone concentration increased with the discharge voltage, but decreased with the <b>air</b> <b>speed,</b> and a maximum mass of generated ozone was obtained at <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> of 15 m/s. Compared with air forced oxidation, the oxidation kinetic constant of ammonium sulfite by ROS injection had an increase by 2. 67 -fold, and the oxidation of ammonium sulfite followed a pseudo zero order kinetics. An increase in <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> accelerated the oxidation of ammonium sulfite, and the oxidation kinetic constant of ammonium sulfite was increased by 5 -fold when the <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> increased by 2 -fold...|$|R

Simulations show that the output air temperature remains constant while the solar chimney&# 8217;s width is the most significant factor influencing output <b>air</b> <b>speed.</b> The solar chimney&# 8217;s inlet position has limited influence on the output <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> although regions near the solar chimney&# 8217;s inlet show an increase in <b>air</b> <b>speed.</b> Furthermore, a regression model is developed based on the solar chimney&# 8217;s stack height, depth and width to predict the interior <b>air</b> <b>speed.</b> To optimize solar chimney in the tropics, the recommendation is to first maximize its width as the interior&# 8217;s width, while allowing its stack height to be the building&# 8217;s height.

40|$|For {{the design}} of {{naturally}} ventilated buildings, information of <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at the openings of a building is important. However, the only data set usually available to designers is meteorological data, such as wind speed and direction measured at weather stations. This paper explores the ratio of <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at building openings to the wind speed measured at weather stations. Meteorological data from three weather stations as well as air velocity that was obtained through full-scale physical measurements were used in this study. The results showed that <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at building openings was {{about half of the}} wind speed recorded at the closest station to the case study. This ratio reduced to approximately 30 % when comparing to the weather stations located in greater distance and more open areas. Given that <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at the openings has a direct relation to the ventilation rate, employing these ratios to the available weather data when designing for natural ventilation, can provide more realistic picture of natural ventilation performance...|$|R
