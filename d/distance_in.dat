5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M.

Foucault could not increase the RM <b>distance</b> <b>in</b> his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
