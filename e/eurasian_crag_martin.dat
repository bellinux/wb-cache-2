5|$|The small, pale {{northern}} subspecies of {{crag martin}} {{found in the}} mountains of North Africa and the Arabian peninsula is now usually split as the pale crag martin, Ptyonoprogne obsoleta. The remaining birds are now identified as <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b>|$|E
5|$|This small martin's {{flight is}} {{typically}} slow and leisurely, {{but it is}} capable of considerable speed when required. The calls {{are similar to those of}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> and include a soft chi, chi contact call and a twittering song.|$|E
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand martins of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> may be hunted by fast, agile {{birds of}} prey such as the African hobby or Eurasian hobby that specialise in {{catching}} swallows and martins in flight, and by other falcons such as the peregrine and Taita falcons. Crows may attack migrating <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martins,</b> and that species also treats common kestrels, Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens as predators if they approach the nesting cliffs. The dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> has been recorded in the diet of the greater false vampire bat, Megaderma lyra.|$|R
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering <b>Eurasian</b> hobby. Pale <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crag</b> <b>martins</b> breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges. The typical altitude is 2,000 - 2,700 m but breeding occurs up to 5,000 m in Central Asia. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> martin's choice of nest sites {{is very similar}} to that of Savi's pipistrelle, Hypsugo savii; the bird and the bat often breed in the same locations and have almost identical ranges in Europe. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings.|$|R
5|$|The pale crag martin's {{flight is}} slow, with rapid wing beats {{interspersed}} with flat-winged glides, {{and it is}} more acrobatic than the larger <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b> It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a trrt resembling {{the call of the}} common house martin, a nasal vick, and a high pitched twee contact call.|$|E
5|$|These are {{exclusively}} Old World species. The {{rock martin}} breeds throughout Africa {{and through the}} Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan, and is replaced by the dusky crag martin further east in India and Indochina. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> breeds from Iberia and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe, the Persian Gulf and the Himalayas to southwestern and northeastern China. Northern populations of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> are migratory, with European birds wintering in north Africa, Senegal, Ethiopia and the Nile Valley, and Asian breeders going to southern China, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean, and, like populations in warmer areas such as India, Turkey and Cyprus, just move to lower ground after breeding. The dusky crag martin and rock are largely resident apart from local movements after breeding, when many birds descend to lower altitudes, although some pale northern rock martins from North African and southern Arabian may winter further south alongside the local subspecies in Ethiopia, Mali and Mauritania.|$|E
5|$|The crag martins mainly breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges, and the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> reaches 5,000m (16,500ft) in Central Asia. The use of buildings as artificial cliffs has enabled breeding expansion into lowland areas, {{particularly for the}} two tropical species, and the rock martin breeds in desert towns. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings in winter.|$|E
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
500|$|<b>Crag</b> <b>martins</b> may host parasites, {{including}} blood-sucking mites of {{the genus}} Dermanyssus such as D. chelidonis, and the nasal mite Ptilonyssus ptyonoprognes. Invertebrate species first found in nests of <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> species include the tick Argas (A.) africolumbae from a rock martin nest [...] and the fly Ornithomya rupes and the flea Ceratophyllus nanshanensis from European <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> nests.|$|R
5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means {{that it is not}} known whether the two closely related martins could hybridise, which would cast doubts as to whether they were distinct species. Dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), {{but it is not clear}} that the difference is greater than that between individual martins of the nominate subspecies.|$|R
5|$|The clutch is {{two to five}} {{eggs that}} are white with brownish, ruddy or grey blotches {{particularly}} at the wide end. The egg size ranges from an average 20.2x14.0mm (0.80x0.55in) with a weight of 2.08g (0.073oz) for the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> to 17.7x13.0mm (0.70x0.51in) with a weight of 1.57g (0.06oz) for the dusky crag martin. Both adults incubate the eggs for 13–19 days to hatching, and feed the chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24–27 days later. The fledged young continue to be fed by the parents for some time after they can fly.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E
5|$|The crag martins {{are four}} species of small {{passerine}} {{birds in the}} genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family. They are the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> (P.rupestris), the pale crag martin (P.obsoleta), the rock martin (P.fuligula) and the dusky crag martin (P.concolor). They {{are closely related to}} each other, and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species. They are closely related to the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities. These are small swallows with brown upperparts, paler underparts without a breast band, and a square tail with white patches. They can be distinguished from each other on size, the colour shade of the upperparts and underparts, and minor plumage details like throat colour. They resemble the sand martin, but are darker below, and lack a breast band.|$|E

5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b> The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There do not appear to be any intermediate forms where pale <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|R

5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo, and is {{sometimes}} included within it since the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resemble those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow. However, a DNA analysis showed that if Hirundo is enlarged to contain the crag martins, it should include all the mud-builder genera. Conversely, if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off. The pale crag martin's nearest relatives are {{the other members of the}} genus, the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia, the rock martin P. fuligula of Southern Africa, and the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> P. rupestris.|$|E
5|$|These martins are 12–15cm (4.7–5.9in) {{long with}} drab brown or grey plumage {{and a short}} square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and {{outermost}} pairs of feathers. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are similar, but juveniles show pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The species differ in plumage shades and size, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> being significantly larger than the others. The flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged glides. The songs of these birds are simple twitterings, and contact calls include a high-pitched twee or chi, chi, and a tshir or trrt call {{like that of the}} house martin.|$|E
5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks where food is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a negative correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E

50|$|Geyr von Schweppenburg named some {{subspecies}} of birds, {{including the}} pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> subspecies Ptyonoprogne obsoleta spatzi.|$|R
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> has a {{very large}} range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} is much drabber than most African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, the pale crag martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated sand martin also makes identification more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} breeds in {{suitable}} habitats throughout northern Africa {{and through the}} Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding. In addition, there is some short-range movement, including martins from southern Arabia crossing the Red Sea and wintering alongside the local breeding birds in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, and non-breeding P. f. spatzi and P. f. presaharica joining rock martins in Mali and Mauritania. In Pakistan, the breeding range of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta overlaps {{with that of the}} dusky crag martin, although that species breeds at much lower levels, and in North Africa P. f. obsoleta occupies desert habitats whilst the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is found in the mountains. The pale crag martin has been recorded as a vagrant in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Sri Lanka, although its occurrence in the last country is treated as unproven in a 2011 field guide. The martin has been claimed to visit Turkey, but this is also disputed.|$|E
5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
