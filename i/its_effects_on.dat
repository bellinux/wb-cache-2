5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1956, initial {{designs were}} {{presented}} by the two companies. Zip fuel was {{to be used in}} the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel. Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance planform known.

Some reviewers felt it was too similar to Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaborations.|$|E
5|$|Before Chataan {{affected}} Guam, officials canceled U.S. Independence Day festivities, {{and residents}} purchased storm supplies. Although {{the center of}} the eye did not strike Guam, the eyewall affected the entire island with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120km/h (75mph), with gusts to 167km/h (104mph) at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts were slightly higher at Apra Harbor, peaking at 170km/h (106mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200km/h (125mph). Similar to <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 536mm (21.1in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311mm (12.2in) in about three hours. The Weather Forecast Office on the island reported 265mm (10.4in) in a 24-hour period. The rains were less than 250mm (10in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed. While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant storm surge that peaked at about 3.6m (12ft) in Umatac.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E

5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism and <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature {{is of paramount importance}} because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E

All charges against the Enterprise crew are dropped, save one for insubordination: for disobeying a superior officer, Kirk is demoted from Admiral back to the rank of Captain where he is returned to command of a starship. The crew departs on their ship, the newly christened USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), and leaves on a new mission.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood}} of dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; and <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the bike, the rider, and safety. An {{important factor in}} any vibration analysis is {{a comparison of the}} natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
