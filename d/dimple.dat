5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a <b>dimple,</b> something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether <b>dimples</b> on a heat sink fin can increase heat transfer for laminar airflows. This was accomplished by performing experimental studies using {{two different types of}} dimples: 1) circular (spherical) <b>dimples,</b> and 2) oval (elliptical) <b>dimples.</b> <b>Dimples</b> were placed on both sides of a aluminium plate with a relative pitch of S/D= 1. 21 and relative depth of δ/D= 0. 16 (e. g., circular <b>dimples).</b> For oval <b>dimples,</b> similar ratios with the same total depth and circular-edge-to-edge distance as the circular <b>dimples</b> were used. For those configurations the average heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, thermal performance and Nusselt number ratio were determined experimentally. For circular and oval <b>dimples,</b> heat transfer enhancements (relative to a flat plate) were observed for Reynolds number range from 600 to 2000 (Reynolds number based on channel height). Also the results are validated analytically for Nusselt number and friction factor for plain vertical plate. This experiment was undertaken to provide the needed experimental data that fill the gap for the use of <b>dimples</b> for laminar flow conditions. Specifically, this {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine whether or not}} the use of <b>dimples</b> can enhance heat transfer characteristics for heat sink applications. <b>Dimples</b> enhanced heat transfer from its surface for laminar air flows while the pressure drop was equivalent or smaller than that of the flat surface.

40|$|The <b>dimpling</b> {{process is}} a novel cold-roll forming process that can enhance the steel {{material}} and structural performance by plastically deforming the material surface prior to the section forming operation [1]. Owing to the complex and interrelated nonlinear changes in contact, geometry and material properties {{that occur in the}} process and section forming, there have been no existing methods to simulate the process and resultant <b>dimpled</b> products and validate through physical measurements. This paper describes a numerical modelling approach and results into the mechanical properties and structural behaviour of cold-formed <b>dimpled</b> steel. A series of mechanical tests including tensile, plate bending and column compression tests on cold-formed plain and <b>dimpled</b> steel material were conducted for evaluation of numerical results. A finite element approach to practically simulate the <b>dimpling</b> process and experimental tests was presented. True stress–strain data obtained from tests were incorporated into nonlinear simulations of <b>dimpled</b> steel sheets and sections. The simulation of the <b>dimpling</b> process revealed that during the process, various levels of plastic strain are developed throughout the thickness of the steel sheet; this could correlate to the increase in the strength of the <b>dimpled</b> steel as observed in experimental tests and simulations. The simulation of the mechanical tests of <b>dimpled</b> specimens predicted similar results to the experiments, in terms of mechanical properties and structural behaviour.

5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss <b>Dimple,</b> and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Jackson's facial {{structure}} {{changed as}} well. Surgeons speculated {{he also had}} a rhinoplasty, a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a cleft put in his chin. Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981. Katherine Jackson, though, has {{said in a recent interview}} that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin. Taraborrelli stated Jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, {{he also had a}} <b>dimple</b> created in his chin. From 1986 onward he was a regular client of Arnold Klein, a dermatologist who specializes in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.|$|E

She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and <b>Dimple</b> Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dimpled</b> steel {{products}} are produced from {{the combination of}} an innovative <b>dimpling</b> process and a traditional forming process such as cold-roll forming or press-braking. The wider use of cold-formed <b>dimpled</b> steel members has promoted considerable interest in the local instability and strength of these members. Of particular interest is their buckling behaviour and ultimate strength capacity in columns under compressive loading. However, the <b>dimpling</b> process produces cold-formed sections with a complex ‘dimpled’ surface topography and the ‘dimpled’ material is non-uniformly work hardened through the entire thickness. Owing to these complex issues, there are no existing analytical and design methods to calculate the buckling strength of <b>dimpled</b> products and validate against physical measurements. This paper presents {{the analysis of the}} compressive behaviour of cold-formed channel and lipped channel <b>dimpled</b> steel columns using Finite Element techniques. True stress–strain data obtained from physical tests were incorporated into nonlinear simulations of <b>dimpled</b> steel columns.

Based on the validated Finite Element results for different geometries, standard design formulae for determining buckling and ultimate loads of channel and lipped channel <b>dimpled</b> columns were developed.

Physical examination was unremarkable except for two symmetrical <b>dimples</b> with a depth of several millimetres at the acromion (fi gures 1 and 2).

5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will <b>dimple</b> inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E

A comparative study of modified airfoil models showing variance in lift and drag at different angle of attacks (AOA). The surface modifications are done here by considering the different types and shapes of <b>dimples.</b> <b>Dimples</b> help in reduction of pressure drag when airfoil attains some angle of attack because that time, wake formation starts due to boundary layer separation. Application of <b>dimples</b> on aircraft wing works in same manner as vortex generators.
