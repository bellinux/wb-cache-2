40|$|In {{this work}} the {{performance}} of a sugar cane chopped harvester was analysed when fed with two sugar cane mass flows, measuring the invisible losses, which are impossible to measure in the <b>field,</b> <b>harvester</b> sugar cane cleaning efficiency and air velocity on extractors exit. The trial was done under controlled conditions at Copersucar Technology Center in January 2000. The results showed that the flow of sugar cane through the harvester doesn't influence the magnitudes of total invisible losses and raw material cleaning efficiency. The mean air velocity on the primary extractors exit was 12. 0 m s - 1, and 9. 2 m s - 1 on the secondary extractor, with a coefficient of variation of 21 %, indicating that the poor cleaning performance of the harvester could be related to air velocity difference inside the extractor. Analyzing the data collected in the trials, it was possible to conclude that invisible losses in sugar cane harvester were 10 % and the cleaning efficiency was 87 %...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} {{the reliability of}} renewable energy production, the local environment variables have to be monitored closely, such as the chamber/nacelle temperature and humidity. In such harsh working conditions, acquiring auxiliary power for such sensor load can harm system reliability if the power is drawn directly from the supply or load lines. This paper proposes a non-intrusive power supply system for the sensor load by harvesting the near field magnetic power from the current enriched supply cables. The size and turn number of the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>harvester</b> coil is calculated and verified by the finite element model. A two stage power conditioning circuit is designed, consisting of a 4 X voltage multiplier followed by an energy feed-forward enabled buck converter. The prototype of the energy scavenger is implemented and tested on a current ripple enriched cable; the experimental {{results indicate that the}} scavenger can harvest more than 30 mW from the power cable with 10 kHz 7 A RMS ripple component...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of three sizes of alfalfa and time post-feeding on rumen contents and on particle size distribution of ruminal digesta. Three ruminally fistulated buffalo steers received a diet consisting just alfalfa that was harvested at 15 % of flowering and chopped in three sizes. Individual small rectangular bales were chopped with a forage <b>field</b> <b>harvester</b> for theoretical cut length 19 and 10 mm for preparation of long and medium particle size, also the fine particles were prepared by milling. The geometric means and its standard deviation were 8. 5, 5. 5 and 2. 5 mm; and 1. 24, 1. 16 and 1. 06 mm, in coarse, medium and fine, respectively. The experimental design was a repeated 3 × 3 Latin squares with 21 day periods. The diets were offered twice daily at 09 : 00 and 21 : 00 h at ad libitum level. The rumens were evacuated manually at 3, 7. 5 and 12 h post-feeding and total ruminal contents separated into mat and bailable liquids. Dry matter weight distribution of total recovered particles was determined by a wet-sieving procedure and used to partition ruminal mat and bailable liquids among percentages of large (≥ 4. 0 mm), medium (< 4. 0 mm and ≥ 1. 18 mm), and fine (< 1. 18 mm and ≥ 0. 05 mm) particles. Intake did not influence markedly the distribution of different particle fractions, whereas particle size and time post-feeding had a pronounced effect. With increasing time after feeding, percentage of large and medium particles significantly decreased, whereas the percentage of fine particles significantly increased. The ruminal digesta particle distributions illustrated intensive particle breakdown in the reticulo-rumen for coarse particle more than others. Dry matter contents and the proportion of particulate dry matter in the rumen increased as intake increased, i. e. ruminal mat increased at the expense of bailable liquids. It can be concluded that reduction of forage particle size for buffaloes at maintenance level, influences the structure of rumen contents, ruminal mat formation and consistency, ruminal pH, the mass of ruminal escapable and non escapable dry matter pool size...|$|E

Collecting these residues in a single-pass of the <b>harvester</b> across the <b>field</b> {{has the potential}} to be a low cost option. Two models have been developed; the first characterizes the in-field logistics of single-pass crop residue collection, the second the economics.

A variety of possible residue collection cases have been examined, and their effects both on <b>harvester</b> <b>field</b> capacity and harvest cost compared to grain-only harvest have been quantified. Systems where a harvester-towed wagon unloads collected residue directly at the field edge without any intermediary residue-hauling carts were generally the lowest cost.

The numbers of tractors, grain combines, corn pickers and picker shellers, pickup balers, and <b>field</b> forage <b>harvesters</b> peaked during the early 1960 s. The decline in their numbers after the 2 ̆ 760 s is brought about mainly by the qualitative changes in those machines. The total tractor horsepower on farms also increased over the period 1963 - 79. Analysis of measures such as acres per horsepower, number of tractors and combines per farm, and acres per tractor and combine indicates that the intensity of machinery-use has increased {{over the last four}} decades. The productivity of machinery input in agricultural production has also increased;Based on the various investment theories, the alternative models of stock adjustment, expectations, and derived demand type are estimated for tractor and other machinery investments at the national and regional levels using 1950 - 77 annual data. Investment demand functions for harvesting machinery are estimated at the national level. Statistical tests for structural change in the machinery investments are performed. The demand elasticities with respect to prices, income and other economic variables are calculated. In general, the other machinery demand is the most elastic and the harvesting machinery demand is the least elastic with respect to their own prices. Harvesting machinery may have a higher priority in the annual machinery purchases of farmers and hence a lower elasticity of demand. In general, the tractor demand elasticity with respect to its own price as well as aggregate crop price is increasing from west to east;Dynamic multipliers expressing the long-lasting effects of the interest rates, price of fuel and oil, and net farm income are calculated for selected machinery investments. The impact and long-term multipliers are also presented;Finally, a block recursive simulation model of the regional farm machinery investments is developed.

40|$|Magnetoelectric multiferroics (ME MFs) exhibit both {{magnetic}} and ferroelectric {{orders and}} show coupling {{between the two}} order parameters. These materials have potential for their applications in magnetic <b>field</b> sensors, energy <b>harvesters,</b> and novel spintronic devices. For these applications, ME MFs with strong ME coupling at room temperature are needed. However at present there are no suitable single phase materials for these applications. This dissertation uses the versatility of wet chemistry sol-gel based synthesis methods to explore two methods of improving the ME coupling and furthering {{the understanding of the}} operating mechanisms. Historically, single phase ME MFs have weak ME coupling at room temperature. Composites of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials achieve ME coupling through strain transfer between the phases. The first pathway toward technologically applicable ME MFs pursued in this dissertation is to develop novel synthesis methods of composites of PbZr 0. 52 Ti 0. 48 O 3 and CoFe 2 O 4 that optimize the nanoscale phase distribution and avoid parasitic effects like leakage current to maximize the ME coupling. The discovery of magnetically driven ferroelectricity has renewed interest in single phase ME MFs for spintronic applications. The rare-earth chromites, such as DyCrO 3, are good candidates for magnetically driven ferroelectricity at much higher temperatures (~ 150 K for DyCrO 3), than other similar materials. Utilizing the versatility of the sol-gel based synthesis to study the effects of chemical substitutions, the fundamental understanding of the magnetic order and magnetic exchange interactions and how they relate to the electronic properties has been enhanced. These substitutions are shown to cause novel magnetic properties, such as single phase exchange bias, which facilitates novel functionalities. The work in this dissertation improves the ME coupling and understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms in MF MFs to enable future device applications...|$|R
