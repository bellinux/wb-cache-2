2500|$|Rotoreliefs {{were the}} next phase of Duchamp's {{spinning}} works. To make the optical [...] "play toys", he painted designs on <b>flat</b> <b>cardboard</b> circles and spun them on a phonographic turntable. When spinning, the flat disks appeared three-dimensional. He had a printer produce 500 sets of six of the designs, and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them. The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists thought they might be of use in restoring three-dimensional stereoscopic sight to people who have lost vision in one eye. In collaboration with Man Ray and Marc Allégret, Duchamp filmed early versions of the Rotoreliefs and they named the film Anémic Cinéma (1926). Later, in Alexander Calder's studio in 1931, while looking at the sculptor's kinetic works, Duchamp suggested that these should be called [...] "mobiles". Calder agreed to use this novel term in his upcoming show. To this day, sculptures of this type are called [...] "mobiles".|$|E

It {{was as if he had}} studied at the university himself, instead of being ill-equipped from browsing at haphazard through the books in the library.) [...] "But even the conventions must be real. Trees, painted on <b>flat</b> <b>cardboard</b> and stuck up on each side of the stage, we accept as a forest. It is a real enough convention. But, on the other hand, we would not accept a sea scene as a forest. We can't do it. It violates our senses. Nor would you, or, rather, should you, accept the ravings and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics to-night as a convincing portrayal of love." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Peters {{came back}} {{this morning and}} said that he had got work for Uncle William. So I was delighted. He said that Uncle will make a first class [...] "street man," [...] and that he has {{arranged}} for a line of goods for him and that he has a [...] "territory" [...] that Uncle can occupy. He showed me a <b>flat</b> <b>cardboard</b> box filled with lead pencils and shoe-strings and little badges and buttons with inscriptions on them, and he says these are what is called a [...] "line," [...] and that Uncle can take out this line and do splendidly. I don't quite understand yet who makes the appointment to be a street man or what influence it takes or what it means to have a territory, but Mr. Peters explained that there is a man who is retiring from being a street man and that Uncle can take his place and can have both sides of the Bowery, which sounds very pretty indeed.|$|E

Milk caps are typically <b>flat</b> circular <b>cardboard</b> discs which are decorated with images on one or both sides. Traditional (or traditional-style) milk caps are made of rougher cardboard, are printed with limited colors, and often have a staple in them (as they appeared when used as actual POG bottlecaps), while modern commercial pogs were stiffer, thicker and are often printed with colorful glossy imagery.|$|R

6000|$|Spades and sieves {{were from}} that moment {{forbidden}} utensils. However unpleasant the task might be, hands alone {{were used in the}} further examination of the mound. The first and foremost necessity was to place the morsels of paper (in <b>flat</b> <b>cardboard</b> boxes prepared for the purpose) in their order as they were found. Night came; the laborers were dismissed; Benjamin and his two colleagues worked on by lamplight. The morsels of paper were now turned up by dozens, instead of by ones and twos. For a while the search prospered in this way; and then the morsels appeared no more. Had they all been recovered? or would renewed hand-digging yield more yet? The next light layers of rubbish were carefully removed--and the grand discovery of the day followed. There (upside down) was the gum-bottle which the lodge-keeper's daughter had spoken of. And, more precious still, there, under it, were more fragments of written paper, all stuck together in a little lump, by the last drippings from the gum-bottle dropping upon them as they lay on the dust-heap! ...|$|E

Elgo/Halsam issued a 3rd version of these sets, the other difference was that this last version came with colored plastic windows (in amber, green and blue) and had more total pieces than the two earlier versions (they did have fewer roof/floor pieces however).American Skyline Construction Sets came with the following amount of parts: ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} the case that robotic systems require models, in order to {{successfully}} control themselves, and to interact with the world. Models take many forms and include kinematic models to plan motions, dynamics models to understand the interaction of forces, and models of 3 D geometry to check for collisions, to name but a few. Traditionally, models are provided to the robotic system by the designers that build the system. However, for long-term autonomy it becomes important for the robot to be able to build and maintain models of itself, and of objects it might encounter. In this thesis, the argument for enabling robotic systems to autonomously build models is advanced and explored. The main contribution of this research is to show how a layered approach can be taken to building models. Thus a robot, starting with a limited amount of information, can autonomously build a number of models, including a kinematic model, which describes the robot’s body, and allows it to plan and perform future movements. Key to the incremental, autonomous approach is the use of exploratory actions. These are actions that the robot can perform in order to gain some more information, either about itself, or about an object with which it is interacting. A method is then presented whereby a robot, after being powered on, can home its joints using just vision, i. e. traditional methods such as absolute encoders, or limit switches are not required. The ability to interact with objects in order to extract information {{is one of the main}} advantages that a robotic system has over a purely passive system, when attempting to learn about or build models of objects. In light of this, the next contribution of this research is to look beyond the robot’s body and to present methods with which a robot can autonomously build models of objects in the world around it. The first class of objects examined are <b>flat</b> pack <b>cardboard</b> boxes, a class of articulated objects with a number of interesting properties. It is shown how exploratory actions can be used to build a model of a <b>flat</b> pack <b>cardboard</b> box and to locate any hinges the box may have. Specifically, it is shown how when interacting with an object, a robot can combine haptic feedback from force sensors, with visual feedback from a camera to get more information from an object than would be possible using just a single sensor modality. The final contribution of this research is to present a series of exploratory actions for a robotic text reading system that allow text to be found and read from an object. The text reading system highlights how models of objects can take many forms, from a representation of their physical extents, to the text that is written on them...|$|R

5000|$|Peavey Electronics Corporation, {{developed}} a sub-harmonic generator, called KOSMOS, based on patent 7,171,002 that avoids <b>flat,</b> <b>cardboard</b> sounding characteristics common {{to this type}} of process. The KOSMOS system achieves this by modifying frequency components at least partially outside the sub-harmonic range, and using the amplitude envelope of the input signal (as a function of frequency components in the relevant frequency range) in producing the output signal. The KOSMOS system also increases stereo width characteristics created by signals from left and right channels and improves sound clarity above certain frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|Composed in 1947 for {{a segment}} of Hans Richter's surrealist film Dreams That Money Can Buy. The film {{contains}} several segments designed by different artists, and Cage's music was composed for a segment designed by Marcel Duchamp. The segment—a dream {{one of the characters}} is having—is titled [...] "Discs" [...] and consists mostly of Duchamp's rotoreliefs. These are designs painted on <b>flat</b> <b>cardboard</b> circles, which are to be spun on a phonographic turntable. The work was later choreographed by Merce Cunningham. The global structure is 11x11 (eleven sections of eleven bars each), the rhythmic proportion is 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1. Similarly to Tossed As It Is Untroubled and The Unavailable Memory of, the work mostly builds on a single melodic line, which uses notes muted by weather strippings. This piece {{is one of the first}} to explore the idea of silence systematically: empty bars are juxtaposed with melodic passages throughout the piece.|$|E
5000|$|CardTalk is an {{inexpensive}} cardboard phonograph for playing recordings, mainly voice, made on vinyl records. The name {{was used by}} Global recordings network, a Christian missionary movement which used the device from the 1960s to play religious talks in remote {{parts of the world}} that did not have electricity. It consists of a <b>flat</b> piece of <b>cardboard</b> creased and folded into a triangle. The base has a nub to hold the record in place. The upper [...] "arm" [...] forms the [...] "pointy" [...] part of the triangle and has a needle which is placed upon the record. The record is spun using a small pointed object like a pencil. The cardboard picks up the impressions on the record and vibrates loud enough to be heard causing the [...] "Card" [...] to [...] "Talk". Several cardboard phonograph playing devices were patented around the same period and these include Jauquet (1953) for a [...] "Pocket Speaking Device", J.S. Wiener's [...] "Sound Emitting Device" [...] (1967) and the [...] "Record Player" [...] of Max Meier-Maletz (1972).|$|R
5000|$|The first Subbuteo sets, {{known as}} the Assembly Outfits, {{consisted}} of goals made of wire with paper nets, a cellulose acetate ball, cardboard playing figures in two basic kits (red shirts with white shorts, and blue shirts with white shorts) and bases made from buttons weighed down with lead washers. The story is that Ray found one of his mother's coat buttons and used Woolworth buttons for the early set bases. No pitch was provided: instead, the purchaser was given {{instructions on how to}} mark out (with chalk, provided) a playing area on to a blanket (an old army blanket was recommended). The first sets were eventually available in March 1947, several months after the original advertisement appeared. The first figures were made of <b>flat</b> <b>cardboard</b> cut out of a long strip. Later these card players came in press-out strips before being replaced with two-dimensional celluloid figures, known to collectors as [...] "flats".|$|E

[...] In a negative review, Indie Gamer Ckick said [...] "This {{is one of the}} most clunky, cumbersome, awful interfaces I’ve ever seen. It’s like Life in the Dorms is overdosing from that slow-motion drug from Dredd. I just want to move the plot forward with as little resistance as possible. Yet every rinky dinky action requires Dack to turn and face the camera to address the situation, in what I can only guess is an attempt to break down the fourth wall. [...] " [...] Rating the game a 6 out of 10, ThisIsXbox summed up its review saying [...] "Life in the Dorms has its ups and downs. It has a pretty cool graphical style with sprites that sort of resemble Xbox LIVE Avatars. The storyline isn’t bad and most of the characters are unique rather than just <b>flat</b> <b>cardboard</b> cutouts. On the other hand, the game progresses at such a leisurely pace that if you aren’t already a fan of the point-and-click genre in general, you probably aren’t going to have much fun with this game. It doesn’t help things that the same background music just drones on and on and on the whole time." ...|$|E
