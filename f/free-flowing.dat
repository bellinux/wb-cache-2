5|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{junctions}} on the A303. These range from motorway-style <b>free-flowing</b> junctions such as that with the A36 near Wylye, to simple forks on the single carriageway sections. Some junctions, such as the Countess Roundabout with the A345 near Amesbury, are known congestion hotspots because they are insufficient to cope with traffic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Free-flow</b> {{speed is}} a {{parameter}} {{that is being}} used extensively for capacity and level-of- service analysis of various types of highway facilities. As part of an ongoing effort to revise Taiwan Area Highway Capacity Manual, this study collects and analyzes <b>free-flow</b> speed data at the midpoints of seventy-six multilane rural and suburban highway segments in Taiwan. The objectives of this study are to develop models for estimating average free-low speed and for identifying the distribution of individual <b>free-flow</b> speeds. The most important variables that govern <b>free-flow</b> speed are vehicle type, speed limit, and the spacing between signalized intersections. The resulting models facilitate both manual analysis and computer simulation of rural and suburban highways...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{traditional}} road investment model, with {{its focus on}} capacity and congestion as measures of capital and its utilization, to include <b>free-flow</b> speed as another dimension of capital. This has practical importance because one can view <b>free-flow</b> speed as a continuous proxy for road type (e. g. freeway, arterial, and urban street). We derive conditions for optimal investment in capacity and <b>free-flow</b> speed, and analyze the optimal balance between the two. We then estimate cost functions for capital and user costs and apply the resulting model using parameters representing large US urban areas. We show that providing high <b>free-flow</b> speed may be quite expensive, and there is sometimes a tradeoff between it and capacity. We find suggestive evidence that representative freeways in many large urban areas provide too high a <b>free-flow</b> speed relative to capacity, thus {{making the case for}} reexamination of typical design practice. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, especially {{on the north side of}} the main stem. Generally, the remaining <b>free-flowing</b> tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more <b>free-flowing</b> form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test, {{playing as}} an opening batsman, he struck 19 {{in the first}} innings. Australia's new post-war skipper Warwick Armstrong felt that Macartney would be more {{effective}} at number three, and in the second innings, he made a <b>free-flowing</b> 69 in a 111-run second-wicket stand with Herbie Collins as Australia went on to inflict a 377-run defeat. Macartney's return to form was interrupted by an illness, which caused him to miss the following three Test matches. After a two-month layoff, Macartney struck 130 in a match for his state against England.|$|E
40|$|A new <b>free-flow</b> {{electrophoresis}} microchip with integrated permeable membranes was developed, {{and different}} substances {{were separated by}} <b>free-flow</b> zone electrophoresis, <b>free-flow</b> isoelectric focusing and <b>free-flow</b> field step electrophoresis. This chip contained {{a new type of}} membranes enabling a stable carrier flow with a perpendicular electrical current. Due to this chip configuration, the device performance and efficiency were superior to recently published alternative systems in terms of separation resolution and sample capacity. The results furthermore indicate that even better results are possible. Analytes were separated and focused within hundreds of milliseconds whereby only nanoliters of samples were consumed. In addition, a new sample steering method was demonstrated during <b>free-flow</b> zone electrophoresis, allowing the specific sorting of various components. As an alternative, a <b>free-flow</b> electrophoresis chip was developed with integrated platinum electrodes, whereby the generation of gas bubbles caused by electrolysis was successfully suppressed by chemical means. Gas bubbles generated by electrolysis are major concern in <b>free-flow</b> electrophoresis systems in general leading to distorted separation. Based on the results, a fourth <b>free-flow</b> chip was developed with an integrated surface plasmon resonance gold detection region. Although fabrication was successful, certain hurdles, in particular surface chemistry issues still remain to be overcome to perform separation and real-time detection of biological samples within this hyphenated micro device. A strategy for proteomics-on-a-chip was developed aiming at the separation of antigens that play a role in autoimmune diseases. In addition two new continuous flow microfluidic chips were developed allowing for continuous biochemical reactions of surface patterning applications. These devices could be of further interest in future, in particular in more complex analytical systems related to proteomics-on-a-chip...|$|R

5|$|More {{recent works}} have {{improved}} {{sections of the}} highway in Perth. Great Eastern Highway's intersection with Roe Highway was upgraded to a grade separated interchange. The design is a diamond interchange, with <b>free-flowing</b> traffic on Roe Highway, and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements. Construction of the $101.5million project began in late 2010, and the interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 June 2012.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the park, the <b>free-flowing</b> reaches of Balch Creek support a {{population}} of resident cutthroat trout. Near the west end, furthest from the city center, Miller Creek retains much of its historic nature and supports a greater diversity of aquatic organisms than other Forest Park streams. Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run cutthroat trout, coho salmon, and short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.|$|E

In portrayals where the goddess's hair is tied like a matron and her attendants have <b>free-flowing</b> hair like young girls, the goddess is treated as a motherly figure of regal authority and power; the tied hair and headlessness represent contrasting ideas of controlled and uncontrolled nature, respectively.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a microfabricated <b>free-flow</b> electrophoresis device with integrated ion permeable membranes. In {{order to obtain}} continuous lanes of separated components an electrical field is applied perpendicular to the sample flow direction. This sample stream is sandwiched between two sheath flow streams, by hydrodynamic focusing. The separation chamber has two open side beds with inserted electrodes to allow ventilation of gas generated during electrolysis. To hydrodynamically isolate the separation compartment from the side electrodes, a photo-polymerizable monomer solution is exposed to UV light through a slit mask for in situ membrane formation. These so-called salt-bridges resist the pressure driven fluid, but allow ion transport to enable electrical connection. In earlier devices the same was achieved by using open side channel arrays. However, {{only a small fraction}} of the applied voltage was effectively utilized across the separation chamber during <b>free-flow</b> electrophoresis and <b>free-flow</b> isoelectric focusing. Furthermore, the spreading of the carrier ampholytes into the side channels resulted in a very restricted pH gradient inside the separation chamber. The chip presented here allows at least 10 times more efficient use of the applied potential and a nearly linear pH gradient from pH 3 to 10 during <b>free-flow</b> isoelectric focusing could be established. Furthermore, the application of hydrodynamic focusing in combination with <b>free-flow</b> electrophoresis can be used for guiding the separated components to specific chip outlets. As a demonstration, several standard fluorescent markers were separated and focused by <b>free-flow</b> zone electrophoresis and by <b>free-flow</b> isoelectric focusing employing a transversal voltage of up to 150 V across the separation chamber. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely <b>free-flowing</b> interchange in the future.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try {{to regain control of}} the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a <b>free-flowing</b> game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was an attacking and <b>free-flowing</b> batsman {{but he was}} not a {{prolific}} scorer, which was attributed by observers to a lack of single-mindedness required to succeed at the top level. Neil said that Ray's footwork was suspect and that the stronger bowlers in domestic cricket were able to exploit this. Neil said that if Ray had been able to rectify his weakness, then he could have become a Test player for Australia. Australian captain Bill Lawry said that Harvey was one of the two best district cricketers he had faced. Aside from his batting, Harvey was an occasional leg spinner, and was known for his fielding ability.|$|E

5|$|Runoff {{from the}} heavily wooded {{monument}} forms small headwater streams of the Illinois River, a major {{tributary of the}} Rogue River. One of five small springs in the monument becomes Upper Cave Creek, which flows on the surface before disappearing into its bed and entering the cave. Supplemented by water entering the cave from above, the stream emerges from the main entrance as Cave Creek. Within the cave, Cave Creek {{is known as the}} River Styx, named for the river Styx of Greek mythology connecting Earth to the Underworld. In late 2014, Congress added the River Styx to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, which added a level of protection aimed at keeping the stream <b>free-flowing</b> in perpetuity. It is the only subterranean river in the Wild Rivers system.|$|E
5|$|Saguaro National Park {{lies within}} the {{watershed}} of the north-flowing Santa Cruz River, {{which is generally}} dry. Rincon Creek {{in the southern part}} of the RMD, <b>free-flowing</b> for at least part of the year, has the largest riparian zone in the park. The creek is a tributary of Pantano Wash, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two washes form the Rillito River, another dry wash, an east–west tributary of the Santa Cruz River. The washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods. Smaller riparian zones are found near springs and tinajas in the RMD. The largest of the springs is at Manning Camp, high in the Rincons.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the <b>free-flowing</b> regulator quickly.|$|E

5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a <b>free-flowing</b> liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Klamath is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} river {{as well as an}} important source of water for agriculture. It includes many of the longest <b>free-flowing</b> stretches of river in California, including excellent stretches of whitewater. However, dams and diversions in the upper basin have often caused water quality issues in {{the lower half of the}} river. Environmental groups and native tribes have proposed broad changes to water use in the Klamath Basin, including the removal of some dams on the river to expand fish habitat. They put forth their concerns in what is now the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement, a water management plan signed by local communities, governments, tribal groups, environmentalists, and fishermen. The proposal has been endorsed by the U.S. Department of the Interior but has not been authorized by the United States Congress.|$|E

50|$|These two {{equations}} used {{to determine}} the velocity of a vehicle in the next timestep represent <b>free-flow</b> and congested conditions, respectively. If the vehicle is in <b>free-flow,</b> the <b>free-flow</b> branch of the equation indicates that the speed of the vehicle will increase as a function of its current speed, the speed at which the driver intends to travel, and the acceleration of the vehicle. Analyzing the variables in these two equations, it becomes apparent that as the gap between two vehicles decreases (i.e. a following vehicle approaches a leading vehicle) the velocity given by the congested branch of the equation will decrease and is more likely to prevail.|$|R
