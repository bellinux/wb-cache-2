6000|$|And {{now it is}} Sunday morning; {{and though}} all without is fragrance, and motion, and beauty, the dewdrops are twinkling, {{butterflies}} fluttering, and merry birds carolling and racketing as if they never could sing loud or fast enough, yet within {{there is such a}} stillness that the tick of the tall mahogany clock is audible through the whole house, and the buzz of the blue flies, as they whiz along up and down the window panes, is a distinct item of hearing. Look into the best front room, and you may see the upright form of my Uncle Phineas, in his immaculate Sunday clothes, with his Bible spread open on the little stand before him, and even a deeper than usual <b>gravity</b> <b>settling</b> down over his toil-worn features. Alongside, in well-brushed Sunday clothes, with clean faces and smooth hair, sat the whole of us younger people, each drawn up in a chair, with hat and handkerchief, ready for the first stroke of the bell, while Aunt Kezzy, all trimmed, and primmed, and made ready for meeting, sat reading her psalm book, only looking up occasionally to give an additional jerk to some shirt collar, or the fifteenth pull to Susan's frock, or to repress any straggling looks that might be wandering about, [...] "beholding vanity." ...|$|E
50|$|Settling is {{the process}} by which {{particulates}} settle to the bottom of a liquid and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For <b>gravity</b> <b>settling,</b> this means that the particles will tend to fall {{to the bottom of the}} vessel, forming a slurry at the vessel base.|$|E
5000|$|Removal of insolubles is {{the first}} step and {{involves}} the capture of the product as a solute in a particulate-free liquid, for example the separation of cells, cell debris or other particulate matter from fermentation broth containing an antibiotic. Typical operations to achieve this are filtration, centrifugation, sedimentation, precipitation, flocculation, electro-precipitation, and <b>gravity</b> <b>settling.</b> Additional operations such as grinding, homogenization, or leaching, required to recover products from solid sources such as plant and animal tissues, are usually included in this group.|$|E

50|$|Fractional crystallization, or crystal fractionation, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} geochemical and physical processes operating within the Earth's crust and mantle. It {{is one of the}} main processes of magmatic differentiation. Fractional crystallization is the removal and segregation from a melt of mineral precipitates; except in special cases, removal of the crystals changes the composition of the magma. In essence, fractional crystallization is the removal of early formed crystals from an originally homogeneous magma (for example, by <b>gravity</b> <b>settling)</b> so that these crystals are prevented from further reaction with the residual melt. The composition of the remaining melt becomes relatively depleted in some components and enriched in others, resulting in the precipitation of a sequence of different minerals.|$|E
50|$|Precipitation is the {{creation}} of a solid from a solution. When the reaction occurs in a liquid solution, the solid formed is called the 'precipitate'. The chemical that causes the solid to form is called the 'precipitant'. Without sufficient force of <b>gravity</b> (<b>settling)</b> to bring the solid particles together, the precipitate remains in suspension. After sedimentation, especially when using a centrifuge to press it into a compact mass, the precipitate may be referred to as a 'pellet'. Precipitation {{can be used as a}} medium. The precipitate-free liquid remaining above the solid is called the 'supernate' or 'supernatant'. Powders derived from precipitation have also historically been known as 'flowers'. When the solid appears in the form of cellulose fibers which have been through chemical processing, the process is often referred to as regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Whichever {{the form}} of the crystallizer, to achieve an {{effective}} process control it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest possible growth. This is achieved by a separation - to put it simply - of the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a different way. The practical way is to perform a <b>gravity</b> <b>settling</b> to be able to extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while managing the mass flow around the crystallizer to obtain a precise slurry density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (Draft Tube and Baffle) crystallizer, an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later President of Swenson) {{at the end of the}} 1950s. The DTB crystallizer (see images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial flow mixer - yellow - pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the crystallizer there is a settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very low velocity, so that large crystals settle - and return to the main circulation - while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and characteristics. This crystallizer, and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC, etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the evaporative capacity, due to the limited diameter of the vapour head and the relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be supplied to the system.|$|E

30|$|For the {{purification}} {{and surface}} chemical modification, 0.2 g of CNT were weighed and placed into a {{round bottomed flask}} fitted with a thermostat and thermometer, where after 100 mL mixture of a sulfuric acid and nitric acid (2 : 3 ratios by volume of concentrated sulfuric acid (98 %) and concentrated nitric acid (55 %), was carefully added into the flask. The CNT were heated under reflux for 3 h, and after the mixture had cooled the CNT were <b>gravity</b> <b>settled</b> and the acid supernatant poured off where after the CNT were mixed with 500 mL of de-ionized water, and recovered. The recovery step used filter paper, a Buchner filtration system, and the CNT were washed until the rinse water had a pH of 6 – 7 as determined by indicator paper. CNT were then dried in an oven at 100 °C overnight.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{of water with}} oil {{continues to be a}} problem for engineers and the oil producers. Since 1865 when water was coproduced with hydrocarbons, it has challenged and frustrated the industry on how to separate the valuable from the disposable. According to Rehm et al (1983), innovation over the years has led from the skim pit to installation of the stock tank, to the gunbarrel, to the freewater knockout, to the hay-packed coalescer and most recently to the Performax Matrix Plate Coalescer, an enhanced <b>gravity</b> <b>settling</b> separator. The history of water treating for the most part has been sketchy and spartan. There is little economic value to the produced water, and it represents an extra cost for the producer to arrange for its disposal. Today oil fields produce greater quantities of water than they produce oil. Along with greater water production are emulsions and dispersions which are more difficult to treat. The separation process becomes interlocked with a myriad of contaminants as the last drop of oil is being recovered from the reservoir. In some instances it is preferable to separate and to remove water from the well fluid before it flows through pressure reductions, such as those caused by chokes and valves. Such water removal may prevent difficulties that could be caused downstream by the water, such as corrosion which can be referred to as being a chemical reactions that occurs whenever a gas or liquid chemically attacks an exposed metallic surface. Corrosion is usually accelerated by warm temperatures and likewise by the presence of acids and salts. Other factors that affect the removal of water from oil include hydrate formation and the formation of tight emulsion that may be difficult to resolve into oil and water. The water can be separated from the oil in a three-phase separator by use of chemicals and gravity separation. If the three-phase separator is not large enough to separatethe water adequately, it can be separated in a free-water knockout vessel installed upstream or downstream of the separators.|$|E

The main goal will be the need to relate dissolution, diffusion and precipitation phenomena to essential geometric and topological changes of the tungstennickel porous microstructure influenced by differential skeletal settling due to large density difference between tungsten domains and the matrix. This study {{will be based on}} domain topology (no shape restriction) and control-volume methodology. The microstructural evolution will be simulated by computation of displacement of the center of mass (combined <b>gravity</b> induced <b>settling</b> and random motion) and mass transport due to dissolution and precipitation at the interfaces between solid-phase and liquid matrix...|$|R

25|$|Ash ponds, a type {{of surface}} impoundment, are a widely used {{treatment}} technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use <b>gravity</b> to <b>settle</b> out large particulates (measured as total suspended solids) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, chemical precipitation, biological treatment (such as an activated sludge process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems. Technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of flue-gas desulfurization wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{methods to}} {{separate}} water-in-crude oil emulsions like chemical demulsifiers are not environmentally-friendly, slow, separation not efficient, not cost effective and consume space for separation. The potentials of microwave energy in demulsification of water-in-crude oil emulsions were investigated. In this study, stability tests, <b>gravity</b> <b>settling,</b> microwave heating and microwave separation were studied. Microwave demulsification was applied in 50 / 50 and 20 / 80 water-in-crude oil emulsions with microwave exposure time varied from 120 - 180 seconds. As the sludge is heated, viscosity is lowered, and rapid coalescence of liquid phases takes place. Once the liquid phases coalesce, separation occurs through natural gravity. No chemicals {{are needed to}} force separation. Three different parameters were being investigated {{on the effect of}} separation namely volume ratio of water-in-oil emulsions, different emulsifiers and power generations of microwave. The four emulsifiers used were SDDS, Span 83, Triton X- 100 and Tween 80. The power generations were 360 and 540 watts respectively. 20 / 80 water-in-crude oil emulsion was the most stable among two volume ratios. Newtonian fluid was determined from stability tests. Viscosity decreased, shear stress increased and shear rate increased over rpm. Surface and interfacial tensions were determined. Water and oil separation efficiencies via <b>gravity</b> <b>settling</b> were low. Volumetric heat generation rate of microwave was high. Water and oil separation efficiencies of microwave were more efficient than <b>gravity</b> <b>settling.</b> Microwave causes molecular rotation and ionic conduction thus fast heating...|$|E

5000|$|Natural gas {{is lighter}} than liquid hydrocarbon. Minute {{particles}} of liquid hydrocarbon that are temporarily suspended {{in a stream}} of natural gas will, by density difference or force of <b>gravity,</b> <b>settle</b> out of the stream of gas if the velocity of the gas is sufficiently slow. The larger droplets of hydrocarbon will quickly settle out of the gas, but the smaller ones will take longer. At standard conditions of pressure and temperature, the droplets of liquid hydrocarbon may have a density 400 to 1,600 times that of natural gas. However, as the operating pressure and temperature increase, the difference in density decreases. At an operating pressure of 800 psig, the liquid hydrocarbon may be only 6 to 10 times as dense as the gas. Thus, operating pressure materially affects {{the size of the}} separator and the size and type of mist extractor required to separate adequately the liquid and gas. The fact that the liquid droplets may have a density 6 to 10 times that of the gas may indicate that droplets of liquid would quickly settle out of and separate from the gas. However, this may not occur because the particles of liquid may be so small that they tend to [...] "float" [...] in the gas and may not settle out of the gas stream in the short period of time the gas is in the oil and gas separator. As the operating pressure on a separator increases, the density difference between the liquid and gas decreases. For this reason, it is desirable to operate oil and gas separators at as low a pressure as is consistent with other process variables, conditions, and requirements.|$|R
50|$|The {{settling}} velocity, {{defined as}} the residence time taken for the particles to settle in the tank, enables the calculation of tank volume. Precise design and operation of a sedimentation tank is of high importance {{in order to keep}} the amount of sediment entering the diversion system to a minimum threshold by maintaining the transport system and stream stability to remove the sediment diverted from the system. This is achieved by reducing stream velocity as low as possible for the longest period of time possible. This is feasible by widening the approach channel and lowering its floor to reduce flow velocity thus allowing sediment to settle out of suspension due to <b>gravity.</b> The <b>settling</b> behavior of heavier particulates is also affected by the turbulence.|$|R

Spread plates and pour plates yielded similar estimates of total thermophiles. Higher counts were observed on spread plates (P less than 0. 05) for Thermoactinomyces candidus, Micropolyspora faeni, and Saccharomonospora viridis. M. faeni and S. viridis were less efficient than T. candidus in breaking through the agar of pour plates to form colonies which could be identified.

40|$|In recent years, a {{range of}} {{computer}} simulation models leading {{to a better understanding}} of liquid phase sintering phenomena, have been developed with the aim of simulating the detailed evolution of microstructure during grain growth. Some liquid phase sintered materials show both macrostructural and microstructural effects associated with gravity force. Therefore we will develop a numerical procedure for the estimation of how much gravity will influence domain (two-dimensional particle representation) growth, domain boundary migration and solid skeleton formation due to gravity induced segregation during liquid phase sintering. The method used for the simulation of a gravity field will be based on the <b>settling</b> procedure. <b>Gravity</b> induced <b>settling</b> will be separated into two stages - Free Settling and Skeletal Settling. Isolated solid phase domains fall under gravity and slide down over the already settled domains (free settling). During settling they make point contacts with each other. Necks between them then form and start to grow until the equilibrium dihedral angle between the domain boundaries and the liquid is established. Thus a solid skeleton forms and skeletal settling of a connected solid structure takes place. ...|$|R
