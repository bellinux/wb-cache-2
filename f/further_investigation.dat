5|$|Based on {{his work}} for the 60 Minutes reports plus <b>further</b> <b>investigation</b> on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The book was {{published}} by W. W. Norton & Company.

The order effectively confirmed future President Lyndon Johnson's apparent victory over former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson.|$|E
5|$|Mt. Kenya was {{discovered}} by Krapf in the next year, on December 3, 1849.

5|$|On April 24, the {{astronomer}} David Charbonneau, {{who led the}} team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the theoretical model to suggest the presence of water.

However, after <b>further</b> <b>investigation</b> they rescinded Coulthard's penalty, as he had retired from the previous race and his change had been made {{before the start of}} the race weekend.

5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined {{that there was no}} evidence to support the allegations and no need for <b>further</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Conceptual {{design of}} a {{permanent}} repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository, three were nominated for <b>further</b> <b>investigation,</b> at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires <b>further</b> <b>investigation</b> with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

After <b>further</b> <b>investigation</b> in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E
