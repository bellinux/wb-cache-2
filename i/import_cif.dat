This issue is highly relevant in Britain, where the industry-standard CIF (Common Interface Format) timetable data files are not directly compatible with modelling tools such as RailSys and EMME/ 2. RMCon has developed a <b>CIF</b> <b>import</b> facility for RailSys, but no equivalent exists for EMME/ 2, which {{is used in the}} PLANET and Railplan multi-modal public transport models employed by the Department for Transport and Transport for London, respectively. This issue was highlighted during passenger demand forecasting work conducted by Arup for Network Rail (Britain?s railway infrastructure owner and operator) for the South West Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy (SWML RUS), a strategy for the utilisation and development of the rail routes between London?s Waterloo station and the area to the south-west. The PLANET South model was used for demand forecasting, using timetable data <b>imported</b> from a <b>CIF</b> file supplied by Network Rail. The issues encountered in <b>importing</b> the <b>CIF</b> data to PLANET {{led to the development of}} a Perl-based tool to automate the process, in a collaboration between Arup and the University of Southampton?s Transportation Research Group. The success of this tool resulted in Arup being commissioned by Transport for London to develop a similar tool for Railplan, which simulates a less extensive but more detailed network than PLANET.

40|$|Japan’s dairy {{industry}} is under heavy governmental regulation. This has serious consequences; for instance, {{controls on the}} imports of butter leads to periodic butter shortages. The collection of raw milk from farmers is monopolized by agricultural cooperatives in the region, which blend the raw milk from many farmers and sell it to dairy processing firms. Therefore, there is no opportunity for farmers to save money, increase quality and {{reap the benefits of}} a higher quality product. Regarding pork, Japan’s tariffs are highly irregular. Japan imposes a specific tariff of ¥ 482 per kilogram on inexpensive pork parts <b>imported</b> at a <b>CIF</b> price less than ¥ 64. 53 per kg. For imported pork at the <b>CIF</b> <b>import</b> price, which is between ¥ 64. 53 and ¥ 524 per kg, Japan uses a “gate price system” in which the tariff equals the difference between the benchmark price of ¥ 546. 53 and the <b>CIF</b> <b>import</b> price. Imported pork products that are more expensive than the ¥ 524 per kg (expensive pork parts) are subject to a conventional ad valorem tariff of 4. 3 %. This system maintains a domestic price of at least ¥ 524 /kg regardless of quality. It also produces a huge incentive to lie about the true import price. Another incentive is to mix expensive and cheap pork parts to reduce the average import price to ¥ 524 per kg in order to minimize tariffs to be paid. This system discourages Japanese farmers from producing high quality pork, since expensive imports may be sold cheaper as part of the mixed pork shipment. Agricultural reform should be fundamental, not cosmetic, since the whole system needs to be overhauled. The realization of “Strengthening Agriculture” through Abenomics depends on {{the success or failure of}} these reforms...|$|R

The excess production has {{allowed for the}} expansion of the export sector, converting Chile in a net exporter in 2001. A relevant question in this new market scenario is how this Structural change can affect milk prices paid to producer,; in Chile. the consequences of this Structural change were explored in this study using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model and cointegration analysis. The results indicated that the domestic, CIF (Cost. Insurance, Freight) and FOB (Free Oil Board) prices were cointegrated, implying that changes in the import and export prices are transmitted to the domestic market affecting the milk price paid to producers. Prior to 200 1, the <b>import</b> price (<b>CIF)</b> was the relevant reference dictating the movements of the domestic price. After 2001, the export price (FOB) became the reference, whereas the CIF price was no longer significant. the parameters of the VEC model SLIcroest that the conitegrating relation between CIF and domestic prices for the first period Under analysis (1990 - 2000) was clearer than that between FOB and domestic prices for the second period (2001 - 2007 / 3). the price elasticity for the FOB-domestic price vector had a large confidence interval, which is Why it IS difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the impact Of future FOB fluctuations Oil the milk price paid to producers in Chile after 2001...|$|R

We focus on the aggregate demand for crude oil in EU with the aim of investigating the degree of substitutability of crude oil imports from the Former Soviet Union countries (FSU) and crude oil imports from four alternative regions (America, Middle East, Europe, Africa). Following Fuss (1977) and Serletis (2010) we employ an econometric model of intra-fuel substitution, using a nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimator, to assess the aforementioned degree of substitutability in terms of Morishima elasticities of substitution. We use the most recent dataset, published by the European Commission, consisting of a collection of <b>imported</b> volumes and <b>CIF</b> prices of crude oil by country of origin.

Turkish exporters often {{complain that}} they cannot maintain a competitive price advantage over South East Asian exporters in world markets. This thesis aims to investigate if relative geographical proximity o f Turkey to the EU market provides a compensating advantage for Turkish exporters selling to this market. In this framework, the study attempts to measure the degree of price competitiveness stemming from the relative proximity of exporters. For this purpose, export similarities between SEAs and Turkey are determined first. The importance of competitiveness on the overall export performance of each exporter is identified by using the Constant Market Share Analysis and then, the degree o f price effect on the competitiveness is found by estimating twostage homothetic demand functions. The proximity advantage o f Turkish exporters relative to SEA exporters is identified by analyzing the difference between <b>CIF</b> <b>import</b> and FOB export prices. The results indicate that Turkey has a price advantage relative to SEA countries in the product group that exhibits the highest degree of export pattern similarity to those countries. Kotan, ZelalM.

40|$|Indonesia is {{a country}} where most of its people rely on the {{agricultural}} sector as a livelihood. Indonesia's rice production is so high {{that it can not}} meet the needs of its population, consequently Indonesia still has to import rice from other food producing countries. One of the main causes is the enormous population. Statistics show that in the range of 230 - 237 million people, the staple food of all residents is rice so {{it is clear that the}} need for rice becomes very large. This study discusses the application of datamining on rice import by main country of origin using K-Means Clustering Method. Sources of data of this study were collected based on import import declaration documents produced by the Directorate General of Customs and Excise. In addition since 2015, import data also comes from PT. Pos Indonesia, records of other agencies at the border, and the results of cross-border maritime trade surveys. The data used in this study is the data of rice imports by country of origin from 2000 - 2015 consisting of 10 countries namely Vietnam, Thailand, China, India, Pakistan, United States, Taiwan, Singapore, Myanmar and Others. Variable used (1) total import of rice (net) and (2) <b>import</b> purchase value (<b>CIF).</b> The data will be processed by clustering rice imports by main country of origin in 3 clusters ie high imported cluster, medium imported cluster and low import level cluster.

40|$|Translational {{control is}} crucial to {{balancing}} the cell's protein output and genetic expression. The substrate of the translational machinery [...] -messenger RNA (mRNA) [...] -is itself subject to regulation. The lifetime of an mRNA is limited and therefore mRNA decay is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. Translation and mRNA decay are intimately related processes as they both handle the cell economy. mRNAs are generally in a balancing act between the translational and the repression/decay machinery, which ultimately decides the fate of an mRNA and its protein expression rate. In fact, translation affects the rate of mRNA decay. For instance, aberrant messages which contain a premature-termination codon (PTC) require ribosome scanning in order to read the message, discover the mistake, and essentially prompt its destruction. Here, {{a relationship between the}} nuclear translation-like factor [...] -eIF 4 AIII, the nuclear <b>import</b> factor of <b>cIF</b> 4 E [...] - 4 E-T, and mRNA decay was discovered. eIF 4 AIII is a nuclear protein that interacts physically or functionally with translation initiation factors eIF 4 G and eIF 4 B, respectively, and shares strikingly high identity with the initiation factors eIF 4 AI/II. This work demonstrates that eIF 4 AIII but not eIF 4 AI is required for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD is a surveillance mechanism in eukaryotes which degrades the mRNA when a PTC is present. NMD is a splicing and translation-dependent event in mammalians. We show eIF 4 AIII is deposited at the exon-exon junction during splicing, is a shuttling protein, and is necessary for NMD. At steady state, 4 E-T is predominantly cytoplasmic and is concentrated in bodies that conspicuously resemble the recently described Processing bodies (P-bodies), which are sites of mRNA decay. We demonstrate that 4 E-T colocalizes with mRNA decapping factors in bona fide P-bodies and that its binding partner, eIF 4 E, is tethered to P-bodies in a 4 E-T dependent manner. Moreover, 4 E-T controls mRNA half life. We demonstrate that 4 E-T interaction with eIF 4 E represses translation, which is thought to be a prerequisite for targeting of mRNAs to P-bodies. Hence, analysis of prospective translation factors has led to elucidation of mRNA decay pathways...|$|R
40|$|The Role of Market Speculation in Rising Oil Prices: {{the large}} oil price {{fluctuations}} occurred from 2003 to 2008 has raised {{many questions about}} their causes. Many empirical studies have attempted to understand how oil price fluctuations are driven by changes in both market fundamentals and speculative pressures. In this regard, some problems arise such as: the use of unreliable data like the global level of inventories or the specification of {{a vast number of}} arbitrary restrictions for the models. In this study I try to isolate, coherently with the view of Knittel and Pindyck(2016) and inspired by Kilian's works, the speculative effect on the short-term spot price fluctuations determined by structural forward-looking behavioral shocks produced in the futures market. Exploiting a dataset used in Kilian and Murphy (2012), CFTC data (period 1999 M 1 - 2008 M 6) and taking advantage of the standard theory of storage {{we will be able to}} verify, with a Blanchard-Quah structural approach, that the impact of these shocks is remarkable but not the prevalent one in magnitude. Instead, it would seem that speculative inventory holdings may have played a much more important role. The study named "European Energy Security: the Substitutability of European Crude Oil Imports from Russia" is meant to be a contribution to the current debate on the diversification possibilities in EU for reducing the dependency on Russian crude oil and ensuring the energy security of the European Union (EU). We focus on the aggregate demand for crude oil in EU with the aim of investigating the degree of substitutability of crude oil imports from the Former Soviet Union countries (FSU) and crude oil imports from four alternative regions (America, Middle East, Europe, Africa).

Predictability Information Criterion for Selecting Stochastic Pricing Models: pricing models of derivative instruments usually fail to provide reliable results when risks rise and financial crises occur. More advanced stochastic pricing models try to improve the fitting results adding risk factors and/or parameters to the models, incurring the risk of overfitted results. Drawing on these observations, it is proposed a generalization of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) suitable to evaluate forecasting power of alternative stochastic pricing models for any fixed arbitrary forecasting time-horizon. The Predictability Information Criterion (PIC) differs from the classical criteria for evaluating statistical models as it assumes that the random variable to study can (or cannot) be partially predictable, which makes it particularly suitable for studying stochastic pricing models coherently with the semimartingale definition of the price process. On the basis of this assumption the criterion measures and compares the uncertainty of the predictions of two different alternative models when prices are (or are not) predictable. We conclude with a focus on the crude oil market by comparing GBM and OU stochastic processes that are commonly used for modeling West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil spot price returns in derivative pricing models...|$|R
