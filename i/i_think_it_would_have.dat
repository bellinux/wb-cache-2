[...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a very interesting thing though. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of SotL, she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter...'." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. IGN columnist Brian Zoromski rated [...] "The Coup" [...] 7.8/10, indicating it as a [...] "good" [...] episode. He felt {{that after the}} [...] "brilliant" [...] episode from the previous week, [...] "The Coup" [...] was [...] "somewhat anticlimactic, as Jim doesn't interact at all with the Scranton branch and the Pam-Jim storyline is pretty much ignored." [...] Despite his disappointment with Jim's storyline, Zoromski commented that the [...] "best moments of the episode were the completely random ones, such as Dwight knowing that Jan wears blouses from Liz Claiborne and earrings from Ann Taylor." [...] AOLTV's Michael Sciannamea was also unhappy with Jim's scenes, writing that they were [...] "beginning to grate on [...] Is every branch office at Dunder Mifflin filled with crazies? How then does the company stay in business? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been funnier if Jim ended up in an office where it's nothing but work and no play at all. The Call of Duty bits didn't do much for me." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{impending}} Writers Guild of America strike, writer and co-executive producer Maurice Hurley developed the teleplay {{in a day}} and a half from fan fiction written by Deborah McIntyre and Mona Clee. Due to the strike, certain story ideas were removed from the plot including the planned first appearance of the Borg which was subsequently delayed until the [...] episode [...] "Q Who". This was because [...] "The Neutral Zone" [...] was originally intended to be the first of a two-part episode, but due to the strike there wasn't enough time to write the second part and so the story was shortened. The second episode would have seen the Enterprise and the Romulans team up against the Borg. The script that was shot was a first draft, and due to the writer's strike in place, no amendments were subsequently made. Director James L. Conway later explained, [...] "If there hadn't been a strike, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a better script." [...] It was the second episode of The Next Generation directed by Conway, the first being [...] "" [...] earlier in the first season. He didn't direct another episode until [...] "" [...] during season six.|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E
500|$|The European leg of {{the tour}} {{featured}} two highlights. The group's 20 September 1997 show in Reggio Emilia was attended by over 150,000 people, setting a world record for the largest paying audience for a one-act show. U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as [...] "an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been worthwhile." [...] Bono called the show [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life". The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of US$171.7million and 3.9million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert. In November 1998, U2 released their first compilation album, The Best of 1980–1990, which featured a re-recording of a 1987 B-side, [...] "Sweetest Thing", as its single. The album attained the highest first-week sales in the US of any greatest hits record, while [...] "Sweetest Thing" [...] topped the singles charts in Ireland and Canada.|$|E

2500|$|Baldwin {{supported}} the Munich Agreement {{and said to}} Chamberlain on 26 September 1938: [...] "If you can secure peace, you may be cursed {{by a lot of}} hotheads but my word you will be blessed in Europe and by future generations". Baldwin made a rare speech in the House of Lords on 4 October where he said he could not have gone to Munich but praised Chamberlain's courage and said the responsibility of a Prime Minister was not to commit the country to war until he was sure that it was ready to fight. If there was a 95% chance of war in the future, he would still choose peace. He also said he would put industry on a war footing tomorrow as the opposition to such a move had disappeared. Churchill said in a speech: [...] "He says he would mobilise tomorrow. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been much better if Earl Baldwin had said that {{two and a half years}} ago when everyone demanded a Ministry of Supply".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, EastEnders {{scriptwriter}} Tony Jordan revealed {{how it was}} {{his idea}} to bring Den back in 2003. Jordan had started working at EastEnders in 1989, after Den had already left the series. Jordan {{had always wanted to}} write material for Den and Angie and so he campaigned for the return of Den for many years. He told the Daily Mirror, [...] "At story conferences I'd say, 'How do we know he's dead? They never found a body'. Eventually, just to shut me up, they made me write an episode where Den's body was found and identified by his ring." [...] Jordan finally got his way in 2003; however, according to the writer, Leslie Grantham's internet sex scandal spelled the demise of the character. Commenting on this, Jordan said, [...] "If [...] hadn't come out <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> worked and he'd still be in the show. When I saw him on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn't believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as Leslie Grantham - not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably." ...|$|E

2500|$|The case {{failed because}} of lack of proper {{evidence}} thanks to Jatin's policy of a loose decentralised organisation federating scores of regional units, as observed by F.C. Daly more than once: [...] "The gang is a heterogeneous one, with several advisers and petty chiefs... From information we have on record we may divide the gang into four parts: (1) Gurus, (2) Influential supporters, (3) Leaders, (4) Members." [...] J.C. Nixon's report is more explicit : [...] "Although a separate name and a separate individuality have been given to these various parties in this account of them, and although such a distinction was probably observed amongst the minor members, it is very clear that the bigger figures were in close communication with one another and were frequently accepted members of two or more of these samitis. It may be taken that at some time these various parties were engaged in anarchical crime independently, although in their revolutionary aims and usually in their origins they were all very closely related." [...] Several observers pinpointed Jatin so accurately that the newly appointed Viceroy Lord Hardinge wrote more explicitly to Earl Crewe (H.M.'s Secretary of State for India): [...] "As regards prosecution, I (...) deprecate the net being thrown so wide; as for example in the Howrah Gang Case, where 47 persons are being prosecuted, of whom only one is, I believe, the real criminal. If a concentrated effort had been made to convict this one criminal, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had a better effect than the prosecution of 46 misguided youths." [...] On 28 May 1911, Hardinge recognised : [...] "The 10th Jats case was {{part and parcel of the}} Howrah Gang Case; and with the failure in the latter, the Government of Bengal realised the futility of proceeding with the former... In fact, nothing could be worse, in my opinion, than the condition of Bengal and Eastern Bengal. There is practically no Government in either province..." ...|$|E
