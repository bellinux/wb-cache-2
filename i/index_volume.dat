2500|$|The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church, also {{referred}} to as the Old Catholic Encyclopedia and the Original Catholic Encyclopedia, is an English-language encyclopedia published in the United States. The first volume appeared in March 1907 and the last three volumes appeared in 1912, followed by a master <b>index</b> <b>volume</b> in 1914 and later supplementary volumes. It was designed [...] "to give its readers full and authoritative information on the entire cycle of Catholic interests, action and doctrine".|$|E
2500|$|The {{landmark}} ninth edition, {{often called}} [...] "the Scholar's Edition", was published from January 1875 to 1889 in 25 volumes, with volume 25 the <b>index</b> <b>volume.</b> Unlike {{the first two}} Black editions, there were no preliminary dissertations, the alphabetical listing beginning in volume 1. Up to 1880, the editor, {{and author of the}} Foreword, was Thomas Spencer Baynes—the first English-born editor after a series of Scots—and W. Robertson Smith afterwards. An intellectual prodigy who mastered advanced scientific and mathematical topics, Smith was a professor of theology at the Free Church College in Edinburgh, and was the first contributor to the Britannica who addressed the historical interpretation of the Bible, a topic then already familiar on the Continent of Europe. Dr. Smith contributed several articles to the 9th edition, but lost his teaching position on 24 May 1881, due to the controversy his (ir)religious articles aroused; he was immediately hired to be joint editor-in-chief with Baynes.|$|E

2500|$|Freeman first {{wrote about}} the Conquest {{while he was still}} a student at Oxford, where his 1846 essay [...] "The Effects of the Conquest of England by the Normans" [...] was {{submitted}} for, but failed to win, a prize. [...] In 1859 and 1865 he published lengthy reviews of the last two volumes of Sir Francis Palgrave's History of Normandy and of England. [...] Exploring his points of agreement and disagreement with Palgrave Freeman decided to embark on his own history of the Conquest, reasoning that its approaching 800th anniversary might well make such a work popular. [...] He believed that he had so completely worked out his own position on the historical controversies involved that [...] "there will be little more to do than write down what is already in my head". [...] He began work on the History on 7 December 1865, writing to a friend that it was a book [...] "which I can do easier than anybody else, as I have worked so much at the subject for twenty years past". [...] In the event, Freeman's decision to trace the remoter causes of the Conquest in much greater detail than he had originally planned put paid to all hopes of bringing his history down to William the Conqueror's accession in time for the octocentenary. [...] His first volume, taking the story as far as the death of Harthacnut, appeared in 1867; subsequent volumes in 1868, 1869 and 1871 dealt with the reigns of Edward the Confessor, Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror respectively; and an 1876 volume explored the consequences of the Conquest in later reigns, with a final <b>index</b> <b>volume</b> in 1879. [...] Freeman later issued two revised editions.|$|E
