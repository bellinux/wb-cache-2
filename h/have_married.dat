5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached menarche {{at about}} age fourteen, {{when they would}} <b>have</b> <b>married.</b> Girls who died before marriage were mourned for their failure to reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides, and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day).|$|E

5|$|During a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but {{he barely}} {{acknowledges}} their acquaintance. Marianne later learns {{that he is}} engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would <b>have</b> <b>married</b> her, {{but he had to}} marry a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward <b>have</b> <b>married.</b> However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E
5|$|Just {{months into}} his reign, Edward forced a {{constitutional}} crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could <b>have</b> <b>married</b> Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.|$|E
5|$|She {{returns in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, {{where it is}} {{revealed}} that Elena and Nate <b>have</b> <b>married</b> and then separated in the period between the two games. Working on a story in Yemen, she is joined by her ex-husband and Sully, and joins their hunt {{for the city of}} Ubarr. Over the course of the adventures, Nate and Elena reconcile and resume wearing their wedding rings. In the teaser trailer for Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Drake is still married to Elena, as his wedding ring can be seen on his hand.|$|E

5|$|Tang dynasty (618–907) {{emperors}} gave princesses {{in marriage}} to {{rulers of the}} Uyghur Khaganate to consolidate the special trade and military relationship that developed after the Khaganate supported the Chinese during the An Lushan Rebellion. At least three Tang imperial princesses are known to <b>have</b> <b>married</b> khagans between 758 and 821. These unions temporarily stopped in 788, which is believed in part to be because stability within the Chinese empire meant that they were politically unnecessary; however, threats from Tibet in the west, and a renewed need for Uyghur support, precipitated the marriage of Princess Taihe to Bilge Khagan.|$|E
5|$|While his {{brothers}} Basil and Naucratius lived as hermits from c. 355, Gregory initially pursued a non-ecclesiastical {{career as a}} rhetorician. He did however, act as a lector. He is known to <b>have</b> <b>married</b> a woman named Theosebia during this period, who is sometimes identified with Theosebia the Deaconess, venerated as a saint by Orthodox Christianity. This is controversial, however, and other commentators suggest that Theosebia the Deaconess was one of Gregory's sisters.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to <b>have</b> <b>married</b> at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
50|$|On Banks {{death in}} 1699 the baronetcy became extinct. He was survived by two married daughters (Mary, who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> John Savile and Elizabeth, who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> Heneage Finch) who were co-heiresses to his estate.|$|R

5|$|Clan Maclachlan claims {{descent from}} Lachlan Mor, {{who lived on}} the shores of Loch Fyne in the 13th century. Lachlan belonged to the family who {{originally}} emigrated from Ireland to Scotland in the 11th century. The progenitor of this family, Anrothan, son of Aodh O'Neil, king of the north of Ireland, is said to <b>have</b> <b>married</b> the heiress of the King of Scots and gained lands campaigning there. Moncreiffe wrote that it was more likely Anrothan married a daughter of the local king of Argyll or a sub-king of Cowal and through this marriage, Anrothan's descendants gained control of the lands of Knapdale and Cowal, and several Scottish clans claim a descent from him including Clan MacNeil of Barra, Clan Lamont, Clan MacEwen of Otter, and the MacSweens who became the Irish Sweeney Clan who left Scotland and returned to Ireland in the 14th century as leaders of Gallowglass.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Farsari had a daughter, Kiku, by a Japanese {{woman whom}} {{he may not}} <b>have</b> <b>married.</b> He {{described}} himself as living like a misanthrope, associating with very few people outside of business, and his correspondence indicates that he increasingly hoped to return to Italy. He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States, and he even hoped to be made a cavaliere and thereby join the Italian aristocracy. His success in these endeavours is not clear. Nevertheless, in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy. On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in Vicenza.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} that the battle took place before Somairle and Guðrøðr struggled for the kingship. Guðrøðr is otherwise known to <b>have</b> <b>married</b> a granddaughter of Muirchertach, and seems to have had an earlier marriage to another member of the Uí Néill. These marital unions could be evidence of an alliance between Guðrøðr and Muirchertach in the 1150s. Mac Scelling's participation in Muirchertach's service, therefore, could have been undertaken during a period of cooperation between the Isles and the Uí Néill. Nevertheless, an alliance between Somairle and Muirchertach may be perceptible as late as 1164, when the former lost his life leading an invasion of mainland Scotland. According to the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, Somairle commanded troops from Dublin, a settlement which have recognised Muirchertach's overlordship at the time. One possibility is that a pact between the two concerned Somairle's support of Muirchertach regarding the Irish high-kingship, and Muirchertach's support of Somairle via Dublin.|$|E

50|$|He died childless in 1946. He <b>had</b> <b>married</b> in 1891 Dr Frances May Dickinson, {{anaesthetist}} at the Royal Free Hospital and {{the daughter}} of Sebastian Dickinson, MP for Stroud. After her death in 1934 he <b>had</b> <b>married</b> Mabel Ingram, a doctor.|$|R
50|$|On December 27, 1831, Cadwalader married Maria Charlotte Gouverneur (1801-1867). Her aunt Elizabeth Kortright (1768-1830) <b>had</b> <b>married</b> US President James Monroe, {{and brother}} Samuel L. Gouverneur (1799-1865) <b>had</b> <b>married</b> Monroe's daughter. Their {{children}} were: Emily, Mary, John, Richard and Maria.|$|R
5|$|Strabo {{married into}} equally illustrious families. He may <b>have</b> <b>married</b> a {{daughter}} of Quintus Aelius Tubero, allying himself with the more prestigious Aelian gens. Lucius Seius Tubero, who became suffect consul in AD 18, was probably his son. Strabo's last wife was Cosconia Gallita, sister of Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis (suffect consul in AD 10) and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio (suffect consul in AD 2) and perhaps half-sister of Quintus Junius Blaesus (suffect consul in AD 10). Sejanus {{could have been a}} child of this marriage. He was later adopted into the Aelian gens by Gaius Aelius Gallus, and by Roman custom became known as Lucius Aelius Seianus or simply as Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The Bannatyne {{manuscript}} also names {{two other}} sons; however, Matheson considered the manuscript {{to be of}} dubious authority, {{since it is the}} only source for these names. It lists Leod's third son as John, stating that John followed Bruce to Ireland. The manuscript continues that in Ireland he acquired considerable estates in Galway and was knighted; although he was the principal man of his name there, his descendants were known not as MacLeods, but as MacElliots. The manuscript states that his daughter, and heiress, married Maurice, 2nd Lord of Kerry. According to MacLeod, the statement about John following Bruce to Ireland is a mistake, since John's daughter couldn't <b>have</b> <b>married</b> later than 1285. Bruce was, however, born in 1275, and did not go to Ireland until 1306. Leod's fourth son is listed by the manuscript as being Olaus. The account states that this Olaus was the reputed ancestor of the MacLewis, or Fullarton family, which originated on the Isle of Arran and that this family traced its ancestry from Lewis, or MacLoy, son of Olaus, son of Leod.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in Scotland kinship was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women {{retained}} their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's kin, and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status and skills {{that would allow them to}} establish a household. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Highland women, based on the higher birth rate of the Highlands, might <b>have</b> <b>married</b> earlier than their Lowland counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Walter married Emma or Emmelina {{and they}} had three sons– Roger, Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became Abbot of Gloucester Abbey. Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to <b>have</b> <b>married</b> twice– once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is {{probably}} a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at St Mary's Abbey, Winchester. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn. C. P. Lewis names her {{as the daughter of}} Walter, but W. E. Wightman calls her the daughter of Hugh, Walter's son. Yet another pedigree has her as the daughter of Agnes, the daughter of Walter. In this rendition, favoured by Bruce Coplestone-Crow, Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage of life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage of life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who <b>have</b> <b>married</b> or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E
5|$|Æthelfrith of Northumbria may <b>have</b> <b>married</b> Acha, who was {{the mother}} of his son Oswald (born in about 604), {{according}} to Bede. Æthelfrith pursued Acha's exiled brother Edwin in an attempt to destroy him and ensure that the Bernician rulership of Northumbria would be unchallenged. Edwin found hospitality in the household of Cearl of Mercia and later married Cearl's daughter. Edwin's nephew Hereric, an exile in the British kingdom of Elmet, was slain there under treacherous circumstances. Edwin eventually sought the protection of Rædwald, where he was received willingly. Rædwald promised to protect him, and Edwin lived with the king amongst his royal companions. When news of Edwin reached Æthelfrith in Northumbria, he sent messengers to Rædwald offering money in return for Edwin's death, but Rædwald refused to comply. Æthelfrith sent messengers a second and a third time, offering even greater gifts of silver and promising war if these were not accepted. Rædwald then weakened and promised either to kill Edwin or to hand him over to ambassadors.|$|E
