40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>gold</b> <b>capping</b> on {{magnetic}} and transport properties of optimally doped manganite thin films is studied. An extraordinary suppression of conductivity and magnetic properties occurs in epitaxial (001) La_ 0. 67 Sr_ 0. 33 MnO_ 3 (LSMO) films grown on SrTiO_ 3 upon deposition of 2 nm of Au: {{in the case}} of ultrathin films of LSMO (4 nm thick) the resistivity increases by four orders of magnitude while the Curie temperature decreases by 180 K. Zero-field 55 Mn nuclear magnetic resonance reveals a significant reduction of ferromagnetic double-exchange mechanism in manganite films upon the <b>gold</b> <b>capping.</b> We find evidence for the formation of a 1. 9 -nm thick magnetic "dead-layer" at the Au/LSMO interface, associated with the creation of interfacial non double-exchange insulating phases.

With respect to uncoated manganite {{layers of the}} same thickness, Au-capped 4 nm-thick manganite films reveal a dramatic reduction (about 185 K) of the Curie temperature TC and a lower saturation low-temperature magnetization M 0. A sizeable TC reduction (about 60 K) is observed even when an inert SrTiO 3 layer is inserted between the gold film and the 4 nm-thick manganite layer, suggesting that this effect might have an electrostatic origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{controlled}} {{manipulation of}} the charge carrier concentration in nanometer thin layers {{is the basis of}} current semiconductor technology and of fundamental importance for device applications. Here we show {{that it is possible to}} induce a persistent inversion from n- to p-type in a 200 -nm-thick surface layer of a germanium wafer by illumination with white and blue light. We induce the inversion with a half-life of ~ 12 hours at a temperature of 220  K which disappears above 280  K. The photo-induced inversion is absent for a sample with a 20 -nm-thick <b>gold</b> <b>capping</b> layer providing a Schottky barrier at the interface. This indicates that charge accumulation at the surface is essential to explain the observed inversion. The contactless change of carrier concentration is potentially interesting for device applications in opto-electronics where the gate electrode and gate oxide could be replaced by the semiconductor surface...|$|E

40|$|In {{optoelectronic}} devices {{based on}} quantum dot arrays, thin nanolayers of gold are preferred as stable metal contacts and for connecting recombination centers. The optimal morphology requirements are uniform arrays with precisely controlled positions and sizes {{over a large}} area with long range ordering since this strongly affects device performance. To understand the development of gold layer nanomorphology, the detailed mechanism of structure formation are probed with time-resolved grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) during gold sputter deposition. Gold is sputtered on a CdSe quantum dot array with a characteristic quantum dot spacing of ≈ 7 nm. In {{the initial stages of}} gold nanostructure growth, a preferential deposition of gold on top of quantum dots occurs. Thus, the quantum dots act as nucleation sites for gold growth. In later stages, the gold nanoparticles surrounding the quantum dots undergo a coarsening to form a complete layer comprised of gold-dot clusters. Next, growth proceeds dominantly via vertical growth of gold on these gold-dot clusters to form an <b>gold</b> <b>capping</b> layer. In this capping layer, a shift of the cluster boundaries due to ripening is found. Thus, a templating of gold on a CdSe quantum dot array is feasible at low gold coverage...|$|E

H 577 M AP 2015 Ngxiv, 93 leaves :color illustrations; 30 cmThis thesis {{presents}} the {{studies on the}} optical properties and applications of three types of periodic plasmonic structures, which were investigated by simulation using the Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) method, and by experiments through angular-dependent reflectivity measurements. The optical responses such as reflectivity, transmittance and electric field enhancement at the nanometer scale depend on the shape and size of nanostructures, which play pivotal roles {{in the design of}} devices based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. First of all, two-dimensional plasmonic nano-pillar structures were simulated. In such samples with Au/photoresist as the metal/dielectric materials, a thin gold layer was deposited perpendicularly on photoresist pillars, leading to isolated gold caps on dielectric pillars that are in turn surrounded by a perforated gold film. Propagating surface plasmon resonances (PSPRs) on the perforated film, and localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the gold caps, were simultaneously observed in such a structure. For the electric field distribution, the incident wave was confined at the Amonil pillars due to the coupling of resonant modes for the perforated gold film and the isolated <b>gold</b> <b>capping</b> layer. Reflection dips were blue-shifted and became sharper with increasing height of the dielectric pillars. The usage of such a device structure for refractive index sensing was discussed. For {{the second part of the}} project, plasmonic Au nanostructures with fractal behavior were investigated by RCWA technique. Fractal patterns that show self-similar behavior and space-filling geometrical arrangement can cause unique optical properties such as transmission enhancement. A type of fractal nanostructure based on Au film/glass substrate system was investigated in this thesis. The fractal pattern was named as center fractal nanostructure in the thesis, as the self-similarity effect occurs at the center of the structure. The effects of three structural parameters (edge length, periodicity and order) on the SPR (transmission dip) were studied. The electric field intensity enhancement factor was boosted with increasing order of the fractal pattern nanostructure. In particular, an electric-field intensity enhancement of ~ 70 times was achieved for the 3 rd order fractal pattern studied in this work. As compared with a continuous planar gold film on glass, transmission enhancement peaks were observed in the fractal nanostructure, and the transmission peak positions were controlled by the edge length of the fractal nanostructure. Properly designed nanostructures are known to produce so-called hot spots for locally enhancing the incident wave intensity. Such a structure is of potential for center fractal nanostructure to be used in antennas. Finally, SPR tuning via thermally-induced refractive index change in ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE) was studied. The transition behavior of the copolymer was found to be dependent on the thermal history. The refractive indices of P(VDF-TrFE) were 1. 3886 and 1. 3637 at 633 nm and 80 °C during heating and cooling processes respectively. One-dimensional gratings with periodicity 750 nm were used to excite the SPR. The resonant wavelength was found to change during the heating and cooling process. The experimental results of reflectivity measurement were compared with the simulation results. The results indicated the feasibility of bistable SPR in solid-state structures.

40|$|The high {{potential}} of bottom-up fabrication strategies for realizing sophisticated optical sensors combining the high sensitivity of a surface plasmon resonance with the exceptional properties of stimuli-responsive hydrogel is demonstrated. The sensor {{is composed of}} a periodic hole array in a gold film whose holes are filled with gold-capped poly(N-isoproyl-acrylamide) (polyNIPAM) microspheres. The production of this sensor relies on a pure chemical approach enabling simple, time-efficient, and cost-efficient preparation of sensor platforms covering areas of cm 2. The transmission spectrum of this plasmonic sensor shows a strong interaction between propagating surface plasmon polaritons at the metal film surface and localized surface plasmon resonance of the <b>gold</b> <b>cap</b> {{on top of the}} polyNIPAM microspheres. Computer simulations support this experimental observation. These interactions lead to distinct changes in the transmission spectrum, which allow for the simultaneous, sensitive optical detection of refractive index changes in the surrounding medium and the swelling state of the embedded polyNIPAM microsphere under the <b>gold</b> <b>cap.</b> The volume of the polyNIPAM microsphere located underneath the <b>gold</b> <b>cap</b> can be changed by certain stimuli such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, and distinct molecules bound to the hydrogel matrix facilitating the detection of analytes which do not change the refractive index of the surrounding medium significantly...|$|R
