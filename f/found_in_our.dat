John Goggin's ambitious program of historical archeology during the 1940s and 1950s generated a large collection of materials from sites throughout the Caribbean and Central America. His collaborations with such researchers as Emile Boyrie of the Dominican Republic, José Cruxent of Venezuela and Irving Rouse of Yale additionally resulted in the exchange of smaller comparative collections from throughout the region.|$|E

When Aslan breathed upon the first animal pairs, some not only gained thought and speech, but changed in size as well. Smaller animals (rodents, birds and small mammals) are larger than their non-talking relatives and larger animals are slightly smaller. Talking beasts can be divided into three main categories: Avian, Mammal, and Reptile. There are no talking fish or insects.|$|E

25|$|On the one hand, a materialist view of {{landscape}} tends to stress how {{it may be}} seen in terms of a set of resources, for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups. This leads one to turn, for example, to optimal foraging theory and other economic models for an understanding of how people exploited the landscape 'rationally'. Postprocessualists like to argue that landscapes are always viewed in different ways by different peoples. They reject the 'rational' view of 'landscape-as-a-set-of-resources' as that of our own society and one that is ideologically loaded in its own way, loaded towards ideas of commodity and exploitation <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own society. They suggest that ancient peoples would have had different views of what was 'real' in that landscape. On the other hand, an exclusively idealist view {{of landscape}} does not work either. Postprocessualists like to stress that such an understanding of landscape was not formed in the abstract—that the way people moved around and used that landscape affected their understanding of it.|$|E
25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> first kings' sceptres, {{have a lot}} less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.|$|E

[...] According to the Muslim sources reported by El-Cheikh, he tried to convert the ruling class of the Empire, but they resisted so strongly that he reversed his course and claimed that he was just testing their faith in Christianity. El-Cheikh notes that these accounts of Heraclius add [...] "little to our historical knowledge" [...] of the emperor; rather, they {{are an important part of}} [...] "Islamic kerygma," [...] attempting to legitimate Muhammad's status as a prophet.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers {{have found}} that almost all {{disorders}} and diseases that affect humans reflect the interplay between the environment and their genes; however {{we are still in}} the initial stages of understanding the specific role genes play on common disorders and diseases.

[...] But like other critics, after praising the book this same critic then turned around and disparaged it: [...] "Not that we mean to say Mr Dickens has outgrown his faults. They are as obvious as ever—sometimes even trying our patience rather hard.

2500|$|Of key {{important}} to Okabayashi's approach was a traditional concept of movement common to most koryū styles but {{not present in}} the teachings of most contemporary Daitō-ryū teachers. This concept was called 'hitoemi', and describes an idiosyncratic movement, readily seen in any Japanese period drama or koryū art, where the warrior class walk and perform techniques while lining their bodies up 'on one line' as they move forward. Okabayashi during his lengthy morning sessions acting uke, or receiver of techniques for Takeda noticed that his movements always seem to conform to this principle while other teachers, even {{those who had been}} taught by Tokimune did not always move so. When he asked the headmaster about this he reputedly replied obliquely saying [...] "The secret of Daitō-ryū is to be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> sword. Study the sword movements and you will find the answers. [...] " [...] As the koryū sword movements were based upon hitoemi Okabayashi took this to mean that he was {{moving in the right direction}} with his practise.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Imants Barušs, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments using the methods of EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive, and the work of [...] "instrumental transcommunication researcher" [...] Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP. Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: [...] "While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense." [...] The findings were published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2001, and include a literature review.|$|E

2500|$|Cornwallis {{was given}} the thanks of both Houses of Parliament, but fell out of favour with the Admiralty in October 1795 in a dispute about naval {{discipline}} and was court-martialed and censured in 1796 for abandoning a convoy to the West Indies due to damage to Royal Sovereign and ill-health. He entered retirement that year, but in 1801 he was given command of the Channel Fleet by Earl St Vincent {{and for the next}} five years led the blockade of the French Atlantic Fleet, most notably during the Trafalgar campaign of 1805 when he sent reinforcements to the fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson at a critical juncture. British historians have highly praised the conduct of Cornwallis and his men at the unequal battle: In 1825 Brenton wrote that Cornwallis's Retreat is [...] "justly considered one of the finest displays of united courage and coolness to be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> naval history." [...] while in 1827 William James wrote of the [...] "masterly retreat of Vice-admiral Cornwallis" [...] in which [...] "the spirit manifested by the different ships' companies of his little squadron, while pressed upon by a force from its threefold superiority so capable of crushing them, was just as ought always to animate British seamen when in the presence of an enemy." [...] Modern historian Robert Gardiner echoed this sentiment, noting in 1998 that [...] "'Cornwallis's Retreat' became as famous as many of the Royal Navy's real victories." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through a {{grant from}} the American Council of Learned Societies, Lomax was able to set out in June 1933 on the first {{recording}} expedition under the Library's auspices, with Alan Lomax (then eighteen years old) in tow. As now, a disproportionate percentage of African American males were held as prisoners. Robert Winslow Gordon, Lomax's predecessor at the Library of Congress, had written (in an article in the New York Times, c. 1926) that, [...] "Nearly every type of song is to be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> prisons and penitentiaries" [...] Folklorists Howard Odum and Guy Johnson also had observed that, [...] "If one wishes to obtain anything like an accurate picture of the workaday Negro he will surely find his best setting in the chain gang, prison, or in the situation of the ever-fleeing fugitive." [...] But what these folklorists had merely recommended John and Alan Lomax were able to put into practice. In their successful grant application they wrote, following Odum, Johnson and Gordon's hint, that prisoners, [...] "Thrown on their own resources for entertainment [...] [...] [...] still sing, especially the long-term prisoners who have been confined for years and who have not yet been influenced by jazz and the radio, the distinctive old-time Negro melodies." [...] They toured Texas prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads, and blues from prisoners such as James [...] "Iron Head" [...] Baker, Mose [...] "Clear Rock" [...] Platt, and Lightnin' Washington. By no means were all of those whom the Lomaxes recorded imprisoned, however: in other communities, they recorded K.C. Gallaway and Henry Truvillion.|$|E
