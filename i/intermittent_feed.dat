40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{experimental}} investigations carried out on a full‐scale ABR and on a pilot UASB to determine biomass washout for various <b>intermittent</b> <b>feed</b> conditions. Particularly, the tests aimed {{to determine the extent}} to which sludge washout is affected by such factors as: daily flow distribution; upflow velocity; concentration and sedimentation properties of the biomass. Moreover, in order to obtain a tool to estimate sludge washout in different influent flow conditions, a simulation model of the sludge transport phenomena in the upflow anaerobic reactors is proposed. The results showed that when the influent flow is interrupted for long periods (above 1 hour), once it is resumed considerable losses of biomass into the effluent were found, independent of the upflow velocity. In contrast, with shorter periods, regular sludge expansion took place even with very high upflow velocities (up to 4 m h− 1), giving rise to limited sludge washout and high removal efficiencie...|$|E

However, there is no study dealing with the effect of CIR on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity as the main neuro-endocrine system in this regard. In the present study, the effect of CIR (<b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding)</b> on metabolic responses to stress was examined. Material and Methods: Female mice with an average weight of 27 ± 3 g were divided into 4 groups of 7. The control group received adequate food and water without stress. The second group was deprived from food (2 hours/day for seven consecutive days) and then electro foot-shock stress was applied to them for 4 days. The third group was deprived from food 2 hours/day for a week, and the fourth group received 4 days of electric shock without food deprivation. Blood samples were collected from all animals for plasma corticosterone evaluation. Results: Stress and intermittent food increased plasma corticosterone levels while <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> when combined with stress, no increment was observed in plasma corticosterone level. Stress decreased food intake, but the <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> with or without stress increased food intake.

Five mares were treated while five mares were controls for this crossover, blinded study.

40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) is an {{important}} natural source of carbon, energy and nutrients for heterotrophic microbial communities both in natural and artificial ecosystems. How this DOM influences more specific functionality such as organic pollutant degradation is unknown. In this study, we examined in which way the degradation activity of a triple-species microbial biofilm, which synergistically mineralizes the phenylurea herbicide linuron, is affected when biofilms were, in addition to linuron, supplemented with DOM samples of natural origin with varying biodegradability. When DOM samples were inoculated with the linuron degrading consortium a synergistic degradation of recalcitrant DOM was observed in this way increasing the biodegradable fraction which can be made available. This synergistic metabolism of natural compounds was confirmed based on metabolic fingerprinting with GN 2 microplates, showing a 17 % increase in carbon sources {{that could be used}} in comparison with the capabilities of the individual strains. The effect of DOM on linuron degradation was first assessed for suspended cells. Degradation rate and lag phases improved depending on the quality of DOM resulting in an overall increased removal of linuron. The quantity of DOM made this effect more pronounced. When mature biofilms were grown on linuron as sole carbon and energy source an <b>intermittent</b> <b>feed</b> with additional DOM changed biomass, structure and composition which clearly depended on the type of DOM and these changes could be related to the observed changes in the linuron degrading activity of the biofilms. Quality and quantity of DOM affects biofilm structure and composition, but also enzymatic activity of the individual species leading to concomitant effects on functionality such as pesticide degradation. This has implications for the natural attenuation of pesticides in natural ecosystems like soils and surface water. Depending on the characteristics of DOM and its abundance, pesticide degrading microbial communities can be affected, either positive or negative, regarding biodegradation of pesticides. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Chicks of a {{heavy-bodied}} strain were {{deprived of}} food on alternate days from 14 to 83 days of age. Relative food intake was depressed by <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> to 25 days of age, {{after which the}} deprived chicks resumed the relative intake of the ad libitum-ied controls, i. e., the relative intake on repletion day was twice that of the control chicks. Following an adaptation period of 2 weeks, the relative growth rate of the intermittently fed chicks exceeded that of the control group, the excessive growth being due to an increase {{on the day of}} repletion which was more than twice that of the control birds. Body fat concentration was depressed by <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> throughout the experimental period.

40|$|In various {{activated}} sludge systems, the biomass grows under transient (unbalanced) {{conditions and the}} storage response (formation of internal polymers as the fastest adaptation to the changing environment) becomes important. The aim of the present work was to select mixed cultures with high storage response by cultivation on an acetate-limited medium in a completely mixed reactor operated with <b>intermittent</b> <b>feed</b> (CSTR-i) and to characterise their storage response by using batch experiments under different experimental conditions. Even though kinetic selection based on storage response should bring about predominance of floc-formers, in this work a bulking sludge was established steadily for long periods and starting from different inocula. Batch experiments showed that the mixed culture dominated by the filamentous bacteria presented immediate response to the substrate spike with both substrate removal and storage of it as PHB at high rates, in the range 740 divided by 920 and 510 divided by 610 COD mg/COD g h, respectively. According to the COD balance, storage of poly- 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was practically the only significant metabolism Moreover, these filaments were able to store PHB about up to their dry weight and were highly resistant to long starvation (24 h). Both high storage response and resistance to starvation can contribute to competitive advantage of these filaments in a large range of operating conditions. Nevertheless, inactivity under anoxic conditions makes easy to control bulking by metabolic selection. Although better insight into implications for full-scale plants must be gained, these results confirm that population dynamics under transient conditions is mainly due to storage phenomena and indicate that a competitive advantage of floc-formers against filaments, under such a selective pressure, has not to be considered as an absolute rule.

40|$|In various {{activated}} sludge systems, the biomass grows under transient (unbalanced) {{conditions and the}} storage response (formation of internal polymers as the fastest adaptation to the changing environment) becomes important. Till now the role of storage on population dynamics has been deeply investigated under anaerobic (EBPR processes) or aerobic (bulking control) conditions. Little {{attention has been given}} to processes including anoxic conditions even though in many of them storage phenomena are likely to occur (anoxic selectors, nitrogen removal processes with addition of an external source of readily biodegradable COD or with aerobic contact/anoxic stabilization). For these reasons, the aim of the present work was to investigate storage and succeeding use of stored products under anoxic and mixed (anoxic/aerobic) conditions. Batch experiments have shown that a mixed culture selected under aerobic conditions and <b>intermittent</b> <b>feed</b> (acetate-limited medium), was also able to take up acetate (90 - 100 mgCOD/gCOD h) and store it as PHB (35 - 40 mgCOD/gCOD h) under anoxic conditions. After acetate depletion, the stored PHB was used for growth and maintenance. The NUR on acetate in the presence of storage was 20 mgN/gVSS h (which corresponded to a COD removal of 6. 9 mgCOD/mgN) while it dropped to 10 - 3 mgN/gVSS h in the "endogenous phase" when denitrification was on the stored PHB. The presence of aerobic conditions instead of anoxic ones had a major positive effect on the rate and yield of PHB storage while it had only a minor effect on the rate of PHB consumption. The latter observation can be explained by assuming that the hydrolysis of the stored product is the rate limiting step of the "endogenous" metabolism and that the hydrolysis rate is not highly dependent on aerobic-anoxic conditions. Cross-comparison of PHB storage and consumption under aerobic/anoxic conditions made it possible to determine that, in the particular mixed culture under investigation, all aerobic heterotrophs able to store were also able to denitrify.

40|$|We report {{preliminary}} results on experimental investigations on condensation {{in the framework}} of the European Space Agency funded programme Enhanced Condensers in Microgravity (ENCOM- 2) which aims at better understanding underlying phenomena during condensation. The first experiment is a study on condensation of HFE on external curvilinear surface of 15 mm height during reduced gravity experiments. It is found that the local minimum of the film thickness exists at the conjugation area of condensed film and the meniscus {{at the bottom of the}} fin; this leads to the local maximum of the heat transfer coefficient, which we also found moves towards the fin tip. The second experiment is a study of falling films hydrodynamics inside a vertical long pipe. In particular, characteristics of wavy falling films produced employing intermittent liquid feed are examined in order to assess wave effects on film condensation. Preliminary results suggest that <b>intermittent</b> <b>feed</b> simply divides the film in two autonomous regions with the wave feature of each one depending only on its flow rate. The processing of registered film thickness data can lead to the estimation of the transverse velocity profile in the film, which is mainly responsible for heat transfer during condensation. The third experiment looks at in-tube convective condensation at low mass fluxes (typical of Loop Heat Pipes and Capillary Pumped Loops) of n-pentane inside a 0. 56 mm diameter channel. The results show that the mean heat transfer in the annular zone when it is elongated may be less than the mean heat transfer when it is shorter, due to the interface deformation involved by surface tension effect. When the length of this annular zone reaches a critical value, the interface becomes unstable, and a liquid bridge forms, involving the release of a bubble. The heat transfer due to the phase-change in this isolated bubble zone appears to be very small compared to the sensible heat transfer: the bubbles evolve and collapse in a highly subcooled liquid. The last experiment concerns in-tube condensation of R 134 a inside a square channel of 1. 23 mm hydraulic diameter at mass fluxes of 135 kg m− 2 s− 1 and 390 kg m− 2 s− 1 for three different configurations: horizontal, vertical downflow and vertical upflow. For the calculated heat transfer coefficient it is found that gravity has no effect on condensation in downflow configurations at 390 kg m− 2 s− 1 and in upflow conditions at both values of mass velocity. The effect of gravity on the condensation heat transfer coefficient becomes noteworthy in downflow at mass velocity G = 135 kg m− 2 s− 1 and vapour quality lower than 0. 6.

In this study, we investigate the effect of alternating light/darkness regimes with <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> on the growth and survival of piscivorous larvae of two Scombrid species: Atlantic bonito, Sarda sarda (Bloch, 1793) and Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus, 1758). First we tested if the manipulation of a light regime generated <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> by analyzing the larval stomach content. Then, we conducted two laboratory experiments to identify the best alternating light regime that maximized larval growth and survival by comparing the results to those obtained using continuous light regimes. The manipulation of light was optimized to provide <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> opportunities for the larvae, since we discovered a clear interruption of feeding in darkness. An increase in specific ingestion throughout the day was observed in all experiments, reaching a maximum peak late in the day. Bluefin tuna larval growth rates were similar despite different alternating conditions whereas the bonito larvae grew best when provided with light at three hour intervals. In both species, growth under alternating light conditions was similar to the 15 hours continuous light treatment. No differences between the alternating and the continuous light treatments were observed in terms of their survival. Our results suggest that alternating light/feeding periods may have a beneficial effect on ingestion rates; possibly because feeding is less satiation-limited, metabolic costs are lower; or food digestion is more efficient under these conditions.

40|$|Lipids and {{long-chain}} {{fatty acids}} (LCFA) are energy-rich compounds {{that can be}} used as carbon and energy source by anaerobic microbial communities. Theoretically, large amounts of methane, a valuable energy carrier, may be generated during this process. However, operational problems, mainly associated with LCFA accumulation onto the sludge, have limited the use of anaerobic technology to produce methane from LCFA. In this work, two novel start-up strategies were tested for optimal methane production from LCFA: (i) bioreactor start-up using a <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy, and (ii) bioreactor bioaugmentation with a LCFA-degrading bacterium. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> start-up resulted in efficient continuous methane production from high LCFA loads (up to 21 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1, 50 % COD as oleate (unsaturated LCFA, C 18 : 1)). Alternating continuous bioreactor feeding and batch degradation periods, during bioreactor start-up, was crucial for sludge acclimation and contributed {{to the development of a}} metabolically specialized anaerobic microbial community that was able to efficiently convert oleate to methane. After <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> bioreactor start-up, methane yields higher than 70 % were achieved, and neither LCFA nor VFA accumulated in the system.

Anaerobic sludge amended with active and inactive S. zehnderi was incubated with 1 mM oleate as sole carbon and energy source.

Overall, the results suggest that trout that received a skip-a-day feeding schedule one month before slaughter, adapt better to a two day fast than trout fed daily or once every four days...|$|R
30|$|Atrophy of {{skeletal}} muscle mass {{is an almost}} universal problem in survivors of critical illness and is associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. Contrary to common practice, the provision of protein/amino acids as a continuous infusion significantly limits protein synthesis whereas <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> maximally stimulates {{skeletal muscle}} synthesis. Furthermore, whey-based protein (high in leucine) increases muscle synthesis compared to soy or casein-based protein. In addition to its adverse effects on skeletal muscle synthesis, continuous feeding is unphysiological and has adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and gastrointestinal function. I propose that critically ill patients’ be fed intermittently with a whey-based formula and that such an approach {{is likely to be}} associated with better glycemic control, less hepatic steatosis and greater preservation of muscle mass. This paper provides the scientific basis for my approach to <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> of critically ill patients.|$|R

40|$|A {{rotating}} {{biological contactor}} (RBC) was used to treat shock loadings of 4 -fluorocinnamic acid (4 -FCA). Intermittent 4 -FCA shocks of 35 mg L 1 were applied (ca. 3 months) with only limited mineralization occurring and accumulation of 4 -fluorobenzoate (4 -FBA) as an intermediate. After bioaugmentation with a degrading bacterium the RBC was {{able to deal with}} 4 -FCA intermittent loading of 80 mg L 1 however, a gradual decline in RBC performance occurred, leading to 4 -FBA accumulation.

Distinct bacterial communities in the 1 st and the 5 th and 10 th stages of the RBC were revealed by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis.

Also, this paper was studied the effects of diet with enzymes supplementation on ileal viscosity and further on litter qualityAn {{experiment was}} conducted to study {{the effect of a}} diet with high structural component on the performance of ad lib and intermittently-fed broiler chickens; whether the supplemented enzymes had effect on ileal viscosity and litter quality. Broiler chicken were given, either ad lib or intermittently, barley-oat-wheat based experimental diet in whole grains and commercial maize-wheat based diet contain less fibrous content from 11 days of age, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. For ad lib feeding, birds got access to feed constantly for 18 hours through continuous light and 6 hours darkness in two rooms. For <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding,</b> in one room, feed was available for three 1 -h feeding bouts plus one 2 -h feeding bout per day. This was completed by frequently removal of feed and switching off the light at night, from day 7 to 14. From day 14 and onward, it was changed to 5 1 -h feeding bout/day {{until the end of the}} experiment. Litter quality were scored at day 22. The empty gizzard weights recorded from intermittently and ad lib fed birds at 29 and 34 & 35 days of age respectively. The ileal viscosity was also measured at day 34 & 35. The structural component interacted on adaptability of broiler chickens to <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> indicated by higher feed intake of diet consisting of whole grains (barley, oat and wheat) than wheat-maize based diet. For the empty gizzard weights from intermittently fed birds there was no significant difference at day 29, however the gizzard weights differed from ad lib fed birds at the end of experiment. Furthermore, the reduction of ileal viscosity due to enzyme supplementation (Wang et al., 1992), has found in birds fed barley-oat-wheat based diet. In conclusion, broiler chickens quickly adapted to <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> through high structural component diets, without reduction of performance. With improved feed efficiency and enzyme supplementation, the ileal viscosity was not as high as when diet without enzymes (Classen, 1996) M-F...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Muscle growth {{depends on}} the fusion of proliferate {{satellite}} cells to existing myofibers. We reported previously that 0 – 14 day <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> led to persistent retardation in myofiber hypertrophy. However, how satellite cells respond to such nutritional insult has not been adequately elucidated. Results One-day-old broiler chicks were allocated to control (Con, ad libitum <b>feeding),</b> <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> (IF, feed provided on alternate days) and re-feeding (RF, 2 days ad libitum feeding after 12 days of <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding)</b> groups. Chickens were killed on Day 15 and satellite cells were isolated. When cultured, satellite cells from the IF group demonstrated significant retardation in proliferation and differentiation potential, while RF partly restored the proliferation rate and differentiation potential of the satellite cells. Significant up-regulation of insulin like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) (P 0. 05) and thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) (P 0. 05), and down-regulation of growth hormone receptor (GHR) (P 0. 01) and IGF-I (P 0. 01) mRNA expression was observed in freshly isolated IF satellite cells when compared with Con cells. In RF cells, the mRNA expression of IGF-I was higher (P 0. 05) and of TRα was lower (P 0. 01) than in IF cells, suggesting that RF restored the mRNA expression of TRα and IGF-I, but not of GHR and IGF-IR. The Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio tended to increase in the IF group, which was reversed in the RF group (P 0. 05), indicating that RF reduced the pro-apoptotic influence of IF. Moreover, no significant effect of T 3 was detected on cell survival in IF cells compared with Con (P P 0. 05) cells. Conclusions These data suggest that early-age feed restriction inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells, induces changes in mRNA expression of the GH/IGF-I and thyroid hormone receptors in satellite cells, as well as blunted sensitivity of satellite cells to T 3, and that RF partially reverses these effects. Thus, a moderate nutritional strategy for feed restriction should be chosen in early chick rearing systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Olive mill {{wastewater}} (OMW) is the effluent {{generated by}} olive oil industries, mainly {{produced in the}} Mediterranean areas. The production of olive oil generates huge amounts of wastewater. Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes appears as a promising technology for the treatment and energetic potential recovery of these high strength wastewaters since a renewable energy source (biogas) is generated. However, due to the high organic contents and presence of lipidic and phenolic compounds the treatment of OMW is sometimes toxic to the anaerobic microorganisms. Aiming at define the best strategy for the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor start-up, two reactors were operated with an hydraulic retention time of 10 days, fed with OMW at 5 gCOD/L. In batch assays it was previously observed that when using an adapted microbial consortium to lipids, OMW was more efficiently converted to biogas and the overall methane production was higher. On the other hand an <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> start-up was proven to promote the degradation of long chain fatty acids to methane. Therefore, two reactors, R 1 and R 2 were inoculated with a biomass acclimated to oleate (BAO) and a biomass non-acclimated (BNA), respectively. The inoculum type effect on start-up efficiency {{and the benefits of}} an <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> were studied. In both reactors, the COD removal efficiency reached more than 80 % after 50 days of operation. The reactor with BAO was more stable during the operation period than in the reactor with BNA. The inoculums effect was determinant in the initial phase of feeding, but, as expected, its effect was diluted after 30 days. The <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> was tested in R 1.

40|$|In {{large-scale}} production reactors {{the combination of}} high broth viscosity and large broth volume leads to insufficient liquid-phase mixing, resulting in gradients in, for example, the concentrations of substrate and oxygen. This often leads to differences in productivity of the full-scale process compared with laboratory scale. In this scale-down study of penicillin production, the influence of substrate gradients on process performance and cell physiology was investigated by imposing an <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> regime on a laboratory-scale culture of a high yielding strain of Penicillium chrysogenum. It was found that penicillin production was reduced {{by a factor of}} two in the intermittently fed cultures relative to constant feed cultivations fed with the same amount of glucose per hour, while the biomass yield was the same. Measurement of the levels of the intermediates of the penicillin biosynthesis pathway, along with the enzyme levels, suggested that the reduction of the flux through the penicillin pathway is mainly the result of a lower influx into the pathway, possibly due to inhibitory levels of adenosine monophosphate and pyrophosphate and lower activating levels of adenosine triphosphate during the zero-substrate phase of each cycle of <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding...</b>|$|R
40|$|Substrate {{limitation}} responsive biosensors {{have been}} used {{for the development of a}} mini-bioreactor platform that can be used as a scale-down tool. Three green fluorescent protein (GFP) transcriptional reporters have been chosen in Escherichia coli, i. e., uspA::gfp, csiE::gfp and yciG::gfp. Our previous studies have shown that these kinds of promoters are induced in response to substrate limitation and are significantly repressed when cultures are carried out in heterogeneous bioreactors. This sensitivity to substrate limitation has been confirmed in the case of the csiE and yciG biosensors. A mini-scale-down platform is proposed as a high throughput tool to rapidly investigate the usefulness of a given microbial biosensor. This platform is composed of shake flasks able to operate in fed-batch mode either using the slow release or the <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> principle. Local heterogeneities were reproduced at the level of these mini-bioreactors (operating under the <b>intermittent</b> <b>feeding</b> principle) and caused a decrease in GFP expression as in conventional scale-down reactors.
