5|$|The Apollo {{program has}} been called the {{greatest}} technological achievement in human history. Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015. The <b>flight</b> <b>computer</b> design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was, along with the Polaris and Minuteman missile systems, the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits (IC). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. While the Navy and Air Force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high.|$|E

More complex applications, such as synthetic aperture radar, remained the domain of analog computing well into the 1980s, since digital computers were insufficient for the task.|$|E

25|$|Autonetics was the {{associate}} contractor for the Minuteman (MM) guidance system, {{which included the}} flight and prelaunch software. This software was programmed in assembly language into a D17 disk computer. TRW provided the guidance equations that Autonetics programmed and was also responsible for the verification of the flight software.

The targeting was done at Strategic Air Command (SAC) Headquarters by the Operational Targeting Program developed by TRW to execute on an IBM 709 mainframe computer.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} address the {{inherent}} flight instability of a flying wing aircraft, the B-2 uses a complex quadruplex computer-controlled fly-by-wire flight control system, that can automatically manipulate flight surfaces and settings without direct pilot inputs {{in order to maintain}} aircraft stability. The <b>flight</b> <b>computer</b> receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's current air speed and angle of attack via pitot-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional pitot tubes which would negatively affect the aircraft's stealth capabilities. The flight actuation system incorporates both hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed {{with a high level of}} redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.|$|E
25|$|When the {{aircraft}} was on final, the pilots received several warnings from ATC {{that they were}} 1000–2000 meters {{to the left of}} the landing course, followed by another warning that they were too low. The pilots were confused about their location and were trying to figure it out based on reports from ATC, the <b>flight</b> <b>computer</b> and a portable GPS device. According to the final investigation report, they also ignored automatic altitude readouts that started at 60 m above ground level and continued every 10 m. Nine seconds before the impact, the pilot contacted ATC to ask if they were off course, still concentrated on aligning {{the aircraft}} with the runway and not on its altitude. The pilots made no effort to stop the descent.|$|E

25|$|Faced {{with the}} lack of {{reliable}} basic flight instrument readings, constant contradictory warnings from the aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>computer</b> (some of which were valid and some of which were not) and believing that they were at a safe altitude, 58-year-old Captain Eric Schreiber Ladrón de Guevara, a veteran pilot who had logged almost 22,000 flight hours, and 42-year-old First Officer David Fernández Revoredo, who had logged almost 8,000 flight hours, decided to begin descent for the approach to the airport. Since the flight was at night over water, no visual references could be made to convey to the pilots their true altitude or aid their descent. As a consequence of the pilots' inability to precisely monitor the aircraft's airspeed or vertical speed, they experienced multiple stalls, resulting in rapid loss of altitude with no corresponding change on the altimeter. While the altimeter indicated an altitude of approximately 9,700 feet, the aircraft's true altitude was in fact much lower.|$|E

500|$|Two A330 {{incidents}} due to in-flight malfunctions were {{survived by}} all on board. On 24 August 2001, Air Transat Flight 236, an A330-200, developed a fuel leak over the Atlantic Ocean {{due to an}} incorrectly installed hydraulic part {{and was forced to}} glide for over 15 minutes to an emergency landing in the Azores. On 7 October 2008, Qantas Flight 72, an A330-300, suffered a rapid loss of altitude in two sudden uncommanded pitch-down manoeuvres while [...] from the RAAF Learmonth air base in northwestern Australia. [...] After declaring an emergency, the crew landed the aircraft safely at Learmonth. It was later determined that the incident, which caused 106 injuries, 14 of them serious, {{was the result of a}} design flaw of the plane's Air Data Inertial Reference Unit and a limitation of the aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>computer</b> software.|$|E

500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the <b>flight</b> <b>computer</b> recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E

From January 1984 to September 1986, two F-15As were used as launch platforms for the ASAT missile. The F-15As were modified to carry one ASM-135 on the centerline station with extra equipment within a special centerline pylon.
