2500|$|According to , Hannah named Samuel {{to commemorate}} her prayer to God for a child. [...] " [...] [...] [...] [...] called his name Samuel, saying, Because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{him of the}} Lord" [...] (KJV). The Hebrew root {{rendered}} as [...] "asked" [...] in the KJV is [...] "sha’al", a word mentioned seven times in 1 Samuel 1. Once it is even mentioned in the form [...] "sha’ul", Saul’s name in Hebrew (1 Samuel 1:28).|$|E
2500|$|On 1 March 2007, Sky's {{agreement}} to provide its basic channels (including Sky News) to Virgin Media expired. At midnight, Sky News was removed and the EPG entry for the channel {{was changed to}} [...] "Sky Snooze Try BBC" [...] until Sir Richard Branson demanded the message be removed saying <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> them to take it down. We do not mean any disrespect to Sky News. I {{think it is a}} very good news channel.|$|E
2500|$|On his website, he {{discussed}} the false allegation, saying, [...] "The accusation that I {{do not speak}} or interact with ladies who are not veiled is an absurdity.... It's true that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> my manager to respectfully request that lady presenters refrain from embracing me when giving awards or during public appearances, but {{that has nothing to}} do with my feelings or respect for them. Islam simply requires me to honour the dignity of ladies or young girls who are not closely related to me, and avoid physical intimacy, however innocent it may be." [...] He added, [...] "My four daughters all follow the basic wearing of clothes which modestly cover their God-given beauty. They're extremely well educated; they do not cover their faces and interact perfectly well with friends and society." ...|$|E
60|$|There he stopped. I put a {{question}} to him--the first that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> yet.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the hilt}} of his sword {{each of them}} swore to do as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked.</b>|$|R
60|$|What was I to do? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> {{myself that}} {{question}} several times, and now I asked it again.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{when the}} Soviet {{minister}} of commerce Anastas Mikoyan met the Wärtsilä manager Wilhelm Wahlforss, he expressed his satisfaction on quality {{and performance of}} Kapitan-class, and casually mentioned, {{that there is a}} need for even stronger icebreakers for the polar waters. He listed the requirements on a sheet of paper. Wahlforss called the Hietalahti shipyard manager Eric Holmström and the company's icebreaker specialist Ernst Bäckström to a meeting asking: [...] "Are we able to construct a such ship?" [...] Bäckström answered directly: [...] "Yes, we are." [...] Subsequently, Bäckström made a 1:500-scaled sketch of the new 22,000-hp icebreaker in relation to Kapitan-class. Wahlforss took the drawing with him in 1954 to a meeting in Moscow where he had dinner with Mikoyan. When Mikoyan opened the discussion about the new icebreaker concept, Wahlforss took the drawing from his suitcase asking [...] "Is this what you need?". Mikoyan became very delighted and said: [...] "For three years <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> from our own shipyards for possibility to construct a such icebreaker, but I have only got headshaking!" ...|$|E
2500|$|From August 4 to 12, 1850, the Melvilles {{and their}} {{neighbor}} Sarah Morewood, Evert Duyckinck, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and other literary figures from New York and Boston, came to Pittsfield {{to enjoy a}} period of social parties, picnics, dinners, and the like. On August 5, Nathaniel Hawthorne and his publisher James T. Fields joined the group, while Hawthorne's wife stayed at home {{to look after the}} children. As the men took a stroll through Ice Glen, someone noticed that Hawthorne and Melville were absent, and the group went looking for the two, who were at last found [...] "deep in conversation." [...] The following day, the group visited the Hawthornes, who since May had been living in nearby Lenox. [...] "I liked Melville so much," [...] Hawthorne wrote to his friend Horatio Bridge, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> him to spend a few days with me," [...] an uncharacteristic move for a man so attached to his work that he would not suffer overnight guests to keep him from it. The following days, Melville wrote the essay [...] "Hawthorne and His Mosses," [...] a review of Hawthorne's Mosses from an Old Manse that appeared in two installments, on August 17 and 24, in The Literary World.|$|E
2500|$|Disagreement {{persists}} {{over who}} originated {{the metaphor of}} a [...] "stab in the back" [...] as an explanation for losing the First World War. [...] What emerges clearly from Thaer's observations is {{that the idea of}} off-loading responsibility for military defeat away from the military leadership originated in the Supreme Army Command. [...] Even though Hindenburg and Ludendorff tried to shift the blame for the threatened defeat [...] - and therefore the failure of their own predications to come true - during the later years of the war, away from the army, there was not at this point any talk of a planned or treacherous conspiracy. [...] But there was talk of the forces having been let down by shortcomings on the homefront, whereby inadequate soldiers and insufficient war resources had been supplied by the civilain authorities. [...] Thaer quotes Ludendorff on 1 October 1918: [...] "Right now we have no chancellor. [...] Whoever gets appointed, there are {{things that need to be}} done. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> His Majesty to bring into government those whom we have to thank that we have come to the present position. [...] We will now see these gentlemen taking over the ministries. [...] They must now conclude the peace that must be concluded. [...] Let them now take the gruel that they have been delivering to us!" [...] This argument can really only be interpreted as a form of retreat-ideology, and in that sense the first phase in the development of the [...] Dolchstoß legend. [...] It served to obscure the failures of the military leadership, and from there of certain specific individuals.|$|E
60|$|JACK. I {{really am}} awfully sorry--my head's so jolly bad. <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>asked</b> the butler, {{but he has}} n't seen it.|$|R
60|$|I felt quite uncomfortable--as if Mrs. Micawber {{supposed}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> her to {{do anything}} of the sort!--and sat looking at her in alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is weary work. Would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> you {{to bring}} that new tale of yours, Scribe Ana, {{that we might have}} read it together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Lady Lovel. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{much from}} her, {{and she has}} given me all that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> nothing, and now claim nothing, as payment for service done. If Lady Anna thinks she is in my debt after such fashion as that, I will soon make her free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, {{the usual}} set. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> Lord Grotrian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have heard}} nothing about your {{property}} {{but what you}} yourself have said unasked. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> no question about your property.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{remembered the}} answer {{of the old}} {{housekeeper}} at the parsonage, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> to see the clergyman. [...] "This, then, was his father's residence?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{just before}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for the rifle <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{perceived}} a little klipspringer antelope {{standing on a}} mass of rock about seventy yards away, and determined to risk the shot.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't in {{the least}} mind your {{laughing}} at me. <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> minded it very much if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> you to marry me, and you had refused me." ...|$|R
60|$|Ger. Hail, fathers. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{permission}} of the prior to minister your refection, and bring you thereby the first news of the pageant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I simply {{mean that}} even {{you could hardly}} have asked Miss Effingham such a question. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her, and she has refused me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why are you evading?" [...] she asked. [...] "I am {{sure it is}} {{not because}} you have not settled convictions. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> you--a favour." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the reply}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for; {{but it was}} not {{explicit}} enough, now <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got it, to satisfy me. I felt the necessity of leading him (if possible) into details.|$|R
60|$|There was a stillness {{about her}} then, {{a light on}} her face, which brought to my mind thought of Sally when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> her to marry me.|$|R
60|$|I {{found my}} speech then--a wretched, hesitating speech, for which I hated myself--and replied, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> {{to be allowed}} to see her as soon as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{informed}} of her existence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why didn't {{you tell}} me, dear?' Alice still sleepily whispered. 'Would <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> a single question? How could I? Oh, {{if you had}} only trusted me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Art thou mocking thy master, Gino? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> thee if {{thou art}} {{acquainted with the}} person of a certain Jacopo Frontoni, a dweller here in Venice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do like her,--I {{love her}} {{better than any}} one in the world; better even than you, Mary; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her to be my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{done wrong}} {{directly}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> him,' rejoined his lordship; 'and yet {{he would not}} <b>have</b> come if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not made such a point of it. I think I will put him off.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for letters at the post-office, {{but there}} were none for Mr. Redmond. I {{did not like to}} add that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been ashamed, after the first week, to write to my mother.|$|R
60|$|Martin gave in handsomely, I'll admit, and I am {{confident}} that at that moment, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> permission to pull one of his teeth, {{he would not have}} denied me.|$|R
6000|$|... "To be frank, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{myself the}} question, and couldn't be quite {{sure it was}} {{altogether}} because {{she wanted me to}} get this unfortunate steamboat off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} so happy {{that she should be}} there; but what am I to do, Frank, if she refuses? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her, and she has refused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{would think}} the fellow lived next door," [...] Ricardo growled impatiently. [...] "Hang it all, can't you {{understand}} a plain question? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> you the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} may--if {{you are really}} {{convinced}} {{that he wants to}} hear it," [...] she said at last, as if barely recollecting that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> the question two minutes previously.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> {{him if he}} had a {{cure for}} your local fever," [...] said the Bishop with a laugh, [...] "for against it, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken so much that my ears buzz, quinine cannot prevail." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders, as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> {{what he would}} do in an {{earthquake}} with two rows of New York skyscrapers falling on his head from both sides of a street.|$|R
