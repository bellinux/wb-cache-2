5|$|In 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment America {{released}} the Infamous Collection to be bundled with a 250 GB PlayStation 3, , , a PlayStation Plus 30-day <b>free</b> <b>trial,</b> and {{the entirety of}} the Infamous 2 DLC.|$|E
5|$|A Steam {{version of}} the client was {{released}} on February 14, 2014. A beta for the PlayStation 4 version of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn debuted {{on the same day}} as the Japanese release of the console, February 22, 2014. Owners of the PlayStation 3 client were able upgrade to the digital PlayStation 4 client for free. A two-week <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> version first became available for PC on July 31, 2014, with PlayStation 3 and 4 versions following in December. This two-week limitation was removed in March 2017; <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> players can access all content up to level 35 with no time restrictions. The Chinese version, published and administrated by Shanda Games, premiered on August 29, 2014 featuring content through patch 2.16. It features separate servers from the other language versions of the game and a pay-per-hour micropayment billing system. The Korean version, distributed by Actoz Soft, launched in South Korea on August 14, 2015 with content from patch 2.2. This version carries a flexible subscription model with increments as low as 5 hours, similar to the Chinese release, up to 90 days, much like the traditional monthly payment plan.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} its release in August 2001, Funcom began {{offering}} <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> subscriptions, now common practice for other {{games in the}} MMOG genre. New players were able {{to sign up for}} accounts that remained free for a limited number of days. This required them to supply some personal information, including a credit card number. After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue playing the game at the cost of the monthly subscription fee.|$|E
40|$|A {{monopolist}} {{can offer}} free samples or free returns to let consumers try his product. When {{the cost of}} offering <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> is negligible, the standard theory (Milgrom 1981, Grossman 1981) predicts unraveling: the monopolist always offers them to reveal his product’s quality. I show that when products differ in vertical quality and a horizontal attribute, unraveling may not occur. When consumers know the product’s vertical quality, the monopolist offers <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> for a central region of horizontal attributes. He {{is less likely to}} offer <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> when quality is higher. Mandating <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> may hurt expected consumer welfare. When consumers do not know the product’s vertical quality, the monopolist is more likely to offer <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> when quality is higher. Nevertheless, he may not offer <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> even when his product has the highest possible vertical quality...|$|R

5|$|On September 18, 2013, Nintendo {{announced}} Wii Sports Club for the Wii U Nintendo eShop. The game {{features the}} five games of Wii Sports remade in high-definition graphics, with {{support for the}} Wii MotionPlus (similar to Wii Sports Resort) and online multiplayer. The game uses a 'Club' system, in which players are registered to regional or national clubs, communicating with each other via Miiverse, and compete against other clubs for rankings. After a 24-hour <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> period, players can purchase a day pass to access all of the games, or purchase full access to the individual games. Tennis and Bowling were released on November 7, 2013, with the other games to follow at later dates.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1989s release, Swift {{stressed}} the importance of albums to artists and fans. In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In June 2015, Swift criticized Apple Music in an open letter for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog. The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> period, and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service. Swift's intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to the singer and the 1989 era memes. She re-added her entire catalog to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2016, Ubisoft {{revealed}} the game {{would be released}} on 15 November of that year for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms in six separate editions. In September 2016, {{it was announced that}} Watch Dogs 2 would have enhancements on PlayStation 4 Pro. In October 2016, Ubisoft announced that the Windows version was delayed to 29 November 2016 to ensure that the game was well-optimized. It was featured on the front cover of Edge in August. Two weeks from release, Ubisoft and Samsung partnered to bundle a free digital download of Watch Dogs 2 with the purchase of their solid-state disks or curved gaming monitors. Amazon Prime copies were subject to an early release, which revealed issues with the seamless multiplayer. Ubisoft vowed to repair the feature on schedule but on the day of release, the company said it was broken – citing persistent lagging and crashing. Cooperative multiplayer was enabled a week after the game's release. A <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> lasting three hours was released for PlayStation 4 on 17 January 2017; the Xbox One version was downloadable on 24 January.|$|E

5|$|ReCore {{was first}} {{revealed}} at E3 2015 during Microsoft's opening press conference. At {{the conclusion of}} the debut trailer, Microsoft revealed the game was to be released {{in the second quarter of}} 2016 on the Xbox One. On January 4, 2016, Microsoft announced that ReCore would also be released for Microsoft Windows. ReCore was released as the first title of Xbox's Play Anywhere program – the opportunity to play the game on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox One, no matter the platform for which it was initially purchased – on September 13, 2016, in North America and Australia, September 15 in Japan and September 16 in Europe. After the loading screens were criticized, a patch was made to assuage their long duration on the Xbox One. An artbook, The Art of ReCore, was published on September 27, 2016, by Dark Horse Comics. A <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> version lasting 30 minutes was released the following month in concurrence with an update launched to polish the audio, performance, waypoints, achievement tracking, collision locations, checkpoints and respawn points. ReCore: Definitive Edition was released on August 29, 2017. The definitive edition adds new story content, new areas to explore, and quality-of-life gameplay changes and fixes.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{release of}} Final Fantasy XIV began development under the codename Rapture between late 2004 and early 2005, and was officially announced in 2009. This version {{was directed by}} Nobuaki Komoto and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, who was also serving as the producer of Final Fantasy XI, and employed the Crystal Tools engine, which had previously been used for Final Fantasy XIII. Following a bug-laden, abbreviated beta test period, the game released in September 2010 to near-universal negative reception. After two extensions to the initial <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> period, then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada issued a formal apology to players and fans in December 2010, and announced a dramatic overhaul in the development team, most prominently the removal of Tanaka from the project and the demotion of Komoto from Director to Lead Designer. Monthly fees for the game were suspended until further notice and the previously planned PlayStation 3 version was canceled. After the change in development team, Naoki Yoshida, who had worked as planning chief of Dragon Quest X, {{was brought in to}} supervise the project as both producer and director.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} the game sparked {{immediate}} player backlash {{in addition to its}} negative critical reception. Some of the controversy was produced by the use of gameplay features unusual for the genre. The main complaint by players was the user interface, followed by problems with the performance and aspects of gameplay. The initial 30-day <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> was extended twice in order to allow players to experience the new development team's updates before committing to the game. In December 2010, it was announced that Tanaka and Komoto had been removed from their posts as producer and director, with Tanaka taking full responsibility for the game's problems. The PS3 version was indefinitely delayed from its original March 2011 release date, with Square Enix saying that it would not release the game for that platform until it fully met the quality standards suitable for the Final Fantasy series. Subscriptions for the Windows version were also suspended indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> for high-tech services {{calls for a}} careful study of their effectiveness, and the drivers thereof. On the one hand, <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> can generate new paying subscribers, by allowing consumers to become acquainted with the service free of charge. On the other hand, a disappointing trial experience might alienate potential customers, when they decide not to adopt the system and are lost for good. This dilemma is particularly worrisome in early periods, when service quality has not been “tried and tested” in the field, and breakdowns occur. We accommodate these phenomena in a model of consumers’ free-trial and regular adoption decisions. Among other effects, it incorporates usage- and word-of-mouth-based learning about quality in a setting where quality itself is evolving. Consumers are forward-looking in that they account for changes in quality and anticipate uncertainty reduction due to trial usage. We estimate our model and run simulations {{on the basis of}} a rich and unique data set that incorporates customers’ trial subscription, adoption, and usage behavior for an interactive digital television service. The results underscore that <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> constitute a double-edged sword, and that timing and consumers’ usage intensity during the trial are key to the effectiveness of these promotions. Implications for managers are discussed...|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week of release, the PS3 version of A Realm Reborn placed second in Japan's sales charts, with 184,000 {{physical}} copies sold. In late October 2013, Square Enix announced that the game had one and a half million registrations. It was the 16th best selling personal computer game of 2013 in the United States. In Japan, the PlayStation 3 version was ranked 32 in sales, with 244,574 retail copies sold. Following an extremely poor fiscal year 2013, Square Enix executives commended the game's sales and subscriptions for its role in returning the company to profitability in 2014. As of July 2016, the game had over 6 million cumulative players, a figure which excludes <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> members. Yoshida has repeatedly emphasized that the robust success of A Realm Reborn was due to its traditional monthly subscription model. He sees the free-to-play model as an unreliable source of income predicated on devoting a lot of development resources to monthly consumable or cosmetic items in order to maintain profitability, leaving little time left for higher quality story and battle content. He also disclosed that over 80% of players are satisfied with the subscription model and theorized that this is due to players' confidence in a steady stream of quality content because of their subscription. With the traditional model, the player base grows over time as people see the game expand, unlike a free-to-play game which can boast a huge initial player base which changes dramatically in size and revenue from month to month. Yoshida has no plans to change to a free-to-play model in the near future.|$|E
