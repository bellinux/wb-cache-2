A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>compare</b> it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E

That there are angels, {{and that there are}} also evil spirits, the Bible says distinctly; and that they can sometimes appear to men. But it is most worthy of remark how little the Bible says about them, not how much; how it keeps them, as it were, in the background, instead of bringing them forward; while our forefathers seem continually talking of them, continually bringing them forward-- I had almost said they thought of nothing else. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>compare</b> the Holy Bible with the works which were most popular among our forefathers, especially among the lower class, till within the last 200 years, you will see at once what I mean,--how ghosts, apparitions, demons, witchcraft, are perpetually spoken of in them; how seldom they are spoken of in the Bible; lest, I suppose, men should think of them rather than of God, as our forefathers seem to have been but too much given to do.|$|E

40|$|This entry {{discusses}} {{a statistical}} issue that arises {{when using the}} Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to compare models. Stata calculates BIC, assuming N = e(N) —we will explain—but sometimes {{it would be better}} if a different N were used. Commands that calculate BIC have an n() option, allowing you to specify the N to be used. In summary, 1. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are <b>comparing</b> results estimated by the same estimation command, using the default BIC calculation is probably fine. There is an issue, but most researchers would ignore it. 2. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are <b>comparing</b> results estimated by different estimation commands, you need to be on your guard. a. If the different estimation commands share the same definitions of observations, independence, and the like, you are back in case 1. b. If they differ in these regards, you need to think about the value of N that should be used. For example, logit and xtlogit differ in that the former assumes independent observations and the latter, independent panels. c. If estimation commands differ in the events being used over which the likelihood function is calculated, the information criteria may not be comparable at all. We say information criteria because this would apply equally to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), as well as to BIC. For instance, streg and stcox produce such incomparable results. The events used by streg are the actual survival times, whereas the events used by stcox are failures within risk pools, conditional on the times at which failures occurred.

60|$|There is {{also another}} {{circulation}} abroad, (spread with a malignant intention, which I cannot attribute {{to those who}} say the same thing in this House,) that Mr. Grenville gave the colony agents an option for their assemblies to tax themselves, which they had refused. I find that much stress is laid on this, as a fact. However, it happens neither to be true nor possible. I will observe, first, that Mr. Grenville never thought fit to make this apology for himself in the innumerable debates that were had upon the subject. He might have proposed to the colony agents, that they should agree in some mode of taxation as the ground of an act of Parliament. But he never could have proposed that they should tax themselves on requisition, which is, the assertion of the day. Indeed, Mr. Grenville well knew that the colony agents could have no general powers to consent to it; and they had no time to consult their assemblies for particular powers, before he passed his first revenue act. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>compare</b> dates, you will find it impossible.

60|$|Ans. For answer, It {{is clear}} from John 1:1 that the Word or Son of God, as he was a Spirit, was with the Father before the world was (Titus 1:2). But now, in the fulness of time, that is, when that time that the Father and he had {{concluded}} on, was come, 'God sent forth his son [which was with him before the world was (John 17:5)] made of a woman' (Gal 4:4); that is, born of a woman. 'And took upon him {{the form of a}} servant, and was made in the likeness of men' (Phil 2:6,7). Now as he was born of a woman, as he was in the likeness of men, so he ascended to the right hand of his Father, in our nature. And for this, I pray turn to Acts 1:9-11 and there you shall find, that he is the same that was born of the virgin, that very man that was crucified; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>compare</b> verse 3 with verses 9, 10, 11 you will find it so to be. Now in verse 9 after he had spoken many things while they beheld, that is, while his disciples looked on him, he was taken up, that is, he was taken up from them into heaven, as in verse 11 and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked up stedfastly towards heaven, as he went up (which heaven, was not within them; if it had, they needed not to have looked toward the clouds and the heaven without them) behold two men stood by them, not in them, in white apparel, which also said (that is, the two men, or angels which stood by them said) Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? Here again, they did not look within them, but stood gazing or looking after the Lord Jesus, the Son of Mary, who was carried away from them in a cloud (v 9). But why (say the angels) do you stand gazing so much into heaven: your master will come again after a certain time (Matt 25:19; Mark 13:34). For, This same Jesus, namely, which was crucified, which rose again, and hath been with you these forty days, which also you see go into heaven, shall so come, (namely in a cloud) as ye have seen him go into heaven (Acts 1:3). But shall he not lose his body before he come again? No say the angels, he shall so come, that is, as ye have seen him go; in like manner, that is, with the same body. Or else I am sure he cannot come in the same manner, if he lose his body before he comes again; for he went thither with that body. But that same Jesus that was crucified, is he that went, or ascended up into heaven. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>compare</b> Luke 24:39-44 with the 50th and 51st verses of the same chapter, you may clearly find it so to be. And therefore if he come again in like manner, he must come again with the same body wherewith he was crucified.|$|E

If thou consider, that the place into which he ascended, even the heaven into which he is entered, is the same place where all the deceased saints are in their spirits: 'Therefore,' saith Paul, 'I desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better.'

[...] "O le triste et plat métier que celui de critique!" [...] Diderot cries on one occasion: [...] "Il est si difficile de produire une chose même médiocre; il est si facile de sentir la médiocrité."[36] No doubt, as experience and responsibility gather upon us, we learn how hard in every line is even moderate skill.
