Stay alone:--with all these? Yes, and alone with one more. Each of us is alone with God. Face to face with God, seen by Him through and through, and directly answerable to Him at every moment of our lives, for every deed, and word, and thought. And is that not a more terrible thought than any? Ah! my friends, it may be. But it may be also the most comforting of all thoughts, the only really comforting thought, if we will {{but look at the}} question as the Psalmist looks at it, and cry with him to God, [...] "I am Thine, oh save the me whom Thou hast made." ...|$|E

5000|$|Here is {{the second}} part of the equation: if and when an opiate user {{identifies}} opiate withdrawal as such, <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> <b>must</b> initiate a ritual activity that is a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral mixture. As Richard DeGrandpre writes in The Cult of Pharmacology, [...] "the opiate user must first experience withdrawal (a physical phenomenon), <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> <b>must</b> develop a concern over the withdrawal experience as such (a cognitive phenomenon), and then <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> <b>must</b> engage in drug use, taking opiates repeatedly to eliminate or avoid opiate withdrawal (a behavioral phenomenon). A breakdown in any part of this bio-psycho-social circuit can keep a pattern of dependent opiate use from emerging." ...|$|R

The champion answers his or her questions and his or her score is revealed after each question. At the end of the second category, the challenger's responses are checked and the score given.|$|R

Once {{the ball is}} served, <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> <b>must</b> hit the ball either directly ("on the fly") or after the first bounce so that it bounces off the front wall.

40|$|Devaluation {{presents}} {{one of the}} therapist's {{most difficult}} challenges: conducting therapy and managing resistance with patients who force the therapist into very aggressive and uncomfortable experiences. When these situations arise, the therapist has a twofold task. <b>He</b> or <b>she</b> <b>must</b> tolerate the transference {{so as not to}} engage in a countertransferential enactment. Additionally, from this vulnerable vantage point, <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> <b>must</b> help the patient understand both the meaning of and the consequences of devaluations of the therapist.
