5|$|Contemporary batik is {{not limited}} to {{traditional}} or ritual wearing in Bali. Some designers promote batik Bali as elegant fabric {{that can be used to}} make casual or formal cloth. Using high class batik, like <b>hand</b> <b>made</b> batik tulis, can show social status.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth was {{a son of}} the Æthelmær the Stout and a {{grandson}} of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of Æthelred I. In {{the view of the}} historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was told at Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his <b>hand</b> <b>made</b> a motion much like that an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan is said to have prophesied that Æthelnoth would become an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and <b>hand</b> <b>made</b> gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

5|$|The algebra of observables {{in quantum}} {{mechanics}} is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. Von Neumann began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by von Neumann and his contemporaries are now known as von Neumann algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition {{of a kind of}} operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one <b>hand</b> <b>made</b> no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in particular that underlies much of the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract harmonic analysis and representation theory.|$|E
5|$|This {{system of}} limited {{suffrage}} caused the predominantly Polish landowning class {{to dominate the}} Diet. Whilst they only made up about 0.4% of the population, they held 28.2% of {{the seats in the}} Diet. Small-scale rural landowners, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>made</b> up about 95% of the population, but held only 52.3% of the seats in Diet. This system also skewed representation for different ethnicities in the Diet. Whilst Ruthenians made up about 40% of the population of Galicia, they only held 15% of the seats in the Diet, as they lived primarily in rural communities. Reform of the suffrage system in late 1913 added a fifth curia for the upper peasantry, which had the right to elect twenty deputies. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no further elections to the Diet took place, and hence the fifth curia existed only on paper.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{centers of}} hand textile production such as India, {{parts of the}} Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine made textiles, which {{over a period of}} decades destroyed the <b>hand</b> <b>made</b> textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{invention}} of the printing press led to a reduced interest in <b>hand</b> <b>made</b> cards and items, by the eighteenth century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations. In the nineteenth century, influenced by French romanticism, parchment crafters began adding floral themes and cherubs and hand embossing.|$|E
