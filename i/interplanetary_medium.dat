40|$|International audienceThe interplanetary {{dust cloud}} is visible through its {{scattered}} light (the zodiacal light) at visible wavelengths. Brightness observations lead to equilibrium temperature and albedo of the particles and their variation {{as a function}} of the heliocentric distance. The light scattered by this optically thin medium is linearly polarized with negative values of the degree of linear polarization, PQ, in the backscattering region. We will review the zodiacal light photopolarimetric observations from the whole line–of-sight integrated values to the local values retrieved by inversion. Whenever available, the local PQ variation {{as a function of}} the phase angle presents a phase curve with a small negative branch and large positive branch similar to comets or asteroids. PQ does not seem to show a wavelength variation. The maximum of polarization decreases with decreasing heliocentric distance. A circular polarization signal may be present in parts of the sky. Both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments of light scattering by irregular particles have been performed to constrain the interplanetary dust properties based on their polarimetric signature. These studies indicate that mixtures of low-absorption (Mg-silicates) and high-absorption (carbonaceous) particles can explain the intensity and polarimetric observations of the zodiacal cloud. The variations with the heliocentric distance may be due to decreasing carbonaceous content of the dust cloud. Such models would favor a significant proportion of aggregates and absorbing particles in the <b>interplanetary</b> dust <b>medium,</b> indicative of a major cometary dust contribution.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is pointed}} out that the {{classical}} propagation model can be in accord with the Sagnac effect due to earth’s rotational and orbital motions in the high-precision GPS (global positioning system) and inter-planetary radar, if the reference frame of the classical propagation medium is endowed with a switchability according to the location of the wave. Accordingly, it is postulated that, as in the obsolete theory, electro-magnetic waves propagate via a medium like the ether. However, the ether is not universal. It is proposed that in the region under sufficient influence of the gravity due to the earth, the sun, or another celestial body, there forms a local ether, which in turn is stationary with respect to the gravitational potential of the respective body. For earthbound and <b>interplanetary</b> propagation, the <b>medium</b> is stationary in a geocentric and a heliocentric inertial frame, respectively. An electromagnetic wave propagates at a constant speed with respect to the associated local ether, independent of the motions of source and receiver. Based on this local-ether model of wave propagation, a wide variety of earthbound, interplanetary, and interstellar propagation phenomena are accounted for. Strong evidence of this new classical model is its consistent account of the Sagnac effect due to earth’s motions among GPS, the intercontinental microwave link, and the interplanetary radar. Moreover, as examined within the present precision, this model is still in accord with the Michelson–Morley experiment. To test the local-ether propagation model, a one-way-link rotor experiment is proposed. ...|$|R

A survey of 6 months {{of data from}} the IMAGE EUV imager indicates a relatively low quiescent background level. The most probable quiescent background count rate is 2. 7 per pixel, per 600 s EUV image, equivalent to a brightness of approximately 27 mR. This quiescent background rate is approximate to 10 {{times larger than the}} detector dark rate, indicating that quiescent background levels are dominated by external light sources or penetrating particles. We hypothesize two light sources of quiescent background in the <b>interplanetary</b> or interstellar <b>medium.</b> The first is 30. 4 nm light from nonplasmaspheric He+. The second is 58. 4 nm light (from neutral He) that gets past the filter/mirror. The IMAGE EUV data also exhibit episodic, factor of 3 -to- 30 increases above the quiescent background rate, throughout the 6 month data set considered herein. Comparison of these elevated background levels with solar EUV and solar wind parameters indicates several contributing causes during active periods, including solar wind energetic (50 keV to 5 MeV) particles, solar wind density/pressure, and solar 30. 4 nm flux.

40|$|We {{show that}} atomic {{alignment}} presents a reliable way to study topology of astrophysical magnetic fields. The effect of atomic alignment arises from modulation {{of the relative}} population of the sublevels of atomic ground state pumped by anisotropic radiation flux. As such aligned atoms precess in the external magnetic field and this affects {{the properties of the}} polarized radiation arising from both scattering and absorption by the atoms. As the result the polarizations of emission and absorption lines depend on the 3 D geometry of the magnetic field as well as the direction and anisotropy of incident radiation. We consider a subset of astrophysically important atoms with hyperfine structure. For emission lines we obtain the dependencies of the direction of linear polarization on the directions of magnetic field and the incident pumping radiation. For absorption lines we establish when the polarization is perpendicular and parallel to magnetic field. For both emission and absorption lines we find the dependence on the degree of polarization on the 3 D geometry of magnetic field. We claim that atomic alignment provides a unique tool to study magnetic fields in circumstellar regions, AGN, <b>interplanetary</b> and interstellar <b>medium.</b> This tool allows studying of 3 D topology of magnetic fields and establish other important astrophysical parameters.

40|$|The uptake and {{potential}} reactivity of metal atoms on water ice {{can be an}} important process in planetary atmospheres and on icy bodies in the <b>interplanetary</b> and interstellar <b>medium.</b> For instance, metal atom uptake affects the gas-phase chemistry of the Earth’s mesosphere, and has been proposed to influence the agglomeration of matter into planets in protoplanetary disks. In this study the fate of Mg and K atoms, incorporated into water-ice films prepared under ultra-high vacuum conditions at temperatures of 110 – 140 K, was investigated. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments reveal that Mg- and K-containing species do not co-desorb when the ice sublimates, demonstrating that uptake on ice particles causes irreversible removal of the metals from the gas phase. This implies that uptake on ice particles in terrestrial polar mesospheric clouds accelerates the formation of large meteoric smoke particles (≥ 1 nm radius above 80 km) following sublimation of the ice. Energetic sputtering of metal-dosed ice layers by 500 eV Ar+ and Kr+ ions shows that whereas K reacts on (or within) the ice surface to form KOH, adsorbed Mg atoms are chemically inert. These experimental results are consistent with electronic structure calculations of the metals bound to an ice surface, where theoretical adsorption energies on ice are calculated to be − 68 kJ mol− 1 for K, − 91 kJ mol− 1 for Mg, and − 306 kJ mol− 1 for Fe.
