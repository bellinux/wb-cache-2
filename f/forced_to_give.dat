5|$|After the Second Manchu {{invasion}} of Korea, Joseon Korea was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> several of their royal princesses as concubines to the Qing Manchu regent Prince Dorgon. In 1650, Dorgon married the Korean Princess Yishun/Uisun (義願). She was a collateral {{branch of the}} Korean royal family, and daughter of Yi Gae-yun (李愷胤). Dorgon married two Korean princesses at Lianshan.|$|E

He was later given a two-game suspension by the NHL due to the incident. He was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up US$36,585.36 of his salary as {{he had already been}} suspended for kicking Eric Cairns of the New York Islanders earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|The war went {{badly for}} the ill-prepared Greeks; the only saving grace was the {{swiftness}} {{with which the}} Hellenic Army was overrun. By the end of April 1897, the war was lost. The worst consequences of defeat for the Greeks were mitigated by {{the intervention of the}} King's relations in Britain and Russia; nevertheless, the Greeks were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up Crete to international administration, and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and an indemnity of 4million Turkish pounds.|$|E

5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of his}} top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, they are <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants {{see it as an}} opportunity to remove him and send him off.|$|E
5|$|Finally, after brief resistance, Przemysł II was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the {{strategic}} Lesser Polish land of Wieluń (also known as Ruda) {{in order to}} obtain his release, because Henry IV wanted a direct connection between Wrocław and Lesser Poland. The imprisonment of Przemysł II did not last too long, because on 3 March he was documented to have been in Poznań. Henry III and Henry V the Fat were both forced to grant much larger territorial concessions. In addition, the three Dukes agreed that upon the request of the Duke of Wrocław they would each give him military aid in the amount of thirty lancers. So this was, in practice, an act of homage.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius was {{fortunately}} {{warned in}} time and managed to escape, chased by the Avars {{all the way to}} Constantinople. However, many members of his court, as well as an alleged 70,000 Thracian peasants who came to see their Emperor, were captured and killed by the Khagan's men. Despite this treachery, Heraclius was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Avars a subsidy of 200,000 solidi along with his illegitimate son John Athalarichos, his nephew Stephen, and the illegitimate son of the patrician Bonus as hostages in return for peace. This left him more able to focus his war effort completely on the Persians.|$|E
5|$|She faced a counterattack from Stephen, {{who started}} by attacking Wallingford Castle which {{controlled}} the Thames corridor; {{it was held}} by Brian Fitz Count and Stephen found it too well defended. Stephen continued into Wiltshire to attack Trowbridge, taking the castles of South Cerney and Malmesbury en route. In response, Miles marched east, attacking Stephen's rearguard forces at Wallingford and threatening an advance on London. Stephen was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his western campaign, returning east to stabilise the situation and protect his capital.|$|E
5|$|These {{leaders were}} divided {{as to whether}} Edward or Æthelred should succeed Edgar. Neither law nor {{precedent}} offered much guidance. The choice between the sons of Edward the Elder had divided his kingdom, and Edgar's elder brother Eadwig had been <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> over {{a large part of}} the kingdom to Edgar. The Queen Dowager certainly supported the claims of her son Æthelred, aided by Bishop Æthelwold; and Dunstan supported Edward, aided by his fellow archbishop Oswald. It is likely that Ealdorman Ælfhere and his allies supported Æthelred and that Æthelwine and his allies supported Edward, although some historians suggest the opposite.|$|E

5|$|To recover lost ground, the PVA 45th Division {{commander}} Cui Jiangong {{attempted a}} sneak attack with three infantry companies by 7 pm. When flares broke the night cover, the attackers launched bayonet charges and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. The UN forces responded with heavy artillery fire, but the determined Chinese assault troops marched through both Chinese and UN artillery screens {{to reach the}} UN positions – a strange sight that made some American observers believe that the attackers were {{under the influence of}} drugs. The intense fighting prevented UN forces from receiving any resupply, and the UN defenders were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up all captured ground after running out of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|As the Yorkists {{reformed}} {{their ranks}} {{to receive the}} Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum {{than the rest of}} its formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.|$|E
5|$|During Blamey's absence in Greece, AIF units {{had become}} widely scattered, with forces being {{deployed}} to Cyprus, and the 9th Division and the 18th Infantry Brigade coming under siege in Tobruk. Blamey {{would spend the}} rest of the year attempting to reassemble his forces. This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston's advice that the Australian troops there should be relieved on medical grounds. Menzies, and later his successor, John Curtin, backed Blamey, and Auchinleck and Churchill were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> way resulting in the relief of most of the Australian troops by the British 70th Division. For his campaigns in the Middle East, Blamey was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1942. He was Mentioned in Despatches for the eighth time, and was awarded the Greek War Cross, First Class.|$|E

5|$|Early the {{following}} morning, Varley {{was promoted to}} brigadier and took over as commander of the 22nd Brigade from Taylor, who was taken ill. In Varley's place, Major Charles O'Brien, who had previously been the battalion second-in-command, took over command of the battalion. After a brief lull in the fighting in the 22nd Brigade's sector, the Japanese 18th Division attacked again, attempting to take the brigade on its left flank. In response, the 2/18th was sent to retake some of the high ground south-east of the Ulu Pandan and Reformatory Roads late in the afternoon. Attacking with about 60 men, supported by three British armoured cars and artillery fire, {{they were unable to}} retake the position after the light failed. The Japanese then pressed heavily against the 22nd Brigade's position, and they were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> ground, falling back to the junction of Buona Vista and Holland Roads, by which time the 2/18th was down to only 250 men.|$|E
5|$|Having {{released}} the Empress, Stephen focused on pacifying the south-west of England. Although {{there had been}} few new defections to the Empress, his enemies now controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south-west into Devon and Cornwall, west into the Welsh Marches and east as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Stephen started by attacking Wallingford Castle, held by the Empress's childhood friend Brien FitzCount, only to find it too well defended. Stephen left behind some forces to blockade the castle and continued west into Wiltshire to attack Trowbridge, taking the castles of South Cerney and Malmesbury en route. Meanwhile, Miles of Gloucester marched east, attacking Stephen's rearguard forces at Wallingford and threatening an advance on London. Stephen was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his western campaign, returning east to stabilise the situation and protect his capital.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the British airport {{operator}} TBI {{announced it was}} in negotiations to purchase an airport close to Oslo, and Dagens Næringsliv speculated {{that it could be}} Notodden. The municipality confirmed that they were in negotiations to establish a limited company to operate the airport, which would be jointly owned by Air Team and the municipality. In 2000, Bergen Air Transport started flying between Notodden and Bergen, using a Cessna 421B. It transported 1,000 passengers in 2000, and 1,500 the following year. During the summer of 2002, the company also attempted to fly from Notodden to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, but was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up due to lack of passengers. In 1995, the airport saw 770 arriving and departing passengers. It increased to 2,467 the following year but fell to 986 in 1998 before increasing to 3,682 in 1999. The patronage has since varied significantly from year to year, but has stayed in the range between 1,500 and 3,500 passengers per year.|$|E
