50|$|Limnobium laevigatum is a {{floating}} aquatic plant, {{which can be}} mistaken for Water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) due to their superficial similarity. Juvenile plants grow in rosettes of floating leaves that lie prostrate upon the water surface, a distinguishing character of the juvenile plant {{is the presence of}} spongy aerenchyma tissue upon the abaxial surface (underside) of the leaf. Mature plants grow up to 50 cm tall, and have emergent leaves borne on petioles that are not swollen or inflated like the spongy leaf stalks of water hyacinth, which aid in buoyancy. Spongeplant produces stolons which bear rametes. Flowers are small, white, and unisexual. Female flowers have an inferior ovary, the fruit is a fleshy capsule 4-13 mm long and 2-5 mm in diameter, and seeds are 1 mm long, ellipsoid, and hairy. Limnobium laevigatum, or Smooth <b>Frogbit</b> can be distinguished from Limnobium spongia, American <b>frogbit,</b> by flower and leaf characteristics as well as range; American <b>frogbit</b> is not known to occur in western states unlike smooth <b>frogbit.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since 1973 the Sandwater {{and several}} {{surrounding}} wetland areas {{with a total}} area of 59 ha have been designated as a nature reserve. The extensive reed beds have an important function in providing nesting and feeding grounds for reed breeders and waterfowl. The expanding beds of common reed, however, are causing the lake to gradually silt up and reduce the area of open water - currently still about 0.223 km² (22.3 ha). Here large carpets of floating plants - the White and Yellow Water Lilies - dominate the scene, and also accelerate the accumulation of mud and silt. Since the lake was dyked {{at the beginning of}} the 1960s and the surrounding area drained, the original hydrology and eutrophication of the lake has changed considerably. Previously the Sandwater had a particularly rich variety of underwater flora which produced relatively nutrient-rich, clean water (c.f. its name!), for example it contained many rare species of pondweed as well as von Floating Water-plantain (Luronium natans) and Lesser Water-plantain (Baldellia ranunculoides).

40|$|Invasive European <b>frogbit</b> (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.) has {{negative}} {{environmental and}} economic impacts in North American water bodies. It is therefore important to develop effective management tools to control this invasive species. This study investigated shading as a control method for European <b>frogbit</b> in both greenhouse and lake mesocosm experiments. A series of shade treatments (0 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, and 100 %) were tested in the greenhouse for three weeks. Results showed that the 100 % shade was most effective at controlling European <b>frogbit,</b> and other shade treatments greater than 50 % were less effective, reducing <b>frogbit</b> biomass up to 38. 2 %. There were no differences found in temperature between treatments, but dissolved oxygen decreased as shading increased. A lake mesocosm experiment utilizing 0 % shade, 70 % shade, and 100 % shade treatments was performed in a sheltered inlet of Oneida Lake in New York State for over one month. Resulting European <b>frogbit</b> biomass was significantly (25 times) less in areas treated with the 70 % shade and nearly zero with the 100 % shade. Shading did not affect temperature but improved DO conditions. Results on the shading effects on submerged macrophytes were not conclusive: {{no significant differences in}} changes in species richness and abundance between the three groups at the end of studied period suggested no shading effects; significant differences between the beginning and end communities in the 70 % shade and the 100 % shade but not in the control group indicated significant impacts of shading. This study is the first one to investigate shading as a control method for European <b>frogbit</b> and it is concluded that a moderately high density shade can effective remove European <b>frogbit</b> likely with minor impacts on the environment. More experiments with larger scales and longer time periods are recommended for further investigation...|$|E
