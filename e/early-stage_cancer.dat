We searched the literature for prognostic models in patients with surgically treated <b>early-stage</b> cervical <b>cancer.</b> The prognostic performance of these models was assessed in a consecutive group Of Surgically treated patients with <b>early-stage</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> treated in our hospital between 1982 and 2004. The performance of the models was visually assessed with calibration plots, which display {{the relation between the}} predicted and observed survival. Results. Twelve published prognostic models met the inclusion criteria. The models categorized the patients into two to four risk groups. Prognostic factors most frequently used in these models were depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, vascu/vascular space involvement, and tumor size. The models were validated in 563 consecutive patients with <b>early-stage</b> cervical <b>cancer.</b> All of the models underestimated the recurrence-free Survival or disease-specific survival in our patients.

In this mixed population of patients, it is of great interest to detect complex differences in survival distributions associated with molecular markers that potentially activate latent downstream pathways implicated in tumor progression. Method: We propose a novel model-based score test designed for identifying molecular markers with complex effects on survival in <b>early-stage</b> <b>cancer.</b> From a biological point of view, the proposed score test allows to detect complex changes in the survival distributions linked to either the tumor burden or its dynamic growth. Results: Simulation results show that the proposed statistic is powerful at identifying departure from the null hypothesis of no survival difference. The practical use of the proposed statistic is exemplified by analyzing the prognostic impact of Kras mutation in early-stage of lung adenocarcinomas. This analysis leads to the conclusion that Kras mutation has a significant negative prognostic impact on survival. Moreover, it emphasizes that the complex role of Kras mutation on survival would have been overlooked by considering results from the classical logrank test.

40|$|Understanding {{the costs}} {{associated}} with early detection of disease is important for determining the fiscal implications of government-funded screening programs. We estimate the lifetime medical costs for patients with screen-detected versus undetected polyps and early-stage colorectal cancer. Typically, cost-effectiveness studies of screening account only for the direct costs of screening and cancer care. Our estimates include costs for unrelated conditions. We applied the Kaplan-Meier Smoothing Estimator to estimate lifetime costs for beneficiaries with screen-detected polyps and cancer.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the costs and}} benefits of mammographic screening in the workplace. The cost of mammography itself and of diagnostic work-up are two of the largest costs involved. Therefore, the most efficient approach to providing mammography depends on the number of employees receiving mammography; and the diagnostic accuracy of mammography and underlying incidence of breast cancer in the screened population strongly influence the number of suspicious mammograms that are not associated with breast cancer. The health benefit of mammographic screening is due to reduced mortality and morbidity through early detection and more effective treatment, which may also result in economic savings if <b>early-stage</b> <b>cancer</b> is less expensive to treat. However, the total lifetime cost of treating <b>early-stage</b> <b>cancer</b> may be greater than treating late-stage cancer because of improved survival of early-stage patients. Thus, although periodic mammographic screening is not likely to result in overall economic savings, in many populations of working-age women, especially those with identifiable risk factors, screening is cost-effective because the expenditure required to save a year of life through early detection of breast cancer is low compared to other types of health services for which employers commonly pay...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is an {{abnormal}} expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 6 (NR 2 F 6) in human cancers such as breast cancer, colon cancer, and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, its clinical significance in cervical cancer {{has not been}} established. We explored NR 2 F 6 expression and its clinicopathological significance in <b>early-stage</b> cervical <b>cancer.</b> Methods: NR 2 F 6 expression in cervical cancer cell lines and cervical cancer tissues was determined by Western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunochemistry (IHC). NR 2 F 6 expression in 189 human <b>early-stage</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> tissue samples was evaluated using IHC. The relevance between NR 2 F 6 expression and <b>early-stage</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> prognosis and clinicopathological features was determined. Results: There was marked NR 2 F 6 mRNA and protein overexpression in the cervical cancer cells and clinical tissues compared with an immortalized squamous cell line and adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues, respectively. In the 189 cervical cancer samples, NR 2 F 6 expression {{was positively related to}} International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (p = 0. 006), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (p = 0. 006), vital status (p < 0. 001), tumor recurrence (p = 0. 001), chemotherapy (p = 0. 039), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0. 001). Overall and disease-free survival was shorter in patients with <b>early-stage</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> and higher NR 2 F 6 levels than in patients with lower levels of NR 2 F 6.

40|$|There {{is great}} {{potential}} to be explored {{regarding the use of}} agent-based modelling and simulation as an alternative paradigm to investigate <b>early-stage</b> <b>cancer</b> interactions with the immune system. It does not suffer from some limitations of ordinary differential equation models, such as the lack of stochasticity, representation of individual behaviours rather than aggregates and individual memory. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when contrasted with stochastic versions of ODE models using <b>early-stage</b> <b>cancer</b> examples. We seek answers to the following questions: (1) Does this new stochastic formulation produce similar results to the agent-based version? (2) Can these methods be used interchangeably? (3) Do agent-based models outcomes reveal any benefit when compared to the Gillespie results? To answer these research questions we investigate three well-established mathematical models describing interactions between tumour cells and immune elements. These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and also converted to the Gillespie algorithm formulation. Our interest in this work, therefore, is to establish a methodological discussion regarding the usability of different simulation approaches, rather than provide further biological insights into the investigated case studies. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} obtain equivalent models that implement the same mechanisms; however, the incapacity of the Gillespie algorithm to retain individual memory of past events affects the similarity of some results.
