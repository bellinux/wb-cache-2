40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of {{sedation}} with propofol in {{the deaths}} of children who were intubated and required intensive care. DESIGN [...] Case note review. SETTING [...] Three intensive care units. SUBJECTS [...] Five children with upper respiratory tract infections aged between 4 weeks and 6 years. RESULTS [...] Four patients had laryngotracheo-bronchitis and one had bronchiolitis. All were sedated with propofol. The clinical course in all five cases was remarkably similar: an increasing metabolic acidosis was associated with brady-arrhythmia and progressive myocardial failure, which did not respond to resuscitative measures. All children developed lipaemic serum after starting propofol. These features are not usually associated with respiratory tract infections. No evidence was found of viral myocarditis, which was considered as a possible cause of death. CONCLUSION [...] Although the exact cause of death in these children could not be defined, propofol may have been a contributing factor...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Body {{growth of}} {{children}} is often used in mathematics textbooks as an example for discussing processes of change, statistics, and discrete and dynamical models of growth. However, the real world context is in many exercises only used for `dressing up' a mathematical problem or as an `ideal' illustration of a mathematical concept. In Figure 1, we show the real diagrams of mean height and increase of mean height for Dutch boys together with a textbook example of a boy called Hank. How credible is Hank's growth curve? Figure 1.

40|$|In this study, we <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of {{the seminal}} vesicles {{of the male}} round goby to the {{production}} of putative steroidal pheromones. A previous study showed that the testes of the round goby are rich in steroid-producing Leydig-like cells; and when incubated in vitro, convert tritiated androstenedione to at least six other steroids, including one not previously identified in fish — namely 3 α-hydroxy- 5 β-androstane- 11, 17 -dione (11 -oxo-etiocholanolone, 11 -oxo-ETIO). The seminal vesicles of reproductively mature males were examined by conventional histology, transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry (utilizing an antibody against 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase — a key enzyme in vertebrate steroid synthesis). All three procedures identified Leydig cells in the proximal and medial regions of the seminal vesicles. In vitro incubation of seminal vesicles with tritiated androstenedione demonstrated biosynthesis of 11 -oxo-androstenedione, 11 -oxo-testosterone (more commonly known as 11 -ketotestosterone) and 11 oxo-ETIO. These data indicate that the seminal vesicles, as well as the testes are involved in the synthesis of steroidal compounds that may function as pheromones...|$|E

The study site was an inshore fishing ground 6 km south of Plymouth Sound, UK Changes were tested using a data set of. stomach contents from Merlangius merlangus (L.), Microstomus kitt (W.), Pleuronectes platessa (L.), Solea solea (L.), Zeus faber (L.) and Callionymus lyra (L.) from 1928 and 1929 and a matching set from 2004. Significant {{differences were found}} in the overall diet of Merlangius merlangus between the two sampling periods. Further significant differences were found within the diets of Pleuronectes platessa and Callionymus lyra by examining within the prey categories of Polychaeta (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Amphipoda (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Porcellana (decrease). Stomach contents analysis found a slight increase in the proportion of scavenging species such as Ophiuroidea, Polychaeta and Amphipoda, and a decrease in the proportions of crustaceans such as Upogebia, Porcellana and Portunus in stomach contents.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} visual responses to moving stimuli {{presented to the}} normal hemifield of a hemianope, GY, who exhibits residual visual function in his right, 'blind' hemifield. Preliminary experiments established that his perception of moving stimuli localized in his 'blind' hemifield is retained when a similar stimulus is presented simultaneously in the normal hemifield. In response to a grating stimulus moving horizontally towards fixation in the non-foveal region of the normal, left hemifield, he perceives {{in addition to a}} normal motion percept in the left hemifield, a sensation of movement localized in the right hemifield. Qualitatively, this latter is indistinguishable from responses elicited by direct stimulation localized within his 'blind' hemifield by moving stimuli. We {{have investigated}} the characteristics of the mechanisms which induce the 'blind' field component of GY's responses to stimulation of the normal hemifield. We show that GY's sensitivity for detection of movement localized within his 'blind' hemifield is dependent on the direction of movement, the contrast and the velocity of a grating presented to the normal hemifield. No induced effects were recorded in response to colour or to non-moving, flickering stimuli.

The technical foundation of these studies was the application of transgenics {{as well as in}} vivo fluorescence and super-resolution imaging. At the population scale, the ontogeny of microglial development was extended from focal colonisation of the optic tectum through the transition to ramified adult morphology. This baseline was then used to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of miR- 124 to the developmental progression of microglia and the CNS. At the local level, a methodology for localised micro-injection and visualisation of compounds was developed with a focus on producing a ‘silent’ delivery mechanism for in vivo research. At the level of the cellular membrane, two transgenic models were investigated with reference to utility in visualising, in-vivo, potential interaction between the microglia and neuronal elements. This entailed a discussion of resolution limitations of confocal/ 2 -photon microscopy and informed the development of a proof of concept for super-resolution microscopy at the microglia membrane. Finally, translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) was adapted to develop a model in which the mRNA of the microglia could be selectively isolated.

The {{aim of this study}} was to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of an increased diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) to weight loss. Eleven patients with COPD in stable clinical state and 11 healthy control subjects were studied. Resting {{energy expenditure}} (REE) was measured by standard methods of indirect calorimetry, using a ventilated canopy. Premeal REE was measured after an overnight fast. All subjects then received a balanced liquid test meal with a caloric content that was 0. 3 times their REE extrapolated to 24 h. Diet-induced thermogenesis was measured over 130 min. Premeal REE was 109. 9 +/- 11. 7 % of predicted values in the COPD group and 97. 5 +/- 9. 6 % of predicted in the control group (p < 0. 01). Seventy minutes after the test meal, REE had increased by 18. 8 +/- 8. 5 % in the COPD group and by 15. 1 +/- 5. 8 % in the control group (NS). After 130 min, REE had increased by 16. 4 +/- 7. 1 % in the COPD group and by 12. 4 +/- 5. 3 % in the control group (NS). The DIT expressed as a percentage of the caloric content of the meal was 4. 3 +/- 1. 6 % in the COPD group and 3. 3 +/- 1. 4 % in the control group (NS). We conclude that patients with stable COPD, although hypermetabolic at rest, do not show an increased DIT...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} three objectives: {{to explore the}} nature of the problem {{implicit}} in the term "risk acceptability," to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contributions</b> of scientific information to risk standard-setting, and to argue that societal response is best guided by considerations of process rather than formal methods of analysis.

Moreover, debates about risk levels are often at base debates over the adequacy of the institutions which manage the risks. Scientific information can contribute three broad types of analyses to risk-setting deliberations: contextual analysis, equity assessment, and public preference analysis. More effective risk-setting decisions will involve attention to the process used, particularly in regard to the requirements of procedural justice and democratic responsibility...|$|R

Most macro-economic models start from a neoclassical economic perspective {{and focus on}} equilibrium outcomes, either in a static or dynamic way, and describe economic processes {{at a high level}} of aggregation. As a consequence, they typically fail to account for the complexity of social interactions and other behavioural responses of consumers and producers to disasters, which may affect the macroeconomic impacts of floods. Employing evolutionary principles and methods, such as agent-based modelling, may help to address some of the shortcomings of current macro-economic models. We explore and discuss the implications of applying consumer and producer heterogeneity, bounded rationality, network effects, social and technological learning, co-evolution and adaptive policy-making concepts into existing economic frameworks for the assessment of macro-economic impacts of floods.

40|$|International audienceHelicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{is associated with}} gastric cancer (GC). The highest incidence rates have been described in Asia, but regional variations exist that do not match the distribution of infection prevalence rates. The aim {{of the study was}} to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of H. pylori virulence factors to geographic differences in the incidence of GC across East and Southeast Asia. We studied 66 isolates from Cambodian patients that had previously been assigned to two genetic populations based on sequences of seven housekeeping genes, namely hpEurope (n= 34, 51. 5 %) and hpEastAsia, subpopulation hspEAsia (n= 32, 48. 5 %). These strains were characterized with respect to vacA polymorphism and cagA status by PCR, and the CagA C-terminal region was sequenced. We also sequenced the complete cagA gene from 10 hpEurope and 10 hspEAsia strains chosen at random. The cagA gene was present in 92. 4 % of the 66 isolates and was mainly of Western type (n= 36, 59. 0 %). hspEAsia strains carrying East-Asian CagA and the m 1 -type vacA allele (15. 2 %) were less frequent among the 66 Cambodian isolates than reported in East Asian countries, a finding that might partly explain the intermediate incidence of GC in Cambodia, and by extension, in Southeast Asia (except for Vietnam). The observed high prevalence of s 1 a alleles (34. 4 %) and Western CagA (28. 1 %) among hspEAsia strains indicates frequent introgression of European vacA and cagA alleles into East Asian H. pylori strains. This expansion might have severe consequences for individual disease outcome...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe role of {{antibiotic}} exposure {{in the evolution}} and emergence of resistance is challenging to assess. We used carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) phenotypes to assess possible factors {{that are associated with}} the occurrence and prognosis of such a phenotype and to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> {{of antibiotic}} exposure to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. We conducted a nested case-control study. Cases were defined as patients from whom carbapenem-resistant ureidopenicillin-sensitive PA (CRUS-PA) was isolated; matched controls were PA patients who did not have isolation of CRUS-PA. We analysed potential predictors of CRUS-PA isolation and assessed their clinical significance (mortality and eventual isolation of pan-resistant PA), taking into account antibiotic exposures. We matched 800 case-control pairs. Case patients {{were more likely to have}} been exposed to anti-PA carbapenems (OR = 6. 9; 95 % CI, 2. 5 – 18. 6). This finding did not apply to the administration of other antibiotics. The mortality among CRUS-PA patients was similar to that of the controls (HR, 0. 8 95 %; CI, 0. 6 – 1. 1). Subsequent isolation of pan-resistant PA was more frequent among case patients compared with non-pan-resistant controls (p-value < 0. 05). Among cases, the risk of eventual pan-resistant PA isolation was increased in ertapenem recipients, only after and not prior to the index specimen date (HR, 1. 9, 95 %; CI, 1. 01 – 3. 4). Therefore we suggest that the CRUS-PA phenotype may represent pan beta-lactam resistance and that antibiotic exposure is associated with evolution of PA resistance phenotypes. We demonstrate a novel association of ertapenem with sequentially appearing PA resistance patterns...|$|E
40|$|CAM {{plants are}} {{specially}} adapted to withstand arid conditions {{for long periods}} without precipitation. In nature, these plants often go for {{extended periods of time}} without water intake through the roots. A few research studies have suggested that these desert plants may have an additional method for taking in water. Specialized structures in the epidermis of the leaves, called hydathodes may be responsible for foliar water uptake in the plants thus helping them to survive in arid conditions. Researchers have theorized that the remarkable ability of CAM plants to survive on such little precipitation {{is due in part to}} the presence of hydathodes. Researchers have hypothesized that the water is absorbed by the hydathodes. A number of rare or threatened members of the Crassulaceae in the genus Dudleya, are endemic to Southern California. For such plants, water uptake either directly by the leaves, or assisted by leaf morphology, could be important to their success. Occidental College has a large collection of African succulents in the Crassulaceae, and is close to field sites of a number of species of Dudleya. We propose to investigate the possibility of foliar water uptake in a variety of succulents. We also propose to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of the rosette form of Dudleya to direct water flow from the surface of the leaves to the roots.

Reward-related units were found that anticipated reward encounter, that responded during reward consumption, and that differentiated between high and low reward magnitude. This is consistent with the hypothesis that BLA neurons may provide the VS with reward-related information that could then be integrated with spatial information to ultimately affect goal-directed behavior.

40|$|Glutamate is {{the main}} {{neurotransmitter}} at hippocampal mossy fibre (MF) terminals. Because neurotransmitters have been proposed as regulating factors of neural network formation and neurite morphogenesis in the developing CNS, we <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of glutamate to MF pathfinding. Entorhino-hippocampal slices prepared from early postnatal rats were cultivated {{in the presence of}} glutamate receptor antagonists. Timm histochemical staining revealed that pharmacological blockade of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), but not of ionotropic glutamate receptors, induced abnormal outgrowth of the MFs. When slices were cultured in the presence of mGluR antagonists, DiI-labelled MF axons displayed a great degree of defasciculation, and MF-mediated EPSPs in the CA 3 pyramidal cells were altered. Similar results were obtained for a selective antagonist of group II mGluR, but not of group I or III mGluR. Glutamate is, therefore, likely to regulate MF outgrowth via activation of group II mGluR. The present study may provide a novel role of glutamate in hippocampal development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} question in developmental biology is how relatively shallow gradients of morphogens can reliably establish {{a series of}} distinct transcriptional readouts. Current models emphasize interactions between transcription factors binding in distinct modes to cis-acting sequences of target genes. Another recent {{idea is that the}} cis-acting interactions may amplify preexisting biases or prepatterns to establish robust transcriptional responses. In this study, we <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of one such source of prepattern, namely gene length. We developed quantitative imaging tools to measure gene expression levels for several loci at a time on a single-cell basis and applied these quantitative imaging tools to dissect the establishment of a gene expression border separating the mesoderm and neuroectoderm in the early Drosophila embryo. We first characterized the formation of a transient ventral-to-dorsal gradient of the Snail (Sna) repressor and then examined the relationship between this gradient and repression of neural target genes in the mesoderm. We found that neural genes are repressed in a nested pattern within a zone of the mesoderm abutting the neuroectoderm, where Sna levels are graded. While several factors may contribute to the transient graded response to the Sna gradient, our analysis suggests that gene length may play an important, albeit transient, role in establishing these distinct transcriptional responses. One prediction of the gene-length-dependent transcriptional patterning model is that the co-regulated genes knirps (a short gene) and knirps-related (a long gene) should be transiently expressed in domains of differing widths, which we confirmed experimentally. These findings suggest that gene length may contribute to establishing graded responses to morphogen gradients by providing transient prepatterns that are subsequently amplified and stabilized by traditional cis-regulatory interactions...|$|E

Methods: Calcified placental tissues and distal tissue samples were collected from 36 confirmed placental calcification cases. In addition, 20 normal placental tissue samples were obtained as a control group. All the tissue samples were cultured using special nanobacterial culture methods. The cultured calcifying nanoparticles were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their growth was monitored by optical density (OD) at a wavelength of 650 nm. 16 S rRNA gene expression of the cultured calcifying nanoparticles was also isolated and sequenced. Results: Novel calcifying nanoparticles wrapped with electron-dense shells between 50 nm to 500 nm in diameter were observed in the extracellular matrix of calcified placental tissues. They were detected in placental villi and hydroxyapatite crystals, and contained &ldquo;nucleic acid-like materials&rdquo;. After isolation and four weeks of culture, 28 of 36 calcified placental tissue samples showed white granular precipitates attached to the bottom of the culture tubes. OD 650 measurements indicated that the precipitates from the calcified placental tissues were able to grow in culture, whereas no such precipitates from the control tissues were observed. The 16 S rRNA genes were isolated from the cultured calcifying nanoparticles and calcified placental tissues, and their gene sequencing results implied that calcifying nanoparticles were novel nanobacteria (GenBank JF 823648). Conclusion: Our results suggest that these novel calcifying nanoparticles may play a role in placental calcification.

Lgr 5 immunolabelling was not detected in any of the tumours analyzed, despite positive staining in the surrounding HFs. The expression of Lgr 6 and Lgr 5 mRNA was observed in the majority of the cases. Sox 9 was expressed in several tumours at both the protein and the mRNA levels. Sox 9 positive cells were mainly present among the basaloid neoplastic cells of infundibular keratinizing acanthoma and of squamous cell carcinoma, and in some cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and trichoblastoma. A statistically significant correlation was observed between lack of Sox 9 protein expression and histologically assessed malignancy (P= 0. 0448). The presence of Sox 9 positive cells in both epidermal and HF tumours suggests their involvement {{in the development of the}}se tumours. Our results suggest that Sox 9 might represent a marker of HF differentiation and its expression in BCCs might indicate a differentiation of these tumors along the line of the outer root sheath. A significant correlation was observed between absent/low Lgr 5 mRNA levels and histologically assessed malignancy (P= 0. 0001), suggesting a possible transient function of the molecule in the development of the investigated tumors.

Why has triskelion come to signify this?//Divi Kervella noticed that triskelion has been popular since the period between WWI and WWII because certain nationalist parties adopted it as a representation of Celticness. In addition, several groups belonging to neo-druidism, such as Kredenn Geltiek, have in recent years in Brittany attempted to (re) construct ancient, religious thought of the Celts by placing emphasis on triskelion. The Breton interpretation of triskelion seems to resemble the four druidic elements (water, air, fire and earth), which is why I believe there might be some connection or correspondence between the new interpretation of the image and neo-druidism. //This paper points out the fact that Bretons are a minority both in France and among Celtic-speaking regions and discusses how Breton people treat triskelion. Also, the relationship between national or cultural identities and visual objects is considered. At the end of the paper, the spiral structure of interaction between two elements facing each other, the spiral figure and human consciousness, is explained. //While developing the above argument, I also <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of religious studies to the understanding of not just religious art, but also images, patterns, figures and other visual objects that do not have an obvious relationship with religion. 論文/Article...|$|E

BACKGROUND: Gender {{differences}} in rates of bipolar disorder have been described, with most studies reporting males as over-represented in those {{diagnosed with a}} bipolar I disorder and females over-represented in those diagnosed with a bipolar II disorder. This could reflect true {{differences in}} prevalence or measurement error emerging from screening or case-finding measures. We <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of the latter by examining one screening measure-the Mood Swings Questionnaire (MSQ). METHODS: We analyse MSQ data from a large sample of age- and gender-matched bipolar I and bipolar II patients (and their composite group). Gender differences were examined in terms of prevalence and severity of MSQ symptoms, MSQ sub-scales scores and total MSQ scores, employing univariate and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses. RESULTS: Both male and female bipolar I patients reported higher total MSQ and higher mysticism MSQ sub-scale scores than their male and female bipolar II counterparts. There were no gender differences when bipolar I, bipolar II and composite bipolar groups were separately examined on both total and sub-scale MSQ scores, suggesting that gender does not impact on MSQ scoring. When item analyses of bipolar I and II groups were undertaken separately, a number of differences emerged, but as few were consistent across bipolar sub-types such differences could reflect chance and failure to control for multiple comparisons. The over-representation of some items in females and some in males {{may have contributed to}} the comparable total and sub-scale scores. LIMITATIONS: Large sample size and only one measure (i. e. MSQ) examined. CONCLUSION: As total and sub-scale MSQ scores were uninfluenced by gender we can conclude that this screening test is not confounded by gender and, if representative of other such screening measures, would indicate that any differential prevalence of the bipolar disorders identified in community studies possibly reflects gender differences in their occurrence rather than artefactual consequences of screening measures having a gender bias...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{contribution of}} a p-exchange process to the photoproduction of p mesons, which subsequently decay to high energy pions at very small angles, is examined when the p-nucleon vertex {{is replaced by}} the total cross section for p induced reactions. Recent experimentsi on high energy photoproduction of pions in the very forward directions have indicated a possible large cross section which cannot {{be explained by the}} Drell mechanism 2 of single pion exchange. Speculations that a non-vanishing 0 ' cross section would be possible from a direct Too magnetic moment interaction have been considered 3 for the reaction f. ~+N [...] +P +N L I? + IlO (1) as indicated in Fig. 1. The main problem with such a contribution is that the calculated angular distribution must be drastically reduced away from 0 ' if the p-exchange mechanism is to be even in rough agreement with experiment. A possible procedure for making the p-exchange process more sharply peaked at very small angles is to assume a Regge pole-like behavior of the exchanged p. * This procedure brings the angular distribution to a better agreement with experiment, but yields a slow decrease of the calculated 0 ' cross section with increasing primary energy. The latter result must still be checked by higher energy experiments. In this note we <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of the p-exchange process, where the pNN 'vertex is replaced by the total cross section for the reaction p + N +(a 11 consistent final states);as shown in Fig. 2. Assuming that the p-nucleon total cross section is 30 mb and that the P is coupled to a conserved current, we conclude that the p-exchange process contribution to a final state of a small angle p and a nucleon, as calculated in Ref. 3, is always an order of magnitude larger than the contribution to a final state where the pNN vertex is replaced by the p total cross section. -l- Consider the process where the exchanged P interacts with the target nucleon (Fig. 2) y + N-+p...|$|E
40|$|Natural killer T (NKT) cells {{constitute}} a distinct subpopulation of T cells {{with a unique}} antigen specificity, prompt effector functions, and an unusual tissue distribution. NKT cells are especially abundant in the liver, but their physiological function in this organ remains unclear. In the present study, we <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contribution</b> of NKT cells to a murine model of hepatitis induced by i. v. injection of Con A. CD 1 -deficient mice lacking NKT cells were highly resistant to Con A-induced hepatitis. Adoptive transfer of hepatic NKT cells isolated from wild-type mice, but not from FasL-deficient gld mice, sensitized CD 1 -deficient mice to Con A-induced hepatitis. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of hepatic mononuclear cells from wild-type mice, but not from CD 1 -deficient mice, sensitized gld mice to Con A-induced hepatitis. Upon Con A administration, hepatic NKT cells rapidly up-regulated cell surface FasL expression and FasL-mediated cytotoxicity. At the same time, NKT cells underwent apoptosis leading to their rapid disappearance in the liver. These results implicated FasL expression on liver NKT cells in the pathogenesis of Con A-induced hepatitis, suggesting a similar pathogenic role in human liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite {{numerous}} and increasing attempts {{to define what}} life is, {{there is no consensus}} on necessary and sufficient conditions for life. Accordingly, some scholars have questioned the value of definitions of life and encouraged scientists and philosophers alike to discard the project. As an alternative to this pessimistic conclusion, we argue that critically rethinking the nature and uses of definitions can provide new insights into the epistemic roles of definitions of life for different research practices. This paper <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contributions</b> of definitions of life in scientific domains where such definitions are used most (e. g., Synthetic Biology, Origins of Life, Alife, and Astrobiology). Rather than as classificatory tools for demarcation of natural kinds, we highlight the pragmatic utility of what we call operational definitions that serve as theoretical and epistemic tools in scientific practice. In particular, we examine contexts where definitions integrate criteria for life into theoretical models that involve or enable observable operations. We show how these definitions of life play important roles in influencing research agendas and evaluating results, and we argue that to discard the project of defining life is neither sufficiently motivated, nor possible without dismissing important theoretical and practical research...|$|R
40|$|One hundred {{three women}} with prior {{histories}} of recurrent spontaneous abortion and 81 of their mates were karyotyped with Q-banding during 1976 - 1980. Recurrent abortion {{was defined as}} two or more spontaneous pregnancy losses; no couple with a previous malformed fetus or child was included. These cases were reviewed in order to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> <b>contributions</b> of minor polymorphic chromosomal variants and major chromosomal abnormalities to recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss. Balanced translocations were detected in four women and two men in the study; mosaic X aneuploidy was noted in one woman. Quantitative (1 qh, 9 qh, 16 qh, Yqh) and qualitative (3 c, 4 c, 13 p, 13 s, 14 p, 14 s, 15 p, 15 s, 21 p, 21 s, 22 p, 22 s) heterochromatic polymorphisms were blindly assessed and compared with a control group. Cases and controls {{did not differ in}} the frequency of any qualitative polymorphisms or in the length of any quantitative polymorphism. Thus, while major parental cytogenetic aberrations are significantly associated with fetal wastage, these data suggest that minor polymorphic chromosomal variants do not {{play an important role in}} the etiology of recurrent spontaneous abortion...|$|R
