25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If <b>internal</b> <b>insulation</b> should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E

The measurements also provide information on effective heat transfer (u value) in consideration of climate conditions like insolation, rain, and storage effects. In the test building, heat transfer could be reduced by half without requiring a vapour barrier. The building is representative of many historical buildings with insufficient thermal insulation.

Mission Director Walter Williams felt a sense of relief at the bad weather, as there was still a general sense that the spacecraft and booster were not ready to fly yet. NASA informed the anxious public that the mission would take time to get ready since manned launches required a high degree of preparedness and safety standards.

40|$|The report {{deals with}} the {{problems}} which {{may be caused by}} internal additional insulation of an existing building component. Problems treated in this report are heat losses through and surface condensation at thermal bridges, condensation in the building components, stresses due to temperature and moisture content variations and possibly frost damage in facade materials. After <b>internal</b> <b>insulation</b> thermal bridges such as joist connections, inner wall connections and window splays have relatively speaking an increased effect on heat losses through an outer wall. Computer calculations have been made to estimate this effect. Thermal bridges also reduce surface temperatures in a room. This way in some cases increase the risk for surface condensation. The effect is, however, relatively small. Condensation in a building component is likely to occur if the <b>internal</b> <b>insulation</b> is made without a new vapour barrier. The condensation risk is naturally greatly influenced by the climatic conditions and the moisture capacity of the building materials. Onedimensional nonstationary calculations of the temperature and moisture field in some building components before and after additional insulation have been made with a computer program. Laboratory investigations of thermal and moisture conditions in two types of walls after thermal insulation have been made. The effect of driving rain on the moisture content in an outer wall with and without <b>internal</b> <b>insulation</b> has for some cases been calculated. The possible risk for frost damage due to the decreased rate of drying out is discussed. Although <b>internal</b> <b>insulation</b> can be said to affect the frost resistance, other factors surely have greater influence. For the discussion of stresses due to temperature and moisture variations simple structural elements are used, plates with clamped and free edges, respectively. The temperature field and the moisture content before and after <b>internal</b> <b>insulation</b> have earlier been calculated.
