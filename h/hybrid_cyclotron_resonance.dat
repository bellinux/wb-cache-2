40|$|The {{current status}} of ICRF heating of Tokamak plasmas is described. Two aspects of the subject are {{discussed}} : the physics of wave damping and the evaluation of ion heating. Recent experiments in several Tokamak devices at the second harmonic of the deuteron cyclotron frequency have exhibited large discrepancies between the observed and predicted wave damping. Current thinking attributes these discrepancies {{to the influence of}} a two-ion hybrid resonance between the majority deuterium ions and impurity protons. A number of experimental observations appear to be consistent with this view. However, the details of the physical processes which lead to wave damping are still unclear. One theory attributes the damping to a linear mode conversion at the two-ion hybrid layer. This process is important, if the proton-to-deuteron density ratio is large (> 10 %). Another possible explanation, based upon enhanced cyclotron harmonic damping due to the proximity of the two-ion <b>hybrid</b> and <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> layers, is discussed in this paper. The boundary value problem for fast wave propagation in an inhomogeneous two-ion plasma has been solved explicitly to obtain the wave field structure. For modest proton concentrations (< 5 %) a steep gradient in the left-hand polarized electric field is found in the region between the <b>hybrid</b> and <b>cyclotron</b> resonant layers. This gradient appears to provide sufficient enhancement of the second harmonic damping strength to account for the observed discrepancies. However, a reliable measurement of the proton concentration is needed to choose between the two possibilities. Ion heating was examined in detail in recent experiments in the ATC device. It is shown that ICRF heating can heat the bulk of the ions in the core of a Tokamak plasma with efficiencies ranging from 10 to 40 %, without causing any significant change in the ion energy confinement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} {{detailed}} study of the magnetic-field-orientation dependence of the millimetre-wave magnetoconductivity of the superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4. We find two harmonic series of <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances.</b> We assign the first, corresponding to a quasiparticle mass of 4. 29 ± 0. 05 me, where me is the free-electron mass, to the β Fermi-surface section. We assign the second series, which contains only odd harmonics, to <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> of the γ Fermi-surface section, yielding a quasiparticle mass of 12. 35 ± 0. 20 me. A third, single <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance,</b> corresponding to a quasiparticle mass of 5. 60 ± 0. 03 me, is attributed to the α Fermi-surface section.

40|$|Using linear Vlasov {{theory of}} plasma waves and quasi-linear theory of {{resonant}} wave-particle interaction, the dispersion {{relations and the}} electromagnetic field fluctuations of fast and Alfven waves are studied for a low-beta multi-ion plasma in the inner corona. Their probable roles in heating and accelerating the solar wind via Landau and <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> are quantified. We assume that (1) low-frequency Alfven and fast waves have the same spectral shape and the same amplitude of power spectral density; (2) these waves eventually reach ion cyclotron frequencies due to a turbulence cascade; (3) kinetic wave-particle interaction powers the solar wind. The existence of alpha particles in a dominant proton/electron plasma can trigger linear mode conversion between oblique fast-whistler and <b>hybrid</b> alpha-proton <b>cyclotron</b> waves. The fast-cyclotron waves undergo both alpha and proton <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances.</b> The alpha <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> in fast-cyclotron waves is much stronger than that in Alfven-cyclotron waves. For alpha <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance,</b> an oblique fast-cyclotron wave has a larger left-handed electric field fluctuation, a smaller wave number, a larger local wave amplitude, and a greater energization capability than a corresponding Alfven-cyclotron wave at the same wave propagation angle θ, particularly at 80 ^∘ < θ < 90 ^∘. When Alfven-cyclotron or fast-cyclotron waves are present, alpha particles are the chief energy recipient. The transition of preferential energization from alpha particles to protons may be self-modulated by differential speed and temperature anisotropy of alpha particles via the self-consistently evolving wave-particle interaction. Therefore, fast-cyclotron waves {{as a result of}} linear mode coupling is a potentially important mechanism for preferential energization of minor ions in the main acceleration region of the solar wind.

40|$|The {{effect of}} electron-hole {{hybridization}} on the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> of bipolar InAs∕GaSb structures is investigated for samples with varying electron-hole coupling. At low magnetic fields {{it is found}} that the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> mass of the electrons is significantly enhanced when the electrons and holes are closer together and strongly coupled. A two-band model including electron-hole mixing shows excellent agreement with the experimental results.

The magnetic-field positions of these splittings are proportional to the energy separation between the electrons and holes, proving the explanation that they are the result of single-particle coupling.

40|$|<b>Cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> {{has been}} {{measured}} in GaAs and related compounds {{through the use}} of a new experimental technique developed for the study of very pure semiconductors called optically detected <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> (ODCR). ODCR differs from other forms of magnetospectroscopy in that the intensity of luminescence excited by a visible laser is monitored rather than the direct absorption of far-infrared radiation. The ODCR technique is initially used on an exceptionally pure sample of GaAs and resolves impurity transitions and central cell effects. An accurate measure of the electron effective mass including band nonparabolicity is made. The ODCR signal represents an interaction between the donor bound electron states and the donor bound exciton states. Standard <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> measurements on high mobility GaAs/Ga 1 - x Al x As heterojunctions are performed with tilted magnetic fields. Resonant coupling between the Landau levels and electric subbands gives rise to a splitting of the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> lineshape which can be used to determine the subband energy spacings. This allows for a direct determination of the shape of the confinement potential which changes dramatically under different illumination conditions. A dilution refrigerator is modified in order to measure the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> (CR) to 100 mK of the low density, two dimensional electron system in a heterojunction. Anomalies in the CR spectrum are explained in terms of an interacting electron system composed of carriers in the two spin states of the lowest Landau level. Experimental results are presented in terms of a recent theory offered for <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance.</b> A series of undoped GaAs quantum wells is studied with ODCR.
