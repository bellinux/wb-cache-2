25|$|Like {{many other}} {{accomplished}} yoginis, Mandarava was pressured {{to accept an}} arranged marriage instead of practicing the dharma.

25|$|The {{post-mortem}} {{exhibition of}} Corriveau's remains at a busy crossroads (a practice also in use under the French regime, and reserved in England for those {{found guilty of}} the most serious crimes); the repercussions in the trial; the rumour that <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> be convicted of murdering Dodier at his daughter's instigation; and the gossip which grew up around the circumstances of the death of her first husband all stirred up the popular imagination and became legends still told today in the oral tradition — increasing the number of murdered husbands to as many as seven and likening la Corriveau to a witch.|$|E

At fourteen, Elliott's mother decided to end the situation; she fled with her daughter {{under the guise of}} taking a joyride on a local bus.

60|$|Uncle John {{was looking}} very serious indeed, and Patsy {{regarded}} him gratefully. <b>Her</b> <b>father</b> never <b>would</b> be serious where Kenneth was concerned. Perhaps {{in his heart}} the grizzled old Major was a bit jealous of the boy.|$|R

It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters.

500|$|One {{week before}} the January special election, a {{controversy}} arose over a Coakley approved television ad. [...] The ad referenced the conscientious objector amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients' rights. [...] This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care (the morning-after pill) to rape victims if they objected due to a religious belief. After the amendment failed, Brown did vote for the main bill which, along with other patient rights, requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care. Coakley's ad featured a male voice that said, [...] "Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims," [...] over the ad's graphic which had the words, [...] "Deny care to rape victims."
