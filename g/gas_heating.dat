25|$|Natural <b>gas</b> <b>heating</b> {{systems may}} cause carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|Most town [...] "gashouses" [...] {{located in}} the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple {{by-product}} coke ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers.

(<b>Gas</b> <b>heating</b> did not come into widespread use until {{the last half of}} the 20th century.) The coal tar (or asphalt) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.|$|E
