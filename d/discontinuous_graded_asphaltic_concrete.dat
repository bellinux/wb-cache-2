40|$|The {{utilization}} of crumb rubber in asphalt mixture has significantly {{evolved in the}} past few decades. However, the modification through dry process method has been a far less popular compared to the wet process due to a few drawbacks that affect its performance. One such concern that is often ignored by researcher relates to the rubber–bitumen interaction that causes swelling of the rubber particles within compacted asphalt mixture. Rubber–bitumen interaction refers to the absorption of bitumen particularly the maltenes fraction by rubber particles. This study investigated the effects of mixture design variables on the rubber–bitumen interaction and properties of rubberized asphalt mixtures fabricated through the dry method. The effects of rubber–bitumen interaction at different rubber sizes, bitumen contents, and curing periods were investigated using the “Basket Drainage Method”. While, the mechanical properties of rubberized asphalt mixtures were measured using resilient modulus and dynamic creep tests. Four types of gyratory compacted specimens of a dense <b>grade</b> mixture of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> were fabricated. The four specimen types comprised a control specimen without rubber and three other specimens with 2 % crumb rubber of varying sizes (1. 18, 3. 35 and 5. 0 mm). Results showed that higher rubber–bitumen interaction can be obtained with the use of fine rubber size and high bitumen content, thus exhibiting greater rubber swelling particularly in the first 4 h of curing. Specimen with fine rubber can be easily compacted to achieve the target density which shows consistency in the volumetric properties. The addition of crumb rubber reduces the resilient and creep modulus of asphalt mixtures compared to the control mix. However, by initiating the rubber swelling extensively prior to compaction can possibly improve the compatibility and volumetric properties, thus enhancing better performance of the rubberized asphalt mixtures...|$|R

In this regard, the paper discusses the results of computational prediction of the stress-strain state and stability of a high earth dam (256 m high) with the core. The authors considered <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> containing 7 % of bitumen as the material of the core. Gravel was considered as the material of resistant prisms. Design characteristics of the rolled <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> and gravel were obtained from the processing of the results of triaxial tests. The calculations were performed using finite element method in elastoplastic formulation and basing on the phased construction of the dam and reservoir filling. The research shows, that the work of embankment dam with vertical core during filling of the reservoir is characterized by horizontal displacement of the lower resistant prism in the tailrace and the formation of a hard wedge prism descending along the core in the upper resistant prism. The key issue of the safety assessment is to determine the safety factor of the overall stability of the dam, for calculation of which the destruction of the earth dam is necessary, which can be done by reducing the strength properties of the dam materials. As a results of the calculations, the destruction of the dam occurs with a decrease in the strength characteristics of the materials of the dam by 2. 5 times.
