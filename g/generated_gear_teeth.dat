In the mist lubrication mode, cooling air was supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the out of mesh location of the gear sets. The mist air was also supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the radial position mist nozzle at a constant rate of 0. 0632 mol/s (3 SCFM) per nozzle. The lubricant contained in the mist air varied between 32 - 44 cc/hour. In the recirculating jet spray mode, the flow rate was varied between 1893 - 2650 cc/hour.

40|$|The hobbing {{theory of}} <b>generating</b> the {{involute}} <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> has been often reported. However, a hobbing mechanism of enlarging the unfinished tooth space has been rarely investigated, because this mechanism is very complicated and the cutting behaviors are different with each tooth {{and even in}} the position on one tooth profile. In order to make clear the causes of the tooth wear and the hobbing vibration, it is necessary to know the cutting behaviors at any point on the edge. This paper describes a method of calculating the length and the thickness to be cut on each point closely divided along the tooth profile without neglecting the tip roundness. This method can be applied to any hobbing condition, e. g. to the cases of spur or helical gear, and the conventional or the climb hobbing. Some examples analyzed by this method are compared with the practical hobbing results, and then some suggestions for both wear and vibration analyses are given...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} for NASA Glenn Research Center under contract NNC 10 BA 05 B, Task NNC 11 TA 80 T to identify beneficial arrangements of the turboshaft engine, transmissions and related systems within the propulsion pod nacelle of NASA's Large Civil Tilt-Rotor 2 nd iteration (LCTR 2) vehicle. Propulsion pod layouts were used to investigate potential advantages, disadvantages, as well as constraints of various arrangements assuming front or aft shafted engines. Results from previous NASA LCTR 2 propulsion system studies and tasks performed by Boeing under NASA contracts are {{used as the basis}} for this study. This configuration consists of two Fixed Geometry Variable Speed Power Turbine Engines and related drive and rotor systems (per nacelle) arranged in tilting nacelles near the wing tip. Entry-into-service (EIS) 2035 technology is assumed for both the engine and drive systems. The variable speed rotor system changes from 100 percent speed for hover to 54 percent speed for cruise by the means of a two speed gearbox concept developed under previous NASA contracts. Propulsion and drive system configurations that resulted in minimum vehicle gross weight were identified in previous work and used here. Results reported in this study illustrate that a forward shafted engine has a slight weight benefit over an aft shafted engine for the LCTR 2 vehicle. Although the aft shafted engines provide a more controlled and centered CG (between hover and cruise), the length of the long rotor shaft and complicated engine exhaust arrangement outweighed the potential benefits. A Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) approach for transmission sizing was also explored for this study. This tool offers quick analysis of gear loads, bearing lives, efficiencies, etc., through use of commercially available RomaxDESIGNER software. The goal was to create quick methods to explore various concept models. The output results from RomaxDESIGNER have been successfully linked to Boeing spreadsheets that <b>generate</b> <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> geometry in Catia 3 D environment. Another initial goal was to link information from RomaxDESIGNER (such as hp, rpm, gear ratio) to populate Boeing's parametric weight spreadsheet and create an automated method to estimate drive system weight. This was only partially achieved due to the variety of weight models, number of manual inputs, and qualitative assessments required.

Experimental measurements of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> average surface temperature and <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> instantaneous surface temperature were made with a fast response, infrared, radiometric microscope.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the <b>generating</b> <b>gear</b> and the work gear, the NC generation of {{spiral bevel gear}} cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with spiral bevel gear NC machining, and is applied to the self-developed spiral bevel gear NC milling machine to control the gear cutting.

40|$|Regarding <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape {{measurement}} and the uncertainty evaluation method <b>Gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape deviation {{can be divided}} into three types: profile deviations, helix deviations, and pitch deviations. Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear deviation measurement. In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus.
