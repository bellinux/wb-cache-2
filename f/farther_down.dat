5|$|<b>Farther</b> <b>down</b> the {{southeast}} slope of Adams, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has two campgrounds along Bird Creek: Bird Creek Campground and Island Cabin Campground. Island Cabin {{is also used}} in winter by snowmobilers.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} spill, tar balls began washing ashore on beaches {{down the coast}} in nearby Summerland and then <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the coast in Ventura county. Although the source of these tar balls could not be {{immediately}} confirmed, the pipeline company sent workers to clean them up. Crews cleaned up coin-sized clumps of oil along the Rincon shoreline such as Faria, the beaches in the City of Ventura including San Buenaventura State Beach, and the extensive oceanfront of the Oxnard Plain.|$|E

5000|$|Odom's debut album, <b>Farther</b> On <b>down</b> the Road (recorded in 1969 and {{released}} in 1973), included {{his version of}} [...] "Farther Up the Road", with accompaniment throughout by Hooker on guitar and Johnny [...] "Big Moose" [...] Walker on keyboards.|$|R
50|$|The Robson Valley is bounded on {{the south}} by the Columbia Country, <b>farther</b> south <b>down</b> the Rocky Mountain Trench, and the Thompson Country, via Canoe Pass , and is flanked on its east by the Rocky Mountains and on the west by the Cariboo Mountains.|$|R
5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the group.|$|E
5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate have been formed. Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and hydrothermally altered rocks are found <b>farther</b> <b>down.</b> Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E
6000|$|Glancing half round, as {{he turned}} away from the wine shop, Philip saw Raoul and two of his companions rising. He walked off in a leisurely manner and, a few paces <b>farther,</b> turned <b>down</b> a side street. He heard steps {{following}} him, and then a voice said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, good friend,' {{said the}} girl, 'you need go no <b>farther.</b> Come, sit <b>down,</b> eat and drink, and {{afterwards}} I'll {{tell you all}} about it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The online {{version of}} the {{magazine}} opens with large images that also display links to main articles. Scrolling <b>farther</b> the <b>down,</b> viewers of the site will find [...] "Top Stories", [...] "Hot Right Now", and other sections. There are tabs to the various categories of the publication's material, including [...] "Celebrity," [...] "Fashion," [...] "Beauty," [...] "Hair," [...] "Love," [...] "Lifestyle," [...] "News", and [...] "Videos".|$|R
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as this is the most easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E
5|$|Moreau {{preferred}} to retreat through the Black Forest via the Kinzig River valley, but Nauendorf blocked that route. Instead, Saint-Cyr's column {{led the way}} over the Höllenthal, breaking through the Austrian net at Neustadt and reaching Freiburg im Breisgau on 12 October. Moreau's supply trains took a route down the Wiese River to Hüningen. The French general wanted to reach Kehl <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the Rhine, but by this time Charles barred the way with 35,000 soldiers. In order for his trains to get away, Moreau needed to hold his position for a few days. The Battle of Emmendingen was fought on 19 October, the 32,000 French losing 1,000 killed and wounded plus 1,800 men and two guns captured. The Austrians sustained 1,000 casualties out of 28,000 troops engaged. Beaupuy and Wartensleben were both killed. There was some fighting on the 20th, but when Charles advanced on 21 October the French were gone.|$|E
60|$|At last {{had come}} the {{opportunity}} for which I waited! I was free to make for {{the far end of}} the mesa, find my way to the valley below, and while the two forces were engaged in their struggle, continue my search for Hooja's village, which I had learned from the beast-men lay <b>farther</b> on <b>down</b> the river that I had been following when taken prisoner.|$|R
6000|$|... "It has sprung half an inch," [...] Francis said, feeling. [...] "Now {{you keep}} your irons as they are, while I thrust mine <b>down</b> <b>farther.</b> I have got a fresh hold. Do you shift yours." ...|$|R
60|$|The next dam {{was about}} fifteen miles <b>farther</b> north <b>down</b> the Allegash. We {{had been told}} in Bangor {{of a man who}} lived alone, a sort of hermit, at that dam, to take care of it, who spent his time tossing a bullet from one hand to the other, for want of employment. This sort of tit-for-tat {{intercourse}} between his two hands, bandying to and fro a leaden subject, seems to have been his symbol for society.|$|R
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. <b>Farther</b> <b>down</b> the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
25|$|In December, 2013, the {{department}} relocated {{to the newly}} built Peretsman-Scully Hall, located <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> Washington Road on the southeast side of Poe Field.|$|E
25|$|Greater {{attention}} {{should be placed on}} the nodes near the root since pruning a branch near the root will remove more potential objects than one <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the tree.|$|E
60|$|Close by were a {{group of}} big, blonde Lithuanians, {{hardened}} by toil, in odoriferous garments; a black-haired Pole; a Jewess whose beauty had run to fatness; and her greasy, ferret-eyed husband. Farther on a burly Englishman, who had evidently laid in alcoholic refreshment <b>farther</b> back <b>down</b> the line, was crooning a maudlin song. There was, however, an interruption presently, for a man's head was thrust {{out from behind a}} curtain which hung between the roof and one of the platforms above.|$|R
60|$|Caleb became {{tired of}} this singing; and when, at length, his tree got wedged fast, {{so that he could}} not move it any <b>farther,</b> he sat <b>down</b> {{discouraged}} upon a log, and looked anxiously towards Raymond, as if he wished that he would come and help him.|$|R
60|$|Meg {{drank the}} spirits, and, {{withdrawing}} herself from <b>farther</b> conversation, sat <b>down</b> before {{the spot where}} Brown lay hid, in such a posture {{that it would have}} been difficult for any one to have approached it without her rising. The men, however, showed no disposition to disturb her.|$|R
25|$|A deep {{foundation}} {{is a type}} of foundation that transfers building loads to the earth <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> from the surface than a shallow foundation does to a subsurface layer or a range of depths.|$|E
25|$|Most {{visitors}} reach Zermatt by {{cog railway}} train {{from the nearby}} town of Täsch (Zermatt shuttle). Trains also depart for Zermatt from <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the valley at Visp and Brig, which are on the main Swiss rail network. The town also has a heliport (ICAO: LSEZ) and a local helicopter operator, Air Zermatt, which also provides alpine rescue services.|$|E
25|$|A small firewarden's hut {{was located}} on the summit of Mount Monadnock and {{operated}} from 1911 to 1948, when it was decommissioned {{with the advent of}} modern means of detecting forest fires. The hut remained as a snack bar and hikers' shelter until 1969 and was removed in 1972. A small cabin, located <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the mountain, served as the fire lookout's residence. It, too, is gone.|$|E
50|$|A {{class of}} {{planters}} that dig <b>down</b> <b>farther</b> than others are called listers. They {{are not used}} much anymore, as their use belonged {{to a set of}} high-till methods that low-till and no-till methods have largely replaced. Corn listers were common on the Great Plains in the 1920s through 1950s.|$|R
60|$|<b>Farther</b> on <b>down</b> {{the road}} the searchers {{stumbled}} over Gaston Isbel. They {{picked him up}} and followed Jean and Gordon, who were supporting the wounded Colmor. Jean looked back to see Blue dragging himself along in the rear. It was {{too dark to see}} distinctly; nevertheless, Jean got the impression that Blue was more severely wounded than he had claimed to be. The distance to Meeker's cabin was not far, but it took what Jean felt to be a long and anxious time to get there. Colmor apparently rallied somewhat. When this procession entered Meeker's yard, Blue was lagging behind.|$|R
60|$|That put {{us all in}} a {{blaze of}} excitement. Still we thought the strike they got might just have been lucky. In running <b>down</b> <b>farther,</b> so we could come back against the light breeze, we ran pretty close to the school out of which the strike had been gotten. Captain Dan stood up to take a good look.|$|R
25|$|Thatcher is {{apparent}} {{as he tries}} to intrigue her with his strength, boldness, and handsome looks. He first sees her after he confessed his feelings for Amy Lawrence, one of his classmates. He lives with his half-brother Sid, his cousin Mary, and his stern Aunt Polly. There is no mention of Tom's father. Tom has another aunt, Sally Phelps, who lives considerably <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|In 1627 Pyotr Beketov was {{appointed}} Yenisei voevoda in Siberia. He successfully {{carried out the}} voyage to collect taxes from Zabaykalye Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in Buryatia. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov {{was sent to the}} Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded Yakutsk and sent his Cossacks to explore the Aldan and <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.|$|E
25|$|The land in {{this part}} of North Carolina is low and rather flat, and is {{sometimes}} marshy. In 1862, the solid land was mostly covered with open pine forest, although in places it was broken into low hills with deciduous forests, separated by ravines. It is crossed by many creeks that sometimes rise to the status of small rivers. One of these, the Trent River, separates New Bern from the land to its south. The slightly smaller Slocum's Creek, enters 16 miles (26km) <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> the Neuse. It was to be the landing site for the attacking Federal forces.|$|E
60|$|Over she pressed, and lee-rail under, {{while he}} {{measured}} {{the weight of}} the wind and quested its easement. The tepid sea-water, with here and there tiny globules of phosphorescence, washed about his ankles and knees. The wind screamed a higher note, and every shroud and stay sharply chorused an answer as the Willi-Waw pressed <b>farther</b> over and <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|For Joan that faint trail {{seemed a}} broad road, blazoned through the wild canons {{and up the}} rocky {{fastness}} and through the thick brakes. She led {{on and on and}} up and down, never at fault, with familiar landmarks near and far. Cleve hung close to her, and now his call to her or to the pack-horse took on a keener note. Every rough and wild mile behind them meant so much. They did not halt at the noon hour. They did not halt at the next camp-site, still more darkly memorable to Joan. And sunset found them miles <b>farther</b> on, <b>down</b> on the divide, at the head of Lost Canon.|$|R
60|$|For nearly {{quarter of}} an hour we {{followed}} the footprints; then we came to dry ground again, and lost all traces of them. We wandered about perseveringly, nevertheless, and were rewarded by again discovering them about quarter of a mile <b>farther</b> on, leading <b>down</b> to the banks of the river on another part of which I had had such a narrow escape.|$|R
