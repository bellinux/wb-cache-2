In order to overcome his addiction, he tried going to rehab and alternative medicine; he was also hospitalized and put under <b>isolation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> All of these efforts were to no avail. After promising his dying mother that he would beat his addiction, he became more adamant in attempting to recover, eventually succeeding. He also quit his 20-year habit of smoking in 2010, after his son began taking and destroying his cigarettes.|$|E

There is all but one recorded visit by Zubiri to the United States, specifically Princeton University, on October 2, 1946. In Princeton, Zubiri lectured in French on [...] "The real and mathematics- A philosophical problem" [...] ("Le reel et les mathematiques—Un probleme de philosophie"). [...] Some of Zubiri's work has been translated to English: [...] "On Essence" [...] (Caponigri, 1980), [...] "Sentient Intelligence" [...] (Fowler, 1999), [...] "The Dynamic Structure of Reality" [...] (Orringer, 2003) and [...] "The Fundamental problems of Western Metaphysics" [...] (Redondo & Fowler 2009). Despite his relative academic <b>isolation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Spain, Zubiri has also been recognized in other countries. In 1979, the German government awarded Zubiri and Laín Entralgo the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Zubiri was awarded this distinction for his work in his books [...] "Nature, History, God" [...] (1954) and [...] "On Essence" [...] (1962). Zubiri's work has also been translated to French, German, Italian and Portuguese.|$|E

Modelling methods are needed to estimate the validity of these measures before their implementation on a large scale. We estimated the transmission coefficient from outbreaks of pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza among school children in Japan in summer 2009; using this transmission coefficient, we simulated the spread of pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza in a virtual community called the virtual Chuo Line which models an area {{to the west of}} metropolitan Tokyo. Measures evaluated in our simulation included: <b>isolation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> school closure, post-exposure prophylaxis and mass vaccinations of school children. We showed that post-exposure prophylaxis combined with <b>isolation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and school closure significantly decreases the total number of cases in the community and can mitigate the spread of pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza, even when there is a delay in the availability of vaccine...|$|E

40|$|The {{summer job}} market for teens in both Massachusetts and the U. S. {{over the past}} five years has been quite depressed, with record low summer {{employment}} rates for the nation's teens being set in the past three years (2010 - 2012). 1 The teen summer employment rate in Massachusetts fell from 67 % in 1999 to only 36 % in 2012, a decline of 31 percentage points (Chart 1). Black and Hispanic teens, especially those residing in low income families and from high poverty neighborhoods, have experienced the greatest difficulties in finding employment in the summer. Lack of job opportunities reduces teens' exposure to the world of work and their ability to acquire both basic employability skills (attendance, team work, communicating with other workers and customers) and occupational skills. Being jobless all summer also increases their risk of social <b>isolation</b> (staying <b>at</b> <b>home),</b> hanging out on the street, and exposure to or participation in urban violence and delinquent behavior...|$|R
50|$|Many {{children}} {{with developmental disabilities}} have an abundance of friends throughout their youth. Children during the elementary years are accepting of disabilities and {{went out of their}} way to make {{children with}} disabilities feel included in school. However, as kids grow up and mature socially, the children with developmental or intellectual disabilities were left isolated and deemed socially awkward. The Special Olympics becomes a safe haven for these kids and brings balance back into the athletes' lives. The relationships that the athletes form with one another are different from the ones they are able to form in schools because participants understand each other and are able to bond over a mutual interest and goal. The relationships started in the Special Olympics turn into great friendships that carry over into the everyday lives of these athletes. The idea of <b>isolation</b> or sitting <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with their parents is completely lost.|$|R
40|$|The study review {{guidelines}} on isolation {{of patients with}} tuberculosis, TB, from the World Health Organization, WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the European Center for Disease Control, ECDC. The review found that unequivocal guidelines for removing patients out of negative-pressure isolation and de-isolation patients from either single rooms or <b>isolation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> is needed. Studies show that the time of effective treatment is the key parameter to follow to determine if patients are contagious to others or not. This means that standard treatment of multi-drug resistant, MDR, TB will not result in the patient being non-infectious. Thus it is important right {{from the time of}} diagnosis to know if the patient is infected with MDR TB or not. Thus the early use of molecular techniques to reveal drug susceptibility is important. Clear guidelines stating if patient with microscopy negative sputum no matter infected with fully susceptible or MDR TB, no matter HIV positive or not is needed...|$|E
40|$|Compared 56 {{children}} between the ages of 5 and 12 years to a sample of healthy controls. All cancer patients had been treated between the ages of 2 and 5 years. Children completed the Self-Perception Profile for children and questionnaires assessing social adjustment. Parent and teacher ratings were also obtained. The cancer patients reported greater feelings of isola-tion than the controls but otherwise few differences were noted. There were few differences between cancer patients and controls in the teacher and par-ent report. Results are discussed in terms of the need to investigate behavioral sequelae of childhood illness and directions for future research. KEY WORDS: cancer survivors; social adjustment; children. Social adjustment difficulties and social skills deficits may be hypothesized to occur in childhood cancer patients, especially young patients, due to a number of factors related to treatment. Children may encounter social difficulties due to changes in physical appearance (e. g., hair loss, loss of a limb). Social difficulties may also arise secondary to separation from peers as result of hospitalizations and/or <b>isolation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> as well as limitations in activities imposed by their disease...|$|E
40|$|Using time-use {{data from}} Canada, Norway, and Sweden, this study briefly {{outlines}} {{the essence of}} the activity setting approach and illustrates one aspect of its usefulness by exploring the impact of social contact on travel behaviour. The activity system approach views behaviour in context. Activity settings are generic components of the activity system and studying them using time-use diaries can provide major insights into travel behaviour. Focusing on social contact, this paper characterizes the social environment in terms of social circle (interaction partners) and social space (location). The analysis shows that there are clear differences in the levels of social interaction across various groups, including those who work at home. The 1992 Canadian data showed people working at the workplace spend relatively more time with others, about 50 % of total time awake. Working at home reduced the time with others to a low of 15. 7 %. when people worked at home the family benefited, almost doubling the time spent with them compared to those working at the workplace. Persons working at home only spend the most time alone. There is a tendency for persons with low social interaction to travel more. It is argued that individual need, or want, social contact and if they cannot find it at the workplace they will seek it elsewhere thus generating travel. Whether this is the result of need or opportunity is of minor relevance, what it does suggest is that working in <b>isolation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> will not necessarily diminish travel but rather may simply change its purpose.
