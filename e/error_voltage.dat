50|$|In radio communication, AFC {{is needed}} because, after the {{bandpass}} frequency of a receiver is {{tuned to the}} frequency of a transmitter, the two frequencies may drift apart, interrupting the reception. This {{can be caused by}} a poorly controlled transmitter frequency, but the most common cause is drift of the center bandpass frequency of the receiver, due to thermal or mechanical drift in the values of the electronic components. Assuming that a receiver is nearly tuned to the desired frequency, the AFC circuit in the receiver develops an <b>error</b> <b>voltage</b> proportional to {{the degree to which the}} receiver is mistuned. This <b>error</b> <b>voltage</b> is then fed back to the tuning circuit in such a way that the tuning error is reduced.

5000|$|The FPS-16 system {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Project Mercury tracking network did not have adequate displays and controls for reliably acquiring the spacecraft in the acquisition time available. Consequently, a contract was negotiated with a manufacturer to provide the instrumentation radar acquisition (IRACQ)RAnge Acquisition modifications. For the near earth spacecraft involved a major limitation of the FPS-16 was its mechanical range gear box, a wonderful piece of engineering. However, for a target at a range typically, say, [...] at acquisition of signal AOS, the radar was tracking second time around, that is, the pulse received in this interpulse period was that due to the previously transmitted pulse, {{and it would be}} indicating a range of [...] As the range closed the return pulse became {{closer and closer to the}} time at which the next transmitter pulse should occur. If they were allowed to coincide, remembering that the transmit-receive switch disconnected the receive (Rx) and connected the transmit (Tx) to the antenna at that instant, track would be lost. So, IRACQ provided an electronic ranging system, the function of which was to provide the necessary gating pulses to the Az and El receiver channels so that the system would maintain angle track. The system utilized a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO as the clock generator for the range counters. An early/late gate system derived an <b>error</b> <b>voltage</b> which either increased a closing target or decreased an opening target the clock frequency, thus causing the gates to be generated so as to track the target. It also, when the target reached an indicated range of less than 16000 yd, took over the generation of transmitter trigger pulses and delayed these by 16000 yd, thus enabling the received pulses to pass through the Big Bang, as it was called, of normally timed Tx pulses. The radar operator, would, while IRACQ maintained angle track be slewing the range system from minimum range to maximum so as to regain track of the target at its true range of <500 nmi (900 km). As the target passed through point of closest approach (PCA) and increased in range the process was repeated at maximum range indication. The most difficult passes were those in which the orbit was such that the target came to PCA at a range of, say 470 nmi. That pass required the radar operator to work very hard as the radar closed, and then opened in range through the Big Bang in short order. The IRACQ Console contained a C-scope associated with which was a small joy stick which gave C-scope operator control of the antenna angle servo systems so that he could adjust the pointing angle to acquire the signal. IRACQ included a scan generator which drove the antenna in one of several pre-determined search patterns around the nominal pointing position, it being desirable that IRACQ acquire the target as early as possible. An essential feature of this modification is that it allows examination of all incoming video signals and allows establishment of angle-only track. Once the spacecraft has been acquired, in angle range. Other features of the IRACQ system included additional angle scan modes and radar phasing controls to permit multiple radar interrogation of the spacecraft beacon. The addition of a beacon local oscillator wave meter permitted the determination of spacecraft-transmitter frequency drift.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the power system operation, {{frequency}} <b>error</b> and <b>voltage</b> control problems. In actual power system operations the load is changing continuously and randomly. As {{the ability of the}} generation to trace the change in load is limited due to physical/technical considerations. They result an imbalance between actual and the scheduled generation quantities. This imbalance leads to a frequency <b>error</b> and <b>voltage</b> problems. In general, as the speed of the machine depends on the frequency, any deviation in the frequency may lead to mal-operation of the system. So load frequency control is the key problem in the power system. For specified power rating of the machine the voltage should maintain constant otherwise the system insulation may get damage. In modern power system multi area inter connected systems are used for more reliability and economic purpose. In the multi area inter connected systems the frequency <b>errors</b> and <b>voltage</b> problems can be effectively decreased by using fuzzy logic controller with either of the 3, 5 or 7 membership functions.
