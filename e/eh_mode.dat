It has been found that, in fiber with smaller dimension, the <b>EH</b> 11 <b>mode</b> hardly exhibits any effect due to the variation in existing nanolayer coating corresponding to 850 [*]nm wavelength.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the joint {{transmission}} of energy and information in multiuser systems, in particular, in a two-user symmetric interference channel. It is assumed that each receiver can be either in the information decoding (ID) mode, or in the energy harvesting (<b>EH)</b> <b>mode</b> at any time instant. In the ID mode, information-carrying signals from the other transmitter is considered as noise, while energy-carrying signals can be ignored owing to their known structure. In the <b>EH</b> <b>mode,</b> a receiver can harvest energy from the energy-carrying signal transmitted by its own transmitter {{as well as from}} the interfering signal from the other transmitter, be it an information or an energy-carrying signal; which is called interference harvesting. The transmission scheme is optimized in order to maximize the throughput while satisfying a constraint on the minimum amount of average harvested power by each receiver, which might model the power required by the receiver for processing and decoding the information-carrying signals. This problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem which can be efficiently solved, and provides insights on the optimal transmission scheme with the help of numerical simulations. I...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a wireless cooperative network with an energy harvesting relay which {{is powered by}} the energy harvested from ambient RF waves, {{such as that of}} a data packet. At any given time, the relay operates either in the energy harvesting (<b>EH)</b> <b>mode</b> or the data decoding (DD) mode, but not both. Separate energy and data buffers are kept at the relay to store the harvested energy and decoded data packets, respectively. In this paper, we optimize a time switching policy that switches between the <b>EH</b> <b>mode</b> and DD mode to maximize the system throughput or minimize the average transmission delay. Both static and dynamic time switching policies are derived. In particular, static policies are the ones where EH or DD mode is selected with a pre-determined probability. In contrast, in a dynamic policy, the mode is selected dynamically according to the states of data and energy buffers. We prove that the throughput-optimal static and dynamic policies keep the relay data buffer at the boundary of stability. More specifically, we show that the throughput-optimal dynamic policy has a threshold-based structure. Moreover, we prove that the delay-optimal dynamic policy also has a threshold-based structure and keeps at most one packet at the relay. We notice that the delay-optimal and throughput-optimal dynamic policies coincide in most cases. However, it is not true for optimal static policies. Finally, through extensive numerical results, we show the efficiency of optimal dynamic policies compared with the static ones in different conditions. Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures, 3 table...|$|E
40|$|The optimum {{transmission}} {{strategy for}} maximizing energy efficiency (EE) of a multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in radio frequency energy harvesting networks is investigated. We focus on dynamic time-switching (TS) antennas, {{to avoid the}} practical problems of power-splitting antennas, such as complex architectures, power loss and signal distortion when splitting {{the power of the}} received signal into power for information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH). However, since a single TS antenna cannot serve ID and EH simultaneously, the MIMO system is considered in this paper. We thus formulate an EE optimization problem and propose an iterative algorithm as a tractable solution, including an antenna selection strategy to optimally switch each TS antenna between ID mode and <b>EH</b> <b>mode</b> using nonlinear fractional programming and the Lagrange dual method. Further, the problem is solved under practical constraints of maximum transmission power and outage probabilities for a minimum amount of harvested power and rate capacity for each user. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is more energy-efficient than that of baseline schemes, and demonstrates the trade-off between the required amount of harvested power and energy efficiency...|$|E

The US Department of Energy (DOE) is cost sharing projects {{to decrease the}} cost of enzymes for biomass saccharification. The performance of benchmark cellulase preparations produced by Danisco, DSM, Novozymes and Verenium to convert pretreated corn stover (PCS) cellulose to glucose was evaluated under common experimental conditions and is reported here in a non-attributed manner. Results Two hydrolysis modes were examined, enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) of PCS whole slurry or washed PCS solids at pH 5 and 50 °C, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of washed PCS solids at pH 5 and 38 °C. Enzymes were dosed on a total protein mass basis, with protein quantified using both the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay and the Bradford assay. Substantial differences were observed in absolute cellulose to glucose conversion performance levels under the conditions tested. Higher cellulose conversion yields were obtained using washed solids compared to whole slurry, and estimated enzyme protein dosages required to achieve a particular cellulose conversion to glucose yield were extremely dependent on the protein assay used. All four enzyme systems achieved glucose yields of 90 % of theoretical or higher in SSF mode. Glucose yields were reduced in <b>EH</b> <b>mode,</b> with all enzymes achieving glucose yields of at least 85 % of theoretical on washed PCS solids and 75 % in PCS whole slurry. One of the enzyme systems ('enzyme B') exhibited the best overall performance. However in attaining high conversion yields at lower total enzyme protein loadings, the relative and rank ordered performance of the enzyme systems varied significantly depending upon which hydrolysis mode and protein assay were {{used as the basis}} for comparison. Conclusions This study provides extensive information about the performance of four precommercial cellulase preparations. Though test conditions were not necessarily optimal for some of the enzymes, all were able to effectively saccharify PCS cellulose. Large differences in the estimated enzyme dosage requirements depending on the assay used to measure protein concentration highlight the need for better consensus methods to quantify enzyme protein. </p...|$|E

An oscillation of mode factor is found {{with the increase of}} the thickness of core layer due to the internal interference between the transmitted and reflected leakage modes, and the vertical leakage loss can be canceled at some thicknesses of the core layer because of the destructive interference. Furthermore, the vertical leakage loss can also be controlled by the external interference in the microcylinder resonator with two vertical coupled core layers.

Accordingly, from the wireless information transmission (WIT) perspective, the system of interest can be modeled as the classic interference channel, while it also can be regarded as a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for collaborative wireless energy transmission (WET). To enable both information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) in SWIPT, we adopt the low-complexity time switching operation at each receiver to switch between the ID and <b>EH</b> <b>modes</b> over scheduled time. Based on this hybrid model, we aim to characterize the achievable rate-energy (R-E) trade-offs in the multiuser SWIPT system under various transmitter-side collaboration schemes.

We aimed to characterize the role of mtDNA mutation in EH. We reported a large Han Chinese family with a maternally inherited EH and an extraordinarily high percentage of sudden death mainly in affected females. Analysis of the entire mtDNA genome of the proband identified a homoplasmic primary mutation m. 14484 T>C for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), along with several variants indicating haplogroup F 1 status. Intriguingly, no maternal member in this family had LHON though they all harbored m. 14484 T>C. The arterial stiffness of the members carrying mutation m. 14484 T>C was significantly increased than that of non-maternal members without this mutation.
