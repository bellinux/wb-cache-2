Furthermore, the time that drugs are approved for use averages seven years out of the twenty years on-patent, meaning a tendency for the market to focus on diseases of developed nations where high prices can be used to recoup research and development costs, and subsidize failed R&D efforts.

For a manufacturing company to succeed therefore, {{it is necessary}} for them to operate with a global perspective. In the area of fire safety, this requires understanding of, and compliance with, global <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements.</b> This research develops a systematic approach that can be utilized to analyze and compare the complex fire <b>safety</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> that are stipulated for a selected topic in various countries. The approach developed is sufficiently general that it can be leveraged to compare and contrast global standards in any field or discipline. The methodology outlines six aspects of the regulatory environment that must be considered in sorting standards and then uses spreadsheets and a mind mapping program to elucidate the many relationships that exist amongst the current standards. In this work, flammability test requirements for public transportation seating are studied, with a major emphasis on seating for railway applications. Requirements for seating in aviation, automotive (both cars and buses) and military vehicles are included in the discussion for comparative purposes. Fire is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to characterize. The legislated testing protocols reflect this complexity with some geographic jurisdictions mandating as many as six different types of fire testing for rail seating. This work looks in depth at two of the main types of fire testing: flame spread testing and toxic effluent testing. Flame spread testing was chosen because it is widely required, and toxic effluent testing was chosen because of the many complexities and ambiguities present amongst these standards. Eleven flame-spread tests are compared on a semi-quantitative basis, and eight fire effluent toxicity tests are discussed on a qualitative basis. The technique developed was useful to elucidate the relationships, similarities and differences amongst the fire safety requirements for transportation seating. There are large differences in requirements among transportation sectors as well as on a geographical basis. Using this technique, it was possible to categorize the flame spread tests into two groups and to compare the relative intensity of the tests within each of these subsets.

40|$|New objective-based <b>safety</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> for European {{air traffic}} {{services}} mandate {{the introduction of}} safety management systems, set a numerical target level of safety (TLS) for service provision, and specify requirements for the approval of software in safety-related systems. These requirements challenge much current “best practice ” in safety management and, though directed at air traffic management (ATM), have major implications for other application sectors. In presenting a framework for tackling these issues, the paper examines current safety practices. In particular it challenges, from a theoretical perspective, and by reference to recent research, two common misconceptions- that safety is largely a matter of equipment reliability and that process-based assurance can provide adequate evidence of system safety. It argues that failure to address these two weaknesses can lead to, wasted effort, inadequate safety assurance and, at worst, unsafe systems. Since sound safety requirements are fundamental to system safety, the paper proposes a rigorous requirements-engineering method and explains how satisfaction arguments can help ensure correctness, completeness, and consistency throughout high-level safety requirements, system specification and system design, {{in relation to the}} important (often overlooked) properties of the application domain. The paper asserts that it is all too common, in the ATM sector at least, for more than 90 % of system safety effort to be expended on less than 10 % of the problem (ie on equipment issues) and argues that a servicelevel TLS requires that the dominant cause of accidents (human factors) be given proportionate consideration, otherwise the overall system may not achieve the required level of safety. Objective-based safety regulation and effective safety management systems place the “burden of proof ” in safety assurance firmly on the “regulatee”, and demands a highly rigorous approach to system development and safety assurance. The paper outlines the principles of “human-centred engineering ” and “white-box safety ” and explains how they can make a major contribution to the achievement and assurance of safety. The paper concludes by considering whether the new regulatory regime is a good thing...|$|R

A performance assessment was completed for the transuranic inventory in the boreholes and submitted to the Transuranic Waste Disposal Federal Review Group. The performance assessment was prepared by Sandia National Laboratories {{on behalf of the}} U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office using an iterative methodology that assessed radiological releases from the intermediate depth disposal configuration against the <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> of the 1985 version of 40 CFR 191 of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. The transuranic materials are stored at 21 to 37 m depth (70 to 120 ft) in large diameter boreholes constructed in the unsaturated alluvial deposits of Frenchman Flat. Hydrologic processes that affect long- term isolation of the radionuclides are dominated by extremely slow upward rates of liquid/vapor advection and diffusion; there is no downward pathway under current climatic conditions and there is no recharge to groundwater under future ''glacial'' climatic conditions. A Federal Review Team appointed by the Transuranic Waste Disposal Federal Review Group reviewed the Greater Confinement Disposal performance assessment and found that the site met the majority of the regulatory criteria of the 1985 and portions of the 1993 versions of 40 CFR 191. A number of technical and procedural issues required development of supplemental information that was incorporated into a final revision of the performance assessment. These issues include inclusion of radiological releases into the complementary cumulative distribution function for the containment requirements associated with drill cuttings from inadvertent human intrusion, verification of mathematical models used in the performance assessment, inclusion of dose calculations from collocated low-level waste in the boreholes for the individual protection requirements, further assessments of engineered barriers and conditions associated with the assurance requirements, and expansion of documentation provided for assessing the groundwater protection requirements. The Transuranic Waste Disposal Federal Review Group approved the performance assessment for Greater Confinement Disposal boreholes in 2001 and did not approve the Application of the Assurance Requirements. Remaining issues concerned with engineered barriers and the multiple aspects of the Assurance Requirements will be resolved at the time of closure of the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site.

The opportunity exists for many automotive Tier 1, and potentially Tier 2 suppliers, to see substantial improvements to their competitiveness and profitability by improving their maintenance performance within an industry where research has shown modern maintenance practices are, at best, limited. Other Industrial sectors have a different performance profile in terms of maintenance.

The combination of phage display repertoire cloning with precise selection procedures enables isolation of specific genes that can then be inserted into mammalian expression systems allowing production of large quantities of recombinant human proteins. With the aim of selecting high-affinity anti-RhD antibodies, two human Fab libraries were constructed from a hyperimmune donor. Use of a new phage panning procedure involving bromelin-treated red blood cells enabled the isolation of two high-affinity Fab-expressing phage clones. LD- 6 - 3 and LD- 6 - 33, specific for RhD.

40|$|In PIRT studies, {{the degree}} of {{importance}} of a phenomenon is evaluated by its relative importance against a criterion called the Figure of Merit (FoM). The selection of the FoM {{is a very important}} step in the overall PIRT process. In some past PIRTs, the acceptance criteria for the safety analysis were used as the FoM. The acceptance criteria for the safety analysis mentioned here mean quantitative allowance criteria used to define an acceptable solution. For LWRs, NRC policies and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections, such as 10 CFR 50 Appendix A [4 - 19] and the Standard Review Plan (SRP) [4 - 20], provide these criteria. These <b>regulatory</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> require that the reactor system be maintained in a safe condition during an accident, transient, and rated operation. As shown in Table 4. 3 - 1, the <b>regulatory</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> result from a hierarchy of requirements [4 - 21]. The most important requirement stipulated for the reactor system is "Protect public health and safety, " per 10 CFR 1. 11 [4 - 22], which indicates this statement should be placed on the top level of the hierarchy. This is the essential part of safety for the reactor system, i. e., the primary regulatory issue, and the origin for the selection of the FoM. Also, the requirements of the lower hierarchy levels express the detailed content of upper levels, so the requirement items of each lower level must also encompass the items of higher levels. As an illustration, the purpose of "limit fission product release, " which is the second requirement, is to "protect public health and safety, " which is the top requirement. To simplify and make the selection of FoM easier, a number of PIRTs select physical quantities that are directly related to the requirements above [4 - 21] as FoM. The following are the characteristics required for FoM [4 - 21]: * Directly related to issue * Directly related to phenomen...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractDNA vaccinations against fish viral {{diseases}} as IHNV at {{commercial level}} in Canada against VHSV at experimental level are both success stories. DNA vaccination strategies against many other viral diseases have, however, not yet yielded sufficient results {{in terms of}} protection. There is an obvious need to combat many other viral diseases within aquaculture where inactivated vaccines fail. There are many explanations to why DNA vaccine strategies against other viral diseases fail to induce protective immune responses in fish. These obstacles include: 1) too low immunogenicity of the transgene, 2) too low expression of the transgene {{that is supposed to}} induce protection, 3) suboptimal immune responses, and 4) too high degradation rate of the delivered plasmid DNA. There are also uncertainties with regard distribution and degradation of DNA vaccines that may have implications for <b>safety</b> and <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> that need to be clarified. By combining plasmid DNA with different kind of adjuvants one can increase the immunogenicity of the transgene antigen – and perhaps increase the vaccine efficacy. By using molecular adjuvants with or without in combination with targeting assemblies one may expect different responses compared with naked DNA. This includes targeting of DNA vaccines to antigen presenting cells as a central factor in improving their potencies and efficacies by means of encapsulating the DNA vaccine in certain carriers systems that may increase transgene and MHC expression.

40|$|Extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles, are {{released}} by different cell types {{and participate in}} physiological and pathophysiological processes. EVs mediate intercellular communication as cell-derived extracellular signalling organelles that transmit specific information from their cell of origin to their target cells. As {{a result of these}} properties, EVs of defined cell types may serve as novel tools for various therapeutic approaches, including (a) anti-tumour therapy, (b) pathogen vaccination, (c) immune-modulatory and regenerative therapies and (d) drug delivery. The translation of EVs into clinical therapies requires the categorization of EV-based therapeutics in compliance with existing regulatory frameworks. As the classification defines subsequent requirements for manufacturing, quality control and clinical investigation, it is of major importance to define whether EVs are considered the active drug components or primarily serve as drug delivery vehicles. For an effective and particularly safe translation of EV-based therapies into clinical practice, a high level of cooperation between researchers, clinicians and competent authorities is essential.

These SINV/EEEVs, which are not classified as select agents, were evaluated as alternative diagnostic reagents in a PRNT using human, equine, and murine sera. The results indicate that the chimeric viruses exhibit specificity comparable to that of wild-type EEEV, with only a slight reduction in sensitivity. Considering their benefits in increased <b>safety</b> and reduced <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements,</b> these chimeric viruses should be highly useful in diagnostic laboratories throughout the Americas...|$|R
40|$|The {{public health}} burden caused by {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) continues to adversely affect individuals {{in terms of}} cost, life expectancy, medical, pharmaceutical and hospital care. This burden has been excessive {{in the case of}} African Americans. The objective {{of this paper is to}} chronicle the procedures and processes that were implemented in the development of the Jackson Heart Study Coordinating Center. The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a population-based investigation of traditional and emerging risk factors that predict progression to CVD among African Americans. In response to the struggle against CVD, the Jackson Heart Study has convened a professional, technical, and administrative staff with specific competence in the operation of a coordinating center to handle the wide variety of areas related to CVD studies. The Jackson Heart Study Coordinating Center (JHSCC) was created to assure validity of the JHS findings and provide the resources necessary to meet comprehensive statistical needs (planning, implementing and monitoring data analysis); data management (designing, implementing and managing data collection and quality control), and administrative support. The JHSCC began with a commitment to support study functions in order to increase participant recruitment, retention and <b>safety,</b> meet <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements,</b> prepare progress reports, and facilitate effective communication with the community and between all JHS centers. The JHSCC facilitates the efforts of the JHS scientists through the development and implementation of the study protocol. The efforts of the JHSCC have resulted in the successful preparation of scientific reports and manuscripts for publication and presentation of study findings and results. In summary, the JHSCC has emerged as an effective research mechanism that serves as the driving force behind the Jackson Heart Study activities...|$|R
40|$|FRP piping {{installations}} {{have significantly}} expanded their application in offshore industry in recent years. Although light weight, low cost, superior corrosion resistance, and simple maintenance {{have been recognized}} as major advantages of using FRP piping, the design and certification of FRP piping are typically not as well understood as those for metallic counterpart. Material anisotropy and long-term degradation of FRP require distinctive strength design methods, acceptance criteria and testing procedures. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> also impose design restrictions on electric conductivity and fire endurance {{that may not be}} significant for metallic pipes. This paper discusses these critical design and certification issues {{in a way that is}} consistent with the guideline recently published by American Bureau of Shipping. Three major topics are covered in this paper, including (1) the strength criteria and recommended design methods for FRP pipes, (2) the approaches for achieving electric conductivity requirements, and (3) the interpretation of the roles of various testing requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{basis for}} {{development}} of the Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) Monitoring Plan was established in HNF- 3312, MCO Monitoring Activity Description (Sexton 1998), with the following specific objectives: The safety of Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project processes for retrieving, packaging, handling, conditioning, and storing the N Reactor spent nuclear fuel has been demonstrated by conservative analyses, as compiled in the project safety basis and licensing documentation. Appropriate quality assurance and independent checking of engineering, fabrication, and construction are being applied, {{and there will be}} in-process monitoring and verification of MCO loading and conditioning actions. Once the MCOs have been placed in storage, there is no <b>safety</b> <b>requirement,</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement,</b> or precedent to monitor them. Although not required, a monitoring program which would acquire data for use by Process Engineering is considered valuable for several reasons (Sexton 1998) : Good engineering practice [...] Acquiring data at a reasonable cost that may be useful in developing a fuller understanding of the behavior of an engineered system is good engineering practice. Actual data on full scale MCOs is otherwise unavailable [...] Previous investigations have been limited to small fuel samples or simulant prototypes and have been relatively short in duration. MCO monitoring can provide data on large loads of actual fuel, in full-scale configuration, over longer time periods. Additional knowledge of the fuel type may prove valuable in future analyses or applications. On that basis, a program with two components was planned: The pressure/temperature/gas composition relationships will be observed in a limited number of MCOs during the first two years in storage. The remaining MCOs will incorporate a simple means to confirm {{at any time in the}} future, that internal pressure of the MCO is not high enough to threaten its structural integrity. The MCOs are likely to be stored for 40 years or longer. While routine checking of high pressure indication is not required or anticipated, the capability would always be available and is likely to be used prior to MCO handling and transport. Monitoring is to be kept practical and cost effective such that it will not interfere with the fundamental project objective of putting the spent fuel in a safe configuration away from the river. Significant work has be done to implement these objectives, and this MCO Monitoring Plan will describe the results of this and provide the basis to complete its integration into all required SNF Project documentation...|$|R
