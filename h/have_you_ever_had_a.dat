That's where a number of chappies would slip up, and I'm pretty certain I should have slipped up myself, but for another {{singularly}} rummy occurrence. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> what-do-you-call it?

60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> man try {{to explain}} to you what {{happened}} in a book {{as far as he}} has read? It is a most instructive thing. Sinclair, the man who shares my rooms with me, made such an attempt the other night. I had come in cold and tired from a walk and found him full of excitement, with a bulky magazine {{in one hand and a}} paper-cutter gripped in the other.|$|E
60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{difference}} with a dear friend? How his letters, {{written in the}} period of love and confidence, sicken and rebuke you! What a dreary mourning it is to dwell upon those vehement protests of dead affection! What lying epitaphs they make over the corpse of love! What dark, cruel comments upon Life and Vanities! Most of us have got or written drawers full of them. They are closet-skeletons which we keep and shun. Osborne trembled long before the letter from his dead son.|$|E

All three of us have seen this kind of passion in our students when they have participated in classroom International Relations (IR) simulations. There is something rewarding about watching a student spell out in painful detail how he doesn’t want to lie but – having read Machiavelli or Morgenthau and being surrounded by a ‘million other countries who are all looking to conquer me’ when playing the game Diplomacy – he understands that lying is the smart thing to do and regular morality can be chucked out the window. That sense of having accomplished something significant as a teacher only increases when other students in the classroom, including those that had been lied to, nod in agreement and point out how events in the game directly demonstrate aspects of various IR theories (Asal 2005) ...|$|E
