5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, MITS had 230 {{employees}} {{and sales of}} $6 million. Roberts was tiring of his management responsibilities and {{was looking for a}} larger partner. MITS had always used Pertec Computer Corporation <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> and on December 3, 1976, Pertec signed a letter of intent to acquire MITS for $6 million in stock. The deal was completed in May 1977 just before the National Computer Conference in Dallas, Texas. Roberts got $2 million and the other 500 MITS shareholders (including the Altair co-designer, William Yates) split the rest.|$|E
5|$|The only floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> {{that were}} readily {{available}} in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 disk drive which could store over 300,000 bytes of data. The Altair disk controller occupied two boards and had over 60 ICs. The initial units were to be available in August, but were delayed {{until the end of}} 1975. The production version of Extended Disk BASIC was released in April 1976. The controller with one disk drive sold for $1,480 (kit) and $1,980 (assembled).|$|E
50|$|As an example, a new <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> {{costs about}} $200 to purchase, the {{technical}} assistance to replace the <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> is $500, and a refurbished computer costs about $600.

5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|USB was {{designed}} to standardize the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has largely replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial ports and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices – and has become commonplace {{on a wide range}} of devices.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} USB1.0 specification, {{which was}} introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5Mbit/s Low Speed and 12Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> and the lower 1.5Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, {{which led to the}} broader PC market using USB as a standard.|$|E

25|$|A hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> or hard <b>drive,</b> hard <b>disk,</b> or fixed <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> is a {{non-volatile}} storage device which stores digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces. The hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> {{was invented by}} Reynold Johnson and commercially introduced in 1956 with the IBM 305 RAMAC computer.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} {{processor}} options: Intel 486SL @ 25 MHz or 33 MHz. The 25-MHz model was available {{with either a}} 120-MB or 240-MB IDE hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> and the 33-MHz model had a 240-MB IDE hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> Both models had a built in 3.5" [...] 1.44-MB floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sectors are 512 bytes long, for {{compatibility}} with hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> {{and the first}} sector can contain a master boot record and a partition table. Therefore, USB flash units can be partitioned just like hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{form factor}} (e.g., 2.5inch) hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> often consume less power per {{gigabyte}} than physically larger drives. Unlike hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> solid-state drives store data in flash memory or DRAM. With no moving parts, power consumption {{may be reduced}} somewhat for low-capacity flash-based devices.|$|E
25|$|While floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> {{still have}} some limited uses, {{especially}} with legacy industrial computer equipment, they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity, such as USB flash drives, flash storage cards, portable external hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> optical discs, ROM cartridges, and storage available through computer networks.|$|E

50|$|A servowriter or disk {{writer is}} a complex machine used in the {{manufacturing}} of a hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> It can write servo tracks (a circular string of sector marks) with much greater precision than a <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> can. This {{is due to the}} big motors, sensors and cooling systems that would be too bulky and expensive to build into a <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> The servowriter writes the tracks on the raw media in the factory before the media is assembled into the <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> The assembled <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> can follow the precise tracks, even though it is not capable of writing them. Once the read/write head has found the proper track, it can read and write data between the sector marks on the track.|$|R
25|$|External hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> {{typically}} connect via USB; variants using USB2.0 interface {{generally have}} slower data transfer rates {{when compared to}} internally mounted hard drives connected through SATA.

25|$|Such large platters {{were never}} used with {{microprocessor-based}} systems. With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in floppy-disk drives (FDDs), HDDs {{that would fit}} to the FDD mountings became desirable. Thus HDD Form factors, initially followed those of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> Because there were no smaller floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings or industry standards.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, as of 2002 most {{manufacturers}} still provided floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> {{as standard}} equipment to meet user demand for file-transfer and an emergency boot device, {{as well as}} for the general secure feeling of having the familiar device. By this time, the retail cost of a floppy drive had fallen to around $20, so there was little financial incentive to omit the device from a system. Subsequently, enabled by the widespread support for USB flash drives and BIOS boot, manufacturers and retailers progressively reduced the availability of floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> as standard equipment. In February 2003, Dell announced that floppy drives would no longer be pre-installed on Dell Dimension home computers, although they were still available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket OEM add-on.
