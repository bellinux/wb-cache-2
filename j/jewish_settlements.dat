5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle the valley {{in order to establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> in the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel {{captured}} the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> in those territories. From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place, which included the Declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988 and ended with the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist in}} {{controlling}} the region, an ad-hoc formation called Craforce was established. Under {{the command of}} the division's commander, Royal Artillery Brigadier C. H. Colquhoun, were the division's artillery, the 17th/21st Lancers, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Battalion Irish Guards. Craforce became involved with breaking up attacks between Arab and Jewish forces. The Arabs did not directly attack the British, but did engage them when British attempted to intervene in an attack on <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, a group of {{students}} of the Vilna Gaon immigrated to the land of Israel and renewed the <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlement</b> in Safed and surrounding area, and reinforced the <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlement</b> in Jerusalem and Hebron.|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1929 as a large {{collective}} farm. Specifically, Amurzet {{has a history of}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlement</b> in the JAO since its inception. Concerning the period 1929 through 1939, Amurzet was the center of <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlement</b> for the area south of Birobidzhan.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} {{established}} in 1980 {{as part of the}} Lookouts in the Galilee plan to encourage <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlement</b> in the region. Its name is derived from an ancient <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlement</b> in the area and {{the fact that some of}} the residents worked as blacksmiths.|$|R
5|$|Operation Agatha {{started at}} 04:15 on 29 June. The 2nd Parachute Brigade was {{responsible}} for Tel Aviv, the 1st Parachute Brigade for <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> around Ma'abarot and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for those around Givat Brenner. The operation ended on 1July after 2,718 suspects had been arrested. Many had no connection to the resistance movements and were instead arrested for harassing the searchers or for refusing to give their names when asked. The 6th Airborne Division alone arrested 636 persons, 135 of them for being suspected Palmach members and ten were Jewish leaders.|$|E
5|$|Tension in the Golan Heights area {{remained}} {{high and}} on 9January the <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> of Dan and Kfar Szold {{were attacked by}} Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army, who crossed the border from Syria. The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.|$|E
5|$|By 1935, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} {{several hundred}} men—the figures range from 200 to 800—organized in cells of five men, and arranged military training for peasants. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which {{they used to}} raid <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> and sabotage British-constructed rail lines. Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass, al-Qassam's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force, Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.|$|E
50|$|When, in 1928, the Soviet Union {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlement</b> in Crimea and endorsed instead the eventual formation of a Jewish Autonomous Republic in the eastern USSR, ICOR followed suit.

5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|The guerrilla bands {{became known}} as the Black Hand (al-kaff al-aswad), an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organization. The idea for such a group {{appeared}} to have crystallized after the 1929 riots. From the outset, a split occurred in the movement. One faction led by Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir argued for immediate attacks against British and Jewish targets, while the other faction, headed by al-Qassam, thought than an armed revolt was premature and risked exposing the group's preparations. According to Subhi Yasin, a comrade of al-Qassam, the group's attacks in the north were executed by Abu Ibrahim's group in defiance of al-Qassam, though in 1969, Abu Ibrahim denied this allegation. The Black Hand's ensuing campaign began with the ambush and killing of three members of Kibbutz Yagur on 11 April 1931, a failed bomb attack on outlying Jewish homes in Haifa in early 1932, and several operations that killed or wounded four members of northern <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements.</b> The campaign climaxed with the deaths of a Jewish father and son in Nahalal, from a bomb thrown into their home, on 22 December 1932.|$|E
5|$|Hinduism is {{the major}} {{religion}} with about 80% of the population adhering to it. About 11% of the population follow Islam and 8% follow Christianity. Evidence of prehistoric religion in South India comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals in Stone Age sites such as the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka. Hinduism, often regarded as the oldest religion in the world, traces its roots to prehistoric times in India. The main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier. Ayyavazhi is spread significantly across the southern parts of South India. Islam was introduced to South India in the early 7th century by Arab traders in Malabar Coast of Kerala and spread during the rule of Deccan Sultanates from 17th to 18th century and the Muslims in Kerala of Arab descent are called Jonaka Mappila. Christianity was introduced to South India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and baptised Kerala's <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements.</b> Kerala {{is also home to}} one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world who are supposed to have arrived in the Malabar coast during the reign of King Solomon.|$|E

5|$|Most Lithuanian Jews {{perished in}} the first phase during the first months of the {{occupation}} and before the end of 1941. The first recorded action of the Einsatzgruppen (Einsatzgruppe A) took place on June 22, 1941, in the border town of Gargzdai (called Gorzdt in Yiddish and Garsden in German), {{which was one of the}} oldest <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> in the country and only 18 kilometres (11mi) from German-annexed Memel. Approximately 800 Jews were shot that day in what is known as the Garsden Massacre. Approximately 100 non-Jewish Lithuanians were also executed, many for trying to aid their Jewish neighbors. About80,000 Jews were killed by October and about175,000 by the end of the year. The majority of Jews in Lithuania were not required to live in ghettos nor sent to the Nazi concentration camps which at that time were just in the preliminary stages of operation. Instead they were shot in pits near their places of residence with the most infamous mass murders taking place in the Ninth Fort near Kaunas and the Ponary Forest near Vilnius. By 1942 about 45,000Jews survived, largely those who had been sent to ghettos and camps. In the second phase, the Holocaust slowed, as Germans decided to use the Jews as forced labor to fuel the German war economy. In the third phase, the destruction of Jews was again given a high priority; it was in that phase that the remaining ghettos and camps were liquidated.|$|E
