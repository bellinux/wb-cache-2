2500|$|Although Bangkok's canals {{historically}} {{served as}} a major mode of transport, they have long since been surpassed in importance by land traffic.

A complex elevated expressway network helps bring traffic {{into and out of the}} city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first rapid transit system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and boat services which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals.

Moreover, when answering a question during this time about whether young people were misunderstood by the older generation, she said [...] "Yes, but I'm sure that's been the case down the ages. It's too much to expect people of the older generation completely to understand people of my age. Some {{of the ways in which}} we behave were unheard of in my mother's young days, but each generation finds different symbols to express its discontent." [...] Also, when asked at the same time about how she felt about her rapid rise to stardom at such a young age, Bazlen said [...] "I realise what a lucky person I am and I'm anxious to repay the trust a lot of important people have placed in me.

2500|$|Robert Hilburn of The Los Angeles Times favorably {{reviewed}} the tour, exclaiming [...] "There {{is so much}} of the ambition and glamour of a Broadway musical in Janet Jackson's new Velvet Rope Tour that it's only fitting that the concert program credits her as the show's creator and director." [...] Although [...] "those aren't terms normally employed in the pop-rock world", Hilburn applauded Jackson's credibility in portraying [...] "a dazzling package, complete with snappy choreography, a colorful array of costumes and often striking staging." [...] Hilburn observed [...] "there were several moments in the show when Jackson stepped beyond the production values and touched us in a way the best pop performers have done over the years." [...] Emphasis was placed on the [...] "playfulness of the fairy tale staging" [...] of [...] "Escapade", the [...] "artful musical stretch" [...] of [...] "Got 'Til It's Gone", and the intimacy of [...] "soul-searching" [...] ballad [...] "Special", adding [...] "Jackson <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> personal stamp on this show that humanizes not only the music but also the performer too." [...] Jackson's [...] "radiance and warmth" [...] was believed {{to be the result of}} [...] "her own new-found self esteem", overcoming some of the insecurities plaguing her since childhood. Upon the show's encore Jackson [...] "lingered, clinging to the thunderous applause" [...] in a way which [...] "demonstrated a personal vulnerability and warmth", considered its [...] "real breakthrough." [...] Hilburn stated [...] "the tour and album should go a long way toward helping Jackson finally get the credit she deserves as an artist." [...] The tour's [...] "computer design-phase" [...] was considered [...] "a marvel of precision" [...] by Tom Moon of The Inquirer. Its [...] "eerie, robotic aura of a video game" [...] was thought to be complimented by pyrotechnics detonated [...] "At all the right, surprising moments", a troupe of [...] "lockstep" [...] dancers likened to [...] "a phalanx of marching insects", and [...] "stylized stage sets", ranging from [...] "a child's nursery to a swing-era street scene." [...] The show's lengthy [...] "high-concept medleys" [...] and [...] "power-as-aphrodisiac theme" [...] where analyzed to be commanding and accentuated her physical presence, ripping off her blouse with [...] "theatrical grandeur." [...] Additionally, Jackson's rapid [...] "clockwork" [...] movement was thought to be [...] "high price", declared as nearly mechanical in certain segments. Moon declared [...] "The audience cheered throughout the lavish production; the glossy, every-note-in-its-place music hardly mattered: This was Janet, the noted control freak. The sexually ambiguous diva. The drill sergeant of the rhythm nation. She can do as she pleases." ...|$|E
