5000|$|One {{advantage}} of barrier systems over other lane management treatments (i.e. traffic cones or overhead <b>directional</b> <b>lights)</b> {{is that a}} solid, positive barrier prevents vehicle collisions due to motorists crossing over into opposing traffic flow.

50|$|The {{first step}} renders {{the scene from}} the light's point of view. For a point light source, the view should be a {{perspective}} projection as wide as its desired angle of effect (it will {{be a sort of}} square spotlight). For <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> (e.g., that from the Sun), an orthographic projection should be used.|$|E

50|$|Most devices (such as solar cells) for {{converting}} the incoming energy to useful output {{are relatively small}} and costly, and they work best at converting <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> at high intensities and a narrow frequency range, whereas input radiation tends to be at diffuse frequencies, of relatively low irradiance and saturation. Concentration of the input energy accordingly is one option for efficiency and economy.|$|E

The RGB normalization will address the <b>directional</b> <b>lighting</b> effect, while the GC normalizes a face image to a pre-defined ‘canonical form’[*], which fades away the effect of illumination.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a simple method for decomposing the linear texture space of a facial {{appearance}} model into two linear subspaces, one for inter-individual variability and another for variations caused by directional changes of the lighting conditions. The approach used is to create one linear subspace from individuals with uniform illumination conditions and then filter a set of images with various <b>directional</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions by projecting corresponding textures on the previously built space; the residues are further used to build a second subspace for <b>directional</b> <b>lighting.</b> The resulted subspaces are orthogonal, so the overall texture model can be obtained by a simple concatenation of the two subspaces. The main advantage of this representation is that two sets of parameters are used to control inter-individual variation and separately intra-individual variation due to changes in illumination conditions...|$|R

50|$|A theorized superlens could {{exceed the}} {{diffraction}} limit that prevents standard (positive-index) lenses from resolving objects smaller {{than one-half of}} the wavelength of visible light. Such a superlens would capture spatial information that is beyond the view of conventional optical microscopes. Several approaches to building such a microscope have been proposed. The subwavelength domain could be optical switches, modulators, photodetectors and <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> emitters.|$|E
5000|$|The Delaware River {{is served}} by various range lights. Reedy Island is {{approximately}} 5 mi southwest of {{the mouth of the}} Salem River. Reedy Island Front Light works in conjunction with the Reedy Island Range Rear Light for navigation of the Salem reach of the river. The Finns Point Range Light upstream of the Salem River was deactivated in 1950. From the Delaware River, entrance to the port is guided by the Salem River Range Lights, the Salem River <b>Directional</b> <b>Light</b> (...) , and 11 other lighted navigational aids.|$|E
50|$|After 1969, the Coast Guard removed {{lighting}} equipment {{from the original}} buildings {{and replaced them with}} a single <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> on the beach. In 1990, the Ridges Sanctuary took possession of the buildings and began restoring them; this was completed during the 1990s, when both buildings were rewired to supply electricity to the lamps. A skeleton tower, which was listed in Volume VII of the United States Coast Guard light list, provided shipping guidance until 2015, when the original range lights were updated with modern LED lamps and brought back online.|$|E

50|$|A similar {{technique}} to using a cookie is simulated in 3D computer graphics, where using an alpha map as a cookie (sometimes called a light texture) to cast shadows on 3D objects is simulated by applying an alpha texture to an emitting light {{source in the}} 3D scene, typically a spot light type or a <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> type, {{to serve as a}} virtual cookie that projects shadows onto 3D object(s) by emitting light only through the transparent or translucent parts of the alpha texture, thus simulating the effect of a cucoloris as used in its real-world counterpart. This effect is commonly used in both 3D computer-generated animation and video games.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{simplified}} and practical computational technique for estimating <b>directional</b> <b>lighting</b> in uncalibrated images of faces in frontal pose. We {{show that this}} inverse problem can be solved using constrained least-squares and class-specific priors on shape and reflectance. For simplicity, the principal illuminant is modeled as a mixture of Lambertian and ambient components. By using a generic 3 D face shape and an average 2 D albedo we can efficiently compute the <b>directional</b> <b>lighting</b> with surprising accuracy (in real-time and with or without shadows). We then use our lighting direction estimate in a forward rendering step to ¨relightärbitrarily-lit input faces to a canonical (diffuse) form as needed for illumination-invariant face verification. Experimental results with the Yale Face Database B as well as real access-control datasets illustrate the advantages over existing pre-processing techniques such as a linear ramp (facet) model commonly used for lighting normalization...|$|R

At j-th pixel, denote nj the surface normal, ρj the albedo, and bj = ρjnj the scaled normal. Note that these quantities are the same across all images and therefore independent of i. Each image comes from a different lighting environment, which has a different rendering function Ri (·), written as Ii,j = ρjRi (nj), (1) and we consider following rendering models in this note. 1. <b>Directional</b> <b>lighting</b> (distant point light source) Ri (n) = max{`>i n, 0 }.
