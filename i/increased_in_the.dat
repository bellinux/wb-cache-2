5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|A snow {{called the}} Unity {{was added to}} the fleet, and used as a tender, but was {{abandoned}} during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid. As Low's success <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, so did his notoriety. Eventually, a bounty was placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E

30|$|We {{supposed}} that an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall thickness {{leads to an}} <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall stiffness and, consequently, to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> its elastance. When the heart rate increases, the ejection duration decreases more slowly than {{the duration of the}} filling phase. Consequently <b>the</b> volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atrium <b>increases,</b> leading to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> veinous pressure: such a phenomenon can be viewed, in our model where atria are neglected, as an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricular elastance. <b>In</b> a similar way, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end-systolic ventricular volume induces a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricular filling (more filled the ventricle is, more difficult to continue the filling is) and, consequently, induces an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atrium: this effect is described as an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elastance proportional to the volume which, as previously explained, should depend on the heart rate. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the ventricular volume and the veinous pressure was not studied and remains to validate. Such a dependency was important to be able to reproduce the proposed mechanism.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed {{south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the disturbance moved west for four days before attaining tropical depression status. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was situated over warm waters; however, wind shear subsequently <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the storm. Therefore, significant development was impeded as the depression curved back to the north along an adjacent upper-level low.|$|E

5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change.

5|$|As Finnish {{nationalism}} arose and <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, crossbreeding of the Finnish horse essentially ended {{and a new}} direction was taken by Finnish horse breeders. The breed was considered {{a symbol of the}} nation, and thus it was desired that it be as purebred as possible. On 20 November 1894, Finland's first horse breeding association Hevoskasvatusyhdistys Hippos (now Suomen Hippos) was founded to breed and improve the Finnish horse by the means of purebreeding, and in 1905, a governmental decree was issued for horse breeding associations to be founded throughout the country, leading to the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book in 1907.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half of the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E
