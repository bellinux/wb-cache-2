40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health Sciences, 2012 Background and Purposes Suicide {{by hanging}} is a {{relatively}} common occurrence. The actual {{cause of death in}} suicidal hanging is, however, controversial, having been attributed variously to asphyxia, carotid artery compression and vagal nerve stimulation. The aim of this Ph. D thesis was to determine the possible neurovascular cause of death in suicides by hanging by careful study of the anatomy and physiology of the neck region in relation to the ensuing pathology. The study was, therefore, approached from an anatomical, physiological, histological and pathological pespective. It therefore comprised a detailed exploration of the anatomy and physiology of the neck structures to match these with the underlying traumatised neurovascular structures, the latter trauma being brought about by the suicidal hanging process. Methods The methods used in the study included an investigation of the ligature and position of the ligature in relation {{to the level of the}} neck and the physical effects of the ligature on the skin and underlying anatomical structures. A careful and detailed dissection of the neck was undertaken and samples of the vessels and nerves were processed for histological study. Fifty consecutive cases of suicidal hanging and five “non-hanging” cases which served as controls were used in the study. In addition, ten cases of suicidal hanging not included in the study were subjected to occlusion studies by means of probe exploration. This technique and procedure was not carried out or applied to the cases included in the study for fear that the probe itself might produce artefactual damage to the delicate endothelium lining the inner layer of the vessel wall. The study was classified into various components such as: 1. Examination of the type and structure of the ligature material; 2. The position of the ligature on the neck, i. e. whether involving upper, middle, or lower third of neck and to correlate this position with the underlying anatomical structures subjected to the accompanying tensile, compressive and haemodynamic forces; 3. The physical effects of the ligature upon the skin and the underlying deeper neurovascular structures of the neck; 4. Meticulous “bloodless” dissection of the neck structures to corroborate any pathology noted with the above three criteria. Currently, all putative causes of death remain speculative; 5. Particular attention was paid to those structures most vulnerable to the compressive forces, tensile forces and haemodynamic forces operative in hanging. These comprise the neurovascular structures contained within the fibrous carotid sheath and the phrenic nerves in the neck, in particular with regard to the anatomical relationship of these structures to the positioning of the ligature. As far as analysing the forces involved, the engineering principles pertaining to these were interpreted in consultation with the Faculty of Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand. Results The main findings of the study showed damage to vascular, neural (including phrenic nerve), carotid bodies and accessory <b>glomal</b> bodies. The vascular findings emerged following an examination of the total number of arteries in the study, namely, 300, the figure derived as follows: six arteries in each of the fifty hanging subjects, viz., the left common carotid artery, the right common carotid artery, the left internal carotid artery, the right internal carotid artery, the left external carotid artery and the right external carotid artery (6 x 50 = 300). The damage shown was particularly the case with regard to the finding of tears in the various layers of the vessel wall. These extended from the intima through to the adventitia or outermost layer of the vessel wall and these were further subdivided into being either single or multiple. The tears found ranged from those involving the intima alone (single tears being found in 17 (5. 6...|$|E
