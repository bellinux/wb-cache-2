5|$|In the 1980s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that four lanes at the western end was not enough. Several safety improvement areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers Road), to a new two-lane road to the south of it that crossed the Roaring <b>Fork</b> <b>to</b> the east of the town.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just north of the border, the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads merge back together; the <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> the west is for cars, and the <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. From here to I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through the Sonoran Desert and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that the state would add one additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression, {{another large}} public works project {{involved}} the pass. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) oversaw {{the construction of}} the Twin Lakes Tunnel, which diverted water from Grizzly Reservoir, on Lincoln Creek, a southern tributary of the Roaring <b>Fork,</b> <b>to</b> Twin Lakes, where it was used for irrigation purposes by beet and watermelon farmers in the Rocky Ford and Ordway areas. Starting in 1935, 50,000 acre-feet (about 61.7 million m³) were made available this way.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{follows the}} {{railroad}} tracks into Beekmantown until it bears left at a fork, trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, County Route 58, formerly NY456, comes to its western end. After crossing into the next town, Chazy, NY22 bears left again at another <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, County Route 23, formerly NY191, in the hamlet of Sciota.|$|E

5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks <b>Fork</b> <b>to</b> Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E

50|$|The basic track {{sections}} contained two slots, though single-slot pieces also existed. They permitted quite complex road layouts, and included a crossroads, a 4-section roundabout, <b>forks</b> <b>to</b> create dual carriageway sections, right-angle junctions, single-track <b>forks</b> <b>to</b> allow lay-bys, {{and later a}} crossover from the left to the right track (with {{a break in the}} conductors). Railway compatibility was ensured by a level crossing and road/rail interchange pieces. Curves could be built with up to 5 parallel slots.|$|R

25|$|Kentucky is {{the only}} U.S. state to have a {{continuous}} border of rivers running along three of its sides—the Mississippi River to the west, the Ohio River to the north, and the Big Sandy River and Tug <b>Fork</b> <b>to</b> the east. Its major internal rivers include the Kentucky River, Tennessee River, Cumberland River, Green River and Licking River.|$|E

25|$|This {{background}} prepared Bell {{for work}} with spoken sound waves and electricity. He began his experiments in 1873-1874 with a harmonic telegraph, following {{the examples of}} Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver electro-magnet that caused a second steel reed or tuning <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> vibrate.|$|E
25|$|The two routes enter Keeseville, {{where in}} mid-village {{they cross the}} Ausable River and enter Clinton County. NY9N reappears here, {{reaching}} its northern terminus. North of the village, the two routes split again and exchange the roles they had been playing for their entire northward journey. 9 takes the eastward <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> the lake, running close to the state's edge; while 22 will run inland from here to the border.|$|E
25|$|Because {{bacteria}} have circular chromosomes, {{termination of}} replication {{occurs when the}} two replication forks meet {{each other on the}} opposite end of the parental chromosome. E. coli regulates this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the Tus protein, enable only one direction of replication <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome.|$|E

25|$|This type of brake pre-dates the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull {{cantilever}} {{design with}} an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a cable {{stop on the}} frame or <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> terminate the cable housing, and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes. The cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.|$|E
25|$|Purple laver (Porphyra) {{is perhaps}} the most widely domesticated marine algae. In Asia it is used in nori (Japan) and gim (Korea). In Wales, it is used in laverbread, a {{traditional}} food, and in Ireland it is collected and made into a jelly by stewing or boiling. Preparation also can involve frying or heating the fronds with a little water and beating with a <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> produce a pinkish jelly. Harvesting also occurs along the west coast of North America, and in Hawaii and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic DNA must be tightly {{compacted}} {{in order}} to fit within the confined space of the nucleus. Chromosomes are packaged by wrapping 147 nucleotides around an octamer of histone proteins, forming a nucleosome. The nucleosome octamer includes two copies of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Due to the tight association of histone proteins to DNA, eukaryotic cells have proteins {{that are designed to}} remodel histones ahead of the replication fork, {{in order to}} allow smooth progression of the replisome. There are also proteins involved in reassembling histones behind the replication <b>fork</b> <b>to</b> reestablish the nucleosome conformation.|$|E
