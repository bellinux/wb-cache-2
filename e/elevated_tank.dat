The <b>elevated</b> <b>tank</b> was better than a standpipe because Monroe didn't have a high hill to place it on, and if a standpipe was drawn down, water pressure would drop.

40|$|Abstract — As {{known from}} very {{upsetting}} past experiences, <b>elevated</b> water <b>tanks</b> were collapsed or heavily damaged during the earthquakes {{all over the}} world. These unusual events showed that the supporting system of the <b>elevated</b> <b>tanks</b> has more critical importance than the other structural types of tanks. So most of damages observed during the earthquakes arise from the causes like unsuitable design of supporting system, mistakes on selecting supporting system. Water is the elixir of life. Hence the importance of water retaining is obvious especially is in the present scenario then water in deed is becoming a scarce commodity [...] The current designs of circular shaft-type supporting structures of <b>elevated</b> water <b>tanks</b> are extremely vulnerable under lateral forces due to earthquakes. The 2001 Bhuj earthquake provided another illustration of this vulnerability when...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes {{can cause}} {{significant}} damages to industrial liquid storage tanks resulting in losses of functionality, fires or environmental contamination {{due to the}} leakage of hazardous chemicals. Typical damages of ground supported tanks during past earthquakes were {{in the form of}} cracking {{at the corner of the}} bottom plate and compression buckling of tank wall due to uplift, sliding of the base, anchorage failure, sloshing damage around the roof, failure of piping systems and plastic deformation of base plate. Liquid tanks can be also located at some elevated positions due to operational purposes. This makes them susceptible to collapse due to increased base shears and overturning moments. The seismic response of <b>elevated</b> <b>tanks</b> has been widely investigated in the past considering different materials and configurations of support structures. This paper addresses the problem of <b>elevated</b> <b>tanks</b> with particular attention focused on the steel storage tanks resting on short RC columns. The vulnerability of a real example of <b>elevated</b> <b>tanks</b> is assessed though the probabilistic analysis performed using non-linear lumped mass models. Consequently different fragility curves are built for identifying the most important damage states and calculating the corresponding probability of occurrence. The results show how the support structure, especially when composed by RC columns, is the most influencing one, whereas the remaining damage states have a limited influence...|$|R

50|$|Bundaberg's {{water supply}} was {{initially}} {{derived from a}} series of water holes and lagoons around the settlement. By the 1880s, as the town developed, the provision of a reticulated water supply became important, not only for domestic use, but to allow road sprinkling to keep down dust and to make it possible to fight fires, a major cause of destruction where timber buildings crowded commercial areas. The colonial government in September 1887 gazetted loan conditions for a reticulated town water system for Bundaberg. A scheme to bring water from the dam on the permanent lagoon at Baldwin Swamp in East Bundaberg to a storage reservoir at Tantitha Park, utilizing an <b>elevated</b> <b>tank</b> to improve water pressure, was presented to the council by Councillor W H McCann.

The two storeyed home, located on Plant's Ridge, was not only large, handsome and tastefully decorated, but incorporated some innovative ideas. These included an inner roof of Willesden paper intended to allow air drawn through mesh under the roof to circulate between it and the roof proper thus cooling the building.

His herds fared well during the devastating “Hard Winter of 1886-1887,” after which he borrowed family money to buy out less fortunate ranchers. By the mid-1890s, his ranch {{was one of the}} largest cattle operations in the nation, running about 65,000 head of cattle and 300 of horses. He sold from 3,000 to 9,000 cattle each year. Wibaux and others persuaded the Northern Pacific Railroad to build stockyards here in 1883, and to enlarge them in 1894. Wibaux campaigned to have Mingusville platted and renamed for him, both of which occurred in 1894. Two years previously, he and Henry Boice of the Berry-Boice Cattle Company had built this office/residence. Wibaux soon took it over completely, and used it during the week to oversee his business interests. The building faced north until W. A.
