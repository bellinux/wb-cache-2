Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> imbalance. Since {{the conclusion of the}} Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 11million tourists each year. The most numerous are tourists from Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic as well as Croatia itself. Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4.9 days.|$|E
40|$|Since the <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> {{activity}} {{accounts for}} {{an important source}} of national economy growth, being the developed states economy driver, the authors considered that {{at the level of the}} entities carrying out <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> activities, the own bookkeeping must be organized taking into account the specific of the activity developed. In this context, the authors began the preparation of the study starting from the idea that this category of companies must provide accounting information as qualitative as possible that can be easily comparable at the international level and hereby increase the international commercial exchanges. Meeting this challenge of increasing the <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> activities involves the adoption of specific measures, in line with the real state of performance and with the current needs of the companies from the national economy. A relevant measure is considered to be IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) implementation for this category of companies in order to increase the quality of the accounting information provided and implicitly of some new businesses with the abroad. In order to test the opinion related to IFRS implementation on the companies carrying out <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> activities, the authors prepared a study based on a questionnaire that targeted Romanian companies carrying out <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> activities, of different dimensions. The purpose of this questionnaire was to draw up conclusions related to the content, need and the information usability of the data reported through financial positions by the companies carrying out <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> activities. The questions addressed by the authors, in this respect, have predefined answers, meant to obtain the opinion of the Romanian companies related to the possible IFRS implementation, irrespective of size, of the impact forecasted of IFRS implementation process on the companies’ activity, as well as the importance granted to the auditing of collection and payment operations with a view to obtain qualitative financial-accounting information...|$|R

The analysis indicates that Kenya did not undertake significant liberalization commitments under the Uruguay Round. There are however, several effects on Kenya’s <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> environment due to most-favored nation tariff cuts, erosion of preference margins, and changes in food prices. These effects are determined using simple computational techniques in a partial equilibrium framework. Overall, the results indicate that the effect on Kenya’s balance of payments in the medium-term may be negative but modest, and can be offset by pursuit of appropriate structural adjustment policies. ...|$|R

Using Shephard's (1970) output distance function, we first estimate the shadow price of CO 2 for power generators in the Korean fossil-fueled electric generation industry. Then, by assuming that each power generator is required to reduce CO 2 emissions by one ton, we compute the potential cost savings from internal trading among generators within the same plant and from <b>external</b> <b>trading</b> across plants at prevailing market prices. The results indicate that, on average, the generators paid $ 14. 63 to abate one ton of CO 2 emissions in 2007. Plants realized additional gains through <b>external</b> <b>trading.</b> In particular, cost savings from trades between different fuel-fired plants were substantial.

Despite this, on 15 December 1978 it was announced that Ireland would participate in the EMS.

The EMS started on 13 March 1979, and towards the end of the month Sterling started to gain in value against the EMS currencies because of rising oil prices, and by 30 March Sterling breached the upper fluctuation band limit of the Belgian franc and the Irish currency could no longer track Sterling.
