25|$|But, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warners came to {{disagreement}} over the compensation {{to be paid}} to Coppola for his directing services on Pinocchio. The parties deferred this issue and finally a settlement was reached in 1998, when the <b>jurors</b> <b>in</b> the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the Pinocchio film project. However, they also awarded him a further $60 million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version. This is the largest civil financial verdict ever against a Hollywood studio.|$|E

25|$|According to Plutarch, Pericles faced, twice, serious accusations. The {{first one}} was just before the {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War and the second one was {{during the first year}} of the war, when he was punished with a fine, the amount of which was either fifteen or fifty talents. Before the war a bill was passed, on the motion of Dracontides, according to which Pericles should deposit his accounts of public moneys with the prytanes and the jurors should decide upon his case with ballots which had lain upon the altar of the goddess on the acropolis. This clause of the bill was however amended with the motion that the case be tried before fifteen hundred <b>jurors</b> <b>in</b> the ordinary way, whether one wanted to call it a prosecution for embezzlement and bribery, or malversation.|$|E
25|$|The 6,000 {{were drawn}} from the 10 tribes (each tribe was {{offering}} 600 members) and they were then divided into chambers of 600 jurymen, 500 or 501 of whom were regular members, with the rest constituting alternate <b>jurors.</b> <b>In</b> exceptional cases the court could go into plenary sessions. Sometimes, the chambers had 201 to 401 members or 1001 to 1501 members. After the selection by lot, the heliasts {{had to take the}} Heliastic Oath once every year. After the swearing-in, the jurors received one box-wood ticket, with their own names and that of their father and deme written on it, and one letter of the alphabet as far as kappa and the jurors of each tribe were divided into ten sections, approximately an equal number under each letter.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the ten double eagles {{were stored}} at the United States Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, Kentucky. They {{were shown to}} <b>jurors</b> <b>in</b> Philadelphia during the July 2011 trial, but were then {{returned}} to Fort Knox, where they were to remain until {{a decision was made}} regarding their disposition. In April 2015, a United States federal appeals court ordered the coins returned to the Langbord family because the original asset seizure was conducted improperly, as the government failed to file a judicial civil forfeiture complaint within 90 days of the family's seized asset claim. This order was reversed on July 28, 2015, and in October 2015, an en banc session was held with 13 judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where they heard oral arguments in the ongoing appeal. On August 1, 2016, the judges reversed the previous ruling, finding the coins to be property of the United States government. The Langbords appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 17, 2017 denied certiorari.|$|E

500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the <b>jurors</b> <b>in</b> Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there and stare at you and have that stupid grin on his face. He would make your skin crawl." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} manuscript containing the cartulary was damaged {{in a fire}} in 1733, but the damage was not serious. The edges of the manuscript were burned, {{which resulted in a}} few words being lost on the margins. Because of the fire damage, the manuscript was rebound in the 19th century, and each leaf was mounted separately. In addition to the two main sections, there are three smaller parchment pages bound in with the manuscript: folios 110, 143, and 153. The first of them, folio 110, [...] measures [...] high by [...] wide and lists eight names, probably witnesses to a lease. The second inserted folio, 143, measures [...] high by [...] wide and gives a list of <b>jurors</b> <b>in</b> a late 11th-century hand. The last inserted folio, 153, measures [...] high by [...] wide and gives the boundaries of a manor in Old English, rather than Latin; it is written in a 12th-century hand.|$|E

2500|$|After the trial, Reno {{received}} a letter from the jury. The <b>jurors</b> <b>in</b> the Fijnje case wanted Reno to know why her office had failed to make a convincing case.

This drew the attention of critics, who also objected to Moore's practice of opening court sessions with a prayer beseeching Divine Guidance for <b>jurors</b> <b>in</b> their deliberations. In at least one instance, Moore asked a clergyman to lead the court's jury pool in prayer. The local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent a letter in June 1993 with the threat of a lawsuit if such prayers did not cease.|$|E
