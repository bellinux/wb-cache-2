25|$|When {{an object}} is {{partially}} blocked by another, humans unconsciously {{tend to make}} up for it and complete the shapes (See Amodal perception). It has however been demonstrated that pigeons do not complete occluded shapes. A study based on altering the <b>grey</b> <b>level</b> of a perch that was coloured differently from the background showed that budgerigars do not detect edges based on colours.|$|E

30|$|The first-order {{features}} are {{based only on}} the distribution of pixel <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> and do not consider the relationships between neighboring pixels.

30|$|This method {{allows the}} {{calculation}} of first-order features, based only {{on the distribution of}} <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> (or intensities) of pixels within an analyzed ROI. Such features provide knowledge on the most and the least occurring <b>grey</b> <b>levels,</b> on the concentration of the <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> around their average, or on the degree of asymmetry in their distribution. Contrariwise, they contain no information on the relationship between neighboring pixels, on the possible direction of the texture, its structure, and other properties resulting from these relationships.|$|R
25|$|According to Fanti and Moroni, after {{comparing}} the histograms of 256 different <b>grey</b> <b>levels,</b> {{it was found}} that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> (levels included between 160 and 200).|$|R
2500|$|As an {{alternative}} to simply replacing each <b>grey</b> <b>level</b> by a color, a sample observed by an oblique beam allows to create an approximative topography image (see further section [...] "Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image").

30|$|Some other {{features}} {{can be derived}} from a vector whose components are the co-occurrence probabilities for pixels with a determined sum of the <b>grey</b> <b>levels.</b> All possible sum values are taken into account. The probabilities forming a vector are sorted in increasing order of corresponding sum values. These features are: sum average, sum variance, and sum entropy [36]. Taking the absolute differences of <b>grey</b> <b>levels,</b> instead of their sums, leads to the features already known from GLDM - based method.|$|R

30|$|Several texture {{parameters}} can {{be derived}} from the co-occurrence matrix with a given pair of parameters: (d,θ). Among them it is worth mentioning: energy or angular second moment (a measure of homogeneity of pixel <b>grey</b> <b>levels,</b> relatively high for homogeneous textures, and of small values for heterogeneous ones), contrast or inertia (with a quite large value for heterogeneous regions, characterized by a strong contrast, and quite small value for homogeneous regions), local homogeneity, and entropy (that quantifies the degree of randomness of pixel <b>grey</b> <b>levels).</b>|$|R

2500|$|Dental CBCT {{systems do}} not employ a {{standardized}} system for scaling the <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> {{that represent the}} reconstructed density values and, as such, they are arbitrary and do not allow for assessment of bone quality.

40|$|The impact {{interaction}} {{of a solid}} sphere against an initially plane gas-liquid interface is experimentally studied with a new experimental principle. The interface is formed {{at the bottom of}} a capillary of about 8 mm inner diameter. The sphere impacts the interface inside the capillary. The new principle is based on video imaging of the <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> of the gas-liquid interface using light beam reflection. The <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> are recorded by a CCD high-speed video system. Collision time is determined as the time between the first two maxima of the <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> and obtained by means of Fourier analysis. The dependence of collision time on the diameter and density of impacting particles is investigated and compared with the available theoretical models. The experimentally determined collision time is longer than the collision time predicted by the available theories. The reasons for this disagreement are discussed. The disagreement may be affected by the dependence of the restoring force on the radius of the plane gas-liquid interface...|$|R
30|$|The ripples {{can also}} be {{extracted}} with a method based on image transformations using the Laws’ filters. During the transformation, each image pixel is assigned a value that is a linear combination of initial <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> of pixels belonging to the neighborhood of a transformed pixel. Typically neighborhoods of 3 [*]×[*] 3 or 5 [*]×[*] 5 pixels are considered. Weights of <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> of neighboring pixels are determined {{by one of the}} Laws’ masks. The masks are designed in order to detect different texture elements: ripples, edges, spots… The frequency rate of such elements determines the feature values calculated from the transformed image.|$|R

30|$|The Haralick {{features}} were defined {{and used as}} described in [25]. The contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity measures were computed for four grey-level co-occurrence matrices (four directions) using quantization into 16 <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> and a distance of two pixels.|$|R
30|$|If the distances, d, between pixels in the {{considered}} pairs are small, {{compared to}} the texture primitives, the <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> in pairs are quite similar.

Conversely, if d approaches the texture primitives size, the probabilities of small differences in pixel <b>grey</b> <b>levels</b> are much smaller, and the components of l(d,θ) are more spread out. Further, if a texture is directional, the distribution of probabilities in l(d,θ) will be different for different θ values. Conversely, if the texture {{does not seem to}} have any particular directional elements, the distribution of probabilities in l(d,θ) is not significantly affected by the θ.|$|R
