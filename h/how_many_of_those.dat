The theoretical part of this bachelor thesis deals with definitions of attitudes, prejudices and stereotypes. We have further characterized the early adolescence, which provides basic information about the developmental stage of the respondents in the target group. The most extensive part of the theoretical part contains information about the selected minorities. Basic terms were explained {{for each of the}} minorities and it was described <b>how</b> <b>many</b> members <b>of</b> <b>those</b> minorities there are in the Czech society. Further, for most minorities we have described the development of attitudes of the society to them. One exception is the EMO subculture for which it is impossible to map the development of attitudes as for this group no relevant investigations were conducted which would make it possible to describe the development. The objective of this bachelor thesis to map attitudes of pupils in the 7 th and 8 th grades of basic schools to the selected minorities (the marginalized minority of the homeless, homosexuals, EMO subculture and religious minority of the Satanists) in the Czech Republic (on a sample in the district of Žďár nad Sázavou), with differentiation based on the sex of the respondents. Before conducting the research three hypotheses were formulated and subsequently confirmed. Hypothesis No. 1 : Boys and girls in the researched sample group demonstrate a higher sympathy for the homeless compared to the other selected groups. Hypothesis No. 2 : More than 50 % of the girls in the researched sample group demonstrate a positive attitude to the homosexuals. Hypothesis No. 3 : More than 50 % of the girls in the researched sample group demonstrate a positive attitude to the EMO subculture. All the established hypotheses we have been confirmed for the selected sample group. The research has been conducted using a quantitative technique, through interviewing by means of my own questionnaire, based on a presentation of illustrative photos. The questionnaire was anonymous and it was completely filled out by 104 respondents. The research was complemented with 6 interviews with selected respondents to map their attitudes. The contribution of this work consists in the mapping of the actual attitudes of the respondents to the mentioned minorities. Results of the work {{could be used as a}} feedback for the professional and interested general public.

40|$|In {{their ancient}} past, humans learned {{to engage in}} the {{sometimes}} risky behavior of investigating novel objects in their environments, such as those that were possibly threatening or those which offered new sources of food or other reward, presumably as a means of survival. We call the propensity to seek out novelty, sensation seeking. Today, an emerging body of research from both the biological and behavioral sciences suggests that understanding differences among adolescents in their propensity to seek out novel sensations offers a path to greater understanding of much drug use [...] particularly among adolescents [...] and clues on <b>how</b> to reach <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> most at risk for drug abuse with more effective prevention programs. This research draws on a long line of work by Marvin Zuckerman on sensation seeking, which he defines as a trait involving “the seeking of varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences, and the willingness to take physical, social, legal, and financial risks for the sake of such experience”(p. 27). Individuals at highest risk tend to be those {{who are most likely to}} be novelty seekers or sensation seekers and it is these individuals who are the principal targets of some recent tests of a different kind of intervention program. This program is aimed at the highest seekers of novelty and does not assume that all individuals will engage in a decision-making process that is “rational. ” In this chapter we bring together two complementary lines of research. One line of research is the result of studies conducted on laboratory animals. The second line of research was conducted on humans who were volunteer subjects in a variety of social science experiments. The value of combining these two kinds of research is that we can learn different things from studies conducted on laboratory animals and humans. Putting what we have learned from both types of studies together provides a wealth of information that has given us key insights into how programs can be more effective at accomplishing the goal of drug prevention. This chapter describes some of the background for drug abuse interventions. It draws upon this body of convergent research from a wide range of disciplines and some of the ways it has been employed...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis, {{literally}} “porous bone”, is {{a disease}} characterized by weak bone. It is a major public health problem, affecting {{hundreds of millions of}} people worldwide, predominantly postmenopausal women. The main clinical consequence of the disease is bone fractures. It is estimated that one in three women and one in five men over the age of fifty worldwide will sustain an osteoporotic fracture. Hip and spine fractures are the two most serious fracture types, associated with substantial pain and suffering, disability, and even death. As a result, osteoporosis imposes a significant burden on both the individual and society. During the past two decades, a range of medications has become available for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. The primary aim of pharmacological therapy is to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. The objective of this report is to review and describe the current burden of osteoporosis and highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges for treatment and prevention of the disease. The report encompasses both epidemiological and health economic aspects of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures with a primary geographic focus on France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Projections of the future prevalence of osteoporosis and fracture incidence, the total societal burden of the disease, and the consequences of different intervention strategies receive special attention. The report may serve as a basis for the formulation of healthcare policy concerning osteoporosis in general and the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in particular. It may also provide guidance regarding the overall healthcare priority of the disease. The report is divided into six chapters: 1. Introduction to osteoporosis The first chapter provides a brief review of osteoporosis, how osteoporotic fractures are defined, a description of the most common osteoporotic fractures, the burden of fractures, as well as challenges in the delivery of health care to reduce the number of fractures. 2. Medical innovation and clinical progress in management of osteoporosis The second chapter reviews the measurement of bone mineral density, diagnosis of osteoporosis, methods for assessment of fracture risk, the development of interventions that reduce the risk of fractures, practice guidelines, and the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatments. 3. Epidemiology of osteoporosis The third chapter reviews the epidemiology and consequences of osteoporosis and fractures, as well as different approaches for setting intervention thresholds (i. e. at what fracture risk it is appropriate to initiate treatment). 4. Burden of osteoporosis The fourth chapter presents a model estimation of the current burden of osteoporosis in the five largest countries in the European Union (EU 5) and Sweden. The burden is described in terms of fractures, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost. 5. Uptake of osteoporosis treatments The fifth chapter provides a description of the current uptake of osteoporosis treatments, that is, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> patients <b>of</b> <b>those</b> eligible for treatment that actually can be treated in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK. International sales data from 1998 and forward was used to analyse international variations in treatment uptake. 6. The future burden of fractures and the consequences of increasing treatment uptake The last chapter presents projections of how the demographic changes in the five largest countries in the France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK will impact the burden of osteoporosis up to 2025. Hypothetical projections of increments in treatment provision are also explored, and the impact of increased treatment on costs, fracture rates, and morbidity is estimated...|$|R
