2500|$|Symptoms of {{dry mouth}} and dryness {{in the oral}} cavity are caused by the reduced {{production}} of saliva from the salivary glands (parotid gland, submandibular gland, and sublingual gland). To check the status of salivary glands {{and the production of}} saliva, a salivary <b>flow-rate</b> test is performed, in which the person is asked to spit {{as much as they can}} into a cup, and the resulting saliva sample is collected and weighed. This test's results can determine whether the salivary glands are functioning adequately. Not enough saliva produced could mean the person has SS. An alternative test is non-stimulated whole saliva flow collection, in which the person spits into a test tube every minute for 15 minutes. A resultant collection of less than [...] is considered a positive result.|$|E
40|$|A {{technical}} approach {{based on}} microbial technology is proposed to help resolve the {{problems caused by}} explosive gases in coal mines. The proposed technique uses methanotrophic bacteria to oxidize methane. In laboratory experiments, the oxidation effect of hanging nets impregnated with liquid containing methanotrophic bacteria was investigated at different air <b>flow-rates.</b> The experimental {{results showed that the}} volume of gas degraded and the gradient of degradation both increased as the gas concentration increased at constant air <b>flow-rates.</b> At fixed gas concentrations, the volume of degraded gas increased with increasing <b>flow-rates</b> of air at low <b>flow-rates.</b> However, the volume of degraded gas slightly decreased with increasing <b>flow-rates</b> of air at high <b>flow-rates.</b> These experimental results provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of explosive gases during exploration for natural gas and to treat potentially dangerous concentrations of gas in gobs, caves and upper corners of mineshafts. They will also be of great practical significance in coal mining...|$|R

2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional <b>flow-rate).</b> [...] In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with [...] smaller silica particles (~1.7 μm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} is established {{to evaluate the}} 2 -D permeability tensor of naturally fractured rock masses by using modified UDEC ¶. Based on the superposition principle, directional <b>flow-rates</b> through a unit square of fractured rock under head gradients in two orthogonal directions can be calculated with UDEC. Then the <b>flow-rates</b> are transformed into <b>flow-rates</b> through a field rock mass for evaluating the permeability tensor. Two kinds of fractured rock models, fixed hydraulic fracture aperture and variable hydraulic fracture aperture under stress, were studied by using this approach. For the first model, the permeability tensor of a fractured rock mass only depends upon the statistical features of fracture pattern geometry, including orientation, trace length, density of fractures. For the second model, the permeability tensor strongly depends upon both the geometry of the fracture pattern and the applied stress, such as the direction and magnitude of principal stress {{as well as the}} ratio of major principal stress to minor principal stress. <br/...|$|R

However, current <b>flow-rates</b> are rarely considered in studies on urban stormwater management, usually focused on extreme <b>flow-rates.</b> We argue that taking into account receiving water bodies is possible with relatively small modifications in current practices of urban stormwater modelling, through the use of Flow duration curves (FDCs). In this paper, we discuss advantages and requirements of the use of FDCs. Then, we present an example of application comparing source control regulations over an urbanised catchment (178 ha) in Nantes, France...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradigm}} of drug discovery {{have been to}} find the strongest possible binder to the target by high-throughput screening (HTS) but high affinity interactions are related to low kinetic off rates and thus result in severe side-effects and non-approved drugs. Lead molecules working in a transient manner (KD > µM) will allow for rapid off rates and possibly less side-effects. In this study the peak profile method applied to weak affinity chromatography (WAC) was evaluated as {{a simple way to}} provide the kinetics of the interaction and thereby allowing for high-throughput determinations. In the peak profile formula all band-broadening effects except the stationary mass transfer is subtracted which simplifies the calculations for the kinetics of the interaction tremendously. The technique was evaluated by screening of 3 different benzamidines at 3 linear <b>flow-rates</b> using zonal chromatography and human α-thrombin as immobilized target protein. The kinetics of the interaction could unfortunately not be determined. This was possibly due to the <b>flow-rates</b> not being high enough as indicated by a low critical ratio (η < 1). Higher <b>flow-rates</b> would increase the contribution to band-broadening due to kinetic effects but would also require more precise estimation of peak variance...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{control at}} a road {{junction}} by a complex fuzzy logic controller is investigated. The {{increase in the}} complexity of junction means more number of input variables {{must be taken into}} account, which will increase the number of fuzzy rules in the system. A hierarchical fuzzy logic controller is introduced {{to reduce the number of}} rules. Besides, the increase in the complexity of the controller makes formulation of the fuzzy rules difficult. A genetic algorithm based off-line leaning algorithm is employed to generate the fuzzy rules. The learning algorithm uses constant <b>flow-rates</b> as training sets. The system is tested by both constant and time-varying <b>flow-rates.</b> Simulation results show that the proposed controller produces lower average delay than a fixed-time controller does under various traffic conditions...|$|R

The Raman spectra of the films have been used to obtain evidence of nanocrystallinity in the films. The dependence of silane <b>flow-rates</b> and discharge power on these properties was investigated. Increase in the discharge power resulted in films with lower hydrogen content and increase the dihydride bond concentration. Nanocrystallinity was observed in films prepared at low discharge power at all silane <b>flow-rates</b> but increase in discharge power resulted in films with purely amorphous structure...|$|R

50|$|The low-flow-rate {{method is}} {{based on the fact that}} the {{extraction}} efficiency is dependent on the <b>flow-rate.</b> At high flow-rates, the amount of drug diffusing from the sampling site into the dialysate per unit time is smaller (low extraction efficiency) than at lower flow-rates (high extraction efficiency). At a <b>flow-rate</b> of zero, a total equilibrium between these two sites is established (Cout = Csample). This concept is applied for the (low-)flow-rate method, where the probe is perfused with blank perfusate at different flow-rates. Concentration at the sampling site can be determined by plotting the extraction ratios against the corresponding flow-rates and extrapolating to zero-flow. The low-flow-rate method is limited by the fact that calibration times may be rather long before a sufficient sample volume has been collected.|$|E
