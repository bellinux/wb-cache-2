50|$|Physalis peruviana (from South America) fruits are marketed in the United States most {{commonly}} as <b>goldenberry</b> and sometimes Pichuberry, named after Machu Picchu {{in order to}} associate the fruit with its origin in Peru and address {{the fact that this}} fruit is actually not a gooseberry as the name Cape gooseberry implies.|$|E
5000|$|Crataegus chrysocarpa is {{a species}} of {{hawthorn}} that is native {{to much of the}} continental United States and Canada. Common names fireberry hawthorn and <b>goldenberry</b> hawthorn, as well as the scientific name all refer to the colour of the unripe fruit, although the mature fruit is red and in var. vernonensis is [...] "deep claret-colored â€¦ nearly black when over-ripe".|$|E
40|$|The {{culture of}} Pleurotus ostreatus was {{evaluated}} {{to determine the}} best waste on which this mushroom canshow the highest growth and production rates [...] The substrates evaluated were agroindustrial wastes of theDepartment of Cundinamarca (dry skin of <b>goldenberries</b> (Physalis), skin of pea pods and maize cobs). Thecontrol substrate was sawdust of oak. The mixtures evaluated were packed in bags of 1 kg containing 78 % ofagroindustrial waste of the volume of substrate mixture. Mixtures were sterilized and inoculated with 30 g ofseeds of Pleurotus ostreatus obtained commercially. Running time of the mycelium, diameter of fruit bodies,number of fruit bodies produced per bag, fresh weight, biological efficiency, and yield were evaluated on eachof the substrates. Finally, the best substrate for the growth and production of Pleurotus ostreatus was the dryskin of <b>goldenberries</b> (Physalis) with a biological efficiency of 76. 1 % after a total production period of 41 days and a yield of 39. 03 Kg/m 2 with excellent organoleptic characteristics, therefore being an adequate andefficient substrate for cultivating this mushroom...|$|R

5000|$|The Hunterston Brooch is {{a highly}} {{important}} Celtic brooch of [...] "pseudo-penannular" [...] type found near Hunterston, North Ayrshire, Scotland, in either, according to one account, 1826 by two men from West Kilbride, who were digging drains {{at the foot of}} <b>Goldenberry</b> Hill, or in 1830. It is now in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. Made within a few decades of 700 AD, the Hunterston Brooch is cast in silver, gilt, and set with pieces of amber (most now missing), and decorated with interlaced animal bodies in gold filigree. The diameter of the ring is 12.2 cm, and in its centre there is a cross and a golden Glory representing the Risen Christ, surrounded by tiny bird heads. The pin, which is broken, can travel freely around the ring as far as the terminals, which was necessary for fastening; it is now 13.1 cm long, but was probably originally 15 cm or more.|$|E
40|$|Moya-Leon, MA (reprint author), Univ Talca, Inst Biol Vegetal & Biotecnol, Lab Fisiol Vegetal & Genet Mol, Casilla 747, Talca, ChileGoldenberry (Physalis peruviana) is a {{climacteric}} {{fruit and}} its ripening is regulated by ethylene. Reports {{indicate that the}} fruit contains high level of antioxidant compounds. To elucidate the role of ethylene on the antioxidant capacity of this fruit during ripening and storage, the effect of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP, 0. 2 mu L L- 1), a blocker of the ethylene receptor, and ethylene (2000 mu L L- 1 Ethrel) were tested. During ripening of the fruit the ethylene production and respiration rates increased constantly {{until the end of}} the process, similar to the SSC/acidity ratio. Firmness reduction started early during development and continued throughout ripening. The measurement of total antioxidant capacity revealed a high antioxidant level in unripe fruit, and a clear increment in antioxidant capacity, ascorbic acid and polyphenol contents was observed throughout ripening with maximum values at the ripe stage. Nevertheless, after harvest the antioxidant capacity was rapidly reduced during the shelf-life period (20 degrees C) and ethylene treatment increased this reduction. Significant preservation of the antioxidant capacity, vitamin C and polyphenol content was observed in 1 -MCP treated fruit. The results indicate that 1 -MCP treatment could be useful to preserve the high antioxidant capacity of <b>goldenberry</b> fruit during storage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{dietary intake}} of {{medicinal}} food with antioxidant activity and required amounts of trace elements {{is important to}} pursue good healthy life. In our study, we aimed to determine the antioxidant capacity and metal content of <b>goldenberry</b> (Physalis peruviana L.) fruit sold in markets in Kayseri. Material and Method: The antioxidant capacity of P. peruviana fruit {{was determined by the}} 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. The DPPH radical scavenger capacity of the methanol extract of fruit was compared with known antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, gallic acid, and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as references. The metal content of P. peruviana fruit was measured by using atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS). Results: The fruit of P. peruviana was found to possess DPPH free radical scavenging activity but the antioxidant capacity was lower than the standard substances. Inhibitory concentration 50 % (IC 50) values of P. peruviana, ascorbic acid, gallic acid, and BHT were determined as 32 mg/ml, 3. 8 mg/ml, 3. 51 mg/ml, and 1. 21 mg/ml, respectively. As a result of the analysis by AAS, it was observed that P. peruviana fruit contented plentiful trace elements and the content of heavy metal was small amount or not detected. Discussion: These observations suggest that the fruit of P. peruviana has a potential source of antioxidant and trace elements of natural origin...|$|E
