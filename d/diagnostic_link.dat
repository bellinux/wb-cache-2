The GM Europe Opel and Vauxall used a 10 position Metripack 280 diagnostic jack.ALDL was not a standard. It was actually extremely fragmented. The information exchange changed with each powertrain control module (aka PCM, ECM, ECU). A PCM integrates transmission and engine control on one Processing unit. ECM/ECU are engine control only with a separate TCM (Transmission Control Module) if needed. While ALDL {{is the closest thing}} to standard onboard diagnostics prior to 1991 ALDL was not a standard. ALDL was even fragmented within GM brands, models, and model years. Trim levels in the same model year, division, and nameplate can use different communications. Different versions presented differences in diagnostic jack pin-outs, data protocols, and data rates (this is the reason for the ″Mask″ files needed for aftermarket software communication).

5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and load (MAP in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (Intake Air Temperature sensor) was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a Mass Air Flow system. This system uses a Mass Air Flow Sensor {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading.

40|$|Abstract Background The General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and Doctor's Independent Network Database (DIN), {{are large}} {{electronic}} primary care databases compiled in the UK during the 1990 s. They provide {{a valuable resource}} for epidemiological and health services research. GPRD (based on VAMP) presents notes {{as a series of}} discrete episodes, whereas DIN is based on a system (MEDITEL) that used a Problem Orientated Medical Record (POMR) which <b>links</b> prescriptions to <b>diagnostic</b> problems. We have examined the implications for research of these different underlying philosophies. Methods Records of 40, 183 children from 141 practices in DIN and 76, 310 from 464 practices in GRPD who were followed to age 5 were used to compare the volume of recording of prescribing and diagnostic codes in the two databases. To assess the importance and additional value of the POMR within DIN, the appropriateness of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>linking</b> to skin emollient prescriptions was investigated. Results Variation between practices for both the number of days on which prescriptions were issued and diagnoses were recorded was marked in both databases. Mean number of "prescription days" during the first 5 years of life was similar in DIN (19. 5) and in GPRD (19. 8), but the average number of "diagnostic days" was lower in DIN (15. 8) than in GPRD (22. 9). Adjustment for linkage increased the average "diagnostic days" to 23. 1 in DIN. 32. 7 % of emollient prescriptions in GPRD appeared with an eczema diagnosis on the same day compared to only 19. 4 % in DIN; however, 86. 4 % of prescriptions in DIN were linked to an earlier eczema diagnosis. More specifically 83 % of emollient prescriptions appeared under a problem heading of eczema in the 121 practices that were using problem headings satisfactorily. Conclusion Prescribing records in DIN and GPRD are very similar, but the usage of diagnostic codes is more parsimonious in DIN because of its POMR structure. Period prevalence rates will be underestimated in DIN unless this structure is taken into account. The advantage of the POMR is that in 121 of 141 practices using problem headings as intended, most prescriptions can be linked to a problem heading providing a specific reason for their issue. </p...|$|R

Scoured rims of the headwalls, relict plunge pools, sediment-transport constraints, and cosmogenic (^ 3 He) exposure ages indicate formation of the amphitheater-headed canyons by large-scale flooding ∼ 46 ka, coeval with formation of Box Canyon 18 km to the south {{as well as the}} eruption of McKinney Butte Basalt, suggesting widespread canyon formation following lava-flow diversion of the paleo-Wood River.

However, in full field simulations the models can be calibrated via history matching (e.g., Kristiansen and Plischke 2010). Certainly a parametric study of seismic attributes to the stress sensitivity of nonlinear rock physics models would be useful to determine the most influential model input parameters.|$|E

Chronic cough {{can also be a}} predominant symptom associated with many chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. Chronic cough itself does impair quality of life and is associated with psychological impairment. The symptoms associated with chronic cough include persistent tickling or irritating sensation in the chest or throat, hoarse voice, dysphonia or vocal cord dysfunction. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of cough is associated with chronic cough caused by airway eosinophilic conditions such as asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or postnasal drip (or upper airway syndrome), which implies cause and effect, or with chronic cough associated with other diseases such as COPD, cancer or heart failure, that does not necessarily imply cause and effect. A recently-recognised category is idiopathic cough with no associated or causative diagnosis. We suggest that there is a better label needed for chronic cough, that includes the common association with a hypersensitive cough response to tussive stimuli such as capsaicin or citric acid. This would invoke a hypersensitive syndrome, and there are good reasons to use a new label that would encompass the problem of chronic cough: the chronic 'cough hypersensitivity syndrome'. This would focus the problem on the cough symptomatology and lead to greater focus on understanding the mechanisms of cough sensitisation, with the ultimate aim of obtaining more effective antitussives...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and sealed with bulkheads against leakage. The isolated zone was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the isolated zone for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the isolated zone, at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or exhaust end of the isolated zone. The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the exhaust end of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using raw exhaust instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Link</b> (DDDL) and from exhaust backpressure and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the DPF systems...|$|E
