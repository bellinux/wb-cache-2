40|$|Aim of study: Game {{species are}} {{considered}} a scarce natural resource and therefore {{they are subject to}} economic analysis. Current studies on factors affecting <b>big</b> <b>game</b> trends have mostly emphasized the impact of ecological supply variables. This study intends to expand this analysis by considering two important supply and demand economic parameters. Area of study: We use <b>big</b> <b>game</b> hunting in Spain from 1972 until 2007 as a case study since it has {{an important role in the}} European hunting activity.   Material and Methods: Different linear models were fitted to explain <b>big</b> <b>game</b> harvest as a function of two parameters not previously used: hunting grounds areas and <b>big</b> <b>game</b> firearm hunting licenses. Main results: Our main results show that up to 1989 the decrease in the area of open access territories significantly explains the increase in <b>big</b> <b>game</b> harvests, and that afterwards, once the hunting property rights were strengthen in most of the Spanish territory, the number of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> firearm licenses best explain <b>big</b> <b>game</b> harvests increments. Research highlights : This work shows an upward trend in Spanish harvests of <b>big</b> <b>game,</b> which can be attributed in part to (1) a shift to the right of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> demand, measured by an increase in <b>big</b> <b>game</b> firearm licenses, and (2) a change in the nature of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> supply (from a backward to an ordinary upward supply curve) due to the strengthening of hunting property rights of Spanish hunting grounds.
