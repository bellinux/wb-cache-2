50|$|The {{most common}} method of dry {{application}} {{used in industry}} today is electrostatic deposition. Before application, the dry frit must be encapsulated in an organic silane; this allows the frit to hold an electrical charge during application. An <b>electrostatic</b> <b>gun</b> fires the dry frit powder onto the electrically earthed metal substrate; electrical forces bind the charged powder to the substrate and it adheres.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} way of {{applying}} the powder coating to metal objects is to spray the powder using an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>gun,</b> or corona gun. The gun imparts a positive electric charge to the powder, {{which is then}} sprayed towards the grounded object by mechanical or compressed air spraying and then accelerated toward the workpiece by the powerful electrostatic charge. There are {{a wide variety of}} spray nozzles available for use in electrostatic coating. The type of nozzle used will depend on the shape of the workpiece to be painted and the consistency of the paint. The object is then heated, and the powder melts into a uniform film, and is then cooled to form a hard coating. It is also common to heat the metal first and then spray the powder onto the hot substrate. Preheating can help to achieve a more uniform finish but can also create other problems, such as runs caused by excess powder. See the article [...] "Fusion Bonded Epoxy Coatings" ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{computing}} the transverse transfer matrix for superimposed axisymmetric rf and solenoid field maps. The algorithm constructs the transfer matrix directly from one-dimensional rf and solenoid field maps without computing numerical derivatives or eigenfunction expansions {{of the field}} map data. In addition, this method accurately describes the dynamics of low energy particles starting from a solenoid-immersed cathode, allowing the method to simulate transport through both rf and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>guns.</b> Comparison of particle tracking with the transfer matrix, and direct integration of the equations of motion through several field setups, shows excellent agreement between the two methods...|$|R
40|$|In this Letter, {{we report}} for the first time, {{the ratio of the}} O I (135. 6 nm) /O I (130. 4 nm) {{absolute}} emission cross sections from electron-impact dissociative excitation of O 2 at 100 eV using facilities located at the University of Colorado, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP). The O I (135. 6 nm) emission glow produced in the laboratory from the long-lived transition O I g P # was measured in a large collision chamber (1 m diameter) with a long focal length (50 cm) <b>electrostatic</b> electron <b>gun.</b> The ratio of the absolute emission cross sections of the O I (135. 6 nm) and O I (130. 4 nm) features resulting from electronimpact dissociative excitation of O 2 at 100 eV was found to be 2. 30. 6. From this ratio, the absolute emission cross section for the O I (135. 6 nm) feature at 100 eV electron-impact energy was determined to be (6. 42. 2) 10. TheOI (135. 6 nm) cross section reported here can be used to better understand the recent Hubble Space Telescope observations of the O I (130. 4 nm) and O I (135. 6 nm) emission intensities from Ganymede [Feldman et al., 2000] and Europa [Hall et al., 1995]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{simulation}} of an electron gun. The effects of some parameters on the beam quality were studied and optimal choices were identified. It gives numerical beam qualities in common <b>electrostatic</b> triode <b>gun,</b> and the dependences on design parameters such as electrode geometries and bias voltages to these electrodes are shown. An electron beam of diameter 5 mm with energy of five kilo electron volt was assumed for simulation process. Some design parameters {{were identified as}} variable parameters {{in the presence of}} space charge. These parameters are the inclination angle of emission electrode, the applied voltage to focusing electrode, the gap width between the emission electrode and the focusing electrode and the diameter of the focusing electrode. The triode extraction system is designed and optimized by using CST software (for Particle Beam Simulations). The physical design of the extraction system is given in this paper. From the simulation results, it is concluded that the inclination angle of the emission electrode is optimized at twenty two point five degrees, the applied voltage to the focusing electrode was optimized and found at minus sixteen volts, also, the separation distance (gap between emission electrode and focusing electrode) equals to four milli meter, and the diameter of the emission electrode is fourteen milli meter...|$|R
50|$|A direct current, <b>electrostatic</b> {{thermionic}} electron <b>gun</b> {{is formed}} from several parts: a hot cathode, which is heated {{to create a}} stream of electrons via thermionic emission, electrodes generating an electric field which focus the beam (such as a Wehnelt cylinder), and one or more anode electrodes which accelerate and further focus the electrons. A large voltage between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons. A repulsive ring placed between them focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode {{at the expense of}} a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. Often at this spot is a hole so that the electrons that pass through the anode form a collimated beam and finally reach a second anode called a collector. This arrangement is similar to an Einzel lens.|$|R
5000|$|Heating can be {{achieved}} by using several methods, but the most commonly used ones are ‘’induction heating’’ or ‘’oven heating’’. The steel part is passed through a high frequency alternating current magnetic field, which heats the metal part to the required FBE coating application temperature. Typical application temperature for a stand alone FBE is 225° to 245°C. When used as a primer in a multi-layer polyolifine system, application temperature may be dropped based on FBE manufacturer's recommendations, {{in order to meet the}} [...] "inter-coat adhesion" [...] parameters. Special grade FBE coatings which can be applied at temperatures as low as 175 °C has been developed recently by certain FBE powder manufacturers. Other methods of heating are ‘’oven heating’’, ‘’infra-red heating’’, etc. The FBE powder is placed on a “fluidization bed”. In a fluidization bed, the powder particles are suspended in a stream of air, in which the powder will “behave” like a fluid. Once the air supply is turned off, the powder will remain in its original form. The fluidized powder is sprayed onto the hot substrate using suitable spray <b>guns.</b> An <b>electrostatic</b> spray <b>gun</b> incorporates an ionizer electrode on it, which gives the powder particles a positive electric charge. The steel to be coated is “grounded” through the conveyor. The charged powder particles uniformly wraps around the substrate, and melts into a liquid form. Internal surfaces of pipes are coated using spraying lances, which travel from one end to the other end of the heated pipe at a uniform speed, while the pipe is being rotated in its longitudinal axis.|$|R
40|$|The Rotating Wall Machine (RoWM) is a line-tied linear {{screw pinch}} built to study current-driven {{external}} kink modes. The plasma column is formed by {{an array of}} seven <b>electrostatic</b> washer <b>guns</b> which can also be biased to drive plasma current. The array allows independent control over the electron density ne and current density Jz profiles of the column. Internal measurements of the plasma have been made with singletip Langmuir and magnetic induction (“B-dot”) probes {{for a range of}} bias currents (Ib = 0, 300, 500 A/gun). Streams from the individual guns are seen to merge at a distance of z ≈ 36 cm from the guns; the exact distance depends on the value of Ib. The density of the column is directly proportional to the Ohmic dissipation power, but the temperature stays at a low, uniform value (Te ≈ 3. 5 eV) for each bias level. Electron densities are on the order of ne ∼ 1020 m− 3. The electron density expands radially (across the Bz guide field) as the plasma moves along the column, though the current density Jz mainly stays parallel to the field lines. The singletip Langmuir probe diagnostic is difficult to analyze for Ib = 500 A/gun plasmas and fails as Ib is raised beyond this level. Spectrographic analysis of the Hα line indicates that the hydrogen plasmas are nearly fully ionized at each bias level. Azimuthal E ×B rotation is axially and radially sheared; rotation slows as the plasma reaches the anode. Perpendicular diffusivity is consistent with the ii classical value, D ⊥ ≈ 5 m 2 /sec, while parallel resistivity is seen to be twice the classical Spitzer value, 2 × 10 − 4 Ω m. ii...|$|R
40|$|All {{electron}} cooling systems {{which were}} in operation so far employed electron beam generated with an <b>electrostatic</b> electron <b>gun</b> in DC operating mode, immersed in a longitudinal magnetic field. At low energies magnetic field is also being used to transport electron beam through the cooling section from the gun to the collector. At higher energies (few MeV), it was shown that one can have simpler electron beam transport without continuous magnetic field. Because of a rather weak magnetic field on the cathode and in the cooling section the latter approach {{was referred to as}} 'non-magnetized cooling', since there was no suppression of the transverse angular spread of the electron beam with the magnetic field in the cooling section. Such a cooler successfully operated at FNAL (2005 - 11) at electron beam energy of 4. 3 MeV. Providing cooling at even higher energies would be easier with RF acceleration of electron beam, and thus using bunched electron beam for cooling. Significant efforts were devoted to explore various aspects of such bunched electron beam cooling as part of R and D of high-energy electron cooling for RHIC. However, experimental studies of such cooling are still lacking. Establishing this technique experimentally would be extremely useful for future high-energy applications. Presently there is an ongoing effort to build Proof-of-Principle (PoP) experiment of Coherent Electron Cooling (CEC) at RHIC, which promises to be superior to conventional electron cooling for high energies. Since the CEC experiment is based on bunched electron beam and it has sections where electron beam co-propagates with the ion beam at the same velocity, it also provides a unique opportunity to explore experimentally conventional electron cooling {{but for the first time}} with a bunched electron beam. As a result, it allows us to explore techniques needed for the high-energy electron cooling such as 'painting' with a short electron beam and control of ion beam distribution under cooling which is essential if cooling is provided in a collider. The software needed for comparison with the experiments is already developed as part of the previous high-energy electron cooling studies for RHIC. Since electron beam will be non-magnetized and there will be no magnetic field in the cooling section it will be also a first demonstration of fully non-magnetized cooling. The purpose of these studies was to explore whether we would be able to observe conventional electron cooling with parameters expected in the CEC PoP experiment. Below we summarize requirements on electron beam and cooling section needed for such demonstration...|$|R
