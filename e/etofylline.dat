40|$|The release {{kinetics}} of monolithic drug deliverydevices based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was investigated. Wter soluble PEO's with molecularweights of 600, 000 and 4, 000, 000 and two blends were studied. the water swelling and dissolution {{characteristics of the}} two blends, along with the diffusivity of the drug <b>etofylline</b> in the water-penetrated polymer gels were analyzed. The higher molecular weight PEO and the two blends underwent swelling rather than polymer dissolution. As a result, a non constant release induced by the prevailing diffusive control was observed. Conversely,the drug release from the lower molecular weight PEO was aresult of equal rates of swelling and dissolutn, which gave a constant release rate...|$|E
40|$|Solid dispersions are {{commonly}} used to overcome bioavailability issues of poorly water soluble drugs. Various preparation methods along with carrier systems {{have been used to}} develop solid dispersions. However, this study investigates the application of microwave heating methods in formulation development alongside associated analytical investigations. Formulations of poorly soluble drugs, namely, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ibuprofen (+) S and phenylbutazone were prepared using a microwave technique and compared with standard formulation techniques. Mesoporous silicas and polyethylene glycol were used as excipients. Then in vitro dissolution analysis was carried out for the performance evaluation of the resultant formulations. It was found that effective products were produced as a result of microwave processing compared with the traditional techniques. Analytical techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ((FTIR) were employed to determine the solid state properties, i. e. thermal stability, crystalline state, physical appearance and chemical stability of developed formulations. The overall findings indicate that successful formulation can be achieved using microwave heating. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to probe the interactions of model drugs, namely, caffeine, diprophylline, <b>etofylline,</b> paracetamol and theophylline with excipients such as sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) and PEG. Thermodynamic data suggests the successful use of ITC to investigate drug-excipient interactions. In summary, the potential of microwave heating in formulation development and ITC to characterise drug-excipient interactions was thoroughly investigated and both found as potential alternatives to more traditional techniques...|$|E
40|$|An {{interpretation}} of the drug release from monolithic water-swellable and soluble polymer tablets is presented. A convenient parameter, alpha, which compares the drug-diffusive conductance in the gel layer with the swelling and dissolving characteristics of the unpenetrated polymer was {{used to describe the}} release behaviour of beta-hydroxyethyl-theophylline (<b>etofylline)</b> from compression-moulded tablets of hydrophilic pure semicrystalline poly(ethylene oxides) of mol wt 600, 000 and 4, 000, 000 and of two blends of the two molecular weights of poly(ethylene oxides). The water swelling and dissolution characteristics of two polymers and two blends were analysed, monitoring the thickness increase of the surface-dissolving layer and the rates of water swelling and penetration in the tablets. The drug diffusivities in the water-penetrated polymer gels were measured by carrying out permeation tests. Finally, drug release tests were performed to investigate the release kinetics of the different systems in an aqueous environment at 37 degrees C. The drug release from the high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) is principally related to the material swelling rather than polymer dissolution, leading to a progressive decrease of the drug's diffusive conductance in the growing swollen layer, and hence to a non-constant release induced by the prevailing diffusive control. Conversely, drug release from the low molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) is strictly related to the polymer dissolution mechanism. The achievement of stationary conditions, in which the rate of swelling equals the rate of dissolution, ensures a constant release rate, even in the case of very low drug-diffusive conductance in the external gel layer. Intermediate behaviours were detected {{in the case of the}} two blends...|$|E
