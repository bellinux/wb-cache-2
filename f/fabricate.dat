5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to <b>fabricate.</b>|$|E

South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to <b>fabricate</b> tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, {{cookware}} and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundRecently, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the amount of prescription narcotics used in Taiwan. Despite the possibility that patients suspected of abusing opioids are visiting emergency departments (EDs) to collect drugs, only few studies have assessed the attitudes of ED staff toward these <b>fabricating</b> drug seekers and narcotics prescription. Both issues are crucial in identifying <b>fabricating</b> drug seekers and for pain management. PurposeThe aims of this study were to investigate the attitudes of ED staff toward <b>fabricating</b> drug seekers and narcotics prescription, and to understand the characteristics of patients suspected to be <b>fabricating</b> drug seekers. MethodsFrom January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, 174 staff members of four EDs completed questionnaires to review their perceptions for patients with <b>fabricated</b> drug-seeking behaviors and their attitudes toward prescribing narcotics. The staff members were also requested to report the characteristics of those patients suspected of <b>fabricating</b> a need for narcotics. ResultsAccording to the ED staff's clinical practice, the three most commonly <b>fabricated</b> drug-seeking behaviors were insistence on specific medications, frequent ED visits, and over-reporting of symptoms. Most medical personnel would choose non-narcotic analgesics as their first-line remedy. A total of 14 patients were reported as <b>fabricating</b> drug seekers. ConclusionThe <b>fabricated</b> drug-seeking behavior patterns described by the ED staff were similar to the descriptions mentioned in the literature and their attitudes toward prescribing narcotics were conservative. However, more interventions to overcome staff's opiophobia are needed to improve pain management. Reported <b>fabricating</b> drug seekers usually complain of abdominal pain, while parenteral meperidine was the most sought-after drug...|$|R
5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc.

A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
