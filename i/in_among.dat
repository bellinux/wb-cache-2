5|$|The Expos called Barrett to the Major Leagues on September 19, 1998, in a {{game against}} the Cincinnati Reds as a third baseman. He managed to hit a home run and a single in the game. After only playing eight games as an Expo, Barrett was sent to play for the Harrisburg Senators, a Class AA team from the Eastern League. He {{recorded}} 145 hits, and seventy-eight runs, nineteen home runs, and eighty-seven RBI en route to winning the Double-A All-Star Catcher and Montreal Expos Minor League Player of the Year awards. His performance allowed him to claim a spot on the Expos’ starting roster during the 1999 season. During his first full season, Barrett had fifty-nine starts as a catcher, sixty-two as a third-baseman, and six as shortstop. He also led all National League rookies with thirty-two doubles, while ranking as one of top statistical tiers in runs, hits, and run batted <b>in</b> <b>among</b> all other rookies.|$|E

5|$|The Parthians had {{originally}} intended to invade Syria, but Corbulo put on a convincing display of military might, building a strong flotilla of ships equipped with catapults and a bridge over the Euphrates, which allowed him to establish a foothold on the Parthian shore. Therefore, the Parthians abandoned their plans for Syria, and turned their attention towards Armenia. There, Paetus had dispersed his forces and granted extended leaves to his officers, {{so that he was}} taken unawares at the Parthian advance. Upon learning of it, he initially advanced to meet Vologases, but after a reconnaissance detachment was defeated, he panicked and withdrew hastily. Paetus sent his wife and son to safety in the fortress of Arsamosata, and tried to block the Parthian advance by occupying the passes of the Taurus mountains with detachments from his army. In so doing, however, he further dispersed his forces, which were then defeated in detail by the Parthians. Roman morale plunged and panic set <b>in</b> <b>among</b> the army, which was now besieged in a series of hastily erected camps near Rhandeia. Paetus, who appears to have fallen into desperate inactivity, sent urgent messages to Corbulo to come to his rescue.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained}} {{a close relationship}} with France, a policy known as Françafrique, and he built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser on African policy in the de Gaulle and Pompidou governments. He aided the conspirators who ousted Kwame Nkrumah from power in Ghana in 1966, took part in the failed coup against Mathieu Kérékou in Benin in 1977, and was suspected of involvement in the 1987 coup that removed Thomas Sankara from power in Burkina Faso. Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained a}} strong anti-communist foreign policy, which resulted <b>in,</b> <b>among</b> other things, severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1969 (after first establishing relations in 1967) and refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China until 1983. He provided assistance to UNITA, a United States-supported, anti-communist rebel movement in Angola. In 1986 he re-established relations with the Soviet Union, shortly before the fall of its confederation.|$|E
5|$|While {{writing in}} Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, {{the number of}} {{documents}} written locally increased in the 7th century; though {{most of them have}} been lost. By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to {{become an integral part of}} Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated <b>in,</b> <b>among</b> others, Confucian texts at the Daigakuryo ("University") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (shakyōjo) before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the phonogram orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and katakana were developed in the Heian period.|$|E

5|$|Development on Immortal Throne {{began in}} early June 2006, {{a few weeks}} after the {{original}} Titan Quest went gold. Preparatory work was in progress during the late development stages of Titan Quest, with staff drawing up feature lists and choosing what features to improve and what additions to make. According to producer Michael Verrette, Immortal Throne was considered an extension of Titan Quest, as many of the elements it included were features that could not be included in the original game due to time constraints. Multiple staff from Titan Quest returned, either in their original roles or different roles: Verrette became producer after being a sound designer for the original game, Arthur Bruno became lead gameplay designer, and Michael Sheidow and Scott Morton returned as art director and composer respectively. The original graphics engine was carried over from the original game with some accompanying refinements. The level design was based around the increased vertical elements in environments, giving a wider variety of gameplay spaces and vistas. A big addition to the game was the Dream Mastery character class, which was both designed to fit <b>in</b> <b>among</b> the existing character classes and to be a useful skill in cooperative multiplayer. The level editor, a feature present in the original game, was left mostly intact, although additional development features were added such as lockable day and night cycle and preview features for new elements. Visually, the game was themed around a descent into the Underworld: the deeper the player went on their journey, the darker the environments became. Immortal Throne would be the last original property worked on by Iron Lore Entertainment: after completing work on , an expansion to , the studio was forced to close in February 2008 due to difficulties in securing any funding for future projects.|$|E
