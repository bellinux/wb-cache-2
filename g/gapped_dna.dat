40|$|Pre-steady-state kinetic {{analysis}} was used to compare the catalytic properties of DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) for single-base gap-filling and regular duplex DNA synthesis. The rate of polymerization (kpol) and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of dNTP (Kd) were determined with single-nucleotide <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> substrates for all four possible correct base pairs and twelve possible incorrect base pairs, and the results were compared with those obtained previously with non-gapped primer/template duplex DNA substrates. For correct dNTP incorporation, the use of single-nucleotide <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> led to significant decreases in the Kd of dNTP. Although kpol was little affected, the catalytic efficiency kpol/Kd increased significantly owing to the decreases in Kd. In contrast, for incorrect dNTP incorporation, the use of single-nucleotide <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> substrates did not affect the Kd of dNTP appreciably but caused the kpol (and thus kpol/Kd) for incorrect dNTP incorporation to increase. As a consequence the fidelity of Pol beta was not significantly affected by the use of single-nucleotide <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> substrates. In addition we show that under processive polymerization conditions the processivity of Pol beta increases in the gap-filling synthesis owing to a decreased rate of DNA dissociation. Finally, with a single-nucleotide <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> substrate the rate-limiting conformational change step before chemistry was also observed. However, the preceding fast conformational change observed with duplex DNA substrates was not clearly detected. A possible cause is that in the complex with the <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA,</b> the 8 kDa N-terminal domain of Pol beta already exists in a closed conformation. This interpretation was supported by tryptic digestion experiments...|$|E

It is a stable heterotrimer consisting of subunits with molecular masses of 70, 32 and 14 kDa (p 70, p 32 and p 14, respectively). <b>Gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> structures are common intermediates during DNA replication and NER.

UV crosslinking and subsequent analysis showed that the p 70 subunit mainly interacts with the 5 ′-end of DNA irrespective of DNA structure, while the subunit orientation towards the 3 ′-end of DNA in the gap structures strongly depends on the gap size. The results are compared with the data obtained previously with the primer–template systems containing 5 ′- or 3 ′-protruding DNA strands.

We generate a library of <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules by treating a DNA restriction fragment with the hydroxyl radical, generated by the reaction of Fe(II) EDTA with hydrogen peroxide. The DNA molecule studied contains a fixed bend produced by a set of phased adenine tracts. The A-tract bend serves as a reference bend for investigating the conformational nature of a strand gap. In the first electrophoretic dimension, a bent DNA molecule that has been treated with the hydroxyl radical is electrophoresed on a native gel. Smearing of the band on the native gel indicates that the library of <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules contains a variety of DNA conformations.

40|$|The human Rad 17 –Rfc 2 - 5 and Rad 9 –Rad 1 –Hus 1 {{complexes}} play crucial {{roles in}} the activation of the ATR-mediated DNA damage and DNA replication stress response pathways. In response to DNA damage, Rad 9 is recruited to chromatin in a Rad 17 -dependent manner in human cells. However, the DNA structures recognized by the Rad 17 –Rfc 2 - 5 complex during the damage response have not been defined. Here, we show that replication protein A (RPA) stimulates the binding of the Rad 17 –Rfc 2 - 5 complex to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), primed ssDNA, and a <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> structure. Furthermore, RPA facilitates the recruitment of the Rad 9 –Rad 1 –Hus 1 complex by the Rad 17 –Rfc 2 - 5 complex to primed and <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> structures in vitro.

Unlike replication factor C (RFC), which uses the 3 ′ primer/template junction to recruit proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the Rad 17 –Rfc 2 - 5 complex can use both the 5 ′ and the 3 ′ primer/template junctions to recruit the Rad 9 –Rad 1 –Hus 1 complex, and it shows a preference for <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> structures.

In cases of asymmetrical methylation, transfection of E. coli with these heteroduplex molecules leads to marker recoveries with a pronounced bias in favour of the marker encoded by the methylated strand.

Different DNA substrates, including single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), DNA template-primer (T-P) duplex and <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA,</b> were immobilized on the biosensor chip surface using streptavidin-biotin, and MMLV RT–-DNA binding kinetics were analyzed by different models. MMLV RT– could bind with ssDNA and the binding was involved in conformation change. MMLV RT – binding DNA T-P duplex and <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> could be analyzed using the simple 1 : 1 Langmuir model. The lack of RNase H domain reduced the affinity between MMLV RT – and T-P duplex. The effects of RT inhibitors, including efavirenz, nevirapine and quercetin, on the interaction between MMLV RT – and <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> were analyzed according to recovered kinetics parameters.

Conditions that, removed the formation of secondary structure in the <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA,</b> such as addition of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein or preincubation in 1 mM-MgCl 2, optimized the binding of RecA protein and increased the formation of joint molecules, The gapped duplex formed stable joints with fully duplex DNA that had a 5 ' or 3 ' terminus complementary to the single-stranded region of the gapped molecule. However, the joints formed had distinct properties and structures {{depending on whether the}} complementary terminus was at the 5 ' or 3 ' end. Pairing between <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> and fully duplex linear DNA with a 3 ' complementary terminus resulted in strand displacement, symmetric strand exchange and formation of complete strand exchange products. By contrast, pairing between gapped and fully duplex DNA with a 5 ' complementary terminus produced a joint that was restricted to the gapped region; there was no strand displacement or symmetric strand exchange. The joint formed in the latter reaction was likely a three-stranded intermediate rather than a heteroduplex with the classical Watson-Crick structure. We conclude that, as in the three-strand reaction, the process of strand exchange in the four-strand reaction is polar and progresses in a 5 ' to 3 ' direction with respect to the initiating strand. The present study provides further evidence that in both three-strand and four-strand systems the pairing and strand exchange reactions share a common mechanism. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Energetics and {{specificity}} of {{interactions between the}} Escherichia coli PriA helicase and the <b>gapped</b> <b>DNAs</b> have been studied, using the quantitative fluorescence titration and analytical ultracentrifugation methods. The gap complex has a surprisingly low minimum total site size, corresponding to ∼ 7 nucleotides of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), {{as compared with the}} site size of ∼ 20 nucleotides of the enzyme-ssDNA complex. The dramatic difference in stoichiometries indicates that the enzyme predominantly engages the strong DNA-binding subsite in interactions with the gap and assumes a very different orientation in the gap complex, as compared with the complex with the ssDNA. The helicase binds the ssDNA gaps with 4 – 5 nucleotides with the highest affinity, which is ∼ 3 and ∼ 2 orders of magnitude larger than the affinities for the ssDNA and double-stranded DNA, respectively. In the gap complex, the protein does not engage in cooperative interactions with the enzyme predominantly associated with the surrounding dsDNA. Binding of nucleoside triphosphate to the strong and weak nucleotide-binding sites of the helicase eliminates the selectivity of the enzyme for the size of the gap, whereas saturation of both sites with ADP leads to amplified affinity for the ssDNA gap containing 5 nucleotides and engagement of an additional protein area in interactions with the nucleic acid...|$|R

Anchors for our study are available in crystallographic structures of the DNA pol-β in “open” (polymerase bound to <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA)</b> and “closed” (polymerase bound to <b>gapped</b> <b>DNA</b> and substrate, dCTP) forms; these different states have long been used to deduce that a large-scale conformational change may help the polymerase choose the correct nucleotide, and hence monitor DNA synthesis fidelity, through an “induced-fit” mechanism. However, the existence of open states with bound substrate and closed states without substrates suggest that substrate-induced conformational closing may be more subtle. Our dynamics simulations of two pol-β/DNA systems (with/without substrates at the active site) reveal the large-scale closing motions of the thumb and 8 -kDa subdomains in the presence of the correct substrate—leading to nearly perfect rearrangement of residues in the active site for the subsequent chemical step of nucleotidyl transfer—in contrast to an opening trend when the substrate is absent, leading to complete disassembly of the active site residues. These studies thus provide in silico evidence for the substrate-induced conformational rearrangements, as widely assumed based on a variety of crystallographic open and closed complexes.

The Xrcc1 NTD specifically binds single-strand break <b>DNA</b> (<b>gapped</b> and nicked) and a gapped DNA-beta-Pol complex.|$|R
5000|$|WRN also {{participates in}} BER through its {{interaction}} with Polλ. [...] WRN binds to the catalytic domain of Polλ and specifically stimulates <b>DNA</b> <b>gap</b> filling by Polλ over 8-oxo-G followed by strand displacement synthesis. This allows WRN to promote long-patch DNA repair synthesis by Polλ during MUTYH-initiated repair of 8-oxo-G:A mispairs.|$|R
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, checkpoints are activated {{in response}} to DNA damage. This requires the action of DNA damage sensors such as the Rad family proteins. The three human proteins Rad 9, Rad 1 and Hus 1 form a heterotrimeric complex (called the 9 - 1 - 1 complex) that is recruited onto DNA upon damage. DNA damage also triggers the recruitment of DNA repair proteins at the lesion, including specialized DNA polymerases. In this work, we showed that the 9 - 1 - 1 complex can physically interact with DNA polymerase beta in vitro. Functional analysis revealed that the 9 - 1 - 1 complex had a stimulatory effect on DNA polymerase beta activity. However, the presence of 9 - 1 - 1 complex neither affected DNA polymerase lambda, another X family DNA polymerase, nor the two replicative DNA polymerases alpha and delta. DNA polymerase beta stimulation resulted from an increase in its affinity for the primer-template and the interaction with the 9 - 1 - 1 complex stimulated deoxyribonucleotides misincorporation by DNA polymerase beta. In addition, the 9 - 1 - 1 complex enhanced DNA strand displacement synthesis by DNA polymerase beta on a 1 nt <b>gap</b> <b>DNA</b> substrate. Our data raise {{the possibility that the}} 9 - 1 - 1 complex might attract DNA polymerase beta to DNA damage sites, thus connecting directly checkpoints and DNA repair...|$|R
