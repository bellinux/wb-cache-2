50|$|Precast shape {{manufacturing}} {{requires a}} mold or pattern {{to form the}} shape. Several methods for mold-making are routinely used, {{and the type of}} mold construction and materials depends on the size, complexity, and dimensional tolerances the shape requires, and sometimes the quantity of shapes. Simple shapes with loose dimensional tolerances (+/- 1/16") can use plywood or metal forms. Other shapes may involve extremely tight tolerances that require more sophisticated molds made from wood, plastic, or metal. These molds may be made by a <b>foundry</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>maker</b> or machine shop.|$|E

40|$|The European foundry {{industry}} is facing an increasing cost pressure coming from low-cost countries. Because European manufacturers cannot compete with production costs, {{they have to}} find other means. The authors believe that European foundries can improve their competitiveness by providing designing cooperation to their customers. 70 – 80 % of the production costs are determined already in the design phase. If the supplier is involved in the product development, the potential benefits can be remarkable both to the supplier and the customer. This study concentrates on the cast part development process. The first aim was to find how a cast part is developed, what the contribution of different actors (<b>foundry,</b> customer, <b>pattern</b> <b>maker)</b> is and what kind of designing cooperation occurs. The second goal was to find what kind of designing cooperation customers want and foundries can provide. To gain the information, semi-constructed interviews were held in a Finnish foundry, in two cast utilizing companies and in a pattern shop...|$|R
