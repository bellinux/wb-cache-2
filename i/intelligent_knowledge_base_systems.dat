Although many successful systems have been developed, these are often difficult to maintain and to generalize in rapidly changing domains. In this paper we consider building <b>intelligent</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems</b> with maintainability well to the fore in our requirements for such systems. We introduce two case studies: the initial proof of concept, {{which was in the}} domain of computer configuration, and a further field-tested study, the configuration of compressors.

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{hypermedia}} {{has been}} grown in interest in advanced research on teaching and learning. Futhermore, {{the extension of}} hypermedia toward intelligent hypermedia comes more than obviously to meet specific requirements of learning, such as the student modeling, diagnosis and guiding the learner in his investigation. In this paper, we present an architecture for a <b>system</b> <b>based</b> on integrating hypermedia <b>system</b> and <b>intelligent</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system.</b> The object formalism is chosen to represent static and predefined knowledge, whereas the rule formalism is chosen for dynamic knowledge and reasoning processes modeling. The <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> can be described by three models of expertise: the domain model, the student model and the didactic model (including the communication model). This architecture allows automatic generation of dynamically individualized courses according to the learner's goal, his or her previous knowledge and the learner's success in acquiring knowlede...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Although {{production}} planning and control systems were developed {{and used for}} about thirty years, {{a whole bunch of}} problems remains unresolved. Simple data management tasks [...] like retrieval and manipulation of master data concerning products, orders, staff, machines and stocks [...] are handled quite well. However the more complex task of creating or adapting production schedules is not yet satisfactorily solved in systems currently available on the market. <b>Intelligent</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems</b> supporting but not replacing the human planner, are a promising approach to solve this task. We propose a support system that covers the whole range from completely interactive scheduling and rescheduling to totally automatic plan generation. In one extreme the human planner may completely construct the schedule in an interactive graphical environment whereas the system only checks the production requirements.

40|$|Details of {{research}} into the automated generation of a digital database of hydrographic charts is presented. Low level processing of digital images of hydrographic charts provides image line feature segments which serve as input to a semi-automated feature extraction system, (SAFE). This system is able to perform {{a great deal of}} the building of chart features from the image segments simply on the basis of proximity of the segments. The system solicits user interaction when ambiguities arise. IThe creation of an <b>intelligent</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system</b> (IKBS) implemented in the form of a backward chained production rule <b>based</b> <b>system,</b> which cooperates with the SAFE system, is described. The 1 KBS attempts to resolve ambiguities using domain knowledge coded in the form of production rules. The two systems communicate by the passing of goals from SAFE to the IKBS and the return of a certainty factor by the IKBS for each goal submitted. The SAFE system can make additional feature building decisions on the basis of collected sets of certainty factors, thus reducing the need for user interaction. This thesis establishes that the cooperating IKBS approach to image interpretation offers an effective route to automated image understanding...|$|R

Semantic similarity denotes computing the similarity between concepts, having the same meaning or related information, which are not necessarily lexically similar. Semantic similarity between concepts {{plays an important role}} in Semantic Web, knowledge sharing, Web mining, semantic sense understanding and text summarization. This also is an important problem in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval Researches. These techniques are becoming important components of most of the Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) and other <b>intelligent</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore it has received considerable attention in the literature. Ontology has a good hierarchical structure of concepts. In the ontology, semantic information can be realized through the semantic relationship of concepts. Ontology-based semantic similarity techniques can estimate the semantic similarity between two hierarchically expressed concepts in a given ontology or taxonomy. Semantic similarity is usually computed by mapping concepts to ontology and by examining their relationships in it. The most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet and MeSH. Several algorithmic approaches for computing semantic similarity have been proposed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with Intelligent Tutoring Systems. It investigates the architecture of an <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Based</b> Tutoring <b>System</b> in terms of three knowledge models: that of the domain, the student and the tutor, and examines the interrelatedness and interconnectedness of these three knowledge models. Existing <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Based</b> Tutoring <b>Systems</b> are reviewed, {{and the relationship between}} their behaviour and architecture is analysed by evaluating them against Wenger's model of a didactic operation. Two such systems, PROUST, a tutoring system for Pascal program debugging skills, and micro-SEARCH, a tutoring system for mathematical transformations skills, are used in the study. This evaluation serves two purposes: to unravel the requirements for interrelatedness and interconnectedness between the three knowledge models in order to develop a true <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Based</b> Tutoring <b>System</b> with a full-scale didactic operation, and to uncover the limitations of the current generation of <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Based</b> Tutoring <b>Systems</b> and how they fail to fully encompass these requirements.

Climate scientists predict that a 1. 5 Â°C rise in global temperature may cause the extinction of 25 % of the Earth's animals and plants disappear. In this fearsome prospect, carbon emission was identified as the main factor contributing to this issue, and needed to be effectively controlled to mitigate their detrimental impacts on the environment as well as human life. GHG mitigation requires developing and implementing policies, and utilizing new technologies to reduce GHG. In this paper, we explore the role of smart technologies in reducing the carbon emission. With the increasing deployment of Smart water meters across Australia in the last five years, an <b>intelligent</b> and <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> <b>system</b> called AutoflowÂ© has been developed to help: (i) monitor and predict carbon emission level from water consumption in realtime (e. g.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} automated environment, {{the control of}} material handling tasks in a goods distribution center is an activity which requires the fusion of various disciplines of engineering {{in order to identify}} the appropriate automation tools which could prove beneficial. Various factors influence the effectiveness of automated equipment in a goods distribution centre. It is necessary to control not only scheduling and routing of goods, but also material handling equipment, which are becoming increasingly autonomous. This dissertation addresses the problem of devising a control system so that (a) material flow and (b) material handling equipment are both controlled. A discrete event modelling formalism is employed, and the concept of fuzzy logic is applied for controlling an automated goods transporting device. This approach is a significant departure from currently used techniques of modelling control in a distribution center, and opens up a very broad based research area. The growing body of <b>knowledge</b> about <b>intelligent</b> control and <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems</b> is an area of research which is very active. Control of automated vehicles is a thoroughly explored area, and answers are waiting for the appropriate questions. This dissertation adopts an integrated approach to the problem of modelling material handling automation, taking into consideration the twin aspects of equipment control and control of goods flow. The discrete event modelling formalism has been employed and autonomous positioning control has been modelled and simulated considering adaptive and fuzzy control strategies. The constraints to automated guided vehicle velocity are discussed and a simulation study in SIMAN, a simulation and analysis software, is performed to examine the variation of queue length for a range of AGV velocities and pallet interarrival times. The objective behind the simulation is to come up with AGV velocities and pallet interarrival rates for which the system would perform satisfactorily.
