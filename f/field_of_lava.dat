60|$|At Los Arenales, {{low down}} on the eastern flank, the mica-slate is traversed by several closely adjoining, broad dikes, {{parallel}} {{to each other and to}} the foliation of the schist. The dikes are formed of three different varieties of rock, of which a pale brown feldspathic porphyry with grains of quartz was much the most abundant. These dikes with their granules of quartz, as well as the mica-schist itself, strikingly resemble the rocks of the Chonos Archipelago. At a height of about twelve hundred feet above the dikes, and perhaps connected with them, there is a range of cliffs formed of successive lava-streams [AA], between three and four hundred feet in thickness, and in places finely columnar. The lava consists of dark- greyish, harsh rocks, intermediate in character between trachyte and basalt, containing glassy feldspar, olivine, and a little mica, and sometimes amygdaloidal with zeolite: the basis is either quite compact, or crenulated with air-vesicles arranged in laminae. The streams are separated from each other by beds of fragmentary brown scoriae, firmly cemented together, and including a few well-rounded pebbles of lava. From their general appearance, I suspect that these lava-streams flowed at an ancient period under the pressure of the sea, when the Atlantic covered the Pampas and washed the eastern foot of the Cordillera. (This conclusion might, perhaps, even have been anticipated, from the general rarity of volcanic action, except near the sea or large bodies of water. Conformably with this rule, at the present day, there are no active volcanoes on this eastern side of the Cordillera; nor are severe earthquakes experienced here.) On the opposite and northern side of the valley there is another line of lava- cliffs at a corresponding height; the valley between being of considerable breadth, and as nearly as I could estimate 1,500 feet in depth. This <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> is confined on both sides by the mountains of mica-schist, and slopes down rapidly but irregularly to the edge of the Pampas, where, having a thickness of about two hundred feet, it terminates against a little range of claystone porphyry. The valley in this lower part expands into a bay-like, gentle slope, bordered by the cliffs of lava, which must certainly once have extended across this wide expanse. The inclination of the streams from Los Arenales to the mouth of the valley is so great, that at the time (though ignorant of M. Elie de Beaumont's researches on the extremely small slope over which lava can flow, and yet retain a compact structure and considerable thickness) I concluded that they must subsequently to their flowing have been upheaved and tilted from the mountains; of this conclusion I can now entertain not the smallest doubt.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{underlying}} slope <b>of</b> a <b>lava</b> flow impart a significant fraction of rotational energy beyond the slope break. The eddies, circulation and vortices caused by this rotational energy can disrupt the flow surface, having {{a significant impact}} on heat loss and thus the distance the flow can travel. A basic mechanics model is used to compute the rotational energy caused by a slope change. The gain in rotational energy is deposited into an eddy of radius R whose energy is dissipated as it travels downstream. A model of eddy friction with the ambient lava is used to compute the time-rate of energy dissipation. The key parameter of the dissipation rate is shown to be rho R(sup 2 /) mu, where is the lava density and mu is the viscosity, which can vary by orders of magnitude for different flows. The potential spatial disruption <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> flow surface is investigated by introducing steady-state models for the main flow beyond the steepening slope break. One model applies to slow-moving flows with both gravity and pressure as the driving forces. The other model applies to fast-moving, low-viscosity, turbulent flows.

40|$|Explosive eruptions of mafic magmas produce lava fountains whose heights are a {{function}} of the exsolved volatile content of the magma, its erupted mass flux, and the geometry of the vent (which may be an elongate fissure or a localized, near-circular conduit). The geometry of the initial vent (and the eruptive behaviour) can be distinctly modified by lava drainback and accumulating ejecta. Hot pyroclasts landing near the vent may coalesce to form rootless flows, some of which may drain back into the vent to be recycled into the eruption products. Rootless flows may be at least partially confined by pre-existing topographic features, or by spatter or cinder ramparts being built up by the eruption itself, so that they accumulate into a lava pond over and around the vent. The erupting jet of magmatic gas and pyroclasts must force its way through such a pond and will entrain some <b>of</b> the pond <b>lava</b> as it does so.

40|$|International audienceThe recent {{activity}} of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano offers {{a rare opportunity to}} address the issue of Pb isotope behavior in volcanic fumaroles, as the composition of the degassing source is accurately and precisely known. Gas sublimates formed between 2007 and 2011 at temperature ranging from 400 to ca. 100 degrees C include Na-K sulfate (aphthitalite), Ca-Cu sulfate (e. g., gypsum), Na sulfate (thenardite), Ca-Mg-Al-Fe fluoride (e. g., ralstonite) and native sulfur. The high-temperature deposits show trace element patterns typical of volcanic gas (with Pb concentration up to 836 ppm) while the low-temperature deposits are depleted in most volatile elements (Pb < 1 ppm) with the exception of Pd and Tl (in fluorides) and Se (in native sulfur). Only for low-temperature fluoride samples do Pb isotope compositions plot significantly outside the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>lavas.</b> The isotopic shift is ascribed to leaching ubiquitous unradiogenic phases (e. g., sulfides) by acidic gas condensates. The similarity in Pb isotope signature between lavas and sublimate samples more representative of the gas phase (sulfates) indicates that the net fractionation of Pb isotopes resulting from volatilization and condensation processes is smaller than the precision of Pb isotope measurements (better than 60 ppm/a. m. u.). The absence of net fractionation could result from negligible isotope fractionation during Pb volatilization followed by extensive condensation of gaseous Pb, with possibly significant isotopic fractionation at this stage. Although this scenario has to be refined by more direct measurement of the gas phase, and its general applicability tested, it suggests that a small fraction (< 10 %) of initially volatilized Pb ultimately escapes to the atmosphere, while the remaining dominant fraction is trapped in sublimates. As sublimates are rapidly dissolved and entrained by runoff, the fumarolic environment appears as a factory efficiently transferring isotopically unfractionated Pb from magmas towards the hydrological system and seawater. Resolving very small isotopic differences between magmas and their gaseous products remains an analytical challenge. High-precision Pb isotope measurements rest not only on instrumental performance but also on high-yield chemistry, as Pb isotopes drastically fractionate (800 ppm/a. m. u.) upon elution on anionic resin. For 50 % Pb recovery, the estimated isotopic bias is plus or minus 60 - 80 ppm/a. m. u., depending on which of the early (isotopically light) or late (isotopically heavy) Pb fraction is lost.

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} an 'Azores mantle plume' has been widely debated, and the {{existence}} of an Azores hotspot questioned. In an effort to shed new light on this controversy, we present He isotope and major, trace and volatile element compositions for basaltic scoriae from five monogenetic cones emplaced along the fissure zone of Pico Island, the youngest island of the Azores archipelago. The bulk scoriae and lavas are moderately alkaline basalts, and their He isotope ratios, determined on olivine crystals, vary between 10 * 2 and 11 * 1 ± 0 * 1 Ra. In contrast, melt inclusions hosted in olivine (Fo 76 - 83 * 5) span a large range of compositions (K 2 O = 0 * 7 - 1 * 7 wt %; Ce = 32 - 65 ppm; Nb = 21 - 94 ppm), which extends the compositional <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>lavas</b> erupted along the Pico fissure zone. This chemical evolution is predominantly controlled by polybaric fractional crystallization. Most melt inclusions share similar enrichments in large ion lithophile and light rare earth elements, and trace element ratios (La/Sm, La/Yb, Sr/Nd, Ta/Th, Zr/Y) with their bulk-rocks. Only a few of them differ in their lower contents of incompatible elements and La/Sm, Li/Ta and Na/K ratios, a feature that is ascribed to distinct conditions of melting. As a whole, the melt inclusions preserve high and variable volatile contents, and contain up to 1 * 8 - 2 * 0 wt % of H 2 O and 0 * 4 wt % of CO 2. The total fluid pressures, retrieved from the dissolved CO 2 and H 2 O concentrations, and the PCO 2 from fluid inclusions, indicate magma ponding and crystallization at the crust-mantle boundary (ca. 18 km deep). The H 2 O/Cl and H 2 O/Ce ratios in the inferred parental undegassed basalts of the Pico fissure zone average 0 * 036 ± 0 * 006 and 259 ± 21, respectively. The latter value is significantly higher than that reported for typical mid-ocean ridge basalts from the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge, but is similar to published ratios for submarine undegassed basalts from the Azores platform. Combining the calculated compositions of Pico primary magmas formed by low degrees of melting with recent geophysical data for the Azores, we propose a model for Azores magma generation involving the decompression melting of a water-enriched mantle domain (H 2 O = 680 - 570 ppm) with an estimated temperature excess of ≤ 120 °C with respect to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge...|$|R
6000|$|A step beyond Hookena, {{a wooden}} house with two doors stands {{isolated}} in a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> broken <b>lava,</b> like ploughed land. I had approached {{it on the}} night of my arrival, and found it black and silent; yet even then it had inmates. A man and a woman sat there captive, and the man had a knife, brought to him in secret by his family. Not long, perhaps, after I was by, the man, silencing by threats his fellow-prisoner, cut through the floor and escaped to the mountain. It was known he had a comrade there, hunted on the same account; and their friends kept them supplied with food and ammunition. Upon the mountains, in most islands of the group, similar outlaws rove in bands or dwell alone, unsightly hermits; and but the other day an officer was wounded while attempting an arrest. Some are desperate fellows; some mournful women--mothers and wives; some stripling girls. A day or two, for instance, after the man had escaped, the police got word of another old offender, made a forced march, and took the quarry sitting: this time with little peril to themselves. For the outlaw was a girl of nineteen, who had been two years under the rains in the high forest, with her mother for comrade and accomplice. How does their own poet sing? ...|$|R
