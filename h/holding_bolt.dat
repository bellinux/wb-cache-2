50|$|The Trotters {{return to}} the mansion a week later to clean the chandeliers, though the Lord and Lady are away on holiday. Grandad goes upstairs to unscrew the <b>holding</b> <b>bolt</b> {{for one of the}} chandeliers while Del and Rodney climb up on step ladders with a blanket ready to catch it. However, unbeknown to Del and Rodney (and the audience), Grandad is {{actually}} loosening the bolt for the adjacent chandelier. He knocks the bolt out, and as Del and Rodney are ready to catch their chandelier, the second chandelier plummets to the ground and smashes to pieces. After verifying with the butler that they never gave any of their contact details to the Ridgemeres, the Trotters run away {{as fast as they can}} and escape from the mansion in their van (although by law, the chandeliers will be covered by home insurance).|$|E
50|$|The rifle feeds from 30-round steel {{magazines}} that are interchangeable with magazines from the American M16 rifle (STANAG 4179 compliant). After {{the last round}} is fired, the bolt will remain closed {{as there is no}} provision for an automatic <b>bolt</b> <b>hold</b> open. However, the bolt handle can be manually worked to <b>hold</b> the <b>bolt</b> back. FNC magazines will function in AR-15/M16-type rifles but the follower will not <b>hold</b> the <b>bolt</b> open on the last round unless they have been replaced by an M16-type follower.|$|R
50|$|Quivers can {{be mounted}} to hold ammunition. These are often made from plastic and usually <b>hold</b> the <b>bolts</b> in fixed {{positions}} along the structure. A popular detachable design {{consists of a}} main arm that {{is attached to the}} weapon, a plate on one end that secures four or more individual bolts at a point on their shafts and at the other end a cover that secures their heads. This kind of quiver is attached under the front of the crossbow, parallel to the string and is designed to be quickly detached and reattached. Other designs <b>hold</b> <b>bolts</b> underneath the crossbow parallel to the stock, sometimes {{on either side of the}} crossbow.|$|R
40|$|New method {{allows for}} {{virtually}} any bolt {{to be easily}} converted to "captive" bolt. Method eliminates need for separate design for each application. Cup-shaped washer that is flattened secures tap to bolt. Wire attached to tab <b>holds</b> <b>bolt</b> assembly captive. Flattening washer can also be done during installation of bolt. Wash, tab and spacer are all made of corrosion-resistant steel...|$|R

40|$|The <b>hold</b> down <b>bolt</b> of {{the fans}} of an air cooler has failed by fatigue. Investigation showed that jamming of the link rod at the eye-end due to {{corrosion}} restricted {{the rotation of the}} link rod when the positioner acted to adjust the pitch of the blade. This has resulted in excessive stresses on the <b>hold</b> down <b>bolt</b> leading to failure by fatigue. The damages seen on other parts of the air cooler are secondary and subsequent to the failure of the <b>hold</b> down <b>bolt.</b> Use of stainless steel grade material for the construction of the linkages and periodic lubrication at the eye-end of the link rod are recommended to prevent the recurrence of similar failure...|$|R

50|$|Stripping is simple: Safety on, remove magazine, cock and <b>hold</b> <b>bolt</b> open, rotate to left, inspect bolt {{face and}} chamber, release bolt under control. Then grab butt, press catch on bottom of {{receiver}} with other hand, rotate butt to left 90 degree and pull off. Remove spring, release safety, tip barrel up and pull {{so that the}} trigger bolt slides out. Assemble in reverse. Suggested ranges for use were 25 meters from the hip snap shooting 100 meters using sights.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2003, {{the store}} was the [...] "oldest active {{business}} in town," [...] according to the St. Petersburg Times, which added:The reluctance to modernize is evident everywhere. The ceiling is high, made of elaborately patterned tin {{and in need of}} paint. The freight elevator {{in the back of the}} store is powered by hand.A tall, darkly stained plywood case that <b>holds</b> <b>bolts</b> and screws in its dozens of drawers, was built, according to a little brass label on one corner, by A.R. Brown on May 7, 1901.|$|R
50|$|Spirit of Communication, a 20000 lb bronze statue {{that had}} stood for 64 {{years in the}} lobby of AT&T's {{previous}} headquarters building at 195 Broadway, was disassembled and relocated to the lobby of 550 Madison in 1983. The 22 ft figure, modeled in 1916 by American sculptor Evelyn Beatrice Longman, is <b>holding</b> <b>bolts</b> of electricity clutched in one arm reaching towards the sky and has coils of cable wound around the statue's torso. After AT&T moved out of the building, the statue was relocated to a spot outside of its Basking Ridge operational headquarters in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Most Yugoslavian {{and some}} East German AK {{magazines}} {{were made with}} cartridge followers that <b>hold</b> the <b>bolt</b> open when empty; however, most AK magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty.|$|R
50|$|Recently, a newly {{configured}} {{version of}} the Saiga 12 was introduced. Called the Saiga Taktika mod 040, it features an extended magazine well, last round <b>bolt</b> <b>hold</b> open (recently produced very rarely and replaced with manual <b>bolt</b> <b>hold),</b> hinged dust cover with Picatinny rail for mounting optics, picatinny rail gas block, and a newly designed 8-round magazine (not interchangeable with other Saiga-12 models).|$|R

50|$|Luna is {{endangered}} {{when one}} member of the invading Skrull army is disguised as one of her playmates. After the Skrulls were repelled from Attilan, Luna was seen with Maximus as Medusa heads into space to look for where the Skrulls are <b>holding</b> Black <b>Bolt.</b>|$|R
50|$|AT&T {{commissioned}} Evelyn Beatrice Longman {{to create}} a bronze sculpture that she called Genius of Telegraphy, {{that was to be}} placed atop a pyramidal structure {{on the top of the}} Fulton Street wing of the building. The statue that she created depicted a 24 ft winged male figure in gilded bronze on top of a globe, with the figure having cables around its torso and one of the statue's arms <b>holding</b> <b>bolts</b> of electricity. the statue was cast in bronze and covered with over 40,000 pieces of gold leaf. After a court-ordered divestiture of Western Union, the statue's official title was changed to Genius of Electricity. The statue was renamed Spirit of Communication in the 1930s, but has been better known by its nickname, Golden Boy.|$|R
50|$|Tongue-and-groove pliers are {{commonly}} used for turning and <b>holding</b> nuts and <b>bolts,</b> gripping irregularly shaped objects, and clamping materials.|$|R
50|$|The Mk47 {{underwent}} several {{tests in}} reliability, being manageable to handle, {{especially with a}} suppressor. Shooting Illustrated mentioned {{that the only thing}} the rifle needs is something to <b>hold</b> the <b>bolt</b> open so that the shooter or someone can see that the weapon is not loaded.|$|R
50|$|The undercroft of the {{building}} is predominantly natural ground but does include a small section of concrete pavement located directly under the stage area. A number of concrete plinths and associated <b>holding</b> down <b>bolts</b> indicate an element of some size was once secured to the floor.|$|R

5000|$|The building's 50-floor stylized Gothic {{octagonal}} brick tower, {{with elaborate}} Art Deco decorations of lightning bolts showing {{the power of}} electricity, grows out of the round-cornered base with elaborate masonry and architectural figural sculpture, to form [...] "one of the most expressive skyscrapers of its era." [...] The building was designed to blend with the low Byzantine dome of St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue and shares the same brick color, with terra cotta decorations chosen to coordinate. The crown of the building {{is an example of}} Gothic tracery, which is intended to represent electricity and radio waves, and is lit from within at night. On the corner above the building's main entrance is a clock with the cursive GE logo and a pair of disembodied silver arms <b>holding</b> <b>bolts</b> of electricity.|$|R
5000|$|The polybolos {{would have}} {{differed}} from an ordinary ballista {{in that it}} had a wooden magazine over the mensa (the cradle that <b>holds</b> the <b>bolt</b> prior to firing) capable of <b>holding</b> several dozen <b>bolts.</b> The mechanism is unique in that it is driven by a flat-link chain connected to a windlass; the flat-link chain is an invention more often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. When loading a new bolt, the windlass is rotated counter-clockwise with the trigger claw raised; this drives the mensa forward towards the bow string, where a metal lug pushes the trigger under the trigger claw, which is closed over the string.|$|R
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Trafford Council {{depicts a}} griffin on a shield flanked by two unicorns. The line {{bisecting}} the shield horizontally symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford {{from east to west}} and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist <b>holding</b> <b>bolts</b> of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|R
50|$|A quiver is a {{container}} for <b>holding</b> arrows, <b>bolts,</b> or darts. It {{can be carried}} on an archer's body, the bow, or the ground, {{depending on the type}} of shooting and the archer's personal preference. Quivers were traditionally made of leather, wood, furs, and other natural materials, but are now often made of metal or plastic.|$|R
5000|$|S9 - Similar to the Goncz Armament GS-9, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the <b>bolt</b> <b>hold</b> open; there was no <b>bolt</b> <b>hold</b> open on any Goncz Armament model. A model marketed as a [...] "sub-compact" [...] (although this is misleading as it is far from being subcompact) with a 5" [...] threaded barrel capable of receiving various attachments. These include a threaded barrel protector, a smooth 3" [...] barrel extension, a ribbed 3" [...] barrel extension, and a shrouded extension. Ostensibly, a silencer could also be attached, but there are none available for the thread type.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} was renovated in 1997 {{when it was}} found that <b>bolts</b> <b>holding</b> the cladding had rusted through. It now houses offices, shops and a health club. The health club uses the original basement swimming pool.|$|R
50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a spring bolt lock because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common spring bolt lock uses a spring to <b>hold</b> the <b>bolt</b> in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|R
50|$|In 1974 {{the number}} of <b>bolts</b> <b>holding</b> the {{flywheel}} increased from 6 to 8 {{and the size of}} the connecting was increased. From 1975 the thread standard changed from SAE to Metric as Volvo switched over with the new 200 series.|$|R
50|$|One {{wall of the}} dam {{currently}} {{features the}} world's highest artificial climbing wall. A German manufacturer of climbing holds installed a line of over 650 artificial <b>holds</b> and <b>bolts.</b> The course covers a vertical distance of 165 meters, going {{from the base of}} the dam to the top. The climb must be done as a sport climb, in multiple pitches. Furthermore, the lowest holds were placed several meters above the ground to deter casual visitors from climbing on them.|$|R
5000|$|A vault door, {{much like}} the smaller {{burglary}} safe door, is secured with numerous massive metal bolts (cylinders) extending from {{the door into the}} surrounding frame. <b>Holding</b> those <b>bolts</b> in place is some sort of lock. The lock is invariably mounted on the inside (behind) of the difficult to penetrate door and is usually very modest in size and strength, but very difficult to gain access to from the outside. There are many types of lock mechanisms in use: ...|$|R
5000|$|When W. Greener died in 1869, his son W.W. Greener merged the two {{companies}} into one. His next patent was the self-acting striker, followed by a famous cross-bolt mechanism produced as a single top bolt, in 1865. In 1873, this cross-bolt mechanism was combined with the bottom <b>holding</b> down <b>bolts</b> to produce the [...] "Treble Wedge-Fast" [...] breech action. The treble wedge-fast {{was one of the}} strongest breech actions ever invented and was widely copied by other manufacturers, after the patent rights expired.|$|R
