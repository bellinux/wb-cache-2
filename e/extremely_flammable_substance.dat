50|$|According to the United States National Association of Rocketry (nar) Safety Code, model rockets are {{constructed}} of paper, wood, plastic and other lightweight materials. The code also provides guidelines for motor use, launch site selection, launch methods, launcher placement, recovery system design and deployment and more. Since the early 1960s, {{a copy of}} the Model Rocket Safety Code has been provided with most model rocket kits and motors. Despite its inherent association with <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>substances</b> and objects with a pointed tip traveling at high speeds, model rocketry historically {{has proven to be a}} very safe hobby and has been credited as a significant source of inspiration for children who eventually become scientists and engineers.|$|R

50|$|A BLEVE {{need not}} be a {{chemical}} explosion—nor does there need to be a fire—however if a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> is subject to a BLEVE it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as skin friction. This heating can cause a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> to ignite, adding a secondary explosion caused by the primary BLEVE. While blast effects of any BLEVE can be devastating, a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> such as propane can add significantly to the danger.|$|R
