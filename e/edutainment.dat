5|$|Frog Fractions is a 2012 browser game {{developed}} by Twinbeard Studios, a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford. The game, released on October 25, 2012, {{has been described}} as a spoof of the <b>edutainment</b> game genre. In the game, the player begins by controlling a frog to eat bugs and defend fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in fractions, but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.|$|E

In 1982, Sierra had released a text-only game on the Apple II titled Softporn Adventure (it was the only text adventure that was released by a company which had established its name on providing a graphical alternative to such games). In 1986, after Sierra lost a Disney license, Al Lowe suggested that Sierra remake Softporn Adventure with the improved tools now at their disposal, and Ken Williams agreed.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Brain Age 2 is an <b>edutainment</b> {{video game}} that offers the player several minigames to play. Before the game begins, the player must create a profile, after which Brain Age Check runs three random tests to {{determine}} the player's brain age, which ranges from 20 to 80 and depends on the player's test performance. The brain age determines approximately the responsiveness of the player's brain; a brain age of 20, the lowest age that the player can achieve, indicates that the player's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20-year-old. Once the player is told their initial brain age, three modes are unlocked: Quick Play, Daily Training, and Sudoku. In Quick Play, the player can practice {{with any of the}} available minigames without receiving a score. In Daily Training, the player can perform Brain Age Check to determine their updated brain age. They can also complete one of the available minigames, after which they are given a rating based on their performance. In Daily Training, the player can also play Virus Buster, a simplified version of Dr. Mario (1990) modified for mobile play. To let the player track their progress, the game saves daily statistics of the player's performance, which are shown in a graph. In the third mode, Sudoku, the player can solve one of a hundred Sudoku puzzles.|$|E

25|$|As Bandai {{specifically}} marketed its Pippin {{models as}} game consoles, {{many of the}} titles produced are games and entertainment software or <b>edutainment</b> software. However, unlike conventional gaming consoles, the Pippin has no dedicated graphics or sound processors. Because the Pippin platform is based on Macintosh system software, graphic services such as 2D and 3D QuickDraw are made available to developers. Early on, Apple encouraged hardware developers to produce 3D rendering hardware so that the RISC processor could be free to tend to other processing. MPEG codec is {{not supported by the}} system software, as QuickTime is the only video format supported by the platform.|$|E

500|$|My French Coach and My Spanish Coach have {{received}} generally favorable reviews from several video game publications. On Metacritic, a website that compiles scores from various video game reviews, My Spanish Coach received a 73/100, based on seven reviews. In {{a review of}} the DS versions of both games, IGN called them a [...] "great learning experience" [...] and a more entertaining alternative to traditional methods of learning French and Spanish such as [...] "ours of boring exercises and outdated videos". Eurogamer claimed the games were not substitutes for proper language lessons, but admitted that [...] "as tools for improving your language skills, whether you're starting from scratch or have some basic knowledge, they're great". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My French Coach, Nintendo World Report called the game [...] "not be the hottest game to ever sit in your DS, but it is an unusually polished product that achieves the <b>edutainment</b> holy grail – it makes learning easy and fun". During the 2007 Christmas holiday season, video game retailer GameStop recommended My Spanish Coach for [...] "The Academic Gamer". My Spanish Coach led all Nintendo DS games in sales during the week of August 15, 2008 to August 21, 2008.|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Alain Lieury, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, indicates that working on exercises with a pencil and paper is {{just as good as}} Brain Age 2 at stimulating the memory. After evaluating ten-year-old children, the survey found [...] "no evidence to support claims in Nintendo's advertising campaign, featuring Nicole Kidman, that users can test and rejuvenate their grey cells". Lieury finds Brain Age 2 acceptable as a game, but considers it charlatanism for Nintendo to claim it as a scientific test, countering the company's assertions that its <b>edutainment</b> products such as Big Brain Academy and Brain Age 2 can improve blood flow to the brain and supposedly improving [...] "practical intelligence". Regarding whether or not brain training games are effective, Graham Lawton of New Scientist wrote, [...] "All things considered, it's hard not to conclude that brain training has been proven to work—under certain circumstances. [...] It's also worth pointing out that no study has shown that brain training makes cognitive abilities any worse." [...] Lawton notes that Nintendo avoids providing evidence that its Brain Age series actually leads to noticeable improvements in brain functions, and that it instead [...] "is careful not to claim that Brain Age is scientifically validated, merely stating that it is an entertainment product 'inspired' by [...] work." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by LucasArts subsidiary spin-off Lucas Learning. The company had originally been created to produce consumer products, but was reimagined as a developer of direct-to-school curriculum products {{in the fall of}} 1998. This marked George Lucas' first foray into the <b>edutainment</b> space. Star Wars DroidWorks was the premiere title of Lucas Learning, and one among a series of Star Wars games to be released their new sweep of <b>edutainment</b> titles. The title was also one out of 175 created by third party software developers for the newly launched iMac platform. [...] Lucas' directive to the company was to design a game that would allow players the freedom to explore and create like Erector Sets and Legos. The initial concept was thought up by project leader Collette Michaud. who pitched a game where players could design their own Star Wars droid and watch them animate.|$|E

In the film, Timon and Pumbaa are chopping down trees and clogging up rivers to build the Hakuna Matata Lakeside Village. Simba comes to them and explains how their actions are harmful to nature. This lesson is explained with live-action footage, some left over from Symbiosis.|$|E
2500|$|IGN rated Paint Studio at 7.0 ("Good") out of 10. [...] Peer Schneider {{described}} it as a powerful, affordable, and easy-to-use 2D and 3D content creation tool unmatched by other video game consoles although minimally comparable to personal computer applications. He likens it to an <b>edutainment</b> version of Adobe Photoshop for children, and a good neophyte introduction to the Internet. He considers Paint Studio to embody Nintendo's originally highly ambitious plans for 64DD, and to thus suffer greatly due to the cancellation of most Paint Studio-integrated disk games and the application's incompatibility with cartridge-based games.|$|E
2500|$|He {{found the}} Mario Artist series (especially the 64DD's [...] "killer app", Talent Studio) to be uniquely {{compelling}} in creative ways that [...] "couldn't {{be done on}} any other gaming console on the market", utilizing the disks' writability and [...] " [...] CD systems behind". As a flagship title for the platform, IGN found Paint Studios well-made art creation functionality to be both a low-cost paint program, and <b>edutainment</b> akin to an Adobe Photoshop for kids. He noted that If the platform hadn't been abruptly canceled, Nintendo supposedly would have utilized Paint Studio {{as a source of}} user-generated art content throughout a notable library of 64DD-compatible games.|$|E
2500|$|The Madeline {{video game}} assets were passed around to various {{companies}} during {{the turn of}} the millennium. In 1999, the company name of The Learning Company was changed briefly to Mattel Interactive, which published not only educational games, but licensed titles from brands like Barbie. After suffering significant losses, Mattel sold The Learning Company in 2000 at a loss to Gores Technology Group, a privately held international acquisition and management firm, for a share of what the firm could sell the assets for. In 2001, <b>edutainment</b> development company Riverdeep Group acquired the education assets of The Learning Company from Gores Technology Group for $40 million in stock, while assuming $20 million in liabilities as inter-company debt. By 2002, Encore Software, a privately held publisher of home entertainment and education, had acquired the exclusive publishing rights for the Madeline properties and re-released the software under its own brand name. In that same year, distribution company Navarre Corporation purchased Encore for $7 million in cash while acquiring $2.75 million in debt. Having worked with Encore since the company's inception in 1995, Navarre saw this as a [...] "move to strengthen its position in the video game market." [...] In 2006, Riverdeep acquired Houghton Mifflin, becoming Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group. In 2007, Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group bought Harcourt Education assets from Reed Elsevier for $4 billion, with the resulting company called Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is the current owner of the Madeline video game license while either Navarre Corporation holds the publishing rights or they reverted to HMH after the games went out of print. HMH has not attempted to resurrect the series, unlike other similarly acquired <b>edutainment</b> assets like Broderbund's Carmen Sandiego, which saw its latest release in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Debbie Maria Leon of the New Straits Times {{said that}} [...] "there's {{so much to}} learn in this...fun, upbeat <b>edutainment</b> title" [...] and that [...] "each case is unique and {{challenging}} and offers a wealth of knowledge". She added that [...] "the high level of interactivity makes [...] very engaging" [...] and advises players not to [...] "rush through the game [...] the thrill is in exploring for clues and making sense of them". She concludes by saying [...] "a myriad of clickable items are lurking in every scene, waiting to unleash just some more interesting and intriguing information". Karen Campbell of The Christian Science Monitor wrote [...] "There's a bit {{of trial and error}} involved when clues are not immediately apparent. It can get tedious for adults, but children, for whom the tactic is a natural part of learning, don't seem to mind".|$|E
2500|$|The {{games in}} the Madeline series have a point and click interface, which players use to {{navigate}} {{through a series of}} static screens, interact with characters, and manipulate objects to complete tasks and to overcome obstacles at a comfortable speed. The gameplay was compared to other <b>edutainment</b> games, such as Big Thinkers, [...] Fisher-Price video games, [...] JumpStart, and [...] Reader Rabbit. The Madeline games revolve around educational minigames in various subjects, including reading comprehension, mathematics, problem-solving, and cultural studies, targeted for children. The games are thorough and informative, yet have an easy to use, straight-forward design. The interface varies {{over the course of the}} series. While Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show and Madeline's European Adventures were designed to look and play like interactive storybook adventure games, others such as Madeline Thinking Games were designed as a series of activities within the game. Madeline European Adventures requires players to search across each screen in a first person view, similar to the game Myst.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the Madeline series {{takes place}} either in Madeline's {{boarding}} school or the surrounding neighborhood. The two exceptions are Madeline European Adventures, which includes France, Italy, Switzerland, and Turkey, and Madeline 1st and 2nd Grade Math, {{which focuses on}} the Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay. While Madeline 1st and 2nd Grade Reading {{is set in the}} boarding school, Madeline and the player can also travel to Italy and Egypt through a magical attic. Throughout the series, Madeline is tasked with helping several characters achieve their goals. The series includes original artwork, emulating watercolor painting, for the backgrounds and full animation. For instance, Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show contains 30 background scenes and over 10,000 frames of original animation. The TV series' theme song, is featured {{at the beginning of each}} game. American author Annie Fox, who had previously co-created the <b>edutainment</b> Putt-Putt series [...] also contributed to the development of the Madeline games.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} demoed at the 1998 Macworld Expo. In June 1998, The Washington Times {{reported}} {{the game was}} set to be released on Macintosh and PC in September of that year. It would eventually be released on October 21, 1998. The game was made available directly to schools, along with other <b>edutainment</b> titles by Lucas Learning. In March 1999, the game was [...] "currently available wherever software is sold". In June 1999, the game was noted as being sold at two-store specialty groups. The game was marketed and packaged as an entertainment title, and was advertised in gaming magazines and Family PC. While the developers thought the game blurred the line between entertainment and education, this originally presented an issue for the marketers as {{they had to make}} a decision whether to place the game on the clearly divided [...] "game" [...] and [...] "education" [...] shelves; it helped that Lucas Learning were able to leverage LucasArts' success and the Star Wars name to get into retail stores such as Walmart and Costco.|$|E
2500|$|The Madeline {{video game}} series {{has been widely}} praised by many {{commentators}} as {{an excellent example of}} <b>edutainment,</b> well thought out, carefully designed and effective in teaching youth. Joe Chidley wrote in Maclean's that the storyline of Madeline European Adventures is [...] "simple... and silly without being stupid", offering some [...] "engaging... fanciful, surprise-filled" [...] moments for children and [...] "chuckle" [...] for parents. It was praised for making its educational content subtly entertaining for children [...] It also was praised for teaching children valuable life skills, such as using different currencies and acquiring a passport and for helping develop creative writing skills. The series was also praised for its foreign language teaching strategies for young people, being one of only a few games that helped children with language learning. Other reviewers added that the games would expose young American children to the European culture and stimulate further inquiry. Some reviewers also felt that the series improved over time due to the increased amount of activities and educational minigames in later releases.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, {{there was}} a [...] "conspicuous absence" [...] of {{interactive}} <b>edutainment</b> software aimed at young girls, however by 1998 there were 65 titles for this demographic. Although many of these games (including those of Mattel, Polaroid, Hasbro, and Disney) were accused of reinforcing negative stereotypes by having themes such as pink, makeovers, jewelry, ponies, and kitchens, Katie Hafner of The Chicago Tribune and The New York Times wrote that the Madeline series, along with American Girls, achieved the [...] "lofty goal" [...] of providing young players with content that was [...] "carefully designed [...] thoughtful", managing to be popular while [...] "present players with some intellectual substance." [...] The Orlando Sentinel suggested that [...] "the success of Barbie software... encouraged other software makers {{to come out with}} their own programs just for girls", such as Creative Wonders' Madeline. Creative Wonders product manager Jennifer Rush called Madeline [...] "a good role model" [...] with [...] "an assertive, spunky personality and... a logical fit in the interactive world." [...] Rush attributed the decision to center a series of educational games on the character as an attempt to reach young girls who are [...] "often ignored by multimedia developers." [...] She explained that the games fulfilled the [...] "real opportunity in multimedia to develop titles that appeal to girls", emphasizing that [...] "girls tend to want more of a storyline." [...] Holly Smevog, producer of software at Creative Wonders, said that girls are drawn to [...] "story lines, real-life situations, hands-on experiences and developing relationships with characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Creative Wonders (also {{known as}} ABC/EA Home Software until 1 June 1995), a {{multimedia}} software joint venture of Electronic Arts Inc. and Disney unit Capital Cities/ABC Multimedia Group, {{was founded in}} Redwood City, California in December 1994 to develop software for the children's market {{in an attempt to}} [...] "dovetail... with Disney's overall corporate strategy", utilize the [...] "creative, marketing, and distribution muscle of its partners", and cultivate a strong brand identity that was synonymous with product quality. ABC contributed a [...] "video archive and production expertise", while EA brought its [...] "software development experience and retail distribution system." [...] Michael Pole, Creative Wonders' director of development and an executive producer, [...] "supervised the development of children's product lines based on such well-known properties" [...] as Madeline. In 1993, he saw an opportunity for a [...] "recognised, franchizable property which could be marketed to girls in the 7-12 year old age bracket" [...] to enter the <b>edutainment</b> space. [...] Creative Wonders' president Greg Bestick envisioned an educational brand that would [...] "excite the emotions, stimulate learning, and provide entertaining, yet valuable lessons." [...] Starting from the 1939 publication of Ludwig Bemelmans' eponymous book, the Madeline franchise and its protagonist still remained popular decades after its release. By 1995, Madeline had become a [...] "cultural icon", and a [...] "widely licensed character in dolls, games and videos" [...] and was [...] "internationally recognized" [...] alongside Sesame Street characters such as Elmo, and Schoolhouse Rock's Lucky Sampson. DIC Entertainment had bought the Madeline content rights from Bemelmans in 1993 and had since produced the successful Madeline TV series for Home Box Office and The Family Channel. Michael Pole approached DIC to acquire the electronic rights to the Madeline franchise and secured the license for a [...] "low, up-front fee (plus royalties)" [...] in exchange for an assurance that their premiere video game title would [...] "contain the highest quality design elements". Interactive Publishers Handbook asserts that Creative Wonders performed a [...] "'song & dance' negotiation" [...] in which they convinced DIC of the benefit of a licensing agreement despite a [...] "short term lower cash infusion"; this was a three-pronged argument of: having an association with multimedia software of award-winning caliber, branding the Madeline name into a new multimedia market, and receiving free collateral publicity for DIC's television show via Creative Wonders' marketing campaign for their premiere title. Blasko felt that the video game project achieved [...] "synergy" [...] by being an interactive media extension of the animated adaptation of Madeline; the games were in made in association with The Incredible World of DiC. Interactive Publishers Handbook said the low upfront fee was a necessity as contemporary licensing fees for branded media characters ranged from $100,000-$250,000, while production budgets for high-end children's <b>edutainment</b> titles ranged from $400,000-$700,000, and the six figure licensing fees would have made it difficult for Creative Wonders to stay profitable while maintaining high production values. It highlighted the deal as a prime example of a publisher and licenser partnering up to [...] "produce a top-notch title in a cost-effective manner" [...] and sharing back-end royalties once the products hit the shelves, suggesting that high licensing fees would have been unbeneficial to both parties. Louis Roitblat was vice president of marketing at Creative Wonders, who [...] "directed his team on product line strategies for many successful brands including...Madeline".|$|E
2500|$|Brøderbund Software’s {{marketing}} strategy {{aimed at a}} target demographic: [...] "young parents who have a computer at home and want their kids to learn while playing". To do this, it created <b>edutainment</b> titles with [...] "entertaining graphics and sound", beta-tested them with kids to ensure they were easy to use, and had deals with retailers like Best Buy and Babbages. An MHHE document entitled Marketing’s Role within the Firm or Nonprofit Organization explained [...] "retailers are happy to give new Brøderbund products shelf space {{because they know that}} Brøderbund’s promotion will help bring customers into the store". In the case of Great Chase Through Time, Brøderbund [...] "not only placed ads in family-oriented computer magazines but also sent direct-mail flyers to its registered customers". Due to brand loyalty, Carmen Sandiego games were able to be sold for more money than software from other companies. Parents appreciated that it [...] "caters to their needs and offers good customer value". The Mirror held a promotion where they would give away 10 copies of the video game through The A List. The game was included in the TLC School Alliance, which saw its titles being sold at discount at theNSBA Conference in Nashville and the California CUE Conference in Santa Clara. James Lyband Jackson, Computer Education Coordinator for both the YWCA/Day Care and the Church, included the [...] " [...] hands-on history" [...] program as part of their education program. The School Edition of the game came with a three-ring binder to hold the software, a User's Guide, a custom-developed Teacher's Guide, and the resource book World History Simulations by Max W.
