40|$|Transfer of {{electrons}} from the cytosol of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) root cells to extracellular acceptors such as ferricyanide and FeIIIEDTA causes a rapid depolarization of the membrane potential. This effect is most pronounced (30 - 40 millivolts) with root cells of Fe-deficient plants, which {{have an increased}} capacity to reduce extracellular <b>ferric</b> <b>salts.</b> Ferrocyanide has no effect. In the state of ferricyanide reduction, H+ (1 H+/ 2 electrons) and K+ ions are excreted. The reduction of extracellular <b>ferric</b> <b>salts</b> by roots of Fe-deficient bean plants is driven by cellular NADPH (Sijmons, van den Briel, Bienfait 1984 Plant Physiol 75 : 219 - 221). From this and from the membrane potential depolarization, we conclude that trans-plasma membrane electron transfer from NADPH is the primary process in the reduction of extracellular <b>ferric</b> <b>salts...</b>|$|R

Since the flocculants used {{in the water and}} wastewater plants {{have been shown to be}} potentially hazardous for the human health, it has become necessary to find flocculants less dangerous and more eco-friendly. This thesis consists of a systematic study to investigate the applications of natural submicron capsules (oil-bodies) and proteins extracted from oleaginous seeds for water treatment. Submicron capsules were extracted from different oleaginous sources and their flocculation activity has been investigated and characterized. We showed that they possess flocculation activity for clay suspensions comparable or even higher than the standard flocculants as alum and <b>ferric</b> <b>salts.</b> Moreover, the capsules have been tested for their ability to remove a range of pharmaceuticals from water. The investigation of oleaginous seed materials was further extended to the extraction of soluble proteins from press-cakes, the by-product of seeds after oil extraction. Thus, the flocculation activity of extracts from several press-cakes has been tested and compared to conventional flocculants, for example, alum and <b>ferric</b> <b>salts.</b> Finally, since lab-scale flocculation tests are usually off-line, in order to improve this methodology an on-line quantification method was developed.
