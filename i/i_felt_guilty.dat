500|$|At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting, it was {{discussed}} whether the rule should be eliminated {{as a solution}} to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, [...] "If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful." [...] He also expressed his concern for defencemen, [...] "It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen...

2500|$|Firemen {{frequently}} pitched two- or three-inning outings to earn saves. The modern closer, {{reduced to}} a one-inning role, is available to pitch more save opportunities. In the past, a reliever pitching three innings one game would be unavailable to pitch the next game. Gossage had more saves {{of at least two}} innings than saves where he pitched one inning or less. [...] "The times I did a one-inning save, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> about it. It's like it was too easy", said Gossage. ESPN.com wrote that saves have not been determined to be [...] "a special, repeatable skill—rather than simply a function of opportunities". It also noted that blown saves are [...] "non-qualitative", pointing out that the two career leaders in blown saves—Gossage (112) and Rollie Fingers (109)—were both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Fran Zimniuch in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball wrote, [...] "But {{you have to be a}} great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, [...] saved many, many more than he did not save." [...] More than half of Gossage's and Fingers' blown saves came in tough save situations, where the tying run was on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of their blown tough saves, they entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save. [...] The pitchers need to get out of the initial situation and pitch additional innings with more chances to lose the lead. A study by the Baseball Hall of Fame found modern closers were put into fewer tough save situations compared to past relievers. The modern closer also earned significantly more [...] "easy saves", defined as saves starting the ninth inning with more than a one-run lead. The study offered [...] "praise to the combatants who faced more danger for more innings." ...|$|E

I forget if I said that while we were waiting at the gate where those silly women talked so much nonsense about Mameena and Kaatje, that I made another effort through Goza to get into touch with the wizard, but quite without avail. Goza only answered what he said before, that if I wished to die at once I had better take ten steps towards the Valley of Bones, whence, he added parenthetically, the Opener of Roads had already departed on his homeward journey. This {{might or might not}} be true; at any rate I could find no possible way of coming face to face with him, or even of getting a message to his ear. No, I was not to blame; I had done all I could, and yet in my heart <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>guilty.</b> But then, as cynics would, say, failure is guilt.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{also worth}} {{stressing}} that ISTDP, unlike traditional psychodynamic therapies, assiduously avoids interpretation {{until such time}} as the unconscious is open. The use of trial interpretations is explicitly avoided. The phase of interpretation only commences once it is clear to both therapist and patient {{that there has been a}} passage of previously unconscious emotion. Quite often, it is then the patient who takes the lead in interpreting: [...] "The incredible rage <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> toward you when you refused to let me off the hook regarding my feelings is exactly the same rage that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> toward my father when I was five years old and found out he had been killed in the war and wasn't coming home.

60|$|One evening about a {{week after}} the death I went out upon the veranda of the hotel to get a book that I had left there. Under some vines {{shutting}} out the moonlight from a part of the space I saw Richard Benning, for whose apparition I was prepared by having previously heard the low, sweet voice of Eva Maynard, whom also I now discerned, standing before him with one hand raised to his shoulder and her eyes, as nearly as I could judge, gazing upward into his. He held her disengaged hand and his head was bent with a singular dignity and grace. Their attitude was that of lovers, and as I stood in deep shadow to observe <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> even <b>guiltier</b> than on that memorable night in the wood. I was about to retire, when the girl spoke, and the contrast between her words and her attitude was so surprising that I remained, because I had merely forgotten to go away.|$|R

I was still with Dean at the time, and he heard the song and knew it was about and me before I did." [...] With [...] "Borrowed", Rimes stated, [...] "Obviously, it was a very controversial topic to write about...As hard as it was for me to write the song, I think it painted a true picture of that situation.

Hugueny, however, was barely three months past her seventeenth birthday and [...] "This beautiful, genteel innocent not only was a virgin when I married her, but had never been on a date". The May wedding took place [...] "on the grounds of a romantic carriage house on La Colina in Beverly Hills.

[...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue.

In his words he stated [...] "... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> as ever, and sometimes could not close my eyes for hours after I had got home to my bed, on account of the guilt I had contracted the evening before.
