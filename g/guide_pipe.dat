Materials and Methods: We created a device composed of a flexible drill unit and a <b>guide</b> <b>pipe</b> unit. The flexible drill unit was made of flexible multifilament wires (1. 2 mm in diameter) that was twisted into one cord {{so that it can}} flex in any direction and a drill bit (1. 2 mm in diameter) that is attached onto one end of the flexible wire. The <b>guide</b> <b>pipe</b> unit was a 150 mm long metal pipe (2. 0 mm in inner diameter and 3. 0 mm in outer diameter), with one end bent to 30 degrees. The flexible drill set was inserted into the shoul-der joint through the posterior portal of the joint. The <b>guide</b> <b>pipe</b> component was placed onto the medial wall of the glenoid so that the pipe was placed 5 mm posterior to the margin of the anterior glenoid rim. The flexible drill was driven through the glenoid by the power drill so that holes were made in the gle-noid. A non- absorbable suture was passed through the hole. Tying of a sliding knot tying was accom-plished over the capsule and labrum after making a stitch through the capsule and labrum with a suture hook loaded with suture passer.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} reflectivity {{method is}} proposed for measuring flow resistivity of porous materials having rigid frame. The flow resistivity of porous material {{is defined as}} the ratio between the pressure difference across a sample and the velocity of flow of air through that sample per unit cube. It is important as one of the several parameters required by acoustical theory to characterize porous materials like plastic foams and fibrous or granular materials. The proposed method is based on a temporal model of the direct and inverse scattering problem for the diffusion of transient low-frequency waves in a homogeneous isotropic slab of porous material having a rigid frame. This time domain model of wave propagation was initially introduced by the authors [Z. E. A. Fellah and C. Depollier, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 107, 683 (2000) ]. The viscous losses of the medium are described by the model devised by Johnson [D. L. Johnson, J. Koplik, and R. Dashen, J. Fluid. Mech. 176, 379 (1987) ]. Reflection and transmission scattering operators for a slab of porous material are derived from the responses of the medium to an incident acoustic pulse. The flow resistivity is determined from the expression of the reflection operator. Experimental and numerical validation results of this method are presented. A <b>guide</b> (<b>pipe)</b> is used in the experiment for obtaining a plane wave. This method has the advantage of being simple, rapid, and efficient.

40|$|Guided waves {{inspection}} is {{a well-established}} method for the long-range ultrasonic inspection of <b>pipes.</b> <b>Guided</b> waves, {{used in a}} pulse-echo arrangement, can inspect a large range of the pipe from a single point as the pipe structure carries the waves over a large distance due to the relatively low attenuation of the wave modes. However, {{the complexity of the}} dispersion characteristics of these <b>pipe</b> <b>guided</b> wave modes are well known, and can lead to difficulty interpreting the obtained results. The torsional family of guided wave modes are generally considered to have much simpler dispersion characteristics; especially the fundamental T(0, 1) mode, which is nominally non-dispersive, making it particularly useful for guided wave inspection. Torsional waves have been generated by a circumferential ring of transducers to approximate an axi-symmetric load to excite this T(0, 1) mode. Presented here is a new design of EMAT that can generate a T(0, 1) as a single transducer, rather than a circumferential array of transducers that all need to be excited in order to generate an axisymmetric force. The EMAT consists of a periodic permanent magnet array and a single meander coil, meaning that the excitation of the torsional mode is greatly simplified. The design parameters of this new EMAT are explored, and the ability to detect notch defects on a pipe is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Sensitive {{millimeter}} wave diagnostics need {{often to}} be protected against unwanted radiation like, for example, stray radiation from high power Electron Cyclotron Heating applied in nuclear fusion plasmas. A notch filter based on a waveguide Bragg reflector (photonic band-gap) may provide several stop bands of defined width within up to two standard waveguide frequency bands. A Bragg reflector that reflects an incident fundamental TE 11 into a TM 1 n mode close to cutoff is combined with two waveguide tapers to fundamental waveguide diameter. Here the fundamental TE 11 mode is the only propagating mode {{at both ends of}} the reflector. The incident TE 11 mode couples through the taper and is converted to the high order TM 1 n mode by the Bragg structure at the specific Bragg resonances. The TM 1 n mode is trapped in the oversized waveguide section by the tapers. Once reflected at the input taper it will be converted back into the TE 11 mode which then can pass through the taper. Therefore at higher order Bragg resonances, the filter acts as a reflector for the incoming TE 11 mode. Outside of the Bragg resonances the TE 11 mode can propagate through the oversized waveguide structure with only very small Ohmic attenuation compared to propagating in a fundamental waveguide. Coupling to other modes is negligible in the non-resonant case due to the small corrugation amplitude (typically 0. 05 ·λ 0, where λ 0 is the free space wavelength). A Bragg reflector for 105 and 140 GHz was optimized by mode matching (scattering matrix) simulations and manufactured by SWISSto 12 SA, where the required mechanical accuracy of ± 5 μm could be achieved by stacking stainless steel rings, manufactured by micro-machining, in a high precision <b>guiding</b> <b>pipe.</b> The two smooth-wall tapers were fabricated by electroforming.

40|$|Laser Doppler {{velocimetry}} (LDV) {{measurement and}} large eddy simulation (LES) {{were used to}} study confined isothermal turbulent swirling flows in a model dump combustor. The aim was to gain {{deeper understanding of the}} flow and turbulence structures in dump combustors and to examine the capability of LES for prediction of turbulent swirling flows. A refractive index matching technique is used in the LDV measurement to improve the near-wall data. A high-order finite difference scheme on Cartesian grids with a scale-similarity subfilter scale model is used in the LES. Turbulent inflow boundary conditions with different energy spectra, different outflow boundary conditions, and grid resolutions are tested in the LES. Three test cases with different swirl numbers and Reynolds numbers are studied in the measurements and the simulations. The Reynolds numbers range from 10 000 to 20 000, and the swirl number is varied from 0 to 0. 43. With appropriate inflow, outflow boundary conditions, and fine grid resolution, the LES results are in fairly good agreement with the LDV data. The experimental and numerical results show that turbulence in the dump combustor is highly anisotropic behind the sudden expansion and in the internal recirculation zone near the axis of the combustor. Turbulence decays rapidly along the streamwise direction downstream, and the structure of turbulence depends highly on the level of inlet swirl. At low swirl numbers, turbulence is primarily generated in the shear layer behind the sudden expansion; at high swirl numbers the near axis flow becomes very unstable and vortex breakdown occurs. The shear layer near the axis of the combustor caused by vortex breakdown generates most of the turbulent kinetic energy. Large-scale motions (coherent structures) are found in the near axis vortex breakdown region. A helical flow in the <b>guiding</b> <b>pipe</b> breaks down near the sudden expansion to form a large bubble-like recirculation zone whose center moves slowly around the axis. Downstream of the bubble the core of the rotational large scale azimuthal flow motion is off the combustor axis and rotates around the axis at a frequency about 18 - 25 Hz (Strouhal number about 0. 17 - 0. 4). As the swirl number increases the coherent structure becomes more evident, and the internal recirculation zone moves upstream. LES successfully simulated the vortex breakdown, the internal recirculation zones and the anisotropic turbulence structures for all the swirl numbers considered.

40|$|The {{magnetostrictive}} {{guided wave}} technology as a non-contact measurement can generate and receive guided waves {{with a large}} lift-off distance up to tens of millimeters. However, the lift-off distance of the receiving coil would affect the coupling efficiency from the elastic energy to the electromagnetic energy. In the existing magnetomechanical models, the change of the magnetic field in the air gap was ignored since the permeability of the rod {{is much greater than}} that of air. The lift-off distance of the receiving coil will not affect the receiving signals based on these models. However, the experimental phenomenon is in contradiction with these models. To solve the contradiction, the lift-off effect of receiving the longitudinal mode <b>guided</b> waves in <b>pipes</b> is investigated based on the Villari effect. A finite element model of receiving longitudinal <b>guided</b> waves in <b>pipes</b> is obtained based on the Villari effect, which takes into account the magnetic field in the pipe wall and the air zone at the same time. The relation between the amplitude of the induced signals and the radius (lift-off distance) of the receiving coil is obtained, which is verified by experiment. The coupling efficiency of the receiver is a monotonic decline with the lift-off distance increasing. The decay rate of the low frequency wave is slower than the high frequency wave. Additionally, the results show that the rate of change of the magnetic flux in the air zone and in the pipe wall is the same order of magnitude, but opposite. However, the experimental results show that the error of the model in the large lift-off distance is obvious due to the diffusion of the magnetic field in the air, especially for the high frequency guided waves...|$|R

The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending. This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as lay-barge construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature - despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support.
