50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>lock</b> is a {{portable}} security device for motorcycles and scooters. Disc-locks use {{the holes in}} a motorcycle's or scooter's brake disc. A locking pin passes {{through the hole in}} the brake disc and locks to the other side of the lock, using either a pushdown-and-click locking mechanism or a more robust double-locking mechanism. When in place, the disc-lock discourages theft by blocking the vehicle from being moved in either forward or reverse direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} freewheel device {{consists of}} two saw-toothed, spring-loaded discs pressing against each other with the toothed sides together, somewhat like a ratchet. Rotating in one direction, the saw teeth of the drive <b>disc</b> <b>lock</b> with {{the teeth of the}} driven disc, making it rotate at the same speed. If the drive disc slows down or stops rotating, the teeth of the driven disc slip over the drive disc teeth and continue rotating, producing a characteristic clicking sound proportionate to the speed difference of the driven gear relative to that of the (slower) driving gear.|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{progressive}} rising prices of international gasoline, cost-conscious consumers promote the demand of internal motorcycles. With the technological advance and increasing requests of safety, the disc brakes gradually become the standard equipment in the new generation; therefore, the disc locks {{are more and more}} popular due to convenience and good to storage. However, the motorcycle thieves ’ skills are increasingly superb, the convenient disc locks have an Achilles ’ heel on strength. This design project of B-LOCKi utilizes double-headed disc locks to restrain the action of the front wheel, in order to prevent the destruction to disc locks when the motorcycle speeds up. In this way, the anti-theft feature of disc locks could be improved to solve the easily damage problem of disc locks which is criticized by users for a long time. We have developed six available concepts of disc locks, which were evaluated with AHP, Pugh and grey relational analysis to select the optimal one. 2 The results showed that in the same standards, grey relational analysis, fuzzy synthetic decision approach and Pugh method all received the same result, so it proved the reliability and robust of grey relational analysis.

In system B, the thread of the screw locked directly into the device. The stability of the connection was tested by measuring the resistance against a torque on the screw, against shear loading, against push-out loading, and against dynamic shear loading (70 N) for 5 million cycles. Both systems met the required minimum values for the resistance against a torque, shear loading and push-out loading, and dynamic shear loading did not cause movements between the screw and the device. We conclude that both systems are stable, but prefer system B because it is easier to make and implant than system A...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{photometric}} study of I-band {{variability in the}} young cluster IC 348. The main {{purpose of the study}} was to identify periodic stars. In all we find 50 periodic stars, of which 32 were previously unknown. For the first time in IC 348, we discover periods in significant numbers of lower-mass stars (M 0. 25 M⊙) showing a bi-modal period distribution concentrated around periods of 2 and 8 days, and the lower-mass stars showing a uni-modal distribution, heavily biassed towards fast rotators. Closer inspection of the period distribution shows that the higher mass stars show a significant dearth of fast rotators, compared to the Orion Nebula Cluster, whilst the low mass stars are rotating significantly faster than those in Orion. We find no correlation between rotation period and K − L colour or Hα equivalent width. We also present a discussion of our own IC 348 data in the context of previously published period distributions for the Orion Nebula Cluster, the Orion Flanking Fields and NGC 2264. We find that the previously claimed correlation between infrared excess and rotation period in the ONC might in fact result from a correlation between infrared excess and mass. We also find a marked difference in period distributions between NGC 2264 and IC 348, which presents a serious challenge to the <b>disc</b> <b>locking</b> paradigm, given the similarity in ages and disc fractions between the two clusters.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{photometric}} study of I-band {{variability in the}} young association Cepheus OB 3 b. The study is sensitive to periodic variability on time-scales of less than a day, to more than 20 d. After rejection of contaminating objects using V, I, R and narrow-band Hα photometry, we find 475 objects with measured rotation periods, which are very likely pre-main-sequence members of the Cep OB 3 b star-forming region. We revise the distance and age to Cep OB 3 b, putting it on the self-consistent age and distance ladder of Mayne & Naylor. This yields a distance modulus of 8. 8 ± 0. 2 mag, corresponding to a distance of 580 ± 60 pc, and an age of 4 – 5 Myr. The rotation period distribution confirms the general picture of rotational evolution in young stars, exhibiting both the correlation between accretion (determined in this case through narrow-band Hα photometry) and rotation expected from <b>disc</b> <b>locking,</b> and the dependence of rotation upon mass that is seen in other star-forming regions. However, this mass dependence is much weaker in our data than found in other studies. Comparison to the similarly aged NGC 2362 shows that the low-mass stars in Cep OB 3 b are rotating much more slowly. This points to a possible link between star-forming environment and rotation properties. Such a link would call into question models of stellar angular momentum evolution, which assume that the rotational period distributions of young clusters and associations can be assembled into an evolutionary sequence, thus ignoring environmental effects...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} a general, steady-state {{model for the}} torque on a magnetized star from a surrounding accretion disc. For the first time, we include the opening of dipolar magnetic field lines due to the differential rotation between the star and disc, so the magnetic topology then depends {{on the strength of}} the magnetic coupling to the disc. This coupling is determined by the effective slip rate of magnetic field lines that penetrate the diffusive disc. Stronger coupling (i. e., lower slip rate) leads to a more open topology and thus to a weaker magnetic torque on the star from the disc. In the expected strong coupling regime, we find that the spin-down torque on the star is more than an order of magnitude smaller than calculated by previous models. We also use our general approach to examine the equilibrium (`disc-locked') state, in which the net torque on the star is zero. In this state, we show that the stellar spin rate is roughly an order of magnitude faster than predicted by previous models. This challenges the idea that slowly-rotating, accreting protostars are <b>disc</b> <b>locked.</b> Furthermore, when the field is sufficiently open (e. g., for mass accretion rates > 5 x 10 ^{- 9 } M_sun / yr, for typical accreting protostars), the star will receive no magnetic spin-down torque from the disc at all. We therefore conclude that protostars must experience a spin-down torque from a source that has not yet been considered in the star-disc torque models [...] possibly from a stellar wind along the open field lines.

5000|$|Around {{the middle}} of the 19th century, [...] "Scandinavian" [...] style locks, or [...] "Polhem locks", invented by the eponymous Swedish {{inventor}} Christopher Polhem, became a more secure alternative to the prevailing smokehouse and screw locks. These locks had a cast iron body that was loaded with a stack of rotating disks. Each disk had a central cutout to allow the key to pass through them and two notches cut out {{on the edge of the}} <b>disc.</b> When <b>locked,</b> the <b>discs</b> passed through cut-outs on the shackle. The key rotated each disk until the notches, placed along the edge of each tumbler in different places, lined up with the shackle, allowing the shackle to slide out of the body. The McWilliams company received a patent for these locks in 1871.

40|$|I have {{investigated}} the role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signalling in the control of ommatidial orientation. Both over- and under-activation of the pathway lead to significant defects in ommatidial orientation, while leaving the polarity of ommatidial unaffected. This previously unrecognised function of EGFR signalling further adds to the multiple functions of the pathway in Drosophila eye development. I {{have shown that the}} initial rotational event proceeds normally in EGFR pathway mutants, but that orientation becomes disrupted later in development, leading to the severe adult phenotypes seen. It is unclear which of the EGFR ligands is responsible for mediating its function in rotation: both Keren and Spitz may be important. At present, no mutant exist in keren. I have conducted a P element excision screen in an attempt to generate a keren mutant; characterisation of potential mutants is still ongoing. Hopefully, this will allow resolution of the question as to which ligand activates EGFR signalling to control orientation, and will also allow analysis of other potential functions of Keren. Very {{little is known about the}} cell biological processes underlying ommatidial rotation. As a first step towards gaining some insight into the mechanism by which ommatidial orientation is achieved, I {{have investigated}} a possible role for E-cadherin in this process. E-cadherin interacts genetically with EGFR signalling in rotation; however, it remains unclear whether cadherin-based adhesion has a primary function in the control of ommatidial orientation. I propose a model for the role of EGFR signalling in ommatidial orientation, in which the pathway acts in the 3 rd instar <b>disc,</b> to <b>lock</b> ommatidial in place once they have reached their appropriate positions; in the absence of such a lock, ommatidial orientation can become disrupted during the remodelling of the larval disc into an adult eye.

40|$|My {{expertise}} is in developing patentable user centred design solutions and this investigation focussed on solving {{how to improve}} the loading and securing of the barbell weights for users during aerobic exercise routines. The inability to load and lock the free weights is caused by disc rotation, which disrupts the users exercise routines and can cause health and safety issues through tripping and falling over. This disruptive problem frequently occurs for users who participate in multiple person exercise routines that involve barbell and dumbbell activities in fitness centres and gyms. This systematic user centred investigation, supported by patent evaluations and ergonomic product testing, has generated an entirely new anti-roll barbell design and locking system. Through ethnographic research and user testing a D-shape <b>disc</b> and bar <b>locking</b> system was developed that addressed the limitations of existing solutions, eliminating all disc rotation.

It has also resulted in an entirely new visual identity within this category of product.
