5000|$|... 1-Butyne, {{also known}} as ethylacetylene, but-1-yne, ethylethyne, and UN 2452, is an <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> and {{reactive}} alkyne with chemical formula 46 and CAS number 107-00-6 that {{is used in the}} synthesis of organic compounds. It occurs as a colorless gas.|$|R
50|$|Isopropyl nitrate is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> {{and burns}} with a {{practically}} invisible flame. This presents unique hazards in its handling. The flame is significantly less luminous than hydrogen or methanol flame {{and is only}} visible due to the turbulent hot air it generates.|$|R
5000|$|Lime sulfur {{reacts with}} strong acids (including stomach acid) to produce highly toxic {{hydrogen}} sulfide (rotten egg gas) and indeed usually {{has a distinct}} [...] "rotten egg" [...] odour to it. Lime sulfur is not <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> but combustion produces highly irritating sulfur dioxide gas.|$|R
50|$|When Arizona white oaks {{are small}} they usually die by fire. The acorns are usually killed by fires as well. The foliage is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> but larger trees usually survive fires {{that are not}} as severe and if a stump survives a fire it will sprout rapidly after its survival.|$|R
50|$|Methoxyethane, {{also known}} as ethyl methyl ether, is an ethyl group with a bonded methoxy. Methoxyethane is a colorless gaseous ether with a medicine-like odor. It is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> and its {{inhalation}} may cause asphyxiation or dizziness. As a Lewis base, it can react with Lewis acids to form salts and reacts violently with oxidizing agents.|$|R
50|$|Though not <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> in gaseous form, 1,1-difluoroethane {{can burn}} under some conditions. As such, {{there is also}} a warning label present on some gas dusters. When {{inverted}} to spray liquid, the boiling fluorocarbon aerosol is easily ignitable, producing a very large blast of flame and extremely toxic gases such as hydrogen fluoride and carbonyl fluoride as combustion products.|$|R
50|$|There {{is little}} {{research}} on Nysted reagent {{because of the}} hazards and high reactivity {{and the difficulty of}} keeping the reagent stable while it is in use. More specifically, it can form explosive peroxides when exposed to air and is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable.</b> Also, it reacts violently with water. These make this reagent very dangerous to work with.|$|R
2500|$|Methane is flammable, {{explosive}} {{and dangerous}} to inhale, {{because it is}} a colorless, odorless gas, special caution must be taken around methane. [...] Ethane is also <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> dangerous to inhale and explosive. Both of these may cause suffocation. Similarly, propane is flammable and explosive. [...] It may cause drowsiness or unconsciousness if inhaled. Butane has the same hazards to consider as propane.|$|R
50|$|Diethyl ether has {{the unfortunate}} {{disadvantage}} of being <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> {{especially in the}} presence of enriched oxygen mixtures. This property has resulted in many instances of fires and even explosions in operating rooms during surgery. This is among the most important reasons that diethyl ether has fallen out of favor as a general anesthetic. Diethyl ether is still commonly used as a solvent and reagent in organic chemistry laboratories, though with caution.|$|R
50|$|The {{importance}} of firestopping of nuclear facilities was {{manifested in the}} Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant fire, a fire resulted from combustion of <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> polyurethane foam. This led to control, communications and telemetry/data links between the control room and the reactor core being severed, causing the operators to {{no longer be able}} to exercise control over the nuclear reactor. By design, staff were able to use other controls to safely shut down the reactor.|$|R
25|$|As a {{toxic gas}} that leaves no residue on items it contacts, {{ethylene}} oxide is a surface disinfectant that {{is widely used}} in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes. It is so <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> and explosive that it {{is used as a}} main component of thermobaric weapons; therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid to control its hazardous nature.|$|R
50|$|Assisted natural {{regeneration}} (ANR) {{is the human}} protection and preservation of natural tree seedlings in forested areas. Seedlings are, in particular, protected from undergrowth and <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> plants such as Imperata grass. In addition to protection efforts, new trees are planted when needed or wanted (enrichment planting). With ANR, forests grow faster than they would naturally, resulting in {{a significant contribution to}} carbon sequestration efforts. It also serves as a cheaper alternative to reforestation due to decreased nursery needs.|$|R

50|$|Isopentane, C5H12, {{also called}} {{methylbutane}} or 2-methylbutane, is a branched-chain alkane with five carbon atoms. Isopentane {{is an extremely}} volatile and <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> liquid at room temperature and pressure. The normal boiling point {{is just a few}} degrees above room temperature and isopentane will readily boil and evaporate away on a warm day. Isopentane is commonly used in conjunction with liquid nitrogen to achieve a liquid bath temperature of −160 °C. It is 1% or less of natural gas.|$|R
50|$|Nitrate {{film base}} {{was the first}} {{transparent}} flexible plasticized base commercially available, thanks to celluloid developments by John Carbutt, Hannibal Goodwin, and Eastman Kodak in the 1880s. Eastman {{was the first to}} manufacture this for public sale, in 1889. Unfortunately, nitrate also had the drawback that it was <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> (being essentially the same chemically as guncotton) and decomposed after several decades into a no less flammable gas (leaving the film sticky and goo-like) and ultimately into dust.|$|R
5000|$|Mantis {{was able}} to remix Groot's sap in {{a way as to}} make it <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> and again Groot died for the team, this time by purposefully igniting so the {{resulting}} fire would destroy the Babel Spire. A cutting of Groot was kept by Rocket Raccoon, though, and Groot was again able to regrow. Groot then joined the new Guardians of the Galaxy (or, as Groot would have it, [...] "Groot and Branches"), and began regrowing under the care of Mantis.|$|R
50|$|The Huron National Forest {{is prone}} to {{frequent}} seasonal forest fires, due to ecological and geological factors including the domination of the jack pine in sections the forests, the needles of which are <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> sandy soil composition {{as a result of}} glacial outwash plain geology of sections of the Huron National Forest, and jack pine barrens management practices to create nesting habitat for the Kirtland's warbler resulting in dense, young stands of jack pine that are extremely susceptible to crowning wildfires.|$|R

PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL HAZARDS When sprayed on a naked flame or any incandescent material the aerosol vapours can be ignited. Aerosol containers can explode when heated, due to excessive pressure build-up. 3 COMPOSITION/INFORMATION ON INGREDIENT...|$|R
50|$|Propane (R290) is an {{eco-friendly}} refrigerant with outstanding thermodynamic propertiies. The pressure {{requirements for}} R290 {{are much less}} than for carbon dioxide, but R290 is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable.</b> Research has demonstrated that MicroGroove is suitable for R290-charged room air conditioners because the refrigerant charge requirement is dramatically reduced with smaller diameter copper tubes. The risk of tube explosions is dramatically reduced as well. Research conducted with propane in MicroGroove has implications for heat exchanger coils used in refrigerators, heat pumps and commercial air conditioning systems.|$|R
50|$|Open flame {{should never}} be used to melt the propellant, and the mix should always be heated in an oil bath, never over direct heat. This is to avoid hot spots causing {{auto-ignition}} or caramelization and degradation of the propellant. Preparing rocket candy in a microwave oven is very dangerous because localized hotspots can ignite. Because rocket candy is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> it should be prepared in small batches, out of doors or in an outbuilding, and using adequate personal protective equipment (eye protection at the very least).|$|R
5000|$|Hydrogen is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable.</b> Some {{countries}} have banned {{the use of}} hydrogen as a lift gas for commercial vehicles but it is allowed for recreational free ballooning in the US, UK and Germany. The Hindenburg disaster is frequently cited {{as an example of}} the hydrogen safety risks posed by hydrogen. The high cost of helium (compared to hydrogen) has led researchers to re-investigate the safety issues of using hydrogen as a lift gas: with good engineering and good handling practices, the risks can be significantly reduced.|$|R
50|$|Ethylene oxide is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> and its {{mixtures}} {{with air}} are explosive. When heated it may rapidly expand, causing fire and explosion. The Autoignition temperature is 429 °C, decomposition temperature of 571 °C at 101.3 kPa, minimum inflammable {{content in the}} air is 2.7%, and maximum limit is 100%. The NFPA rating is NFPA 704. Ethylene oxide in presence of water can hydrolyze to ethylene glycol and form poly ethylene oxide which then eventually gets oxidized by air and leads to hotspots that can trigger to explosive decomposition.|$|R
50|$|Chloromethane, {{also called}} methyl chloride, Refrigerant-40, R-40 or HCC 40, is a {{chemical}} compound {{of the group}} of organic compounds called haloalkanes. It was once widely used as a refrigerant. It is a colorless <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> gas with a mildly sweet odor. Due to concerns about its toxicity, it is no longer present in consumer products.Chloromethane was first synthesized by the French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot in 1835 by boiling a mixture of methanol, sulfuric acid, and sodium chloride. This method is similar to that used today.|$|R
50|$|The TLV {{value for}} 3-pentanone is 200 ppm (705 mg/m3). 3-pentanone can be {{hazardous}} {{if it comes}} {{in contact with the}} skin or eyes, and can cause irritation of the skin and redness, watering, and itching of the eyes. This chemical can also cause nervous system or organ damage if ingested. Although considered stable, 3-pentanone is <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> if exposed to flame, sparks, or another source of heat. For safety, it should be stored in a flammable materials cabinet away from heat or sources of ignition, preferably in a cool, well-ventilated area.|$|R
