5|$|Gheerbrant et al. {{concluded}} that the early presence of Ocepeia in Africa, and its specialized features indicate {{a long history of}} diversification in Africa, which supports <b>hypotheses</b> of endemic evolution of Afrotheria and placental mammals in Africa, in contrast to <b>hypotheses</b> supposing they originated from Laurasia, the northern supercontinent comprising much of present-day North America, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The fungal <b>hypotheses</b> is also {{compatible}} {{with some other}} established AD <b>hypotheses,</b> like the amyloid hypothesis, that can be explained as an immune system response to an infection in the CNS, as found by R. Moir and R. Tanzi in mouse and worm models of AD.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypothesis</b> {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{as the principal}} instrument in research. It {{plays a major role}} in research. Its main function is to suggest new experiments and observations. It occupies a very small space in the thesis. A researcher cannot proceed in the research work without formulating one or more than one <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> brings clarity, specificity and focus to a research problem. There are two types of <b>hypothesis</b> which are called the Null <b>Hypothesis</b> and the Alternative <b>Hypothesis.</b> There are four steps in <b>hypothesis</b> testing. After getting the results, the researcher tests whether the collected facts support the <b>hypothesis</b> formulated or not. There exist a number of statistical tools like t-test, F-test, chi-square test, D-W test, etc., to test the validity of <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> testing shows whether the <b>hypothesis</b> should be accepted or rejected. It has been rightly said that “You torture the data until they confess”. This paper include the introduction, steps of <b>hypothesis</b> testing, function of <b>hypothesis</b> and testing of <b>hypothesis...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The null <b>hypothesis</b> is a <b>hypothesis</b> {{set up to}} {{be tested}} against an {{alternative}}. Thus the counternull is an alternative <b>hypothesis</b> that, when used to replace the null <b>hypothesis,</b> generates the same p-value as had the original null <b>hypothesis</b> of “no difference.” ...|$|R
25|$|As such, {{the only}} <b>hypothesis</b> {{that needs to}} be {{specified}} in this test and which embodies the counter-claim {{is referred to as the}} null <b>hypothesis</b> (that is, the <b>hypothesis</b> to be nullified). A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the null <b>hypothesis.</b> That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if the null <b>hypothesis</b> is assumed to be true. The rejection of the null <b>hypothesis</b> implies that the correct <b>hypothesis</b> lies in the logical complement of the null <b>hypothesis.</b> However, unless there is a single alternative to the null <b>hypothesis,</b> the rejection of null <b>hypothesis</b> does not tell us which of the alternatives might be the correct one.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{competing}} <b>hypotheses</b> about the ultimate {{fate of the}} Universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse <b>hypotheses,</b> in which the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.|$|E

5|$|Three {{competing}} <b>hypotheses</b> {{have been}} proposed regarding the dynasty to which Sheshi belonged.|$|E
25|$|What statisticians call an {{alternative}} <b>hypothesis</b> {{is simply a}} <b>hypothesis</b> that contradicts the null <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Hypothesis</b> is {{very often}} {{inevitable}} in research activities. <b>Hypothesis</b> is {{of at least}} three kinds, each of which should not be confused. A study trying to measure the relationship between variables can predict the finding based on theory or logical common sense. This prediction is called theoretical <b>hypothesis.</b> In testing <b>hypothesis</b> quantitatively, the theoretical <b>hypothesis</b> should be transformed into statistical <b>hypothesis,</b> which takes the form of Null <b>hypothesis</b> and its alternatives. It is the Null <b>hypothesis</b> that is to be tested to justify its rejection or otherwise its acceptance. In qualitative study, the result of first data analysis is called temporal empirical <b>hypothesis</b> that should be validated with more data. This cycle of rechecking the result with more data is done again and again until the <b>hypothesis</b> becomes the final conclusion...|$|R
5|$|Although many <b>hypotheses</b> {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} {{ketogenic}} diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven <b>hypotheses</b> include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the major}} {{defining}} characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin {{has been the subject}} of much speculation. Four major <b>hypotheses</b> have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.|$|E
5|$|Earlier <b>hypotheses</b> of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some {{hypothesized}} the flu {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C. Hannoun, leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur, asserted the former virus {{was likely to}} have come from China, mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders. He considered several other <b>hypotheses</b> of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E

(2006), as for becoming object from this research is manufacturing business which located in Cenral of Java Indonesia. This research represent the empirical test which used random sampling techniques in data collection. Data were collected using a survey of 93 Top Managers, Production Managers and Operational Managers from manufacturing organizations in Central Java, Indonesia. Data analysis uses Structural Equation Model (SEM) with the program SmartPLS (Partial Least Square). Result of <b>hypothesis</b> Examination indicate that from seven <b>hypothesis</b> raised, there is five accepted <b>hypothesis.</b> Accepted <b>Hypothesis</b> is <b>hypothesis</b> 1 (there are influence between Management Practices to Infrastructure Practices), <b>hypothesis</b> 3 (there are influence between Infrastructure Practices to Operational Performance), <b>hypothesis</b> 5 (there are influence between Core Practices to Operational Performance), <b>hypothesis</b> 6 (there are influence between Core Practices to Financial Performance), <b>hypothesis</b> 7 (there are influence between Core Practices to Product Quality).

30|$|To {{describe}} the process qualitatively and quantitatively statistically, null <b>hypothesis</b> (H o) is defined assuming {{that it is}} true. An alternative <b>hypothesis</b> (H a) is defined {{at the same time}} keeping in view that alternative <b>hypothesis</b> is accepted, if the null <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected or vice-versa. Level of significance, the maximum value of the probability to reject the null <b>hypothesis,</b> is defined before testing the <b>hypothesis</b> (Kaushal and Singh 2016 a).|$|R
5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were <b>hypotheses</b> about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such <b>hypotheses</b> {{ought to be the}} subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E
5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different <b>hypotheses</b> have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These <b>hypotheses</b> are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} <b>hypotheses</b> have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a {{snorkeling}} function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact <b>hypotheses</b> based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction <b>hypotheses,</b> and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.|$|E
30|$|In {{the third}} <b>hypothesis,</b> {{resilience}} {{is found to}} have positive significant effects on project success (β[*]=[*]. 35, p-value[*]<[*] 0.01) thus <b>hypothesis</b> 3 is accepted. While the <b>Hypothesis</b> 4 predicted that optimism is positively related to project success and the findings proved this <b>hypothesis</b> as (β[*]=[*]. 31, p-value[*]<[*] 0.01). So, <b>hypothesis</b> 4 is accepted.|$|R
50|$|Richard Simon of Normandy in 1689 {{asserted}} that an Aramaic or Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, lay behind the Nazarene Gospel, {{and was the}} Proto-Gospel. J. J. Griesbach treated this as {{the first of three}} source theories as solutions to the synoptic problem, following (1) the traditional Augustinian utilization <b>hypothesis,</b> as (2) the original gospel <b>hypothesis</b> or proto-gospel <b>hypothesis,</b> (3) the fragment <b>hypothesis</b> (Koppe); and (4) the oral gospel <b>hypothesis</b> or tradition <b>hypothesis</b> (Herder 1797).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the problems of}} anomaly detection and localization from noisy tomographic data. These are characteristic of a class of problems which cannot be optimally solved because they involve <b>hypothesis</b> testing over <b>hypothesis</b> spaces with extremely large cardinality. Our multiscale <b>hypothesis</b> testing approach addresses the key issues associated with this class of problems. A multiscale <b>hypothesis</b> test is a hierarchical sequence of composite <b>hypothesis</b> tests which discards large portions of the <b>hypothesis</b> space with minimal computational burden and zooms in on the likely true <b>hypothesis.</b> For the anomaly detection and localization problems, <b>hypothesis</b> zooming corresponds to spatial zooming [...] -anomalies are successively localized to finer and finer spatial scales. The key challenges we address include how to hierarchically divide a large <b>hypothesis</b> space and how to process the data at each stage of the hierarchy to decide which parts of the <b>hypothesis</b> space deserve more [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The rise of {{molecular}} techniques {{at the end}} of the 20th century prompted new evolutionary <b>hypotheses</b> that were different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results {{of molecular}} studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for <b>hypotheses</b> about extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that molecular data supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but not into the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree. In addition, there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades, only molecular differences.|$|E
