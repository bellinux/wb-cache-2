50|$|The Blue Line's Type I LRVs are {{numbered}} sequentially from 101 through 127. The Flexity Swift vehicle is an articulated design with three car-body sections, {{referred to as}} the A, B and C sections. The markings on the ends of LRVs indicate the vehicle number and section. For example, car 114 is marked 114A on one end and 114B on the other end. Vehicle numbers are also displayed (excluding the section letter) {{on the sides of the}} C section, on the doors of the <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> and on the roof of the vehicle. Both ends of the vehicle have <b>operator</b> <b>cabs,</b> allowing trains of any length to be operated normally in either direction without the need to turn the train around. The pantograph is located on the B section of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The A and B {{cars were}} built from 1968 to 1971 by Rohr Industries, an {{aerospace}} manufacturing {{company that had}} recently started mass-transit equipment manufacturing. The A cars were designed as leading or trailing cars only, with an aerodynamic fiberglass <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> housing train control equipment and BART's two-way communication system, and extending 5 ft longer than the B- and C-cars. A and B cars can seat 60 passengers comfortably, and under crush load, carry over 200 passengers. B cars have no <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> and {{are used in the}} middle of trains to carry passengers only. Currently, BART operates 59 A cars and 389 B cars. The BART A cars have a larger cab window than the C cars, allowing riders to look out of the front or the back of the train.|$|R
2500|$|M8s {{are similar}} to the M7As running on the Harlem and Hudson lines. They each have two {{single-leaf}} doors on each side and a full-width <b>operator's</b> <b>cab,</b> eliminating the so-called [...] "railfan" [...] windows at the front and rear of each train and restricting passengers' ability to walk between car pairs.|$|R

50|$|Each car has an {{enclosed}} <b>operator</b> <b>cab</b> at each end. This allows the most flexible system for managing operations, but prevents travel between cars except at stations. Each car also has separate doors for station level and track level access. In normal operations the track level doors (equipped with stairs) are unused.|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{respirable dust}} surveys were {{conducted}} at six surface coal mines {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of dust control methods used on rotary rock drills and bulldozers. Dust controls commonly used on drills include a dry dust collection system, exhausting from a shrouded area around the collared hole, and an enclosed drill <b>operator</b> <b>cab,</b> filtering airborne dust from the cab. Bulldozers are also typically equipped with an enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cab</b> as a dust control measure. Airborne respirable dust sampling was conducted near each equipment's source of generation and inside its enclosed cab. Silica analysis {{was performed on the}} dust samples to determine the percent silica content in the dust generated at the six mining operations. An additional eight- month follow-up of dust sampling was also conducted in the enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> of several rock drills and bulldozers. Data were analyzed for long-term variability of accepted control methods to abate dust and silica levels. The highwall rock drill was the major and most variable dust source as compared to the bulldozer, generating dust levels, on average, one order of magnitude higher than dust levels of the bulldozer. Four of the six drills surveyed had dust containment and capture problems at the shrouded drill table above the lple. Repairs or modifications to three of the drill dust collection systems were shown to reduce dust levels by more that 50 % next to the shrouded drill table. The enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> provided more than 90 % and more than 40 % lower dust levels than at the dust source for the drill and bulldozer, respectively. Long-term sampling of several of these highwall drills and bulldozers showed that the dust levels in the drill cabs were frequently higher than 0. 2 mg/m 3 and more variable than in the bulldozers. The bulldozer dust levels were frequently below 0. 2 mg/m). Future research should focus on improving some of the deficiencies present in the drill's primary dust collection system, and developing quality control methods to ensure the integrity of enclosed cab protection for equipment operators...|$|R
25|$|Modified long-armed {{demining}} bulldozers {{are being}} used {{in a number of}} countries. They have the capability to remove vegetation before demining and can withstand antipersonnel and antitank landmines. Their long arms provide the benefit of reducing damage to the main body, especially to the <b>operator's</b> <b>cab.</b> Three inch (7.62cm) thick bulletproof glass protects the operator from directional mines.|$|R
50|$|The SLRVs {{are longer}} and can {{accommodate}} more passengers than the Kinki Sharyo-built vehicles {{from which they}} were developed, known by DART as its standard Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs), which had been operated by DART Light Rail since it began service in June 1996. DART's original LRVs were built as articulated, two-section cars with <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends.|$|R

50|$|A {{double-ended}} tram has an <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> {{and controls}} {{at each end}} of the vehicle, which allows it to easily be driven at full speed in either direction on a continuous segment of track. Typically at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of crossover points or Y-points. Conversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at terminani so that the <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and fewer door spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense.|$|R
50|$|In the USSR, {{just like}} in the DDR there were networks, which {{permitted}} a maximum width of vehicle of 2.20 m. Since those were too narrow for T3 and the factory in Gotha stopped its production, the T4s was sold as T4SU to the Soviet Union. Like the other CSU types, a closed <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> was included. No trailer cars were used.|$|R
5000|$|All TTC subway cars (except Line 3 Scarborough cars) are {{equipped}} with flip-up seats located in each car (near the <b>operator's</b> <b>cab),</b> which can accommodate mobility devices such as wheelchairs, strollers, scooters, and bicycles, the new Toronto Rocket trains have two designated areas in each car with automatic flip-up seats, although level boarding platforms allow a degree of access to all trains.|$|R
40|$|Enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> {{are widely}} used on mobile {{excavation}} equipment in the mining and construction industries. They protect the operator from bad weather, noise, and airborne dusts. The inside cab environment usually must be kept at very low dust concentrations because of quartz dust generated from the excavation of silica-bearing rock. Most cab designs achieve {{heating and air conditioning}} effectiveness by recirculating most of the interior cabin airflow, with a smaller portion of the outside air added to the cab as makeup air. Both the recirculated cab airflow and exterior makeup air added to the cabin should be efficiently filtered, with the makeup air positively pressurizing the <b>cab</b> interior. Ideally, <b>operator</b> <b>cab</b> air filters should provide at least 99 % capture efficiency for dust particles as small as 0. 3 microm aerodynamic diameters. These higher efficiency air filters provide good dust control for the equipment operator, but tend to accumulate dust more quickly than lower efficiency air filters.

50|$|A {{total of}} 140 cars were built.

50|$|Modern {{tractors}} have a ROPS {{to prevent}} an operator from being crushed if the tractor turns over. The ROPS does not prevent tractor overturns; rather, it prevents the operator from being crushed during an overturn. This is especially important in open-air tractors, where the ROPS is a steel beam that extends above the operator's seat. For tractors with <b>operator</b> <b>cabs,</b> the ROPS is partof {{the frame of the}} cab. A ROPS with enclosed cab further reduces the likelihood of serious injury because the operator is protected by the sides and windows of the cab.|$|R
