40|$|Many large {{universities}} {{have the luxury}} of well-developed computer science and software engineering programs that include team projects at several levels, from group work in an introductory data structures or software engineering course through a multi-course team project for an external client. In this paper, we will discuss our computer systems management curriculum that exposes students to large software engineering (analysis, design, programming, and user interface) projects within the time and budget constraints of a typical small college program. In the curriculum, we have two courses where students do full group design and analysis projects, Database Design and Systems Analysis. Other courses emphasize specific aspects of the software engineering process that tend to be impossible to experience in a limitedterm project. Finally, we have a capstone course where students use all that they have learned to develop systems on their own. Students are responsible for all phases of the capstone project, from recruiting a client and specifying the project through <b>delivery,</b> <b>documentation,</b> and client evaluation. 1...|$|E

Postal Service (USPS) is facing significant financial problems as mail volume is declining, 4. 5 percent in fiscal year 2008 and 11 percent projected for fiscal year 2009. USPS lost $ 2. 8 billion in fiscal year 2008 and projects a $ 6. 4 billion loss in fiscal year 2009 (possibly more if it cannot cut an ambitious $ 5. 9 billion in costs). As one way to cut costs, USPS is trying to improve the efficiency of mail delivery, which generates close to one-third of USPS's $ 78 billion in expenses. Recognizing the sizeable impact of delivery on USPS's finances and operations, you requested a GAO review. This report addresses (1) how USPS monitors delivery efficiency; (2) characteristics of delivery units that affect their efficiency; and (3) the status and results of USPS's actions to improve delivery efficiency, in particular USPS's Flats Sequencing System (FSS). To address these objectives, GAO interviewed stakeholders and USPS officials, reviewed <b>delivery</b> <b>documentation,</b> conducted fieldwork, and analyzed delivery data. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Poor {{medical record}} {{documentation}} remains a pervasive problem in hospital delivery rooms, hampering efforts {{aimed at improving}} the quality of maternal and neonatal care in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the feasibility and completeness of labor room documentation within a quasi-experimental study aimed at improving emergency preparedness for obstetric and neonatal emergencies in 8 nonteaching, subdistrict, secondary care hospitals of Karnataka state, India. Methods: We redesigned the existing open-ended case sheet into a structured, delivery record cum job aide adhering to principles of local clinical relevance, parsimony, and computerizability. Skills and emergency drills training along with supportive supervision were introduced in 4 “intervention arm” hospitals while the new delivery records were used in eight intervention and control hospitals. Results: Introduction of the new delivery record was feasible over a “run-in” period of 4 months. About 92 % (6103 of 6634) of women in intervention facilities and 80 % (6205 of 7756) in control facilities had their delivery records filled in during the 1 -year study period. Completeness of <b>delivery</b> record <b>documentation</b> fell into one of two subsets with one set of parameters being documented with minimal inputs (in both intervention and control sites) and another set of parameters requiring more intensive training efforts (and seen more in intervention than in control sites; P <. 05).

In the present study, we investigated {{the effect of}} a tablet-based application for real-time resuscitation documentation used by the emergency team leader on documentation quality and clinical performance of the emergency team. Methods Senior anaesthesiologists either used the tablet-based application during the simulated resuscitation for documentation and also used the application for the final documentation or conducted the full documentation {{at the end of the}} scenario using the local hospital information system. The latter procedure represents the current local documentation method. All scenarios were video recorded. To assess the documentation, we compared the precision of intervention <b>delivery</b> times, <b>documentation</b> completeness, and final documentation time. To assess clinical performance, we compared adherence to guidelines for defibrillation and adrenaline administration, the no-flow fraction, and the time to first defibrillation. Results The results showed significant benefits for the tablet-based application compared to the hospital information system for precision of the intervention delivery times, the final documentation time, and the no-flow fraction. We observed no differences between the groups for documentation completeness, adherence to guidelines for defibrillation and adrenaline administration, and the time to first defibrillation. Discussion In the presented study, we observed that a tablet-based application can improve documentation data quality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a well-designed application can be used in real-time by a member of the emergency team with possible beneficial effects on clinical performance.

A national archive of electronic resources will be created following the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model, developed by the Networked European Deposit Library (NEDLIB) programme. From the very start of the project, it was recognized that, due to the application of the OAIS model, a deposit library could benefit from the advantages of international standardization including the model of the archive, terminology and the conceptual framework. The OAIS model defines the environment surrounding the archive and the interactions between modules and subsystems within the existing system including cataloguing, bibliographic control and OPAC.

The project's roots are a belief that each individual present is involved in an event's conception, <b>delivery,</b> and <b>documentation,</b> making the environment, thus event, constantly evolving and fluid. The thesis and accompanying performances are based upon a definition of Environment informed by James J. Gibson's 'Theory of Affordances' and the creative (inter) relationships that form between the environment and an individual, that individual and other individuals, all as constituents of the environment. The project's focus upon individuals as environmental stimuli and what they afford draws upon the performance, or event, {{and its relationship to}} the everyday the meaning of a piece is derived from what people bring to it. Due to the concept of micro-narratives and the focus upon experience rather than a grand narrative and truth, those meanings are fluid. The project adopts a practice-led research methodology in order to develop principles of composition that revolve around notions of the centre and periphery of personal experience; spatial organisation; and disassociation and reappropriation: there were six events with a focus upon the implication of these ideas and their evolution into each event. Following observation of a poststructural emphasis upon personal experience and (subjective) micronarratives, rather than objective truth, a documentation strategy has been developed.

The act requires states and localities {{to create a more}} comprehensive workforce system for development needs. The act promotes partnerships among diverse programs and community representatives through participation on newly created state and local workforce investment boards and youth councils. GAO found that most youth councils nationwide included the required members and nearly all councils were active by July 2000. Local boards competitively chose youth service providers and developed strategies for one-stop centers. Most boards reported that services were provided through contracted service providers rather than one-stop centers. However, local boards had difficulty getting parents and youth to participate on youth councils. Some local areas found it difficult to identify and select youth service providers because of low response to requests for proposals. Getting youth to visit the typically adult-focused one-stop centers was also difficult. Youth councils linked with the education community by including representatives of local school districts and existing school-board career programs in their membership or as youth service providers. Moreover, secondary and postsecondary schools contracted to deliver mentoring and occupational skills training. Some educators, however, were hesitant to broaden their role in youth development beyond traditional academics and saw few financial incentives to partner with the youth council. GAO found three legislative requirements that impeded service <b>delivery.</b> First, eligibility <b>documentation</b> requirements may have excluded eligible at-risk youth from services.

In these cases the internal organization framework and distribution of work among different departments of construction company is increasingly important with the scale of construction project. Internal processes of construction project management, which are based upon the project management approach including the domain knowledge have to be well defined. Engaged experts have to perform their tasks in assigned processes following the defined quality, time and scope definitions of the processes. Performance of the activities has to be demonstrated and defined with adequate documents. For the management of construction project adequate internal documentation management framework is therefore essential. It is prepared by the experts working in different departments of construction company following the defined project line. It is following the main stages of project development: bidding process and contracting, project activation, project implementation and project closure with testing and final <b>delivery.</b> This internal <b>documentation</b> is closely interrelated with external documentation which is obtained mainly by the client. Internal documentation also has a role to amend the external documentation and correct its inconsistencies along with the project development, following {{at the same time}} contractual and legal requirements.

BIM has the potential to revolutionize the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry in terms of the positive impact it may have on information flows, working relationships between project participants from different disciplines and the resulting benefits it may achieve through improvements to conventional methods. This chapter reviews the development of BIM, the extent to which BIM has been implemented in Australia, and the factors which have affected the up-take of BIM. More specifically, the objectives of this chapter are to investigate the adoption of BIM in the Australian AEC industry and factors that contribute towards the uptake (or non uptake) of BIM. These objectives are met by a review of the related literature in the first instance, followed by the presentation of the results of a 2007 postal questionnaire survey and telephone interviews of a random sample of professionals in the Australian AEC industry. The responses suggest that less than 25 percent of the sample had been involved in BIM – rather less than might be expected from reading the literature. Also, of those who have been involved with BIM, there has been very little interdisciplinary collaboration. The main barriers impeding the implementation of BIM widely across the Australian AEC industry are also identified. These were found to be primarily a lack of BIM expertise, lack of awareness and resistance to change. The benefits experienced as a result of using BIM are also discussed. These include improved design consistency, better coordination, cost savings, higher quality work, greater productivity and increased speed of delivery. In terms of conclusion, some suggestions are made concerning the underlying practical reasons for the slow up-take of BIM and the successes for those early adopters. Prospects for future improvement are discussed and proposals are also made for a large scale worldwide comparative study covering industry-wide participant...|$|R

Both tasks are done with a work of negotiation and monitoring of suppliers, which are responsible of the development and the assessment. The large number of projects carried out in the department causes that we don't have an exhaustive control of these in which can do an observation of the <b>documentation,</b> <b>deliveries,</b> dates and costs. This problem leads to one of the parts of the project, which involves the creation of a tool that permits the management of the projects made. This tool is intended to have control of delays and cost overruns of the projects. On the other hand, in terms of developments, various problems arise caused by the high amount of these requested to the department, the fact that recently the major supplier has changed and also works with multiple suppliers. All this together causes we don't have a control of how is the situation in this area and thus makes work will accumulate and delivery date will not be met. In relation to this problem detected, the department needs another management tool which permits control and manage the developments. It aims to study the current amount of developments, the delays and other several factors of high interest. With both tools already in operation, we can get some objectives. In terms of projects, the situation in the current year, 2016, will be observed and compared with the situation in 2015 in order to reach measures to take to improve the working methodology that would lead to a reduction in delays and cost overruns. In terms of development, weekly studying the progress of these (delays, status, current amount, etc.), a number of measures will be taken in order to improve the realization of these...|$|R

The case studied, FMC Technologies, is located in Norway, but is part of a globalcompany. FMC has grown quickly, and solving issues with tacit knowledge and personalexperience, as was done earlier, is challenging. The unit of analysis within the organization isthe department of Well Access Systems (WAS). WAS is concerned with connecting subseawells to surface rigs or vessels. A typical project consists of complex subsea equipment forwork over and intervention of established wells. The research method is based on a constructive research design for analyzing the case(Lukka, 2003). The constructive research approach is a research procedure for developingconstructions that in turn can contribute to the theory connected to the field of research. Inaddition, constructive research relates to design science research, which according to Simon(1996) is concerned with devising artifacts, e. g. tools, techniques, and methods, to attaingoals. Constructive research is a form of prescriptive research aiming at improving theperformance of the case being studied. Furthermore, our approach is based on action research(Reason & Bradbury, 2008), as we have been working closely with FMC. During our exploratory study, we got a comprehensive view of the organization, as well asmanagement processes and tools. Within WAS, two tools are used to plan and follow up onengineering activities. However, the utilization of them does not seem satisfactory to ensure asmooth project execution. The tools are the well-established “Eplan” and the newly developed“PPM tool”. However, we have found that neither Eplan nor PPM tool are planning tools;they are merely progress reporting tools. The PPM tool is based on frequent progressreporting for each task, and Eplan is based on a few milestone dates within each task. ThePPM tool was implemented as Eplan does not include all engineering activities, only puredeliverables that are sent to the client. Consequently, Eplan does not capture the actual usageof hours or remaining hours, thus failing to visualize the actual status of projects. Further, theinitial planning, which serves as input for both tools, is performed at the startup of the project,usually without sufficient emphasis on the importance of “doing it right the first time”. Thus,inconsistent milestone dates 1 and infeasible resource allocations are frequent. In addition,activities are often planned in parallel with long durations and without dependency links. Consequently, on-time <b>delivery</b> (OTD) of <b>documentation</b> and drawings is found to be low atFMC. In March 2014, the OTD was as low as 38 % on average for all the ongoing projects. 1 Urgent activities are planned too late, and non-urgent activities are planned too early. IVProjects within the subsea oil and gas industry tend to be large-scale, and the financial impactof delays and deviations is significant (Kalsaas, 2013). Thus, increased predictability in thedesign and engineering phase may reduce the risk of potential outburst from the initial budget. However, {{due to the nature of}} the design process, planning serves as a challenging task. Traditionally, several planning strategies used in the design process are based on linearapproaches, such as “Stage Gate” and “Waterfall” (Kalsaas, 2013). In addition, complexprojects tend to perform concurrent engineering, i. e. a number of engineering activities areunderway simultaneously and the entire set of activities converges to the design solution atonce (Hoedemaker, Blackburn, & Van Wassenhove, 1999). Yet, traditional planningtechniques take little account of the interdisciplinary, iterative nature of the design process(Austin, Baldwin, Waskett, & Li, 1999). Inevitably, this leads to cycles of rework, known asnegative iterations (Ballard, 2000 b), as well as time and cost penalties in both design andfabrication. Against this background, iterative and inclusive methods for planning design andengineering, such as the Last Planner System (LPS), Critical Chain (CC) and Scrum, must besought in order to increase predictability and quality of the deliverables. The thesis presents aconstruct on how the initial planning and subsequent production control can be strengthenedby adapting ideas from these methods. Planning of design processes serves as a challenging task: the design emerges through acomplex process where solutions, and thus activities, evolve as the process progress (Ballard, 1999), i. e. reciprocal dependencies (Thompson, 1967 / 2003). The main idea of the framework,or construct, is to postpone the documentation and drawing phase to the end of the designphase. As such, the design can be fully completed before the production of documents anddrawings commences. Further, the two distinct phases can be handled separately, as illustratedin Figure 1. Today, the design and documentation are often conducted concurrently, thusleading to several parallel activities with long durations due to reciprocal dependenciesbetween them. With several designers and engineers working in parallel, this often results inrework, i. e. negative iterations, due to late changes and poor communication. Thus, it isimportant to freeze the design at some point, in order to make the documentation phase sound. Figure 1 : The design phase and the documentation and drawing phase. VThe first aspect to consider is the initial planning of the documentation and drawing phase. The main goal of the initial planning is to sequence the engineering activities in the rightorder to avoid both inconsistent delivery dates and parallel activities with unnecessary longdurations. The planning must be executed in accordance with the principles of collaborativeplanning in LPS, where different disciplines attend to unveil constraints and evaluate thebudgeted amount of hours. Based on ideas from CC, resources are allocated in advance toavoid parallel activities on individual resources. Further, the problem of infeasible resourceallocations is reduced, while the visibility is increased. The latter removes the necessity of thefrequent progress reporting done today, which further renders the PPM tool unnecessary. Today, parallel activities on individual resources must be reported frequently in order toforesee any off-track activities potentially threatening the delivery or to track cost measures,while sequential activities are more visible and easier to track, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2 : Parallel vs. sequential progress measurement. By structuring activities according to CC, the problems related to multitasking, StudentSyndrome, and Parkinson’s Law will be structurally mitigated (Koskela, Stratton, &Koskenvesa, 2010). Herroelen and Leus (2001) point out that multitasking is quite common inmulti-project environments where resources often have more than one significant taskrunning. However, such multitasking results in individuals who bounce back and forth,whereas the flow time in individual activities increases. Further, activities stretched over along period does not motivate the resource to go with full thrust from start, or even begin onthe task immediately after the start date, i. e. the Student Syndrome (Leach, 1999). Longdurations also affect Parkinson’s Law, stating that work expands to fill the time available(Shen & Chua, 2008). In accordance with CC, buffers are postponed to the end of each activity chain in order tovisualize off-track activities. Since several deliverables are subjected to an internal reviewbefore delivery to the client, we propose to add buffers at the end of these chains, asillustrated in Figure 3. The size of these buffers must be evaluated collaboratively at the initialplanning. No existing method seems satisfactory (Tukel, Rom, & Eksioglu, 2006) : however,VIShen and Chua (2008) point out that the soundness of the tasks should be of guidance, i. e. thedegree of prerequisite work serving as input. Figure 3 illustrates how the logical sequencingof tasks visualizes the upcoming activities for the resource and determines the start date. Theblue bars represent the budgeted amount of hours, while the internal review marks thedelivery date to client. Figure 3 : Sequencing of activities with postponed buffer. For progress measurement, each participating engineer reports progress in accordance withthe milestones in Eplan. Further, Eplan updates the Product Plans automatically, which servesas a holistic management tool to control cost, progress, and quality. As suggested by Shen andChua (2008), the CC framework acts as a linear controlling feature. This is also in accordancewith the addressed need of such system in LPS (Junior, Scola, & Conte, 1998; Kalsaas, 2013). However, as LPS demonstrates, planning and production control 2 are strongly related. Thus, besides the framework for initial planning and progress control, a proper frameworksecuring corrective actions is necessary. The principles of production control from LPS isimplemented complimentary to CC, to allow more detailed handling of assignments, flows,and constraints (Shen & Chua, 2008). This is also supported by Koskela et al. (2010), whosuggest weekly and daily planning across all tasks, as an extension of CC. We propose weeklyforward-looking meetings, where key personnel meet and evaluate upcoming activitiesspanning six weeks ahead. An important part of this meeting is to make sure that prerequisiteinputs are available, or that actions can be taken in advance of the scheduled startup dates, tomake tasks ready for execution (Hamzeh, Ballard, & Tommelein, 2008).
