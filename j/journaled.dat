25|$|Reiser and {{his company}} Namesys {{developed}} the <b>journaled</b> computer file systems ReiserFS and Reiser4. ReiserFS has been available in the Linux operating system since version 2.4.1 and has at times been the default filesystem on several Linux distributions including, until 2006, Novell's SUSE Linux Enterprise.|$|E
25|$|SCO {{has claimed}} {{a number of}} {{instances}} of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), <b>Journaled</b> File System (JFS), Read-copy-update (RCU) and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel, and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix.|$|E
2500|$|... ext3, {{or third}} {{extended}} filesystem, is a <b>journaled</b> file {{system that is}} commonly used by the Linux kernel. It is the default file system for many popular Linux distributions. Stephen Tweedie first revealed that {{he was working on}} extending ext2 in Journaling the Linux ext2fs Filesystem in a 1998 paper, and later in a February 1999 kernel mailing list posting. The filesystem was merged with the mainline Linux kernel in November 2001 from 2.4.15 onward. Its main advantage over ext2 is journaling, which improves reliability and eliminates the need to check the file system after an unclean shutdown. Its successor is ext4.|$|E

60|$|The cry passed on, and the banging. Lord Berkeley sprang {{out of bed}} {{and moved}} with all {{possible}} speed toward the clothes-press in the darkness and the gathering smoke, but fell over a chair and lost his bearings. He groped desperately about on his hands, and presently struck his head against the table and was deeply grateful, for it gave him his bearings again, since it stood close by the door. He seized his most precious possession; his <b>journaled</b> Impressions of America, and darted from the room.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper by}} {{applying}} Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) ranks Economics <b>journals.</b> In contrast {{with many other}} studies this paper ranks <b>journals</b> which are characterized as mainstream economic <b>journals</b> rather than interciplinary economic <b>journals.</b> By using one composite input and one composite output the paper ranks 180 <b>journals.</b> In addition {{for the first time}} three different quality ranking reports have been incorporated to the DEA modelling problem in order to classify the <b>journals</b> into four categories (‘A’ to ‘D’). The results reveal that the <b>journals</b> with the highest rankings in mainstream economics are <b>Journal</b> of Political Economy, Quarterly <b>Journal</b> of Economics, <b>Journal</b> of Economic Literature, Review of Economic Studies, American Economic Review, Econometrica, Review of Economics and Statistics, <b>Journal</b> of Economic Theory, <b>Journal</b> of Econometrics, Economic <b>Journal,</b> <b>Journal</b> of Monetary Economics, <b>Journal</b> of International Economics, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, International Economic Review, <b>Journal</b> of Development Economics, <b>Journal</b> of Economic Perspectives, <b>Journal</b> of Risk and Uncertainty and <b>Journal</b> of Public Economics. ...|$|R

50|$|Note {{that the}} {{configuration}} of the Ingres DBMS allows for the new tables to be automatically journal-enabled via the default journaling parameter. Some care should be taken with this facility as not all tables should be <b>journaled.</b> For example, a work table which is constantly emptied and refreshed should not be <b>journaled</b> as it places extra data in the journal system, data which are generally irrelevant to auditing and not required for database recovery.|$|E

There is also an [...] "inherit-journal" [...] attribute which when set on a directory causes all files (and sub-directories) created within that directory to have the journal (or inherit-journal, respectively) flag set. This can be used instead of the data=journal mount option which ext3 supports (and GFS/GFS2 doesn't).|$|E
