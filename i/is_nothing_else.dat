25|$|Descartes {{explains}} how {{he made a}} mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> in the essence of the self.|$|E
25|$|In the Roman Liturgy {{the office}} of Nones is {{likewise}} constructed after {{the model of the}} Little Hours of the day; it is composed of the same elements as in the Rule of St. Benedict, with this difference: that instead of the three psalms (125-127), the three groups of eight verses from Psalm 118 are always recited. There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> characteristic of this office in this liturgy. The hymn, which was added later, is the one already in use in the Benedictine Office—Rerum Deus tenax vigor. In the monastic rules prior to the 10th century certain variations are found. Thus in the Rule of Lerins, as in that of St. Caesarius, six psalms are recited at Nones, as at Terce and Sext, with antiphon, hymn and capitulum.|$|E

25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.|$|E
25|$|Because of his {{philosophical}} beliefs, René Descartes {{proposed in}} 1644 that no empty space can exist and that space must consequently {{be filled with}} matter. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with vortices. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to centrifugal force, matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater inertia—so due to {{the pressure of the}} condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed {{into the center of the}} vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

500|$|Modelling atomic {{behaviour}} under incident {{electromagnetic radiation}} using [...] "virtual oscillators" [...] at the absorption and emission frequencies, {{rather than the}} (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They {{led to the development}} of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".|$|E
500|$|Offa of Mercia, who reigned from 757 to 796, was the {{dominant}} force in Anglo-Saxon England {{in the second}} half of the eighth century. The relationship between Offa and Cynewulf, who was king of Wessex from 757 to 786, is not well documented, but it seems likely that Cynewulf maintained some independence from Mercian overlordship. Evidence of the relationship between kings can come from charters, which were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and which were witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land. In some cases a king will appear on a charter as a subregulus, or [...] "subking", making it clear that he has an overlord. Cynewulf appears as [...] "King of the West Saxons" [...] on a charter of Offa's in 772; and he was defeated by Offa in battle in 779 at Bensington, but there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to suggest Cynewulf was not his own master, and he is not known to have acknowledged Offa as overlord. Offa did have influence in the southeast of the country: a charter of 764 shows him in the company of Heahberht of Kent, suggesting that Offa's influence helped place Heahberht on the throne. The extent of Offa's control of Kent between 765 and 776 is a matter of debate amongst historians, but from 776 until about 784 it appears that the Kentish kings had substantial independence from Mercia.|$|E

500|$|Wolfenstein 3D {{was well}} {{received}} by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of Computer Gaming World praised the [...] "sparse [...] gorgeous", [...] "frighteningly realistic", and [...] "extremely violent" [...] graphics, {{as well as}} the [...] "immersive" [...] sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned [...] "those sensitive to such things to stay home". Lombardi concluded that Wolfenstein 3D, alongside Ultima Underworld released two months prior, was [...] "the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief–suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment", stating that they knew of no other game that could [...] "evoke such intense psychological responses from its players". Wolfenstein twice received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it [...] "definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC", highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the [...] "fast-paced action" [...] could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence. Sandy Petersen, in the first [...] "Eye of the Monitor" [...] column, claimed that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> quite like Wolfenstein" [...] and that it had [...] "evolved almost beyond recognition" [...] from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it [...] "a fun game with lots of action" [...] and [...] "a fun, fairly mindless romp", though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard. The Spear of Destiny retail episode was also rated highly by Computer Gaming Worlds Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes.|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story <b>is,</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
