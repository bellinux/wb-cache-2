On January 1, 2013, Tompkins created the first painting SLUT (#1). In an interview with Art in America, Tompkins says, [...] "People sent stories, too. They made comments. It was very personal.

The fellows which you mentioned in your letter I did not know but I was very glad to hear about them, you see they were 4 and 5 years behind me and I didn’t have much chance {{to get back to the}} doings at school after I left. It has been very nice weather here and once in a while we get some hot days but on the whole it has been very nice.

I hope it won’t be long until all the boys can return home and start life anew in a new and peaceful country. There is not much a fellow can write about here and therefore I hope you will excuse the short letter.

40|$|Transcription begins] “WEST POINT OF THE AIR” July 25, 1942 Dear Bryant Co-Ed: While {{going through}} some papers, I came across your letter of April 27 {{and decided to}} answer it late as it is. Having {{forgotten}} almost everything Mr. Naylor taught me about correspondence while I was at Bryant I will try to compose an interesting and reasonable letter. I am a lieutenant in the Air Corps and was assigned to Randolph Field as a flying instructor last May much against my will. When I received my wings I had visions of flying bombers in Australia but these have long since faded into the distance. My work here consists of teaching flying cadets to fly basic trainers and myself to fly the new fighting ships {{as fast as the}} Army receives them. In case you have ambitions of becoming a flying instructor, here is an accounting of a day’s work. At 8 : 00 A. M. (a reasonable hour) I go to the flying line and make a preflight inspection of my plane and any plane my students may fly. At 9 : 00 A. M. the eager! young! cadets arrive. Five are assigned and report to me. We have a little talk about what is expected of them and then start flying. I fly one hour with each student and spend about 15 minutes criticizing the student’s flight. By about 4 P. M. we are through flying unless night flying is scheduled. I give the planes their daily inspection and put them to bed. After spending about an hour making out students’ grade slips for the day’s work it is 6 P. M. and suppertime. We are then off until 8 P. M. when night flying starts. This is just a repetition of the day’s flying and usually lasts until 2 A. M. If no night flying is scheduled we teach ground school until about 10 P. M. We get time off every time weather does not permit flying. Otherwise the above schedule goes on seven days a week. For recreation I generally get about an hour’s swimming just before supper at the pool at the Officers’ Club which is pretty nice. You can tell my teachers at Bryant that I never knew what they were up against until I started teaching navigation, meteorology, etc. to these cadets. If you have a chance <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> showing this letter to Mr. Gulski. I am sure he will remember me as I was more trouble to him than most students. I also wish to express my thanks for the packages from the Bryant Service Club and the Bryant Alumni Bulletin which arrives frequently. Texas isn’t a very good place to spend the summer and work here is very monotonous. I would like to be back in New England where the temperature isn’t 100 - 110 ° almost every day. I think that if I am a good boy I may get a five day leave around Christmas. However, with all the flying regulations we have here {{it is very hard to}} behave myself considering my reckless nature. Twice so far I have been reprimanded for doing maneuvers which are considered bad examples to students. They will admit I am still alive so my flying must be safe enough. Please let me hear more about the happenings at Bryant and in Providence. Sincerely, Kirke Everson [Transcription ends...|$|E

Gosser Diagnostic Clinic 318 West Woodruff Ave. Toledo, Ohio 43602 Dear Dick: Your willingness to help our efforts on behalf of getting a medical school in Toledo is very much appreciated. Just for your information, I am enclosing a copy of the letter that was sent out in June in-viting various people in northwestern Ohio to serve on an area advisory committee. A copy of the news story lists the names of the people who accepted. We now are trying to get suggestions for additional members, and I would appreciate any names you could offer. Although we have included 22 northwestern Ohio counties in our list, we are most interested in the ones fairly close to Lucas [...] such as Fulton, Henry, Defiance, Wood, Ottawa, Sandusky, Hancock and Seneca. As I said, most members of the medical school Foundation favor the cigarette tax extension because we think it might make it easier for us to get state money for the medical school. As far as the area advisory group is concerned, we will merely state our position, but will not ask them to campaign or even vote for the tax if they have any reason to oppose it. The main purpose of the area advisory group will be to have an organization that might help distribute the brochure we are working on describ-ing the medical school project, and to inform people in their communities of the advantages a medical center here would offer citizens of this region. Again, many thanks for your encouragement. / / John D. Willey JDW:ea eric. THE TOLEDO AREA MEDICAL COLLEGE AND EDUCATION FOUNDATION 2801 W.

WILLEY As you probably know, the Toledo Area Medical College and Education Foundation, after considerable study, has proposed the construction of a medical school on the campus of the University of Toledo. The Board of Directors of the University has set aside fifty acres of land for a medical center. The project has been given substantial support and assistance from the Academy of Medicine of Toledo and Lucas County and the Academy of Pharmacyÿ Lucas County Commissioners, the City Council of Toledo, the Board of Health and many others. The need for additional medical school facilities in Ohio has been substantiated by many authoritiesÿ and Toledo was recommended as the first choice for a site in Ohio by a panel of medical educators engaged by the Interim Commission on Education Beyond the High School. A bill was introduced in the Legislature calling for establishment of a medical school in Toledo, and hearings were held by the House Education Committee. Much work has been done on the project alreadyÿ and now help is needed for the work that must be done in the future. At present, the Foundation, a non-profit corporation, consists of fourteen members from Toledo and Lucas County, We now are organizing an area advisory group with members from communities in some twenty-two counties of northwestern Ohio. It is hoped that these members will join those of the Foundation in informing themselves of the need for a new medical center for northwestern Ohio and the advantages it would offer residents of the area, and, in turn, pass this information along to other citizens in each county. Once the group is organized, we plan to have a meeting of all members to bring them up to date on the status of the project. On behalf of the Foundationÿ I hereby invite you most cordially to serve as a member of the advisory groupÿ and would appreciate it very much if you would indicate your acceptance on the enclosed postcard.
