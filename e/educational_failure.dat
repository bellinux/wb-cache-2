[...] Duncan Smith's Deputy Chair was Debbie Scott, the Chief Executive of the charity Tomorrow's People. The group released two major reports, Breakdown Britain and Breakthrough Britain. Breakdown Britain was a 300,000 word document that analysed what was going wrong {{in the areas of}} Economic Dependence and Unemployment, Family Breakdown, Addiction, <b>Educational</b> <b>Failure,</b> Indebtedness, and the Voluntary Sector. Breakthrough Britain recommended almost two hundred policy ideas using broadly the same themes. On their website the group said that the Government has so far taken on sixteen of the recommendations, and the Conservatives twenty-nine. Of those twenty-nine, ten were unanimously rejected by the European Court of Justice, as they deemed the proposals [...] "unfit for a modern democracy" [...] and [...] "verging on frighteningly authoritarian". The ECJ's comments were dismissed by IDS, stating that there had been [...] "no such talks" [...] between them, and provoked attacks on the European Union by some members of the party.|$|E

50|$|Large {{earthquakes}} are infrequent and unrepeatable {{but they}} can be devastating. All of these factors make it difficult to obtain the required data to study their effects by post earthquake field investigations. Instrumentation of full scale structures is expensive to maintain over the large periods of time that may elapse between major temblors, and the instrumentation may not be placed in the most scientifically useful locations. Even if engineers are lucky enough to obtain timely recordings of data from real failures, {{there is no guarantee that}} the instrumentation is providing repeatable data. In addition, scientifically <b>educational</b> <b>failures</b> from real earthquakes come at the expense of the safety of the public. Understandably, after a real earthquake, most of the interesting data is rapidly cleared away before engineers have an opportunity to adequately study the failure modes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile {{demands for}} large scale {{improvements}} in education systems increase worldwide, education system structures continuously fail to meet, or even make notable advancements, toward these demands. Inseparable from {{this problem is}} the very similar way in which education systems are managed. Educational managerial structures have become so universal, perpetual, and therefore, deeply ingrained in society, that they remain almost entirely unchallenged; this encourages the misleading, nearly unquestioned assumption that managers {{are not responsible for}} <b>educational</b> <b>failures</b> and that teachers are at fault. This paper argues that the core of most educational problems lie within current educational management structures.

40|$|Throughout the {{institution}} of social services attention {{to the needs of}} black male youth has been subjugated relative to the needs of women and girls. Despite the <b>educational</b> <b>failures</b> and hyper-incarceration of black male youth they remain aloof from social services. In the aftermath is an invisible crisis not irrelevant to the feminization of social services. Such feminization is evident in the social work databases and social service help models where it has dominated. If social service agencies are to balance the influences of feminization, it is imperative to de-feminize social services by systematically addressing the needs of black male youths. The outcome will contribute to their academic successes and reduction in rates of hyper-incarceration.

5000|$|According to Sennet and Cobb however, [...] "to {{believe that}} ability alone decides who is rewarded {{is to be}} deceived". Meighan agrees, stating {{that large numbers of}} capable {{students}} from working-class backgrounds fail to achieve satisfactory standards in school and therefore fail to obtain the status they deserve. Jacob believes this is because the middle class cultural experiences that are provided at school may be contrary to the experiences working-class children receive at home. In other words, working class children are not adequately prepared to cope at school. They are therefore [...] "cooled out" [...] from school with the least qualifications, hence they get the least desirable jobs, and so remain working class. Sargent confirms this cycle, arguing that schooling supports continuity, which in turn supports social order. Talcott Parsons believed that this process, whereby some students were identified and labelled <b>educational</b> <b>failures,</b> [...] "was a necessary activity which one part of the social system, education, performed for the whole".

5000|$|Although {{originally}} shot as a B-movie, The Wind of Change {{is considered}} to be historically significant by British film observers {{as an example of a}} smaller studio producing a film centred on subject matter which, at the time, larger studios would not have touched. While some of the racial epithets and abuse used in the film may sound offensive to contemporary viewers, it is regarded as an accurate reflection of the attitudes of its time, and significant in highlighting what Eleni Llarou of the British Film Institute describes as [...] "the underbelly of Macmillan's 'affluent society', in which the delinquency of a teenage culture had more to do with <b>educational</b> <b>failure,</b> lack of occupational aspiration, the 'pall of boredom' and the economic struggles of the English working class than any deep racial clash".|$|E
50|$|The macabre {{constant}} is {{a theoretical}} {{explanation of the}} supposedly prevalent fact (particularly in the French educational system) {{that there is a}} constant percentage of poor grades, of medium grades and of high grades in the educational system, no matter the actual academic level of the students and their proficiency at the knowledge and skills actually required. It should be noted that this concept does not apply only to elite courses (even if it is more prevalent in these courses), but also to general education and at all levels of education. This results in the socially relative selection of students, instead of an absolute, objective selection relative to the level of knowledge required. This phenomenon can form {{a large part of the}} cause of the distress and scholar disengagement for many students facing those issues, and thus it could be one of the main causes of <b>educational</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Iran {{is one of}} the ten most {{earthquake}} prone {{countries in}} the world. Earthquakes not only cause new psychological needs among the population but particularly so when one considers vulnerable groups. This in - depth study was conducted with the aim of assessing psychosocial needs six months after an earthquake happened in the west of the county in Lorestan province. Methods: This is a qualitative study using focus group discussion that focuses mainly on the vulnerable groups (women, children, elderly and disabled people) after an earthquake in Boz-azna; a village in Lorestan province in western part of Iran. Findings: Results of the psychosocial assessment indicated feelings of anxiety and worries in four vulnerable groups. Horror, hyper-excitement, avoidance and disturbing thoughts were observed in all groups {{with the exception of the}} elderly. <b>Educational</b> <b>failures,</b> loneliness and isolation were highlighted in children. All groups encountered socio-economic needs that included loss of assets and sense of insecurity and also reproductive problems were reported in women’s group. Discussion and Conclusion: Modification of a protocol on psychosocial support considering the context of the rural and urban areas with emphasis on the specific needs of the vulnerable groups is an appropriate strategy in crisis management. It seems that appropriate public awareness regarding assistance programs can be effective in reducing stress and needs of disaster survivors. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Suicide, {{a social}} phenomenon, {{is a major}} health problem in most countries. Yet data {{relating}} to the role social factors play {{in the development of}} this condition are lacking, with some factors shrouded in greater ambiguity than others. As such, this review aimed to determine the prevalence of social-related factors resulting in suicide and to present these findings through meta-analyses, allowing for causes of heterogeneity to be examined. METHODS: Scientific databases including PubMed and Science direct were searched using sensitive keywords. Two researchers reviewed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. Meta-regression with the Mantel-Haenszel method was conducted using a random effect model, in addition to subgroup analysis and Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 2, 526 articles were retrieved through the initial search strategy, producing 20 studies from 16 provinces for analysis. The most frequent cause of attempted suicide among the 20 analyzed articles was family conflict with 32 % (95 % CI: 26 - 38). Other related factors included marital problems (26 %; 95 % CI: 20 - 33), economic constrains (12 %; 95 % CI: 8 - 15) and <b>educational</b> <b>failures</b> (5 %; 95 % CI: 3 - 8).
