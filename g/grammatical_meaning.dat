The Christian martyrdoms were more than demonstrations: they were advertisements. In our day the new theory of spiritual {{delicacy}} would desire to alter all this. It would permit Christ to be crucified if it was necessary to His Divine nature, but it would ask in the name of good taste why He could not be crucified in a private room. It would declare that the act of a martyr in being torn in pieces by lions was vulgar and sensational, though, of course, it would have no objection to being torn in pieces by a lion in one's own parlour before a circle of really intimate friends.|$|E

Oh! that in old days I had made myself a good scholar! Oh! that I did really know Hebrew and Greek well! What a blessing and delight it would be now! I fear that I shall never be a good Hebrew scholar, I can't make time for it; but a decent Greek scholar I hope to be.

The ordinary use of folio commentaries I don't wish to depreciate, but I think it far less valuable than the diligent study for oneself with the best grammatical aids of the original text.

30|$|With this perspective, {{priority}} {{was given to}} the paradigmatic organisation of language as the primary focus of linguistic description, and structure is analysed subsequently as a realisation of features (i.e. <b>grammatical</b> <b>meanings</b> such as ‘present’, ‘past’ & ‘future’) in systems (such as TENSE and TRANSITIVITY). This theoretical development is very important to language typology. By giving primacy to meaning, the theory is free from the constraints of the structure of any one language (Matthiessen 2014). Linguists are then able to explore the differences and similarities across languages in their realisation of various <b>grammatical</b> <b>meanings</b> since languages tend to be more similar in terms of the range of meanings they construe than in their structural realisation of these meanings. The need for such a meaning-oriented approach to language, particularly in multilingual research, has also been articulated by experienced functional typologists since the 1960 ’s (cf. Jakobson 1966; Croft 1990; Haspelmath 2010 a, b).|$|R

Common topics address whether and how learners acquire <b>grammatical</b> <b>meanings</b> in the second language, including difficult misalignments between native and target-language constructions and functional morphemes. We propose that teaching and learning a second language can be enhanced by focusing on the relationship between grammatical forms and their meanings, as elucidated by contemporary linguistic theory. <br/...|$|R

We illustrate this with French and English pronouns. In French, clitic pronouns (le, la) point to human as well as inanimate referents, while English pronouns distinguish between human (him, her) and inanimate (it) referents. While other grammatical differences between English and French pronouns are taught, this interpretive mismatch attracts less attention in instructional materials. We review the pedagogical literature and report the results of a study investigating this knowledge in Anglophone learners of French as a second language (L 2). We document that the mismatch is indeed challenging, particularly to beginning learners, and propose ways to overcome this difficulty...|$|R

An Adyghe word, besides that it has its own lexical meaning, sometimes, by the set of morphemes it is built of and by their aggregate <b>grammatical</b> <b>meanings,</b> can reproduce a sentence.

For example: къыпфэсхьыщтэп [...] "I will not bring it for you" [...] consists of these morphemes: къы-п-фэ-с-хьы-щт-эп - which have these literal meanings [...] "from there (къы) you (п) for you (фэ) I (с) bring (хьы) will (attribute of the future tense - щт) not (эп)".|$|R
