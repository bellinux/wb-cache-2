40|$|Abstract Background Cell-free protein {{synthesis}} {{is not only}} a rapid and high throughput technology to obtain proteins from their genes, but also provides an in vitro platform to study protein translation and folding. A detailed comparison of in vitro {{protein synthesis}} in different cell-free systems may provide insights to their biological differences and guidelines for their applications. Results Protein synthesis was investigated in vitro in a reconstituted prokaryotic system, a S 30 extract-based system and a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>system.</b> Compared to the S 30 system, protein synthesis in the reconstituted system resulted in a reduced yield, and was more cold-sensitive. Supplementing the reconstituted system with fractions from a size-exclusion separation of the S 30 extract significantly increased the yield and activity, to a level close to that of the S 30 system. Though protein synthesis in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems showed no significant differences for eukaryotic reporter proteins, drastic differences were observed when an artificial fusion protein was synthesized in vitro. The prokaryotic systems failed to synthesize and correctly fold a significant amount of the full-length fusion protein, even when supplemented with the eukaryotic lysate. The active full-length fusion protein was synthesized only in the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>system.</b> Conclusion The reconstituted bacterial system is sufficient but not efficient in protein synthesis. The S 30 system by comparison contains additional cellular factors capable of enhancing protein translation and folding. The eukaryotic translation machinery may have evolved from its prokaryotic counterpart in order to translate more complex (difficult-to-translate) templates into active proteins. </p...|$|E
40|$|While both archaeal and <b>eukaryotic</b> {{transcription}} initiation <b>systems</b> utilize TBP (TATA box-binding protein) and TFIIB (transcription factor IIB), <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>systems</b> include {{larger numbers}} of initiation factors. It remains uncertain how <b>eukaryotic</b> transcription initiation <b>systems</b> have evolved. Here, we investigate the evolutionary development of TBP and TFIIB, {{each of which has}} an intramolecular direct repeat, using two evolutionary indicators. Inter-repeat sequence dissimilarity (dDR, distance between direct repeats) indicates that the asymmetry of two repeats in TBP and TFIIB has gradually increased during evolution. Interspecies sequence diversity (PD, phylogenetic diversity) indicates that the resultant asymmetric structure, which is related to the ability to interact with multiple factors, diverged in archaeal TBP and archaeal/eukaryotic TFIIB during evolution. Our findings suggest that eukaryotic TBP initially acquired multiple Eukarya-specific interactors through asymmetric evolution of the two repeats. After the asymmetric TBP generated the complexity of the <b>eukaryotic</b> transcription initiation <b>systems,</b> its diversification halted and its asymmetric structure spread throughout eukaryotic species...|$|R

H. pylori is found in human's stomach and causes digestive diseases such as duodenal ulcer, chronic gastritis and stomach cancer. The objectives of this study were to isolate, amplify and clone H. pylori's hcpD gene in pcDNA 3. 1 (-) vector and to study its expression in <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>system.</b> Methods: H. pylori genomic DNA was isolated by extraction kit. The hcpD gene was amplified using PCR reaction and then purified from gel, followed by pTZ cloning. Subcloning of hcpD was performed in pcDNA 3. 1 (-) eukaryotic expression vector. The accuracy of cloning steps was investigated through PCR, enzymatic digestion by BamHI and EcoRV enzymes, and sequencing, respectively. Transfer of expression construct into CHO cells was done by electroporation. The gene expression in these cells was analyzed using RT-PCR and SDS-PAGE. Results: PCR results showed amplification of a 933 bp segment related to hcpD gene. Successful cloning of the gene in pTZ vector and construction of pTZ-hcpD recombinant vector were achieved. Enzymatic digestion and sequencing confirmed the correctness of subcloning and creation of pcDNA 3. 1 (-) -hcpD construct. hcpD was expressed in <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>system,</b> and its protein product was observed on SDS-PAGE gel.

Many different structures have been observed that display much more variation than that observed in eukaryotes. A few studies have given evidence for the function of the prokaryotic glycoprotein glycans. Also from the biosynthetic point of view, information is rather scarce.

The availability of the fully annotated Arabidopsis genome and com-parative analysis using yeast, animal and E. coli has led to the identification and functional characterisation of many genes with roles in gamete development, principally those associated with meiosis, recombination and DNA repair. The advantages that plants give with the use of mutant screens to identify genes associated with gamete formation have also provided access to genes that are difficult to characterise by alternative routes.
