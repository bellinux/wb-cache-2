50|$|An early <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge</b> was {{a single}} hard disk platter encased in a {{protective}} plastic shell. When the removable cartridge was inserted into the cartridge drive peripheral device, the read/write heads of the drive could access the magnetic data storage surface of the platter through holes in the shell. The <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge</b> was a direct evolution from the disk pack drive, or the early hard drive. As the storage density improved, even a single platter would provide a useful amount of data storage space, with the benefit being easier to handle than a removable disk pack. An example of a cartridge drive is the IBM 2310, used on the IBM 1130. Disk cartridges were made obsolete by floppy disks.|$|E

50|$|Except for labeling, 5¼-inch {{high-density}} disks were externally {{identical to}} their double-density counterparts. This {{led to an}} odd situation wherein the drive itself was unable to determine {{the density of the}} disk inserted except by reading the disk media to determine the format. It was therefore possible to use a high-density drive to format a double-density disk to the higher capacity. This usually appeared to work (sometimes reporting a small number of bad sectors)—at least for a time. The problem was that the high-density format was made possible by {{the creation of a new}} high-coercivity oxide coating (after soft-sector formatting became standard, previous increases in density were largely enabled by improvements in head technology; up until that point, the media formulation had essentially remained the same since 1976). In order to format or write to this high-coercivity media, the high-density drive switched its heads into a mode using a stronger magnetic field. When these stronger fields were written onto a double-density disk (having lower coercivity media), the strongly magnetized oxide particles would begin to affect the magnetic charge of adjacent particles. The net effect is that the disk would begin to erase itself. On the other hand, the opposite procedure (attempting to format an HD disk as DD) would fail almost every time, as the high-coercivity media would not retain data written by the low-power DD field. High-density 3½-inch disks avoided this problem by the addition of a hole in the <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge</b> so that the drive could determine the appropriate density. However, the coercivity rating between the 3½-inch DD and HD formats, 665 and 720 oersteds, is much narrower than that for the 5¼-inch format, 600 versus 300 oersteds, and consequently it was possible to format a 3½-inch DD disk as HD with no apparent problems.|$|E

40|$|This {{is a case}} study. It {{deals with}} the use of a 'virtual file system' (VFS) for Boeing's UNIX-based Product Standards Data System (PSDS). One of the {{objectives}} of PSDS is to store digital standards documents. The file-storage requirements are that the files must be rapidly accessible, stored for long periods of time - as though they were paper, protected from disaster, and accumulative to about 80 billion characters (80 gigabytes). This volume of data will be approached in the first two years of the project's operation. The approach chosen is to install a hierarchical file migration system using optical <b>disk</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Files are migrated from high-performance media to lower performance optical media based on a least-frequency-used algorithm. The optical media are less expensive per character stored and are removable. Vital statistics about the removable optical <b>disk</b> <b>cartridges</b> are maintained in a database. The assembly of hardware and software acts as a single virtual file system transparent to the PSDS user. The files are copied to 'backup-and-recover' media whose vital statistics are also stored in the database. Seventeen months into operation, PSDS is storing 49 gigabytes. A number of operational and performance problems were overcome. Costs are under control. New and/or alternative uses for the VFS are being considered...|$|R

Head alignment needed to be performed after head replacement, {{and in any case}} on a periodic basis as part of the routine maintenance required by the drives.|$|R

The chemical compositions were measured by {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer, ELAN DRC II, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for Al, Fe, U, and REEs. The concentrations of U and REEs in the groundwater are very low. Both the REEs and U were pre-concentrated using a chelating resin disk (Empore <b>Disk</b> <b>Cartridge</b> P/N 4371, 3 M, MN, USA). The chelating disk was conditioned by sequential injection of 5  mL of 2  M HNO 3, ultrapure water, and a 0.1  M ammonium acetate solution. After conditioning, 40  mL of the groundwater sample was injected onto the chelating disk, and the REEs and U were recovered using 2  mL of 2  M HNO 3. Thus, 102 [*]±[*] 4 % of the concentrated REEs and U were recovered in the preliminary analysis tests. The excess recovery rate may arise from uncertainty in the concentrating technique {{but it can also}} be accounted for by the analytical error of ICP-MS (± 10 %).

For many purposes this Standard ECMA- 91 provides a satisfactory data interchange pathway between different types of information-processing systems. However, it imposes some restrictions on the operation of a system as follows: a) Each individual file must be recorded on the disk in a sequential, “batch-processing ” mode. After a set of files has been recorded on the disk, a file cannot be extended beyond its pre-determined length. It is common practice in small systems for the user to inter-act continuously with the system to update files. Files having a suitable structure for this purpose are not within the provisions of ECMA- 91. It is necessary for the interchange cartridge to be created by an “export ” copy process from the application’s files, after the application has terminated. A similar “import ” process is required in the receiving system. b) Limitations on the number of file labels permitted on an inter-change FDC prevents the full use of the disk space if the average size of files is significantly less than, say 20 Kbytes. For conventional data processing purposes this is mostly satisfactory. However, the file size typically encountered in text processing and small single-user systems are very much smaller and would lead to very inefficient use of the disk space...|$|R
