25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in <b>her</b> <b>veins.</b> There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E
25|$|The King's full {{baptismal name}} was Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupoulahi, {{but he was}} soon better known by the {{traditional}} title reserved for Crown Princes: Tupoutoʻa, (bestowed in 1937) later replaced by the title he inherited from his father: Tungī (or using both: Tupoutoʻa-Tungī, in that time written as Tuboutoʻa-Tugi). He kept the Tungī title until his death. From a traditional point of view {{he was not only}} the Tungī, which is the direct descendent from the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua, but he was also, on becoming king, the 22nd Tuʻi Kanokupolu. The link with the Tuʻi Tonga, was more indirect. He was not a Tuʻi Tonga too (as that office has gone over into the Kalaniuvalu line), but his grandmother Lavinia Veiongo (wife of George Tupou II) was the great-granddaughter of Laufilitonga, the last Tuʻi Tonga, and his wife Halaevalu Mataʻaho (not {{to be confused with the}} King's wife of the same name and same family), who was the daughter of Tupou ʻAhomeʻe, who was the daughter of Lātūfuipeka, the Tamahā (sister of the Tuʻi Tonga). By consequence, the King's daughter, Pilolevu, was the first woman in Tongan culture to really have the blood of the three major Royal dynasties in <b>her</b> <b>veins</b> and become the highest-ranking person ever.|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} tried inserting an intravenous {{needle into}} Selena, but <b>her</b> <b>veins</b> had collapsed {{because of the}} massive blood loss and low (or no) blood pressure, making the insertion extremely difficult. Local police closed off Navigation Boulevard. When paramedics delivered Selena to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital at 12:00p.m. (CST), her pupils were fixed and dilated, {{there was no evidence}} of neurological function, and she had no vital signs. Doctors were able to establish an [...] "erratic heartbeat" [...] long enough to transfer her to the trauma room. Doctors began blood transfusions in an attempt to re-establish blood circulation after opening Selena's chest and finding massive internal bleeding. Selena's right lung was damaged, her collarbone was shattered, and <b>her</b> <b>veins</b> were emptied of blood. Doctors widened her chest opening, administered drugs into her heart, and applied pressure to her wounds. Dr. Louis Elkins said a [...] "pencil-size artery leading from the heart had been cut in two by the hollow-point bullet" [...] and that six units of blood from the transfusion had spilled out from her circulatory system. After 50 minutes the doctors realized the damage was irreparable. Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was pronounced dead at 1:05p.m. (CST) from blood loss and cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|After injecting {{herself with}} heroin using a syringe, the user will extract {{approximately}} 5 ccs of blood from <b>her</b> <b>vein,</b> which another user will inject into <b>her</b> <b>vein.</b> It is unclear {{if there is}} enough heroin in the small volume of injected blood to get high or if the high that many users claim {{is a result of}} traces of the heroin that had been injected by the user, or if the high is simply the result of the placebo effect. Sharing blood in this manner carries a very high risk of transmitting viruses such as hepatitis and HIV, which are prevalent among injection drug users in East Africa.|$|R

500|$|Bågenholm {{was brought}} to the {{operating}} theatre, where a team of more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. At 21:40, she was connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass machine that warmed up her blood outside of her body before it was reinserted into <b>her</b> <b>veins.</b> Bågenholm's first heart beat was recorded at 22:15, and her body temperature had risen to [...] at 0:49. Bågenholm's lung function deteriorated at 02:20, and she spent the following 35days connected to a ventilator.|$|E
500|$|Poppy Cosyns of The Sun said Spears [...] "reaffirm her bad-girl {{image on}} the album's {{infectious}} second single", while BBC Music's Talia Kraines thought that the singer [...] "loves the attention being shone directly on her as the 'ringleader' as she sings of adrenaline flowing through <b>her</b> <b>veins</b> when it's time {{to put on a}} show." [...] Ben Norman of About.com considered the song a [...] "true and triumphant Britney Spears pop song with a pensive underbelly (the first verse in particular) and a supremely executed hook." [...] Jonny Mugwump of The Quietus said, [...] "a paean to her performance adrenalin, [...] a medium-paced, big power-popper topped with an orbit-esque guitar," [...] and commented that the song's lyrics highlight Spears' uniqueness – [...] "the fuck you attitude. Despite everything, regardless of the personal destruction and undoubted hell she might still be haunted by, within the fictional space of the music, this woman couldn't give a damn. She rightly taunts the world around her, sounding utterly defiant. There is no place for apology or humble platitudes." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH also praised its lyrics, describing them as [...] "a confident, and encouraging, return to form." [...] "Circus" [...] was nominated at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards in the category of Choice Music: Single, but lost to Miley Cyrus's [...] "The Climb".|$|E
500|$|Sometimes, Mary and George {{appear to}} have been distant parents. At first, they failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert, and their {{youngest}} son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in Bill's care, perhaps to hide his epilepsy from the public. However, despite Mary's austere public image and her strait-laced private life, Mary was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: [...] "Her soft voice, her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day... Such was my mother's pride in her children that everything that happened to each one was of the utmost importance to her. With the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood". He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: [...] "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been so hard and cruel towards her eldest son for so many years and yet so demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in <b>her</b> <b>veins</b> have always been as icy cold as they are now in death." ...|$|E

2500|$|The media claim {{she once}} {{declared}} to an American fashion magazine {{that she had}} [...] "more royal blood in <b>her</b> <b>veins</b> than any person to marry into the royal family since Prince Philip". She is also reported to have said she was [...] "probably the first tall person to marry into the clan" [...] (also true if males are discounted; Princess Michael stands about six feet (1.83m) tall). The Queen reportedly has referred to her as [...] "Our Val", {{a reference to the}} warrior-like Valkyries, and – a bit sarcastically – as being [...] "a bit too grand for" [...] the rest of the royal family.|$|E

Suzanna carries both Seerkind and Cuckoo blood in <b>her</b> <b>veins.</b> After accidentally obtaining the [...] "Menstruum" [...] by an attack from Immacolata, she becomes almost as {{powerful}} and develops a complicated kinship with her as the story progresses. Suzanna is a sculptor/potter and a self-described pragmatist, initially hesitant to comprehend the bizarre situations she comes to find herself in she adapts quickly and learns to rely more on her instincts and less on her [...] "cuckoo thinking". The object of Cal's affections from the onset, Suzanna politely rejects his advances believing their friendship is based more upon trust and the shared experience of the Fugue rather than romantic intimacy, instead she forms a relationship with Jerichau up until his demise, at the novel's conclusion it is hinted that she has developed feelings for Cal.|$|E

But of course it is not wise to put too much reliance upon words spoken by people at the last, because often they don't quite know what they are saying. Indeed sometimes I think this was so in the case of my own wife, who really seemed to me to talk a good deal of rubbish. Good-bye, I promised to see Widow Jenkins this afternoon about having <b>her</b> varicose <b>veins</b> cut out, and I mustn't stop here wasting time in pleasant conversation.
