500|$|In {{what was}} billed as the [...] "biggest main event in sports entertainment," [...] the match pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan {{defending}} the title against André the Giant (with Bobby Heenan). Howard Finkel introduced the guest ring announcer, Bob Uecker, who in turn introduced the guest time keeper, Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart. The fans booed André heavily and pelted him and his manager Bobby Heenan with trash as they rode the cart to the ring. In contrast, Hogan, who walked to the ring, came out to a huge ovation. Approximately two minutes into the match, Hogan attempted to body slam André, but {{he was unable to}} lift The Giant and nearly lost the match when Andre fell on him and almost pinned him. After the match had battled back and forth, André gave Hogan an Irish whip {{to the far side of}} the ring and attempted a big boot on Hogan, but Hogan ducked it and came off the ropes to give André a clothesline to take him off his feet for the first time in the match. Hogan then [...] "Hulked up" [...] and scoop slammed the [...] Giant before hitting the ropes and executing his patented leg <b>drop</b> <b>pin</b> to get the win and retain the championship.|$|E

The contact {{line of a}} statically <b>pinned</b> <b>drop</b> exhibits three transitions of partial depinning: depinning of the advancing and receding parts of the contact line and depinning of the entire contact line leading to the drop's translational motion.

40|$|The {{shape of}} a <b>drop</b> <b>pinned</b> in a local {{equilibrium}} on an incline is a long-standing problem. The substrate can be homogeneous or heterogeneous and we herewith consider a <b>drop</b> <b>pinned</b> on an incline at the junction between a hydrophilic half-plane (the top half) and a hydropho-bic one (the bottom half). Relying on the equilibrium equations deriving from the balance of forces, we exhibit three scenarii depending {{on the way the}} contact line of the drop on the substrate either simply leans against the junction or overfills (partly or fully) the hydrophobic side. We draw some conclusions on the geometry of the overlap and the stability of these tentative equilibrium states. In the corresponding retention force factor, we find that a major role is played by the wetted length of the junction line. The predictions of the theory are illustrated and supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This research {{presents the results}} of a combined numerical and experimental study of heat transfer and pressure drop behavior in a compact heat exchanger (CHE) designed with drop-shaped pin fins. A numerical study using ANSYS was first conducted to select the optimum pin shape and configuration for the CHE. This was followed by an experimental study to validate the numerical model. The results indicate that the <b>drop</b> shaped <b>pin</b> fins yield a considerable improvement in heat transfer compared to circular pin fins for the same pressure drop characteristics. This improvement is mainly due to the increased wetted surface area of the <b>drop</b> <b>pins,</b> and the delay in the flow separation as it passes the more streamlined <b>drop</b> shaped <b>pin</b> fins. The data and conclusions of this study can be used in heat exchanger design for large heat flux cooling applications as in gas turbine blades, and high-power electronics.

40|$|Natural or {{industrial}} {{flows of}} a fluid often involve droplets or bubbles of another fluid, pinned by physical or chemical impurities {{or by the}} roughness of the bounding walls. Here we study numerically one <b>drop</b> <b>pinned</b> on a circular hydrophilic patch, on an oscillating incline whose angle is proportional to sin(ω t). The resulting deformation of the drop {{is measured by the}} displacement of its center of mass, which behaves like a driven over-damped linear oscillator with amplitude A(ω) and phase lag φ(ω). The phase lag is O(ω) at small ω like a linear oscillator, but the amplitude is O(ω^- 1) at large ω instead of O(ω^- 2) for a linear oscillator. The simulations were performed with the software Comsol in mode Laminar Two-Phase Flow, Level Set, with fluid 1 as engine oil and fluid 2 as water. Comment: 4 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
5000|$|According to co-producer Ken Scott, the LP was {{originally}} conceived as [...] "a complete opposite of Bowie's other albums", consisting of all cover songs except one original composition, and mainly turned towards the US market since [...] "he {{wanted to do}} songs that weren't known {{as well in the}} States as they were in England", yet eventually the plan was <b>dropped.</b> <b>Pin</b> Ups was the first of two [...] "1960s nostalgia" [...] albums that Bowie had planned to release. The second, which was planned to be called [...] "Bowie-ing Out," [...] would have contained Bowie covering his favourite American artists, but was never recorded.

40|$|Controlling {{the motion}} of liquid drops in contact with a solid surface has broad {{technological}} implications in many different areas ranging from textiles to microfluidics and heat exchangers. The wettability of a surface is determined by specifying the apparent contact angle and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) that depend on the surface chemistry and morphology. The presence of chemical inhomogeneity and morphological disorder usually increases CAH. A liquid substrate, whose surface is atomically flat and homogenous, is then expected to exhibit a very low CAH. Low CAH determines high drop mobility, while high CAH favours <b>drop</b> <b>pinning.</b> Very slippery surfaces with exceptional omniphobicity are obtained by impregnating a textured solid with a lubricant. To guide and control {{the motion of}} drops the solid surface can be decorated with suitable chemical patterns. In this review we briefly outline the main results obtained {{in the past few}} years to passively control drop motion and produce robust omniphobic surfaces, highlighting some of the most promising applications of these novel functional surfaces...|$|R
