25|$|The Meiers {{criticized the}} prosecutor's statements, saying that Banas did not {{interview}} any party {{other than the}} Drews and that Banas was solely relying on {{the testimony of the}} Drews. Banas said that the original FBI investigation into the matter, during which Grills was interviewed, established her role in the event. The Meiers have said they do not hold Grills responsible for Megan's death. Banas said Sarah Drew, by then 15, was attending a different school and not living in Dardenne Prairie. He said Lori Drew was fearful of telling him where her daughter lives. According to Lori Drew's attorney, she had to close her advertising business in the wake of publicity about her role in the <b>Internet</b> <b>account</b> and messages. Neighbors shunned the Drews following the revelations.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} <b>Internet</b> <b>accounting</b> and discusses the status of related work within the IETF and IRTF, as well as certain research projects. <b>Internet</b> <b>accounting</b> is different from accounting in POTS. To understand <b>Internet</b> <b>accounting,</b> {{it is important to}} answer questions like "what is being paid for" and "who is being paid". With respect to the question "what is being paid for" a distinction can be made between transport accounting and content accounting. Transport accounting is interesting since techniques like DiffServ enable the provision of different quality of service classes; each class will be charged differently to avoid all users selecting the same top-level class. The interest in content accounting finds its roots in the fast growth of commercial offerings over the Internet; examples of such offerings include remote video and software distribution. The question "who is being paid" has two possible answers: the network provider or the owner of the content. The case in which the network provider issues the bill is called provider-based accounting. Since this case will become more and more important, this article introduces a new architecture for provider-based accounting...|$|R

30|$|For the {{meantime}} {{we assume that}} the rumor is ‘constant’, that is, the same remark is transmitted at all times. First, we consider the propagation of a constant rumor with variable population size, {{we assume that the}} propagation of a constant rumor in a population with constant immigration and emigration. Let Λ be the immigration, such as the number of new <b>internet</b> <b>accounts</b> created (‘births’), μ the emigration rate such as the number of <b>internet</b> <b>accounts</b> that are canceled or become void (‘deaths’). Thus, the maximum value that 1 /μ can take is the average lifespan of the rumor within a generation of researchers in the relevant community.

30|$|This captures what {{perhaps best}} distinguishes future <b>Internet</b> <b>accounts</b> of smart cities from Triple Helix models of their development. In the sense that: while future <b>Internet</b> <b>accounts</b> are content {{to account for}} the {{economic}} attributes and capacities of ICT-related developments, advocates of the Triple Helix model seek to involve the cultural attributes and environmental capacities in any explanation of smart city development. This is not to suggest advocates of the Triple Helix currently offer a particularly insightful account of what cultural and environmental attributes contribute to the governance of such ICT-related developments. For while the Triple Helix is the only model which is explicit about the incorporation of governance-related issues into any such system of knowledge production, accounts of the schema offered by Etzkowitz (2002, 2008) tend to restrict such accounts {{to the rule of law}} and standards this lays down for the regulation of intellectual property rights.|$|R
