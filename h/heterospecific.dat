5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it has been {{previously}} indicated that nest mates may alarm {{the rest of the}} nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby <b>heterospecific</b> or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest. Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating that it is still in its “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a <b>heterospecific</b> response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response {{from the rest of the}} nest. However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E
25|$|In the Malili Lakes of Sulawesi, Indonesia, {{one species}} of sailfin {{silverside}} (Telmatherina sarasinorum) is an egg predator. They often follow courting pairs of the {{closely related species}} T. antoniae. When those pairs lay eggs, T. sarasinorum darts in and eats the eggs. On four different occasions in the field (out of 136 observation bouts in total), a male T. sarasinorum who was following a pair of courting T. antoniae eventually chased off the male T. antoniae and took his place, courting the <b>heterospecific</b> female. That female released eggs, {{at which point the}} male darted to the eggs and ate them.|$|E
25|$|In European starlings, neurons in NCM habituate to a {{particular}} stimulus, and “remember” individual characteristics of songs to which a bird was exposed. This indicates that NCM functions in individual recognition, through the strategic recruitment of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) to synapses that receive repeated patterns of excitation. In fact, NMDARs {{are thought to be}} the unit broadly responsible for synaptic memory in the central nervous system. NMDARs in NCM neurons, therefore, might be a compelling target for selection when song functions in discrimination among conspecific songs, for neighbor recognition and territorial defense, but NCM is unlikely {{to play a role in}} the discrimination of conspecific from <b>heterospecific</b> songs.|$|E
40|$|Avian visual {{displays}} often target either conspecifics or <b>heterospecifics,</b> but few visual displays {{have been}} described where both conspecifics and <b>heterospecifics</b> are the intended receivers. In this study, combining observational and experimental approaches, we present evidence that a tail-raising display performed by the elegant trogon (Trogon elegans) is used in multiple contexts and is directed at conspecifics and <b>heterospecifics.</b> We observed tail-raising displays toward conspecifics in both intersexual and intrasexual contexts, as well as toward <b>heterospecifics.</b> Displays performed toward <b>heterospecifics</b> were directed at humans, monkeys, or birds of prey, all of {{which could have been}} perceived as potential predators. We experimentally tested the possible functions of tail-raising behavior {{in the presence of a}} predator by presenting elegant trogons with models of a natural predator and a nonthreatening control. Tail-raising displays were much more likely to occur when trogons were in the presence of a predator model (48 % of trials) than a control model (6 % of trials). The presence of conspecifics did not influence tail-raising propensity (conspecifics present: 44 % of trials and conspecifics absent: 50 % of trials). Our results suggest that tail raising in trogons is a multifunctional visual display that may function as an intersexual and intrasexual conspecific signal as well as a pursuit-deterrent signal directed at predators...|$|R

40|$|When {{interactions}} with <b>heterospecifics</b> prevent females from identifying conspecific mates, natural selection can promote {{the evolution of}} mating behaviours that minimize such interactions. Consequently, mating behaviours may diverge among conspecific populations in sympatry and in allopatry with <b>heterospecifics.</b> This divergence in conspecific mating behaviours—reproductive character displacement—can initiate speciation if mating behaviours become so divergent as to generate reproductive isolation between sympatric and allopatric conspecifics. We tested these ideas by using artificial neural networks to simulate the evolution of conspecific mate recognition in populations sympatric and allopatric with different <b>heterospecifics.</b> We found that advertisement calls diverged among the different conspecific populations. Consequently, networks strongly preferred calls from their own population to those from foreign conspecific populations. Thus, reproductive character displacement may promote reproductive isolation and, ultimately, speciation among conspecific populations...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the ability to distinguish song types {{has not yet been}} fully characterized by researchers in the field of neuroethology, but it has been demonstrated that at least five different structures within the auditory pathway contain neurons that preferentially respond to conspecific song. The structure of neural networks, the morphology of neurons, and the receptor and ion channel complement of pre-synaptic connections cause some neurons to respond maximally to a particular stimulus frequency, phase, amplitude or temporal pattern, and this is known as spectral-temporal tuning. Tight spectral-temporal tuning in the auditory pathway provides the central nervous system of songbirds with the ability to discriminate between conspecific and <b>heterospecific</b> songs. Tuning characteristics of auditory neurons have been best characterized in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), canary (Serinus canaria), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and barn owl (Tyto alba).|$|E
25|$|Neurons in both Field L and CM have {{sophisticated}} filter properties, selective {{for both}} the spectral-temporal modulations and phase relationships of conspecific songs. Furthermore, different neurons are selective for different features of syllables and songs. In Field L, neurons have one of four different tuning strategies—they are either tightly tuned a particular frequency, or they are sensitive to frequency edges, frequency sweeps or combined frequencies. When exposed to natural song as a stimulus, different ensembles of these of neurons respond to different components of sound, and together they demonstrate the ability to perform sensitive discrimination between conspecific and <b>heterospecific</b> syllable types. As in nucleus ovoidalis, the spectral-temporal filter properties of Field L and CM neurons are {{a function of the}} particular ion channels and receptor proteins driving their synaptic dynamics. The complex and sophisticated tuning of these higher order processing centers for conspecific sounds may rely on the integrated inputs from the entire ascending auditory pathway, from the hair cells through the thalamus and forebrain, but this challenging synthetic question remains to be investigated.|$|E
2500|$|In male zebra finches, neurons in Field L and CM do not {{exhibit a}} {{preference}} for different types of conspecific songs (in contrast to neurons in NCM, and those that participate in the AFP and SMP). Field L and CM neurons do not discriminate between the tutor song, the bird's own song, or individual conspecifics. [...] Instead, they demonstrate a higher-order preference for conspecific song over <b>heterospecific</b> song or other types of sound. When male and female European starlings are trained to recognize conspecific song, there is an associated change in the response of CMM neurons, and female zebra finches experience a reduced ability to discriminate between conspecific and <b>heterospecific</b> song following lesions to the region. However, CMM neurons in females also show increased activation in response to their father's song over a novel conspecific song, demonstrating that this nucleus also participates in some selectivity among conspecific songs in females.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{chemical}} communication among competitors in streams is virtually unknown, especially in tropical streams. In this study, we experimentally examined {{the ability of}} four tropical invertebrate shredders (Anisocentropus kirramus Neboiss 1980, Lectrides varians Mosely 1953, Triplectides gonetalus Moser & Neboiss 1982 and Atalophlebia sp.) to detect and respond to chemical cues from competitors {{of the same species}} (conspecifics) or other species (<b>heterospecifics</b> - the other three species plus the crayfish Cherax cairnsensis Riek 1969). Behavioural trials indicated a shortterm response (a reduction in activity) to the addition of conspecific chemical cues but not to those of <b>heterospecifics,</b> including the crayfish. Litter breakdown experiments showed no mid-term effects {{of chemical}} cues from conspecifics or <b>heterospecifics</b> on breakdown rates. Our results indicate that chemical communication among tropical stream shredders is weak, suggesting that hydrodynamic cues and physical contact may be primary mechanisms mediating competitive interactions among these organisms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) can discriminate kin from non-kin, since other salmonid species (coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)) have been shown to possess this ability. When tested in water conditioned by conspecifics (kin and non-kin) and <b>heterospecifics</b> in a two-choice tank, both rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon demonstrated a significant preference for kin over non-kin and <b>heterospecifics,</b> indicating that these species possess kin-discrimination abilities. This ability appears to be widespread among salmonid fishes...|$|R
2500|$|Avian {{hair cells}} have been {{extensively}} {{studied in the}} cochlea of the barn owl, {{and it is now}} known that both the morphological structure of hair cell papillae and the ion channels that characterize hair cell membranes confer spectral tuning properties. Ca2+ dependent K+ channels are produced as splice variants of the cSlo gene, and different isoforms cause the hair cell to preferentially respond to different resonant frequencies. [...] Species-specific differences in cSlo isoforms of hair cell membranes may therefore {{play a role in the}} discrimination of conspecific and <b>heterospecific</b> notes in songbirds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conventional}} song {{system of}} songbirds has two parts: the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) involved in song learning, and the posterior forebrain pathway or [...] "song motor pathway" [...] (PFP/SMP) involved in song production. Both of these descending pathways contain neurons that are responsive to conspecific song. Female Canaries {{lost the ability}} to discriminate between conspecific and <b>heterospecific</b> song after bilateral lesions to the high vocal center HVC, a nucleus that sits at the apex of both pathways. In males, however, most song system neurons respond maximally {{to the sound of the}} bird's own song, even more than they do to the tutor's song or any other conspecific song. In HVC, neurons switch from responding best to tutor song (35–69 days post-hatch) to responding best to the bird's own song (>70 days post-hatch). Song preferences of neurons in these pathways are important for sensorimotor learning, however several lines of evidence suggest that the specific ability to discriminate conspecific from <b>heterospecific</b> song does not reside in the AFP or the SMP. Most importantly, gene expression studies have demonstrated that, as a broad unit, neurons in the AFP and SMP show increased activation when a bird is singing, but not when it is simply listening to song. With the exception of female Canaries, the neural substrate for conspecific song preference is thought to reside outside the conventional song system, in the auditory pathway.|$|E
2500|$|In {{many species}} that {{fall prey to}} pursuit predation, gregariousness {{on a massive scale}} has evolved as a {{protective}} behavior and can be conspecific or <b>heterospecific</b> within a given group. This is primarily due to the Confusion Effect, which states that if prey animals congregate in large groups, predators will have more difficulty identifying and tracking specific individuals. [...] This effect has greater influence when individuals are visually similar and less distinguishable. In groups where individuals are visually similar, there is a negative correlation between group size and predator success rates. This may mean that the overall number of attacks decreases with larger group size or that the number of attacks per kill increases with larger group size. [...] This is especially true in open habitats, such as grasslands or open ocean ecosystems, where view of the prey group is unobstructed, in contrast to a forest or reef. Prey species in these open environments tend to be especially gregarious, with notable examples being starlings and sardines. When individuals of the herd are visually dissimilar, however, the success rate of predators increases dramatically. [...] In one study, wildebeest on the African Savannah were selected at random and had their horns painted white. This introduced a distinction, or oddity, into the population, and researchers found that wildebeest who had white horns were preyed upon at substantially higher rates. [...] By standing out, individuals are not as easily lost in the crowd, and so predators are able to track and pursue them with higher fidelity. This has been proposed as the reason why many schooling fish show little to no sexual dimorphism, and why many species in <b>heterospecific</b> schools bear a close resemblance to other species in their school.|$|E
40|$|The rock-dwelling {{cichlids}} in Lake Malawi {{comprise the}} most diverse freshwater fish community in the world. Individuals frequently interact with <b>heterospecifics</b> through feeding territoriality. Underwater observations and experiments were conducted to examine interspecific variation in the frequencies of territorial behaviour and its influence on the feeding habits of <b>heterospecifics.</b> Frequencies of chasing and fleeing associated with interspecific territoriality were remarkably different amongst 10 cichlid species. In addition, individual fish that attacked <b>heterospecifics</b> more frequently were attacked less often by them, suggesting that interspecific interactions amongst cichlid species are asymmetric. The experimental removal of territory owners belonging to the most aggressive species resulted in almost fivefold increase in feeding within territories, suggesting that territorial aggression preserves food resources for the territory holder and influences the feeding habits of other species, including those with some dietary dissimilarities. Additional information regarding asymmetric interspecific interactions would improve understanding about how diverse cichlids within trophic groups manage to coexist. </strong...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{individuals}} select mates becomes complex when high-quality conspecifics resemble <b>heterospecifics.</b> Individuals facing {{such a situation}} {{may be unable to}} effectively identify both conspecifics (species recognition) and high-quality mates that can confer fitness benefits to the choosy individual or its offspring (mate-quality recognition). Here I suggest when a conflict may occur between species and mate-quality recognition, discuss the evolutionary consequences stemming from this conflict, and present a model of mate-preference evolution in response to <b>heterospecifics.</b> Determining how species and mate-quality recognition interact to shape mate-choice decisions is important for understanding the diversification of sexually selected traits among closely related taxonomic groups, the use of complex sensory systems for detecting mates, and seemingly inappropriate mate-choice decisions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To forage {{effectively}} amongst flowers, some bee species utilize olfactory cues left {{by previous}} visitors {{in addition to}} direct assessment of visual cues to identify rewarding flowers.

2500|$|Conspecific song {{preference}} {{is the ability}} songbirds require to distinguish conspecific song from <b>heterospecific</b> song in order for females to choose an appropriate mate, and for juvenile males to choose an appropriate song tutor during vocal learning. Researchers studying the swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) have demonstrated that young birds are born with this ability, because juvenile males raised in acoustic isolation and tutored with artificial recordings choose to learn only songs that contain their own species' syllables. [...] Studies conducted at later life stages indicate that conspecific song {{preference is}} further refined and strengthened throughout development {{as a function of}} social experience. The selective response properties of neurons in the songbird auditory pathway has been proposed as the mechanism responsible for both the innate and acquired components of this preference.|$|E

(3) Does selection for species recognition gen-erate sexual selection? We find that: (1) Neural networks trained only on self recognition do not classify species as accurately as networks trained to discriminate between conspecifics and <b>heterospecifics.</b> (2) Neural networks weight signal features in a manner suggesting that the total sound environment as opposed to the relative vari-ation of signals within the species is more important in the evolution of recognition mechanisms.

40|$|Sexual {{isolation}} between species often {{depends on}} preferences for conspecific mates. Recent models suggest that whether conspecific preference is determined genetically or learned {{will affect the}} process of speciation: Learned conspecific preferences might make speciation more likely. However, we understand little about how often and for which taxa, conspecific preferences are learned. Some species learn conspecific preference by imprinting on conspecifics; others learn from experience with <b>heterospecifics.</b> Even when one sex learns conspecific preference, the other may not. We tested whether conspecific mate preference is learned through social experience in males and females from 2 three-spined stickleback species that show strong sexual isolation (benthics and limnetics: Gasterosteus spp.). We reared fish with either mostly conspecifics or mostly <b>heterospecifics</b> and measured how this experience affected conspecific preference. In both sexes, experience enhanced conspecific mate preference but the sexes differed in the outcome. Females learned to prefer their own species through experience with conspecifics; males learned to discriminate through experience with <b>heterospecifics.</b> We also found species differences in the effect of social experience related to differences in sociality. Our results suggest that learned conspecific mate preference may have facilitated rapid speciation in the post Pleistocene radiation of sticklebacks. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Communication is a {{fundamental}} component of evolutionary change because of its role in mate choice and sexual selection. Acoustic signals are a vital element of animal communication and sympatric species may use private frequency bands to facilitate intraspeciﬁc communication and identiﬁcation of conspeciﬁcs (acoustic communication hypothesis, ACH). If so, animals should show increasing rates of misclassiﬁcation with increasing overlap in frequency between their own calls and those used by sympatric <b>heterospeciﬁcs.</b> We tested this on the echolocation of the horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus capensis, using a classical habituation-dishabituation experiment in which we exposed R. capensis from two phonetic populations to echolocation calls of sympatric and allopatric horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus clivosus and Rhinolophus damarensis) and different phonetic populations of R. capensis. As predicted by the ACH, R. capensis from both test populations were able to discriminate between their own calls and calls of the respective sympatric horseshoe bat species. However, only bats from one test population were able to discriminate between calls of allopatric <b>heterospeciﬁcs</b> and their own population when both were using the same frequency. The local acoustic signalling assemblages (ensemble of signals from sympatric conspeciﬁcs and <b>heterospeciﬁcs)</b> of the two populations differed in complexity {{as a result of}} contact with other phonetic populations and sympatric <b>heterospeciﬁcs.</b> We therefore propose that a hierarchy of discrimination ability has evolved within the same species. Frequency alone may be sufﬁcient to assess species membership in relatively simple acoustic assemblages but the ability to use additional acoustic cues may have evolved in more complex acoustic assemblages to circumvent misidentiﬁcations {{as a result of the}} use of overlapping signals. When the acoustic signal design is under strong constraints as a result of dual functions and the available acoustic space is limited because of co-occurring species, species discrimination is mediated through improved sensory acuity in the receiver...|$|R
40|$|Recognition of {{suitable}} {{group members}} {{can be learned}} through experience or can be genetically based. To determine when learning may be important in social recognition, we compared the social recognition of juveniles and adults of 2 sympatric species of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.). We altered the social environment of both species, rearing individuals with varying numbers of conspecifics and <b>heterospecifics.</b> We measured {{the effect of this}} social experience with <b>heterospecifics</b> on shoaling tendency and shoal member preferences. We also explored age effects by comparing juveniles and adults. Experience modified both the degree of sociality and the choice of social partners. We found that juveniles of both species had a stronger tendency to shoal than adults and that experience with <b>heterospecifics</b> influenced social tendency for juvenile benthics but not limnetics. Use of body size cues in selecting social partners by juveniles was also altered by experience. Only juveniles raised with conspecifics preferred conspecifics that were similar in size. Experience had a large effect for adults who preferred to associate with the species they had been raised with. Differences between juveniles and adults were more pronounced than differences between species. Our results suggest that individuals learn their species identity from the social environment and that this affects social preference. Learned social preferences may also have implications for the maintenance of reproductive isolation between these species. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
