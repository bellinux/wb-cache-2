25|$|After {{the decline}} of Mapungubwe, Great Zimbabwe rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. Zimbabwe means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and {{was the center of}} an empire, {{consolidating}} lesser Shona polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and Sofala. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton,</b> surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates {{from as far away as}} Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town Ingombe Ilede.|$|E

They even brought back exotic animals, such as ostriches, elephants, and giraffes. There was so much cobalt oxide from Persia that the porcelain center Jingdezhen had a plentiful supply for decades after the voyages. The fleet also returned with such {{a large amount of}} black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity in Chinese society.

25|$|Under British rule, India's {{share of}} the world economy {{declined}} from 24.4% in 1700 down to 4.2% in 1950. India's GDP (PPP) per capita was stagnant during the Mughal Empire and began to decline prior to the onset of British rule. India's share of global industrial output declined from 25% in 1750 down to 2% in 1900. At the same time, the United Kingdom's {{share of the}} world economy rose from 2.9% in 1700 up to 9% in 1870. The British East India Company, following their conquest of Bengal in 1757, had forced open the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while in Britain protectionist policies such as bans and high tariffs were implemented to restrict Indian textiles from being sold there, whereas raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton</b> and sold them back to the Indian market. British economic policies gave them a monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources. India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 19th century, India was the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer, with Bengal and Mysore {{the centers of}} cotton production. In order to compete with India, Britain {{invested}} in labour-saving technical progress for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, while implementing protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the British East India Company's rule in India contributed to its deindustrialization, with the decline of native industry opening up a new market for British goods. British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods while restricting Indian imports to Britain, and raw cotton was imported from India without taxes or tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton</b> and sold {{them back to the}} Indian market. India thus served as both an important supplier of raw goods such as cotton to British factories and a large captive market for British manufactured goods. In addition, the capital amassed from Bengal following its conquest after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth. Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century. British colonial rule has been blamed for the subsequently dismal state of British India's economy, with investment in Indian industries limited since it was a colony.|$|E
25|$|After {{gaining the}} right to collect revenue in Bengal in 1765, the Company largely ceased {{importing}} gold and silver, which it had hitherto {{used to pay for}} goods shipped back to Britain. In addition, as under Mughal Empire rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the Company's wars in other parts of India. Consequently, in the period 1760–1800, Bengal's money supply was greatly diminished; furthermore, the closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates, and the standardisation of coinage, paradoxically, added to the economic downturn. During the period, 1780–1860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. More specifically, in the 1750s, mostly fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa; by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India's exports. Also, from the late 18th century British cotton mill industry began to lobby the government to both tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in—and soon to inundate—the Indian markets, with the value of the textile imports growing from £5.2 million 1850 to £18.4 million in 1896. The American Civil War too would {{have a major impact on}} India's cotton economy: with the outbreak of the war, American cotton was no longer available to British manufacturers; consequently, demand for <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton</b> soared, and the prices soon quadrupled. This led many farmers in India to switch to cultivating cotton as a quick cash crop; however, with the end of the war in 1865, the demand plummeted again, creating another downturn in the agricultural economy.|$|E

Hon.Rufus Isaacs, the Earl of Reading, P.C; G.C.B; GMSI; GMIE; GCVO; on 3rd, December 1924. Turner worked on several new projects studying <b>Indian</b> <b>cottons,</b> including the American hirsutum cottons that were being tried by the officers of the East India Cotton Association. He streamlined the entire cotton research programmes, co-ordinated the scientists and the Bombay cotton mills, who were the ultimate users of the cotton crop. The best varieties of cotton once recognised, were to be exported to the United Kingdom. The Research papers entitled, [...] "The Foundation of yarn strength", was culminated in many parts, is the best documented series of articles, compiled and edited by him. This work, has been published in The Journal of Textile Institute. He was responsible for many of the technological reports, that flowed from the laboratory and published in the Shirley Institute Memoirs by the Shirley Institute, Didsbury, Manchester. While he was in India, he was ably assisted by R. P. Richardson, the spinning master. After working for six years in India, he was appointed {{as the head of the}} Spinning Department at the Shirley Institute, Manchester, and as head of the British Cotton Industries Research Association BCIRA in 1931. He was offered the post of director of research at the Linen Industry Research Association, Lambeg, Lisburn, in Northern Ireland in 1940 and spent his last 16 years of service there, raising its profile to become accepted as the research centre of the whole linen industry and trade.

From ancient times, India was a major exporter of textiles, sitting at the centre of a complex regional network of exchanges which inserted <b>Indian</b> <b>cottons</b> and silks as prestige items into the textile regimes of societies all around the Indian Ocean. The balance between indigenous production marking local identity and Indian imports marking elite status and trans-local identity was disrupted by {{the spread of the}} competing globalisations of Islam and Christianity. Colonialism expanded networks and forged new connections, redirecting a significant portion of production through metropolitan centres towards a global market and facilitating a dynamic process of cultural exchange. By the late 20 th century India was no longer the dominant player in a regional system, but one of several players in a global system. Nevertheless, within this new system particular networks continue to connect the disparate communities of the Indian Ocean and to play a complex role in negotiating identification with and resistance to competing globalisations...|$|R
