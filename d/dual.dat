5|$|Because the <b>dual</b> graph {{depends on}} a {{particular}} embedding, the <b>dual</b> graph of a planar graph is not unique {{in the sense that}} the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic <b>dual</b> graphs. In the picture, the blue graphs are isomorphic but their <b>dual</b> red graphs are not. The upper red <b>dual</b> has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the outer face of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6.|$|E

5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different <b>dual</b> graphs, testing whether one graph is a <b>dual</b> of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the equivalence relation of having a shared mutual <b>dual.</b> For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the <b>dual</b> graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its <b>dual</b> graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique <b>dual,</b> if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all <b>dual</b> graphs are isomorphic.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} four weighted matching-type problems: the {{bipartite graph}} and general graph versions of matching and f-factors. The linear program <b>duals</b> for {{these problems are}} shown to be weights of certain subgraphs. Specifically the so-called y <b>duals</b> are the weights of certain maximum matchings or f-factors; z <b>duals</b> (used for general graphs) are the weights of certain 2 -factors or 2 f-factors. The y <b>duals</b> are canonical in a well-defined sense; z <b>duals</b> are canonical for matching and more generally for b-matchings (a special case of f-factors) but for f-factors their support can vary. As weights of combinatorial objects the <b>duals</b> are integral for given integral edge weights, and so they give new proofs that the linear programs for these problems are TDI. ...|$|R

5|$|Historically, {{the first}} form of graph duality to be {{recognized}} was the association of the Platonic solids into pairs of <b>dual</b> polyhedra. Graph duality is a topological generalization of the geometric concepts of <b>dual</b> polyhedra and <b>dual</b> tessellations, and is in turn generalized algebraically by {{the concept of a}} <b>dual</b> matroid.

Oregon's program was ranked in the top 3 nationally in <b>dual</b> meets by Track & Field News thirteen times between 1970 and 1996 and was ranked No. 1 three times. The UCLA squad achieved a No. 1 ranking from the same publication eleven times within the same time frame. In 1966, the two programs met head to head for the first time. The Bruins displayed their dominance at the <b>dual</b> meet and won nine straight against the Ducks. Oregon head coach Bill Bowerman in 1971 called the Bruins team the best <b>dual</b> meet team in the country. It wasn't until 1978 that Oregon earned its first victory in the series, which ended UCLA's 34 <b>dual</b> meet winning streak. Oregon won the next three meets and the series ended in 1985 with a UCLA win. The <b>dual</b> meet event was fading out of favor in collegiate track and field and the Oregon-UCLA <b>dual</b> meet was discontinued with UCLA holding the advantage over the Ducks 10–4. In 1994, the Pepsi Team Invitational which included Oregon, UCLA and Washington was scored as a <b>dual</b> meet, which UCLA won. In 2008, the <b>dual</b> meet series between the two schools restarted and Oregon won the first three meets. Although the location of the meet had alternated between Eugene and Los Angeles between 1966 and 1976, subsequent meets have been held at Hayward Field in Oregon until 2011 where the two teams battled to a tie at UCLA. The <b>dual</b> meet was discontinued in 2012 due to scheduling difficulties in an Olympic year.|$|E

In the unramified case, we study relation between the property of being automor-phic (and isolated there), and intrinsic properties of representations. In the case of split classical groups we give combinatorial formulas for the number of isolated representations in the unramified unitary <b>duals</b> (these representations are also isolated representations in the automorphic <b>duals),</b> and for the number of so called strongly negative representations, which can be expected to be sets of isolated representations in the unramified automorphic <b>duals.</b> For the difference of special linear groups, we have plenty of both of these representations.
