40|$|Although margin {{requirements}} would arise naturally {{in the context}} of unregulated trading of clearinghouse-guaranteed derivative contracts, the {{margin requirements}} on U. S. <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivative</b> products are subject to government regulatory oversight. At present, two alternative methodologies are used for margining exchangetraded derivative contracts. Customer positions in securities and securities options are margined using a strategy-based approach. Futures, futures-options, and securitiesoption clearinghouse margins are set using a portfolio margining system. This study evaluates the relative efficiency of these alternative margining techniques using data on S&P 500 futures-option contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The results indicate that the portfolio margining approach isamuch more efficient system for collateralizing the one-day risk exposures of equity derivative portfolios. Given the overwhelming efficiency advantage of the portfolio approach, the simultaneous existence of these alternative margining methods is somewhat puzzling. It is argued that the co-existence of these systems can in part be explained {{in the context of}} Kane's (1984) model of regulatory competition. The efficiency comparison also provides insight into other industry and regulatory issues including the design of bilateral collateralization agreements and the eficiency of alternative schemes that have been proposed for setting regulatory capital requirements for market risk in banks and other financial institutions...|$|R

40|$|Jet {{fuel costs}} have {{substantially}} risen {{over the past}} several years putting consistent pressure on airlines to maintain positive cash flows. While the costs are hedgable, there is not a perfect hedge available in either the over-the-counter or exchange traded derivatives markets. Over-the-counter derivatives on jet fuel are very illiquid which makes them rather expensive and not available in quantities sufficient to hedge all of an airlines jet fuel consumption. <b>Exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> are not available in the United States for jet fuel, so airlines must use futures contracts on commodities that are highly correlated with jet fuel, such as crude and heating oil. As such, airlines employ a variety of strategies ranging from not hedging to fully hedging using a combination of products. This paper is divided into several sections. First, we document the various strategies, including hedging using over-the-counter derivatives, futures contracts, and not hedging, and evaluate the effectiveness and merits of each. We then discuss the accounting rules and the implications these rules have for driving hedging strategies. Finally, we perform an industry survey as of December 31, 2003 and document the practices currently in place in the domestic airline industry to determine whether the use of a hedging strategy appears to create market value. Our research indicates that, contrary to the opinions of many airline executives, the optimal strategy is to employ a dynamic hedging program that is actively managed through the price cycle using a variety of derivative products. Because the airline industry is relatively unhedged at the present, using derivatives to hedge jet fuel costs creates a competitive advantage and has been shown to increase firm value. I. Available Hedging Strategies Domestic airlines have a variety of hedging strategies available to them. These include using both over-the-counter and <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> and remaining unhedged...|$|E
40|$|We use the {{introduction}} of <b>exchange-traded</b> weather <b>derivative</b> contracts as a natural experiment to examine the relation between risk and incentives. In particular, we examine how executives’ ability to hedge uncontrollable weather-related risk that was previously difficult and costly to manage influences the design of executives’ incentive-compensation contracts. We also examine the whether the ability to hedge this important source of uncontrollable risk affects executives’ subsequent risk-taking. We find that the CEOs of firms that are relatively more exposed to uncontrollable weather risk—and therefore stand to benefit the most from hedging this source of risk—receive less annual compensation and have fewer equity incentives following {{the introduction}} of weather derivatives. We attribute the decline in annual compensation {{to a reduction in}} the risk premium that CEOs demand for exposure to uncontrollable risk. We attribute the decline in equity incentives to stock price becoming a more precise measure of CEOs’ actions—and therefore a more informative performance measure—so that fewer shares of stock and stock options are required to provide the same total incentives...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{explain the}} {{features}} of an array of futures contracts and their basic pricing relationships and describe a few applications to show how investors and risk managers can use these contracts. Futures - and derivatives generally - allow economic agents to fine-tune the structure of their assets and liabilities to suit their risk preferences and market expectations. Futures are not a financing or investment vehicle per se, but a tool for transferring price risks associated with fluctuations in asset values. Some may use them to spread risk, others to take on risk. Financial futures (along with options) are best viewed as building blocks. Futures have facilitated the modern trend of separating conventional financial products into their basic components. They allow not only the reduction of transformation of investment risk but also the understanding and measurement of risk. The market for derivatives has grown enormously over the past decade. The value of <b>exchange-traded</b> eurodollar <b>derivatives</b> (futures and options) is equal to roughly 13 times {{the value of the}} underlying market. The volume of trading in financial futures now dwarfs the volume in traditional agricultural contracts. As emerging markets develop, given their inherently risky nature, expect financial futures to play a prominent role in risk management.
