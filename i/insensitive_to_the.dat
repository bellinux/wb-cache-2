5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis {{can be seen}} during pregnancy. Acne can be {{a side effect of}} testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind {{to a halt and}} the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E

5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E

Argall was succeeded by Sir George Yeardley in 1619 (who named a son Argall in his honor). Back in London, Argall was cleared of these accusations and continued his steady rise at court as a useful servant of King James I.|$|E

Davie M proposed using particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem; Ikeda T proposed a heuristic algorithm {{which is based on}} A* search algorithm; Bimey E first proposed using hidden Markov model to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem; and many other biologists use genetic algorithm to solve it. All these algorithms generally are robust and <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of sequences, but they also have shortcoming, for example, the result got from particle swarm optimization algorithm is unstable and its merits depend on the selection of random numbers, the runtime of A * search algorithm is too long and the genetic algorithm is easy to fall into local excellent.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of the ESTJ {{are found in the}} primary combination of extraverted thinking as their dominant function and introverted sensing as their auxiliary function: the dominant tendency of ESTJs to order their environment, to set clear boundaries, to clarify roles and timetables, and to direct the activities around them is supported by their facility for using past experience in an ordered and systematic way to help organize themselves and others. For instance, ESTJs may enjoy planning trips for groups of people to achieve some goal or to perform some culturally uplifting function. Because of their ease in directing others and their facility in managing their own time, they engage all the resources at their disposal to achieve their goals. However, under prolonged stress or sudden trauma, ESTJs may overuse their extraverted thinking function and fall into the grip of their inferior function, introverted feeling. Although the ESTJ can seem <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feelings of others in their normal activities, under tremendous stress, they can suddenly express feelings of being unappreciated or wounded by insensitivity.|$|E
25|$|While {{very few}} {{mutations}} in CNGB3 have been characterized, {{the vast majority}} of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional, table 2. This will largely result in haploinsufficiency, though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a dominant negative fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the cell membrane. The three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity. The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP. It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.|$|E
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Wijnberg {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} {{the presence of}} several structurally related antifungal compounds called benzoxepines in the latex of Mycena galopus. One of these compounds, 6-hydroxypterulone, is a derivative of pterulone, a potent antifungal metabolite first isolated from submerged cultures of Pterula species in 1997. The antifungal activity of pterulone is based on selective inhibition of the NADH dehydrogenase enzyme of the electron transport chain. A 2008 publication reported that fatty acid esters of benzoxepine serve as precursors to wound-activated chemical defense. When the fruit body is injured and the latex is exposed, an esterase enzyme (an enzyme that splits esters into an acid and an alcohol in a chemical reaction with water called hydrolysis) presumably cleaves the inactive esterified benzoxepines into their active forms, where they can help defend the mushroom against yeasts and parasitic fungi. In nature, the mushroom is rarely attacked by parasitic fungi, however, it is prone to infection by the [...] "bonnet mold" [...] Spinellus fusiger, which is <b>insensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> benzoxepines of M.galopus. In an English field study, where the two fungi M.galopus and Marasmius androsaceus made up over 99% of the fruit bodies in a site under Sitka spruce, the fungivorous collembolan arthropod Onychiurus latus preferred to graze on the mycelium of M.androsaceus. This selective grazing influences the vertical distribution of the two fungi in the field.|$|E
