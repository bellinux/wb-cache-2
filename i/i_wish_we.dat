They found help from Tom McKnight and George Oppenheimer, whose names were passed along to Groucho. Perrin explained, [...] " [...] was in the men's room during a break, and he was {{complaining}} to the guy standing next to him, 'Geez, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could find another writer or two to make life easier.' Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!' Having Tom and George did make life easier, although Arthur and I went over their scripts for a light polishing." ...|$|E
500|$|As of December 2013, Oppong is a {{full-time}} student at the University of Windsor teacher's college. Prior to 2013, he notified the Oshawa Power front office about his plans {{to pursue a career}} in education, leading to his trade to the Windsor Express. In the case that Windsor had to play out of their division, his basketball career forced him to miss a few days of school. Oppong has experience as a student-teacher at Catholic Central High School in Windsor, Ontario. In late 2013, he said, [...] "It's been challenging. It's a matter of juggling things and time management. I'm really grateful the Windsor Express have worked with me and supported me." [...] Express head coach Bill Jones commented, [...] "I really like Papa and respect what he's doing. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could have the kid with us every day because I'm sure he'd have a bigger role with us but he's doing what he can and playing 22 minutes a game and playing them hard." [...] Oppong became the third member of his family to attend the University of Windsor, following his sister. He plans to become either a physical education or history teacher once he gets his teaching certificate. While at Eastern Kentucky University, he intentionally majored in general studies so that he could attend teacher's college for one year.|$|E

To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
500|$|Benfica {{started their}} {{season with the}} third {{qualifying}} round of the Champions League, attempting to make their first presence in the group stage since 1998–99. On 10 August, Benfica beat Anderlecht 1–0 after Zlatko Zahovič scored in the 13th minute. When asked why Anderlecht had more goal opportunities than Benfica, Trapattoni said, [...] "Do you know international football? It is very balanced nowadays. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> had more chances but our opponent was stronger." [...] Following the win, Benfica were due to meet Porto in the Supercup on 20 August. Ricardo Quaresma of Porto scored the only goal {{of the game in}} an individual effort. It was Benfica's tenth consencutive loss in the competition; the previous win occurred in 1989. Four days later, Benfica travelled to Belgium to play Anderlecht. The home team scored first by Aruna Dindane, who scored another on the hour-mark. Nenad Jestrović scored the last goal. Trapattoni blamed fatigue and anxiety for the defeat, saying, [...] "I said we would try to score, but lacked composure to do so. In the first half {{he spent a lot of}} energy. On the second, we tried to fight back, until he conceded a second goal, which killed us." [...] The fans insulted the team on their arrival in Lisbon. On 29 August, Benfica made their debut in the Primeira Liga by visiting Beira-Mar. Two goals in the first half and another within five minutes of the second, gave Benfica a lead that help them beat the locals.|$|E
500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at where we are now, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> had better choices".|$|E

The carved marble {{fireplace}} was taken from an old Louisiana plantation home. Hill chose parquet flooring and a gold and white color scheme for the entire room. The pianos were placed at one end, with French provincial sofas cushioned by an oriental carpet at the other end. Gold and white silk wall panels concealed shelves for records, music-related books, and Hill's musical instruments. Hill had 108 speakers installed in the room, connected with four miles of wiring. He spent more than $20,000 on the room's sound system. Hill also added a hidden movie screen on which to project his collection of comedy films, which was also hidden {{behind one of the}} silk wall panels. [...] The room became a bone of contention; Joan was angry about the amount of money her husband had poured into realizing his dream. During their 1968 separation, she had confided in Patti Gordon, a friend who owned a restaurant, that the music room had been central to their troubles.

2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, juror number three—Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student—told ABC News, [...] "I {{did not say}} she was innocent" [...] and [...] "I {{just said}} {{there was not enough}} evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot {{determine}} what the punishment should be." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," [...] but that [...] "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" [...] via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was [...] "dishonest." [...] She said the jury [...] "was sick to [...] stomachs to get [...] verdict" [...] and that the decision process overwhelmed them {{to the point where they}} did not want to talk to reporters afterwards. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the St. Petersburg Times that [...] "everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, [...] was done". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not-guilty verdict: [...] "I just swear to God... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> had more evidence to put her away. I truly do... But it wasn't there." [...] He also said that Anthony was [...] "not a good person in my opinion". Juror number six, identified by WTSP as Brian Berling, told gossip website TMZ.com that he was willing to be interviewed [...] "so long as the opportunities are paid".|$|E

2500|$|After {{taking over}} command in mid-1862, Lee began {{preparing}} {{to lead the}} Army of Northern Virginia for the first time. However, his aggressiveness to attack the Union led {{to the loss of}} many troops especially at the Battle of Antietam, which ended up being {{a turning point in the}} war for the Union. After the costly victories during the Seven Days Battles and at Second Manassas in August 1862, Lee had now lost a total of 30,000 of his approximately 92,000 troops within three months of becoming the Confederate's top general. Lee then planned to take his troops north into Maryland to destroy a critical railroad bridge across the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg in a letter written to President Davis. Lee even questioned his own plan, as he wrote, [...] "I am aware that the movement is attended with much risk, yet I do not consider success impossible..." [...] In addition, historians question Lee's aggressiveness to move his army to Maryland. [...] "There can be no sort of doubt that Lee underestimated the exhaustion of his army after Second Manassas. That is, in reality, the major criticism of the Maryland operation: he carried worn-out men across the Potomac." [...] His men were also underarmed and underfed, so the journey to Maryland added to the overall exhaustion. Once Lee arrived in Maryland and was preparing for Antietam, he made another controversial decision. Against the advice from General Longstreet and Jackson, Lee split his troops into four parts to attack the Union from different fronts. Clearly outnumbered and opposed to Lee's plan, Longstreet stated, [...] "General, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could stand still and let the damned Yankees come to us!" [...] As the fighting played out on September 17, 1862, known as the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, the battles at Dunker Church and Burnside's Bridge proved to be too much for Lee and his Confederate army. Luckily for Lee, the arrival of A.P. Hill's troops and the mixture of McClellan's and Burnside's sluggishness, saved Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and allowed them to barely hold off the Union in Maryland.|$|E
