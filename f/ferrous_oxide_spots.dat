One of several iron oxides, it is a black-colored powder that is sometimes confused with rust, the latter of which consists of hydrated iron(III) oxide (ferric oxide).

30|$|Red {{ceramics}} {{were produced}} by heating (750 °C) samples of mixtures of reddish yellow colored kaolinite clay with waste glass (percentage ranging between 0 and 15 % mass). The chemical {{analysis of the}} clay revealed both low content of alkaline oxides and rich amount of <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide.</b> The mineralogical characterization of the clay revealed the presence of minerals such as kaolinite, quartz α, rutile, lepidocrocite and others unconfirmed phases attributed particularly to organic matter as confirmed by thermal analysis. Waste glass {{can be considered as}} potential fluxing additive that can substitute feldspars in terra cotta for low heating temperature production. Hence increasing the mass percentage of waste glass in mixtures with kaolinite clay leads to fired products whose linear shrinkage and flexural strength increase while there is decrease of water absorption. This is attributed to the densification of samples via the viscous flow mechanism induced by a vitreous phase brought about by the fusion of waste glass. The obtained results show that mixing waste glass with poorly alkaline <b>oxide</b> and abundant <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide</b> kaolinite clay content is an interesting process to get red ceramics destined for the making of bricks or roofing tiles at 750 °C.|$|R

50|$|However, {{after its}} adoption, this {{technology}} was indeed adapted for local use. While the tatara has commonalities with other South Asian furnace designs, {{including those of}} Sri Lanka and Cambodia, the local materials {{for use in the}} blast furnace were remarkably different. The main source of ores for Japanese steel was iron sand, a sand-like substance which accumulated as an end product of the erosion of granite and andesite in mountainous regions of Japan. Importantly, it was less labor-intensive to extract the ore from the sand than from hard rock. Furthermore, this sand could be obtained by surface mining, rather than more laborious mining process. However, these sands had a much lower percentage of iron than that typically found in rock-ores, only 2-5% <b>Ferrous</b> <b>Oxide,</b> as compared to 79-87% <b>Ferrous</b> <b>Oxide</b> in certain Sri Lankan ores, for example. Since this smaller percentage of iron would inevitably lead to smaller blooms, Japanese metal workers would have been very familiar with the process of combining blooms. Given these environmental constraints, the most effective solution was to combine certain types of blooms, and through trial-and-error, early sword smiths were able to determine that the most effective combinations of blooms (for swords) were those {{at the bottom of the}} tatara.|$|R

25|$|For such iron-rich {{rocks to}} be {{deposited}} {{there would have}} to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide)</b> could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice, while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.|$|R

50|$|When impure (cast) iron is {{in contact}} with water, oxygen, other strong oxidants, or acids, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in {{seawater}} or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, {{as a result of}} electrochemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide</b> layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water.|$|R

Ferric chloride and <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxides</b> were used as catalysts to promote reaction, and 5 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -one (NTO) was theoretically synthesized under an inert gas (X 6) -clustered envi-ronment in this study. The raw material, urea, initially underwent chlorination using chlorine as the reagent, followed by amination, formylation and nitration. Reaction routes closely related to the experimental processes were successfully constructed, and the corresponding energy barriers were estimated for each elementary reaction. The findings revealed that the average errors in the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d, p) -calculated geometry and vibrational frequency of NTO in an Ne 6 sys-tem relative to the observed values were 0. 83 % and 1. 84 %, respectively. The neon gas-clustered system achieved greater stabilization, which results from the difference in self-consistent field energy (ESCF), than the corresponding sta-bilization acquired in a helium- or argon-based system. Ferric chloride serves as a good catalyst to reduce the energy barrier of the chlorination reaction, and <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide</b> is suitable for catalyzing the amination, formylation and nitration reactions, although nitric acid is the better agent for nitration.

Authors {{investigation}} in 5 m are enough for pipe diluted solutions of ferric chloride {{on the one}} hand and of Humin substances (peat water) on the other hand on their color. One compares the dilution concerned with the content to iron and organic substances of our seas, lakes and flux, then it resulted that the water of these natural runs and basins would have to look to black brown instead of blue to green. An explanation for this difference resulted from the experiment to examine a mixture of diluted ferric salt solution and Humin substances solution for its color. Such a mixture is colored in the beginning dark, but under the influence of light more brightly and more brightly, as turbidity sit down to ground. The Humin substances is oxidized and to connect itself in more highly oxidized with metal oxides to insoluble compounds. With this process ferric oxide is reduced to <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide,</b> whose color is hardly possible. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>oxide</b> can take up oxygen from air in the natural water again and exercise now as ferric compound its function with the elimination one the Humin substances again.

The light fractions of two Chinese coals were prepared using a 1. 5 g·cm− 3 ZnCl 2 solution as a density separation medium and were burned in a drop-tube furnace (DTF). The mineral matter {{in each of the}} light coal fractions was compared to that of the relevant raw coal. The DTF ash from light coal fractions was analysed using hydrochloric acid separation. The acid-soluble aluminium fractions of DTF ash samples were used to determine changes in the amorphous aluminosilicate products with increasing combustion temperature. The results show that the clay mineral contents in the mineral matter of both light coal fractions were higher than those in the respective raw coals. For the coal with a high ash melting point, clay minerals in the light coal fraction thermally transformed more dehydroxylation products compared with those in the raw coal, possibly contributing to solid-state reactions of ash particles. For the coal with a low ash melting point, clay minerals in the light coal fraction produced more easily-slagging material compared with those in the raw coal, playing {{an important role in the}} occurrence of slagging.
