25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She {{wrote a letter to the}} author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

[...] and Hanneman took Rubin's advice. Only a demo was recorded, consisting of Hanneman on vocals and bass, Lombardo on drums and George on guitar. Later two of the songs were re-recorded on Slayer's 1996 album Undisputed Attitude.|$|E

500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{gave the}} song a four (out of five)-star rating, and wrote that its {{production}} {{was of a}} [...] "summer anthem level". Corner said the track felt [...] "slightly lighter" [...] than Azalea's previous releases, adding: [...] "... but if it means she crosses over into superstardom territory, it's a job well done". While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity".

2500|$|To Judge Rich, {{even though}} section 101 says [...] "whoever invents or discovers," [...] {{there is no}} basis for {{importing}} into the analysis any inquiry {{into the nature of}} what it is that the patent applicants purports to have invented, and whether it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that can be patented as an invention. Thus, when the Flook Court says that Flook's process {{is not the kind of}} process that the patent law permits to be patented, even though it is a process in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word, Judge Rich finds the inquiry impermissible because [...] "§ 101 was never intended to be a 'standard of patentability'; the standards, or conditions as the statute calls them, are in § 102 and § 103." [...] The only legitimate question, he says, is whether the claimed subject matter is [...] "new, useful, and unobvious." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{law which}} is {{applicable}} {{to this case}} is section 101 of the Patent Act. If Flook's patent claim can meet {{the definition of a}} [...] "process" [...] under that law then it is patent-eligible (that is, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that can receive a patent if it is also novel, unobvious, and the like). The Court decided that the patent claim under review was instead a claim to a [...] "principle" [...] or a [...] "law of nature" [...] and thus not patent-eligible. The Court relied on a line of cases following from the Neilson blast furnace case. The principle of that case, as explained in O’Reilly v. Morse, is that that patent-eligibility must be analyzed on the basis of it being as if the principle, algorithm, or mathematical formula were already well known (was in the prior art). Flook's process is thus ineligible for a patent [...] "because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention."

2500|$|By {{walking out}} of her contract, Varsi's {{participation}} or consideration to several films were cancelled, including a starring role in The Best of Everything (1959). After leaving Hollywood, Varsi played in several small plays in San Francisco. At some point thereafter, {{she made her way}} to New York long enough to successfully audition for the Actors Studio, which she would attend at least briefly in 1965. As a result of being released from her contract, Varsi returned to film acting in the late 1960s, but by this time she was no longer being offered major film roles. She called the films she made in this period [...] "cheap films of little merit". She furthermore said that although producers were curious, they would not hire her. [...] Her later films include Johnny Got His Gun in 1971, a film which Varsi described as her favorite, and a 1972 ABC-TV [...] "Movie of the Week", titled The People. Of Johnny Got His Gun, the actress said: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> I always wanted to do. It comes very late to me. It's been a long time to wait."
