5|$|Unlike most breeds, {{there is}} a set naming system {{that is used to}} {{identify}} individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. <b>First</b> <b>comes</b> the prefix, the farm or breeding establishment of which the foal was born into, followed by the sire's name, and lastly the given name for the foal. Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the given name for the foal, and it is by the year's letter that the foal is named. Some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy, but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines. Originally, horses were tattooed with identification numbers, but now microchipping is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry.|$|E

40|$|Balachandran and Schaefer (1979) {{show that}} {{if in the}} {{individual}} optimum class A dominates with a <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue, there could exist cases where in the public optimum class B dominates. We derive conditions under which providing a nonpreemptive priority allows both classes of users to use the facility and get a higher expected public net benefit than the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. The class that is provided the higher priority may or not be the class that dominates in the public optimum under the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. That means that introducing a priority scheme may switch the class that is given preference in the public optimum. It is shown that there exist situations where the class that is granted the higher priority for service could be levied a lower price than the class that is granted the lower priority. In the case where the users alone have perfect information on the value from using the facility, we derive conditions under which a non preemptive priority is superior to the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. The preemptive priority resume queue is not necessarily always superior to the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue.

25|$|In the novel, {{the battle}} is not seen until Aslan, Susan, Lucy and their {{reinforcements}} arrive. This was changed in the movie because Adamson said he could vividly remember a huge battle, {{an example of how}} Lewis left a lot to the readers' imagination. Other small changes include the reason all four children come to Narnia, in that an accident breaks a window and forces them to hide. Tumnus also never meets Edmund until the end in the novel. Minor details were added to the Pevensies, such as their mother's name, Helen, being the actual first name of Georgie Henley's mother. Finchley as the home of the Pevensies was inspired by Anna Popplewell, who actually is from Finchley. Adamson also changed the circumstances in which Lucy <b>first</b> <b>comes</b> into Narnia. He felt it was more natural that she first see the wardrobe while looking for a hide-and-seek hiding place, rather than just chance upon it exploring the house. The film also hints at Professor Kirke's role in The Magician's Nephew, such as the engravings on the wardrobe, when it is a simple one in the novel, and the Professor's surprise and intrigue when Peter and Susan mention Lucy's discovery in the wardrobe. When Lewis wrote the novel, {{it was the first of}} the series and the back-story later outlined by the subsequent books in the series did not exist. Additionally in the novel, the father of the Pevensie children is in London with their mother, but in the film, their father is fighting in the war as Lucy states to Mr. Tumnus when they first meet in Narnia.|$|E

Then, Kelis recorded her vocals at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and wrote her own words in the song, {{from the point of}} view of the continents. Originally not intended to be commercially released, the remix leaked after being played on BBC Radio 1's The Breezeblock, but was then included on the [...] "Who Is It" [...] single as a B-side. According to The Guardian, [...] "it's a brilliant fusing together of two distinct voices, Kelis handling the breathy first verse, as layers of her chopped-up vocals form the rhythm track, while Björk at <b>first</b> <b>comes</b> across as restrained, allowing Kelis' ad-libs to soar before unleashing a song-stopping, wordless roar that heralds the song's dramatic final coda".|$|E
