5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore <b>is</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E

The lectotype was selected by Don MacGillivray in 1993 from a collection by George Caley in 1803 11km (7mi) northwest of Prospect {{in what is now}} Sydney's outer western suburbs. Brown placed it in the series Lissostylis in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen.|$|E
