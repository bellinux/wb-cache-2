25|$|Modern rockets {{originated}} when Goddard {{attached a}} supersonic (de Laval) nozzle to the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant rocket. These nozzles turn the hot {{gas from the}} combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency</b> from 2% to 64%.|$|E
25|$|Comparing {{the rocket}} {{equation}} (which {{shows how much}} energy {{ends up in the}} final vehicle) and the above equation (which shows the total energy required) shows that even with 100% <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency,</b> certainly not all energy supplied ends up in the vehicle - some of it, indeed usually most of it, ends up as kinetic energy of the exhaust.|$|E
5000|$|Thus {{a diesel}} <b>engine's</b> <b>efficiency</b> = 1/(BSFC × 0.0119531) and a {{gasoline}} <b>engine's</b> <b>efficiency</b> = 1/(BSFC × 0.0122225) ...|$|R

50|$|A {{diesel cycle}} engine {{can be as}} much as 40% to 50% {{efficient}} at converting fuel into work, where a typical automotive gasoline <b>engine's</b> <b>efficiency</b> is about 25% to 30%.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the spark}} voltage is also {{dependent}} on contact effectiveness, and poor sparking {{can lead to}} lower <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency.</b> A mechanical contact breaker system cannot control an average ignition current of more than about 3 A while still giving a reasonable service life, and this may limit {{the power of the}} spark and ultimate engine speed.|$|E
25|$|Modern rockets {{originated}} when Goddard {{attached a}} supersonic (de Laval) nozzle to the combustion chamber of a liquid-fueled rocket engine. These nozzles turn the hot {{gas from the}} combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency</b> from 2% to 64%. On 16 March 1926 Robert Goddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket in Auburn, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Bleed {{air systems}} have been in use for several decades in {{passenger}} jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems {{to be replaced by}} electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the Boeing 787, each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency,</b> lower weight, and ease of maintenance.|$|E
50|$|In {{heat engines}} such as jet <b>engines,</b> <b>efficiency</b> is best when {{combustion}} is {{done at the}} highest pressure and temperature possible, and expanded down to ambient pressure (see Carnot cycle).|$|R
50|$|If it {{were not}} for air {{resistance}} and the reduction of propellant during flight, specific impulse would be a direct measure of the <b>engine's</b> <b>efficiency</b> in converting propellant weight or mass into forward momentum.|$|R
50|$|In {{thermodynamic}}s, {{work output}} {{can refer to}} the thermodynamic work done by a heat engine, {{in which case the}} amount of work output must be less than the input as energy is lost to heat, as determined by the <b>engine's</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|R
25|$|However, as speeds rise, the {{resultant}} exhaust speed goes down, {{and the overall}} vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency</b> when the vehicle is travelling exactly {{at the same speed}} that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up travelling forwards- trailing behind the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Acceleration {{increased}} during S-IC flight {{for three}} reasons. One, increased acceleration increased the propellant pressure at the engines, increasing the flow rate somewhat. This {{was the least}} important factor, though this feedback effect often led to an undesirable thrust oscillation called pogo. Two, as it climbed into thinner air F-1 <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency</b> increased significantly, a property of all rockets. The combined thrust of five engines on the pad was about 7.5 million pounds, reaching nearly 9 million pounds at altitude. But the biggest contribution by far was the rocket's rapidly decreasing mass. The propellant in just the S-IC made up about three-quarters of Saturn V's entire launch mass, and it was furiously consumed at over 13 metric tonnes per second. Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or equivalently that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass, so as the mass decreased (and the force increased somewhat), acceleration rose. Including gravity, launch acceleration was only 1¼g, i.e., the astronauts felt 1¼g while the rocket accelerated vertically at ¼g. As the rocket rapidly lost mass, total acceleration including gravity increased to nearly 4g at T+135 seconds. At this point, the inboard (center) engine was shut down to prevent acceleration from increasing beyond 4g.|$|E

30|$|ATD is an {{important}} dependent factor related to the fuel efficiency. According Williams (2007); Parker [61]; Graham et al. [24] and Miyoshi and Ibáñez [55] the technological advancement {{has resulted in a}} positive trend of fuel efficiency. ATD was measured from <b>engine</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> aerodynamic efficiencies, and structural <b>efficiencies</b> [4, 51]. <b>Engine</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were expressed in term of engine thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC), lower value of TSFC result in better fuel efficiency [4, 25]. Aerodynamic efficiencies were evaluated in term of lift/drag (L/D) ratio [74]; higher value of lift/drag ratio can result in improved fuel efficiency. Structural efficiencies were assessed in term of ratio of operating empty weight (OEW) to maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) [4, 73]. The use of advanced composite material has reduced the structural weight of aircrafts [76]. Therefore, our construct include the TSFC, L/D ratio, OEW, and MTOW for the measurement of ATD dimension.|$|R

500|$|As {{with most}} US naval designs, coal storage and <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency</b> were more {{important}} than in European designs. US ships might have to fight far from their home shores, especially in the Pacific. Even in the Caribbean, US forces might be farther from their coaling stations than a European power with colonial bases. Draft was a concern, since southern US harbors tended to have shallow entrances, and some proponents felt that all ships {{should be able to}} egress all major harbors. [...] Beams were typically limited by the width of dry docks.|$|E

Cunard attempted to reduce the carbon footprint of Queen Mary 2 by improving <b>engine</b> <b>efficiency</b> and reducing friction while the ship is in motion. In November 2008, the ship was given a refit in Hamburg, part of which involved the repainting of the hull in paint {{which is designed to}} reduce drag and improve fuel economy.

25|$|A turbocharger, or colloquially turbo, is a turbine-driven forced {{induction}} {{device that}} increases an internal combustion <b>engine's</b> <b>efficiency</b> and power output by forcing extra {{air into the}} combustion chamber.
