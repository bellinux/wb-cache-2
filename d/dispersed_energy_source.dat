40|$|In this paper, an {{application}} of superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is proposed to limit the fault current that occurs in power system, SFCL is a device that uses superconductors to instantaneously limit or reduce unanticipated electrical surges that may occur on utility distribution and transmission networks. At the time of fault occurs in the line, a large surge of power can be sent through the grid resulting in a fault. These faults can result in damage to expensive grid connected devices. SFCL's eliminate or greatly reduce the financial burden on the utilities by reducing the wear on circuit breakers and protecting other expensive equipment. Utilities can reduce or eliminate the cost of circuit breakers and fuses by installing SFCL. As for a <b>dispersed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> 10 MVA wind farm with three units connected and the total was simulated. Three phase faults have been simulated at different locations in smart grid {{and the effect of}} the SFCL and its location on the wind farm fault current was evaluated. Three wind farms were considered and their performance is also evaluated. Consequently, the optimum arrangement of the SFCL location in Smart Grid with renewable resources has been proposed and its remarkable performance has been suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy market}} {{paradigm}} shift towards {{the so called}} “green revolution ” assumes {{that in the next}} few decades <b>dispersed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> will replace centralized generation systems. Despite growing energy related spatial conflicts, already accompanying the devel-opment of dispersed generation, {{it is not clear how}} to integrate new energy infrastructure into planning procedures.

40|$|Both the {{coordination}} of international energy transfer and the integration of a rapidly growing number of decentralized energy resources (DER) throughout most countries cause novel problems for avoiding voltage band violations and line overloads. Traditional approaches are typically based on global off-line scheduling under globally available information and rely on iterative procedures that can guarantee neither convergence nor execution time. In this paper, we focus on operational limitation problems in power grids based on widely <b>dispersed</b> (renewable) <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> We introduce an extension to the DEZENT algorithm, a multi-agent based coordination system for DER, that allows for the feasibility verification in constant and predetermined time.

40|$|Abstract – The {{increasing}} {{contribution of}} <b>Dispersed</b> and Renewable <b>Energy</b> <b>Sources</b> (DER) to the peak power balance {{of up to}} 60 % and {{the goals of the}} European Community for the year 2010 require innovative approaches {{in order to maintain the}} sustainability of the power supply. Sustainability in this context requires that DER significantly support system services like frequency control, power balance, voltage control or supply restoration after failures. For this, remote information exchange with the respective DER units will become necessary. Consequently, interoperable and scaleable communication solutions play a key role for sustainability in power systems with an increasing share of DER. The “Network for energy and communication ” (NEaC) which was founded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, is a consortium that elaborates requirements...|$|R
50|$|Radiant {{systems are}} {{associated}} with low-exergy systems. Low-exergy refers to the possibility to utilize ‘low quality energy’ (i.e. <b>dispersed</b> <b>energy</b> that has little ability to do useful work). Both heating and cooling can in principle be obtained at temperature levels that {{are close to the}} ambient environment. The low temperature difference requires that the heat transmission takes place over relative big surfaces as for example applied in ceilings or underfloor heating systems.Radiant systems using low temperature heating and high temperature cooling are typical example of low-exergy systems. <b>Energy</b> <b>sources</b> such as geothermal (direct cooling / geothermal heat pump heating) and solar hot water are compatible with radiant systems. These sources can lead to important savings in terms of primary energy use for buildings.|$|R

Jacobson {{report that}} {{there are at least}} seven ways to design and operate {{variable}} renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand: *(A) interconnect geographically <b>dispersed,</b> naturally variable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (e.g., wind, solar, wave, tidal), which smoothes out electricity supply (and demand) significantly.*(B) use complementary and non-variable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (such as hydroelectric power) to fill temporary gaps between demand and wind or solar generation.*(C) use [...] "smart" [...] demand-response management to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available.*(D) store electric power, at the site of generation, (in batteries, hydrogen gas, molten salts, compressed air, pumped hydroelectric power, and flywheels), for later use.*(E) over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses.*(F) store electric power in electric-vehicle batteries, known as [...] "vehicle to grid" [...] or V2G.*(G) forecast the weather (winds, sunlight, waves, tides and precipitation) to better plan for energy supply needs.Jacobson and Delucchi argue that wind, water and solar power can be scaled up in cost-effective ways to meet our energy demands, freeing us from dependence on both fossil fuels and nuclear power. In 2009 they published [...] "A Plan to Power 100 Percent of the Planet With Renewables" [...] in Scientific American. The article addressed a number of issues, such as the worldwide spatial footprint of wind turbines, the availability of scarce materials needed for manufacture of new systems, the ability to produce reliable energy on demand and the average cost per kilowatt hour. A more detailed and updated technical analysis has been published as a two-part article in the journal Energy Policy.|$|R
40|$|The current {{regulatory}} framework for approving long-distance, interstate electric transmission lines does not match the physical aspects of the interstate electric grid, regional electricity markets, or the growing but <b>dispersed</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> increasingly used to power the grid. Despite the interstate nature of the electric grid and electricity markets, the states have virtually complete authority over the siting and permitting of interstate transmission lines. Continuing state authority over {{the development of the}} interstate transmission grid is puzzling when compared to the nation’s network of interstate natural gas pipelines, for which regulatory authority was transferred to the federal government in the 1940 s. The question for this Article is whether the history surrounding the transfer of regulatory authority over interstate natural gas pipelines can be instructive in planning {{for the future of the}} electric grid. This Article shows that that there was a moment in time in the 1940 s when natural gas, which for a century had been limited in its commercial use because of lack of transportation from well sites to cities, became a critical energy resource for the entire nation. At that time, Congress responded by creating a federal regulatory process to build the interstate pipeline network necessary to transport this resource after state regulatory authorities had blocked such pipelines. This Article then suggests that the electric grid is nearing a crossroads that justifies a similar shift in regulatory authority over the grid, although not necessarily using the same framework Congress created for siting interstate natural gas pipelines. Instead, this Article proposes a regional model for siting interstate transmission lines rather than the purely federal approach used for interstate natural gas pipelines. It sets forth various options for regional siting approaches, including interstate compacts under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to create separate, regional siting authorities; granting Regional Transmission Organizations (“RTOs”) siting authority over interstate transmission lines within their footprints; and federal mandates on state public utility commissions and courts to consider regional benefits and needs in making siting and eminent domain determinations...|$|R
