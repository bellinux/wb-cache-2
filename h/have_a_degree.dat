5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, 16.91% of Juniata County {{residents}} over 25 {{years of}} age had less than a ninth-grade education. 17.93% of residents over 25 {{years of age}} had a ninth-grade education to a twelfth-grade education and 46.35% had graduated from high school. 7.80% of the residents had attended college, but did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> and 3.76% had an associate degree. 4.67% of Juniata County residents aged 25 years or more had a bachelor's degree and 2.59% had a graduate or professional degree.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which the {{educational}} attainments of a generation are reproduced in Great Britain. We address a very specific question [...] what was the effect, among people born around the middle of the 20 th century, of <b>having</b> acquired <b>a</b> University <b>degree</b> on the probability of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child who also acquires <b>a</b> <b>degree?</b> We consider the two central processes involved: the effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> on whether or not <b>a</b> person <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child and, conditional on having at least one child, the effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> on whether at least one child acquired <b>a</b> <b>degree.</b> We find <b>a</b> strong and persistent negative effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> on the chances of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child but, among those who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child, the possession of <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> large positive effect on the probability of that child also acquiring <b>a</b> <b>degree.</b> These two effects largely cancel out and thus <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very small effect on the chances of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child who also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree.</b> One major advantage of adopting the prospective approach used here is that it helps to better answer questions concerning the intergenerational effects of changes in education...|$|R
5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model {{such as the}} Bühlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, {{there is still much}} that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon for them to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Gowing {{attempted}} to negotiate better {{conditions at the}} University of Kent that would allow more {{time to work on}} the books, but this was denied.

Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> in history or science.|$|E
