5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff <b>dwellings,</b> houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff <b>dwellings</b> of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|The Silver Reef {{area was}} first {{inhabited}} by Anasazi Native Americans between about 200AD and 1300AD.

They were also farmers and gardeners, growing corn, wheat, rye, and barley. Many were potters, and pottery {{can be found in}} abandoned villages. The Anasazi usually constructed temporary <b>dwellings</b> out of sticks and leaves, often using bark for the roofs. Occasionally they built more permanent <b>dwellings</b> out of rocks, usually along the side of a mountain, often large enough to accommodate several families. Storage pits were often placed behind the rock <b>dwellings.</b> Settlements were typically small, as food was scarce.

5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff <b>dwellings</b> were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff <b>dwellings,</b> warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff <b>dwellings.</b>|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{why and how}} {{students}} interact with educational videos is essential to further {{improve the quality of}} MOOCs. In this paper, we look at the complexity of videos to explain two related aspects of student behavior: the <b>dwelling</b> time (how much time students spend watching a video) and the <b>dwelling</b> rate (how much of the video they actually see). Building on a strong tradition of psycholinguistics, we formalize a definition for information complexity in videos. Furthermore, building on recent advancements in time-on-task measures we formalize <b>dwelling</b> time and <b>dwelling</b> rate based on click-stream trace data. The resulting computational model of video complexity explains 22. 44 % {{of the variance in the}} <b>dwelling</b> rate for students that finish watching a paragraph of a video. Video complexity and student <b>dwelling</b> show a polynomial relationship, where both low and high complexity increases <b>dwelling.</b> These results indicate why students spend more time watching (and possibly contemplating about) a video. Furthermore, they show that even fairly straightforward proxies of student behavior such as <b>dwelling</b> can already have multiple interpretations; illustrating the challenge of sense-making from learning analytics...|$|R

40|$|Cooking {{emission}} samples {{collected in}} two residential kitchens were compared where towngas (denoted as <b>dwelling</b> A) and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG) (denoted as <b>dwelling</b> B) were used as cooking fuels. A total of 50 different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were quantified during the 90 min cooking periods. None of any carcinogenic compounds like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or benzene are detected in the raw fuels, confirming that those are almost entirely derived due to cooking activity alone. Alkenes accounted for approximately 53 % of the total measured VOCs collected at <b>dwelling</b> A. while alkanes contributed approximately 95 % of the VOCs at <b>dwelling</b> B during the cooking periods. The concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene also increased during the cooking periods. The total amount of carbonyls emitted from the cooking processes at <b>dwelling</b> A (2708 mu g) is three times higher than that at <b>dwelling</b> B (793 mu g). Acetaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl at the <b>dwelling</b> A but its emission was insignificant at the <b>dwelling</b> B. Carcinogenic risks on chronic exposure to formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and benzene for housewives and domestic helpers were evaluated. Formaldehyde accounts for 68 % and close to 100 % of lifetime cancer risks at <b>dwelling</b> A and B, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
