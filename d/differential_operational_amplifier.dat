40|$|ISBN 978 - 1 - 4244 - 6649 - 8 International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an approach for ordering analog specification (or functional) tests {{that is based}} on a statistical estimation of parametric defect level. A statistical model of n specification tests is obtained by applying a density estimation technique to a small sample of data (obtained from the initial phase of production testing or through Monte-Carlo simulation of the design). The statistical model is next sampled to generate a large population of synthetic devices from which specification tests can be ordered according to their impact on defect level by means of feature selection techniques. An optimal order can be obtained using the Branch and Bound method when n is relatively low. However, for larger values of n, heuristic methods such as genetic algorithms and floating search must be used which do not guarantee an optimal order. Since the value of n can reach several hundreds for advanced analog integrated devices, we have studied a heuristic algorithm that considers combinations of subsets of the overall test set. These subsets are easier to model and to order and a heuristic approach is used to form an overall order.

30|$|The use {{of two or}} more {{channels}} of EMG signals implies that this prosthesis uses an extraction pattern of signals for controlling, as noted in [34 – 36]. The EMG signal can be generated from muscles. In this way, the EMG signals are received through stick electrodes. To extract the EMG, two electrodes placed on the muscle biceps or triceps brachial were used, and the third should be placed on the bone. The extracted data for sweating hands and feet control the velocity or force modes to suit the strong-willed users [30, 33]. Several authors successfully contributed to refining variance estimation of the myoelectric signal, for example, by applying a whitening filter or changing the smoothing window length {{to increase the number of}} states available from the surface EMG signal [37 – 39]. These techniques require a different muscle contraction for each controlled function, making the control {{of two or more}} joints very difficult. Because the effects of unwanted movement of the surrounding muscles create the additive noise, the EMG signal is dependent on physical condition of disabilities due to its natural characteristics. Only one input signal is used in the control system to decrease the impact of noises. The external control system with a single input can produce control command (speed and torque, clockwise and counterclockwise action). Speed and torque are obtained by the voltage domain of the EMG signal. So one of our parameters is the amount of the EMG voltage domain, and it was determined by putting two thresholds (up/down); the clockwise and counterclockwise actions were assigned.
