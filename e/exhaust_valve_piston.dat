50|$|The {{expansion}} stroke of the steam engine covers piston travel from {{top dead center}} to bottom dead center. When the piston reverses to return to top dead center, an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> needs to open so that the expanded steam from the previous stroke can be released from the cylinder. The WHE engine has an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> in each <b>piston</b> actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right).

5000|$|In a uniflow engine, the mixture, or [...] "charge air" [...] in {{the case}} of a diesel, enters at one end of the {{cylinder}} controlled by the piston and the exhaust exits at the other end controlled by an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> or <b>piston.</b> The scavenging gas-flow is therefore in one direction only, hence the name uniflow. The valved arrangement is common in on-road, off-road and stationary two-stroke engines (Detroit Diesel), certain small marine two-stroke engines (Gray Marine), certain railroad two-stroke diesel locomotives (Electro-Motive Diesel) and large marine two-stroke main propulsion engines (Wärtsilä). Ported types are represented by the opposed piston design in which there are two pistons in each cylinder, working in opposite directions such as the Junkers Jumo 205 and Napier Deltic. The once-popular split-single design falls into this class, being effectively a folded uniflow. With advanced angle exhaust timing, uniflow engines can be supercharged with a crankshaft-driven (piston or Roots) blower.|$|R
50|$|A “Jake Brake” is {{an engine}} {{compression}} release brake used especially for steep hill downgrades. The Jake Brake opens the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> when the <b>piston</b> is near {{top dead center}} (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses {{the air in the}} cylinder to 1/15th its original volume, which creates drag on the engine. The Jacobs Engine Brake then releases the compressed air and the energy stored in it before it can push back on the piston during the down stroke. The Jake Brake turns a power producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor and in turn, causes the truck to slow down.Inside of the truck, the driver can choose how many cylinders to activate; the more cylinders activated, the more slowing of the truck.|$|R

Ensemble-averaged mean velocity, velocity fluctuation distribution and cyclic variation of the instantaneous velocity field were analysed.

The tumble centre is nearly in the centre of the cylinder when the tumble forms. Then it moves gradually to the underneath of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> as the <b>piston</b> moves up. It is found that the cyclic variation of the tumble motion at a tumble ratio of 0. 9 is so great that the ensemble-averaged flow characteristics hardly represent any individual cycle flow behaviours.

The engine braking generated by creating partial vacuum with a closed throttle at each intake stroke in petrol/gasoline engines does not apply to diesel engined vehicles—diesel engines are quite [...] "free-running". However Clessie L.

40|$|The {{design of}} a modern {{internal}} combustion engine {{requires the use of}} advanced analysis and development tools to carry an in-depth investigation on internal combustion process and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation by using high performance computers. In this work, the algorithm for moving or deformed mesh for a 1. 6 -litre four-cylinder four-stroke direct-injection engine has been developed. This type of mesh is required for transient simulation of fluid flow and combustion process inside the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. This mesh deforms with the movement of intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> as well as piston. Hence, the purpose of the work is to verify the moving mesh algorithm and to establish the correct mesh configuration at any crank angle. The simulation covers the full engine cycle consisting of intake, compression, power and exhaust strokes and the orderof piston motion is set according to the firing order of the selected engine. The algorithm established defines events in which any of the designated engine components moves in terms of time and duration of occurence. The verification of teh algorithm was performed for the whole four-stroke cycle of 720 degree crack angle, where the position of the intake <b>valve,</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> cylinder and <b>piston</b> were updated accordingly with respect to crack angle.

50|$|The use of {{separate}} valves for steam admission and exhaust means {{that neither the}} valves nor the steam passages between cylinders and valves need to change temperature during the power and exhaust cycle, and {{it means that the}} timing of the admission and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> can be independently controlled. In contrast, conventional steam engines have a slide <b>valve</b> or <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> that alternately feeds and exhausts through passages to each end of the cylinder. These passages are exposed to wide temperature swings during engine operation, and there are high temperature gradients within the valve mechanism.|$|R

Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals.The inside of a <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> contains a <b>piston</b> that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston.

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and causes high temperatures in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat.

40|$|Abstract — The system aims at {{modifying the}} {{position}} and diameter of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to reduce}} the probability of knocking (both in SI and in CI) and lessen the dilution of charge because of the small size of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> when compared to the size of inlet valve. The size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is smaller when compared to the size of inlet valve. It is done so because the region closer to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is at a higher temperature compared to that of the temperature surrounding the inlet valve. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> size is increased there will be higher possibility of knocking because the charge coming inside the combustion chamber has a higher probability of combusting at <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve’s</b> surface (due to large surface area). On the other hand if the size is too small then, there will be greater possibility of dilution in the intake charge because there is no enough space for the burnt gas to leave the chamber. To reduce these problems, modifications in the engine is proposed. In general inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are positioned vertically along the axis of the combustion chamber. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis (i. e. perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and if the size of the valve is increased then there will be less possibility for the dilution. But the probability of knocking increases. Since the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis, the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> will be in contact with the water cooling system of the combustion chamber (outside the chamber). Thus this cooling system or the coolant will be able to release the heat at the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and transfer heat from the seat surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> (commonly in tappet valves). The rate of Heat Transfer will be high because the surface area perpendicular to heat flow direction is large thereby enhancing heat transfer. The possibility of the dilution is reduced because, during the piston movement from BDC (Bottom Dead Center) to the TDC (Top Dead Center) the piston pushes the burnt gases outside through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> since the size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is increased, it is easie...|$|R

40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is a major}} focus of automotive crashworthiness with new regulations taking effect worldwide. While there are many approaches to reducing the head-injury-criteria (HIC), a leading approach is to actively lift the hood to increase the crush distance to rigid underhood components. Most current lift devices are single-use, requiring the hood to be manually returned to a drivable position, and may damage the hood during lift due to inappropriate lift rates. This paper addresses these issues with an alternative approach using stored energy marrying conventional (pneumatic) and smart materials (Shape Memory Alloy) actuation. The SMART (SMA ReseTtable) hood lift device comprises a dual chamber cylinder which releases stored pneumatic energy via an ultra-fast SMA <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> raising a <b>piston</b> attached to the hood. The device can be automatically reset and rearmed through pressurization of the chambers and the energy dissipated for service by evacuating both chambers. This approach is unique in that several design parameters such as pressure and valve opening/timing profile can be altered in the field to compensate for temperature, added mass (such as snow) or platform changes. This paper presents the concept of this device and the parametric design of the pneumatic cylinder and valve orifice based on an analytical performance model. Two valve concepts are presented: direct and indirect, where the direct valve is simpler and more controllable, but the indirect valve can provide larger orifices (and therefore faster lift times) with reduced actuation requirements.
