40|$|In March 2015, the United Kingdom {{declared}} the world's largest fully protected marine reserve {{in the remote}} waters surrounding the Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. The <b>designation</b> <b>marks</b> the first time any government has combined creation of a fully protected marine area with detailed plans for surveillance and enforcement that include use of the most up-to-date technology available. This approach sets a new standard for the comprehensive monitoring of protected areas. In 2013, The Pew Charitable Trusts and The National Geographic Society joined the local government, the Pitcairn Island Council, in submitting a proposal calling for creation of a marine reserve to protect these spectacular waters. The Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve spans 834, 334 square kilometres (322, 138 square miles). Together with the Chagos Marine Reserve in the Indian Ocean, designated in 2010, the United Kingdom has created the world's two biggest fully protected marine areas, totalling 1, 474, 334 square kilometres (569, 243 square miles).

5000|$|For Intervals (2009), a solo {{presentation}} of four works {{installed in the}} Solomon R.

In this exhibition, all the works were proposed to partially describe, in the artist's words [...] "a sense of time's passage according to subjective experience, rather than subscribed to a strict system of measurement that assigns a fixed duration to any given event". Each piece captures time's passage in an individualized sense, addressing what the artist conceives as [...] "subject formation" [...] and the assertion of one's dominion over one's own time {{as a condition for}} individualism.|$|R

5000|$|Despite of its ET <b>designation</b> (<b>marking</b> {{a freight}} locomotive) ET22 is a {{universal}} locomotive, and it is occasionally seen in passenger traffic. Its maximum continuous power is [...] {{and it is the}} biggest single-box Co-Co locomotive in PKP service. Technical features enable this engine to pull heavy freight trains of up to 3150 t with a speed of 70 km/h. Trains of up to 2700 t can be hauled at 80 km/h. When used as passenger locomotive it can pull trains weighing up to 700 t at 125 km/h. This is caused by several features and solutions based on passenger EU07 and EU06 locomotives.Four EE-451A engines are isolated in H class with maximum temperature allowed of 180 °C. They have four main and four commutative poles.Because of its length and the wheelbase between axles ET22 locomotive performs poorly on tight curves, unlike the older ET21 locomotives, {{despite the fact that the}} designers were given the same parameters for minimum curve diameter. Using the ET22 at winding tracks can cause severe damage both to rails and locomotive bogies. This forced several modifications, which are made presently. Such changes are essential, as fewer and fewer ET21 locomotives are in service and ET41 are ineffective on highland tracks due to serious loss of power. The locomotives were originally painted in two shades of green, with grey roofs. In the 1980s and 1990s their ends were painted yellow for better visibility, but during further repairs an original, the more aesthetic old scheme was being restored, or only a narrow yellow stripe was retained.|$|R
