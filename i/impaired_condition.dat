5000|$|There {{were certain}} defects in detinue sur trover. Wager of law was a {{possible}} defense in {{certain kinds of}} cases. Wager of law involved the use by a defendant of witnesses, some of whom may have {{had no knowledge of}} the case to testify. If a large number of these “witnesses” testified, the defendant would prevail. It was a form of sanctioned perjury. The courts began to severely limit wager of law {{by the middle of the}} fourteenth century. No action lay where the chattel was returned but in a damaged or <b>impaired</b> <b>condition.</b> In 1478, Catesby said, “And in the same manner I deliver my robes to you to keep for me and you wear them so that they perish, I shall have an action of detinue for in all these cases the property is not altered, and afterwards an action on the case and recover damages for the loss sustained by your using the clothes.” [...] the same opinion was reiterated in 1510 by Serjeant Moore, although an action would lie for trespass on the case. In the cases of a chattel damaged or destroyed, the plaintiff must choose some remedy other than detinue. This was also true if the bailee dealt with the property in an improper manner as noted by Littleton in 1462: “I bail to you my cloak and you burn it, I will have a writ of trespass on the case against you (and not detinue).” [...] It was doubtful whether detinue lay where, after bailment, a third party had destroyed the chattel bailed. The action lay against a bailee who had himself been responsible for the loss, as where a charter had been found by the jury to have been burned. It was disputed whether this remedy applied to the action of a third party. Judge Brian said, “If I bail my horse to a smith to shoe and he bails it to another smith who damages the horse an action will not lie against him.” The second party was a stranger to the bailment, but the other justices were opposed to this opinion of Brian.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Sciences) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The Klip River {{catchment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily impacted river systems in South Africa and is subjected to various types of pollution. The catchment furthermore serves all five recognised user groups identified by DWAF (domestic, agricultural, recreation, industrial and the natural environment). Increasing rates of urbanisation, industrialisation and population growth have aggravated the significance of water pollution as a threat to the wetland resources in the Klip River catchment. A wide range of physical, chemical and biological variables has been evaluated at the inflow and outflow points of the Klip River and Natalspruit wetlands to determine the effects of the wetlands on the incoming water. The Klip River wetland is impacted upon by mining and industries before the inflow points; three wastewater treatment works during the course of the wetland and informal settlements. Analyses of the wetlands show a significant improvement in conductivity, dissolved oxygen, manganese and sulphate concentrations. A deterioration was found in the suspended solids, chloride, sodium, nitrate and phosphate and chemical oxygen demand concentrations. Microbiological analyses showed that there is 93 % removal of faecal coliforms from the wetlands at the output site. There was an increase in the SASS 4 score from the inflow to outflow points for both the summer and winter months analysed showing a change from a considerably <b>impaired</b> <b>condition</b> to a moderately <b>impaired</b> <b>condition</b> The Natalspruit wetland is impacted upon by mining just before the inflow point, industries, three wastewater treatment works during the course of the wetlands and informal settlements. Readings taken at the outflow point of the wetlands show a significant improvement in conductivity, pH, chloride, iron, manganese, sodium, and sulphate concentrations. A deterioration was found in the fluoride, nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Microbiological analyses show that there is 99 % removal of faecal coliforms from the wetlands at the output site. There was a slight increase in the SASS 4 score 6 om the inflow to outflow points for both the summer and winter months analysed showing that it is in a considerably <b>impaired</b> <b>condition.</b> Load analyses of the Natalspruit wetland showed improvements for all the physical, chemical and microbiological analyses carried out. Very little work is done on the Klip River wetlands, and any information with regards to their benefit in being in a catchment especially one as degraded as the Klip River catchment, will result in their importance to all South Africans to be highlighted. Mines, industries and wastewater treatment works, can use wetlands as an added measure to purify water before discharging into rivers. In comparison, the Natalspruit wetland is functioning more efficiently than the Klip River wetland. Some reasons for this will be discussed. Master...|$|E

40|$|For {{signalling}} to {{be honest}} the handicap principle claims that signals must impose fitness costs so that only the best individuals can afford the most exaggerated signals. The cost of signalling in terms of reduced survival decreases, however, {{towards the end of}} an individual’s lifetime, which can induce an increase in signalling effort as a terminal effort. I show for the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, that a decrease in survival prospects through <b>impaired</b> <b>condition</b> leads to an increase in red nuptial coloration that makes the signal less reliable as an indicator of male parental ability. Males in poor condition with a large signal sometimes cannibalized all the eggs they received, probably to start a new breeding cycle with a higher energy reserve. However, the inclusion of socially imposed costs of signalling through male–male competition during courtship increased the honesty of the signal, as some males in poor condition and of poor parental ability decreased their signal expression. Some cheaters still occurred, but the signalling system was honest on average. This implies that socially imposed costs are important in the maintenance of honest sexual signalling. Dishonesty may occur under favourable conditions when the cost of signalling is reduced. This emphasizes the importance of considering the environmental conditions experienced by individuals when investigating the evolution and maintenance of honest sexual signals...|$|E

So, the aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of a 10 week aerobic exercise along with vitamin E supplementation on blood pressure, heart rate and VO 2 max of addicted women. Materials and Methods: The participants were the addicted women taken from a quit addiction camp in Zahedan.

However, the failure of most models to incorporate residual variability and parameter uncertainty in their predictions makes them unsuitable for TMDL development. The percentile-based standards increasingly used by the EPA and tile requirement for a margin of safety in TMDLs necessitate that model predictions include quantitative information on uncertainty. We describe a probabilistic approach to model-based TMDL assessment that addresses this issue and is suitable for use with any type of mathematical model.

This probabilistic term captures the effects of any processes that are not considered in the model and allows for direct assessment of the frequency of standard violations. Additionally, by estimating and propagating the effects of parameter uncertainty on model predictions, we are able to provide an explicit basis for choosing a TMDL that includes a margin of safety. We conclude by discussing the potential for models currently supported by the EPA to be adapted to provide the type of probabilistic information that is necessary to support TMDL decisions...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of Turkish homeless patients who brought to the emergency department by ambulance. Materials and methods: The records of homeless adult patients brought to the ED by 112 emergency service ambulance teams over a 1 -year period from January to December, 2014, were examined retrospectively. Results: Thirty-six (21. 56 %) of {{the homeless}} patients enrolled in the study presented due to trauma, and 131 (78. 44 %) due to non-traumatic causes. One hundred thirty-seven (82. 04 %) of the total patient group were male. The mean age of the non-trauma patients was 47. 3 Â Â±Â  15. 2 years (range, 18 â 81 years), and the mean age of the trauma patients was 36. 9 Â Â±Â  14. 4 years (range, 18 â 63 years). The most common reason for presentation among patients presenting to the emergency department for non-trauma reasons was clouded consciousness (nÂ =Â  39, 23. 35 %), followed by general <b>impaired</b> <b>condition</b> (nÂ =Â  26, 15. 57 %), respiratory difficulty (nÂ =Â  25 14. 97 %) and abdominal pain (nÂ =Â  21, 12. 57 %). The most common reason for presentation among trauma cases was traffic accidents (nÂ =Â  13, 7. 78 %), followed by sharp implement injury (nÂ =Â  9, 5. 39 %).

40|$|Bibliography: pages [54]- 56. Paranoid {{disorders}} {{have been}} attributed to both stressful experiences and reality distortions encouraged by psychological isolation. Hearing impairment, which constitutes isolation in terms of information input, has led to paranoid reactions in subjects studied naturalistically and experimentally. Threats to self-esteem from critical feedback have produced anxiety in experimental subjects. The present study compared the effects of impaired vs. normal hearing and critical vs. favorable feedback on changes in paranoid reactions. It was predicted that subjects experiencing hearing impairment would increase in their paranoid reactions from pre- to posttest. Subjects receiving critical feedback (i. e., adjustment weaknesses) were also expected to increase in their paranoid reactions from pre- to posttest. The investigation was designed to determine whether the joint effects of hearing and feedback are additive or multiplicative. Prior to the experimental manipulations, 80 female subjects completed several measures (anxiety, projection, and paranoid adjective checklist) in order to assess their pre-experimental paranoid reactions. A self-esteem scale also was used as a possible covariate. In the second session, subjects were asked to take several personality tests and were presented with one of four pre-recorded, simulated personality interpretations. The content of the taped interpretations consisted of either weaknesses or strengths in general and social adjustment, and these were either completely intelligible (normal hearing) or partially unintelligible (impaired hearing). Subjects' reactions to their respective experimental conditions were assessed after the interpretation ended and comparisons of the subjects' pre- and post-experimental paranoid reactions were made. Since subjects in the four experimental conditions did not differ in self-esteem, the covariate was not used in subsequent analyses. Results of the investigation indicated that subjects in the hearing and feedback conditions differed significantly in paranoid reactions, with those in the hearing <b>impaired</b> <b>condition</b> and adjustment weaknesses condition exibiting the greatest increases in paranoid reactions. Hearing and feedback were found to combine in an additive fashion. The combination of impaired hearing and adjustment weaknesses feedback produced the greatest increases in paranoid reactions, and the combination of normal hearing and adjustment strengths feedback produced the greatest decreases in paranoid reactions.

Aged related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is for example {{one of the most}} important visual disease in occidental countries. The forecasts of the World Health Organization translate a major risk which it will be necessary to face, and developing adapted tools is urgent. Nowadays, the only primary aids offered to visually impaired people for independent mobility are in fact different types of canes. Even if electronic travel aids exist and even if they were initially devised to replace canes, they are ultimately used as secondary aids. The main origin of such a relative unsuccessful result in assisting with navigation is the lack of significant additional information provided by electronic travel aids to low vision individuals. During the past years many research teams have proposed some assistive technologies or solutions to compensate vision impaired troubles. Nevertheless, little researches have been conducted on wearable systems exploiting the residual vision of visually impaired people to assist them in mobility even if professionals working in the field of low vision agree to say that it is important to stimulate the residual vision early in the sight-loss process. Visual media are becoming more abundant in our daily life and a core constituent of information and communication technologies. This leads the emergence of new needs, changes in behavior, consumption patterns and distribution practices. Today people are less and less refractory for new technologies like smartphones or other embedded systems. Such elements motivate the overview presented in the chapter we propose.

Calving is stressful condition in which NEFA and hydroxyl butyric acids concentrations were increased which are specific to negative energy balance and then, reduction of milk yield, development of fatty liver syndrome in addition to postpartum reproductive problems in cows (Grummer 2008). During the transition period, high producing cows have rapid transportation of fatty acids from adipose tissue to maintain energy balance resulting in circulation of excess NEFA in the blood which impair the hepatic function and animal performance with increase in choline metabolism (Karimian et al. 2015). Through stress, adipocytes are lipase sensitive, and the deposited triacylglycerol is broken down into glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids or free fatty acids which transported into liver, if continuous NEFA mobilization increase towards liver which directly causes hepatic inflammation or hepatic steatosis and the liver function decreased (Maison et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2005). Continuous and excessive mobilization of the stored fatty acids from adipose tissue {{is a sign of}} low dietary energy which increase burden on liver with low hepatic fatty acid oxidation rate and low mobilization rate of VLDL (Grummer 1993). Furthermore, high uptake of NEFA by hepatic cell consequently develop hepatic lipidosis condition of cows and alleviate the capacity of detoxifying ammonia into urea which reduces gluconeogenic capacity from propionate fatty acid (Strang et al. 1998). Liver cell capacity fully engaged to esterify mobilized NEFA into TAG (Litherland et al. 2011).

A sustained delivery as the one provided by these nanoparticles (NP) can be highly advantageous, maximizing the drug’s potency in the target site. Therefore, we synthesized MP-loaded NPs composed of an inner poly/(amido) amine (PAMAM) dendrimeric core and grafted with carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht). Chemical and biological characterization studies were carried out showing that the NPs are stable in acidic and neutral buffer solutions. Also, the viability of primary glial cultures was not compromised by the presence of 200 lg/mL of NP. In turn, an MP action in microglial cultures was observed in dosages above 1 mg/ mL showing that MP is being released from the NPs inside the cells. The uptake profile of these NPs is time dependent and reaches itsmaximum 24 h after incubation with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. In a preview of a possible therapeutic effect, the NPs were administered in hemisected spinal cord injured rats. To assess the efficacy of local injections around the lesion site the animals were sacrificed 3 h after surgery and frozen sections were observed. The fluorescently labeled-NPs were detected in the injury and in the surrounding spinal tissue indicating a successful delivery of the NP to the spinal tissue. The local injections were repeated in hemisected rats that were kept for 1 month, performing the BBB locomotory test weekly. Significant differences in the BBB test were found between the MPloaded NPs injected rats and the sham group as well as the ones injected with MP, demonstrating a favorable action of the MP-NPs in the acute phase of the injury. This work revealed that sustained delivery of MP via a NP system can be highly beneficial in the management of the secondary injury that follows SCI improving the overall functional outcome of the injured animals...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} {{human beings who}} live their lives at the {{extremes}} {{of the human condition}} because of some gross intellectual, cognitive, neurological, or developmental impairment to their human nature. The evidence from practices of care and concern towards such people – the profoundly impaired – suggests that they are acknowledged and respected as moral peers within the human community. Such pre-reflective intuitions and commonplace practices lend credence to the anthropological claim that the profoundly impaired are recognisably persons. Yet what might an argument in support of this intuition look like? How is it that the profoundly impaired are recognisably persons among fellow persons? This thesis is a theological response to that question. The presupposition underpinning the question is that there is something at stake for the humanity of the profoundly impaired in their being the particularly conditioned human beings that they are. There are, however, those who do not allow for the personhood of the profoundly impaired precisely because of the <b>impaired</b> <b>condition</b> in which they live their lives, and there are others who do uphold the personhood of the profoundly impaired precisely by sidelining their impairment. Peter Singer is representative of the first position. Christian theology can and should make an effective response to Singer’s challenge. An emerging field in Christian theology seeks to do so by proposing a distinct theology of disability that re-imagines Christian anthropology. The aim is to secure the humanity of the disabled without the condition of their humanity becoming an obstacle to their moral status within the community of persons. Key to this re-imagining is the adoption of a paradigm of inclusion towards the disabled. However, a critique will be offered of those theological re-imagined Christian anthropologies that centre on a paradigm of inclusion, and on a commitment to separating out the condition of the profoundly impaired from the question of their humanity. The Dutch Protestant theologian Hans Reinders proposes one such re-imagined anthropology in his recent major work, Receiving the Gift of Friendship: Profound Disability, Theological Anthropology, and Ethics. His claim is that the humanity of the profoundly disabled cannot be secured by the traditionally held Christian doctrine of the imago Dei because that doctrine treats personhood as something intrinsic to human beings, thereby making it inaccessible to the profoundly disabled who do not have the personalising capacities of reason and will. Instead, he proposes ‘being chosen as a friend’ by God as the only way in which the humanity of the profoundly disabled can be secured, thereby rejecting an immanent reading of the imago Dei in favour of a transcending conception of friendship. This thesis will argue that Reinders’ anthropological project fails because his transcendent concept cannot do for the humanity of the profoundly disabled what it sets out to do. Consequently, a return will be made to that tradition of Christian anthropology centred on the imago Dei to see what may be retrieved from it, such that the condition under which the profoundly impaired live their lives is central to them being recognisably the persons that they are. This is a proposition which says that the personal presence of the profoundly impaired among other persons is not to be denied to them (contra Singer), nor only extended to them as a means of belonging (contra a paradigm of inclusion), nor simply eschewed of them so that they may thereby be included by other means (contra Reinders). In placing the doctrine of the imago Dei {{at the heart of the}} creaturely life of human beings, the Catholic Church has made this doctrine the structural centre of any theological account of the personhood of the profoundly impaired. It will be the positive task of this thesis to uncover the theological import of this Catholic anthropological imagination. The two authors most significantly engaged with in undertaking this task will be C S Lewis and Josef Pieper...|$|E

Empirical and epidemiological knowledge acquired over recent years has given rise to a general consensus on the capacity of psychoactive substances for producing impairment and causing accidents (alcohol, cannabinoids, hallucinogens, narcotics, psychomimetics, and solvents). For other classes of substances, evaluations need to be made of the effect of each drug, with the consequent careful use of those compounds which offer a better risk:benefit ratio. A number of guiding principles should be followed in future studies, in particular, creative and international synergistic research should be related to the real world in order to link laboratory results to field observations reflecting individual actual reality, often affected by other <b>impairing</b> <b>conditions</b> such as personality and comorbid psychiatric disorders...|$|R

Treating {{refractory}} obsessive-compulsive disorder: {{what to do}} when {{conventional treatment}} fails? Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and <b>impairing</b> <b>condition.</b> A very small percentage of patients become asympto-matic after treatment. The purpose of this paper was to review the alternative therapies available for OCD when conventional treatment fails. Data were extracted from controlled clinical stu-dies (evidence-based medicine) published on the MEDLINE and Science Citation Index/Web of Science databases between 1975 and 2012. Findings are discussed and suggest that clinicians dealing with refractory OCD patients should: 1) review intrinsic phenomenological aspects of OCD, which could lead to different interpretations and treatment choices; 2) review extrinsic phe-nomenological aspects of OCD, especially family accommoda-tion, which may be a risk factor for non-response; 3) consider non-conventional pharmacological approaches; 4) consider non [...] conventional psychotherapeutic approaches; and 5) consider neurobiological approaches...|$|R
