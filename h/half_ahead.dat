In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, a second and a <b>half</b> <b>ahead</b> of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars.

500|$|Two {{days later}} the All Blacks faced Newport at the city's Athletic Ground. The All Blacks scored a try early to Eric Harper and Wallace {{recalled}} [...] "It looked {{as though we were}} going to win comfortably." [...] Wallace then scored a penalty for the All Blacks and they ended the first <b>half</b> <b>ahead</b> 6–0. Newport's Rowland Griffiths scored a penalty early in the second half but, despite their strong display in the second half, they could not score again and the All Blacks won 6–3.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Oxford. Umpire Rickett started the race at 2p.m. in [...] "fine" [...] weather {{conditions}} and with a strong tide. [...] Despite being out-rated by three strokes per minute, Oxford took an immediate lead and were over half a length ahead by the time they passed Fulham Wall. With the Middlesex bend in their favour, Oxford increased their lead to a length and a <b>half</b> <b>ahead</b> by the Mile Post. [...] Cambridge's stroke Eadie called for a push just before Harrods Furniture Depository and the Light Blues began to reduce the deficit, and although the Dark Blues responded, by the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, Oxford's lead was down to half a length.|$|E
500|$|The Dark Blues' {{lead was}} down to half a length {{by the time the}} crews passed Harrods Furniture Depository and by Hammersmith Bridge Cambridge had edged ahead. [...] Still out-rating Oxford, the Light Blues {{gradually}} pulled away and were a length and a <b>half</b> <b>ahead</b> by Chiswick Steps. [...] With no response from Oxford, Cambridge extended their advantage further to around two lengths by Barnes Bridge, a lead which they held at the finishing post in a time of 19 minutes 1 second. [...] They secured their third consecutive victory and their ninth win in eleven years and taking the overall record in the race to 5745 in their favour. [...] At the post-race dinner, held at the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall, the Oxford boat club president Carnegie defended his crew's style: [...] "The style was all right but we did not match up to it". [...] His counterpart Delahooke suggested that had the race been held ten days prior, Oxford would have won.|$|E

500|$|A spurt at Harrods Furniture Depository {{saw them}} gain an extra half-length before they passed under Hammersmith Bridge a length and a <b>half</b> <b>ahead</b> of Oxford. [...] Although the Dark Blues {{were on the}} outside of the long bend in the river, they kept in touch, and {{prevented}} Cambridge from extending their lead. [...] The Light Blues passed Chiswick Steps still with a length and a half lead as both crews faced a head wind going into Corney Reach. [...] Along Dukes Meadow Cambridge started to tire and Oxford began to gain; passing through the arches of Barnes Bridge, the Light Blues held a four-second lead. [...] Increasing their rate to 34 strokes per minute, Oxford's stroke Mawer tried to pull them back into contention yet just as the boats began to overlap, Cambridge pushed on again to win by one-and-a-quarter lengths in a time of 18 minutes 36 seconds. [...] It was the fastest winning time since the 1934 race and the fourth fastest time in the history of the Boat Race, [...] yet the narrowest winning margin since the 1952 race. [...] It was the Light Blues' second consecutive win, their third win in four years and took the overall record in the race to 5645 in their favour.|$|E
500|$|Next {{they had}} their bye round, before facing the Wellington Hurricanes at Athletic Park. Despite leading 143 at half time, the Highlanders lost when Hurricanes' half-back Jason Spice scored in the corner to give the Hurricanes a 2119 victory. Had the Highlanders won they would have {{finished}} top {{of the table and}} hosted a semi-final at Carisbrook. Instead they then had to travel from Wellington to South Africa to play the Stormers. After trailing 110, the Highlanders finished the first <b>half</b> <b>ahead</b> 2218. They scored a further 11 points in the second half to win 3318. The Highlanders travelled back to Dunedin and the match was moved to the Sunday to allow an extra for recovery. The 1999 Super 12 Final was against South Island rivals the Canterbury Crusaders, and was billed as [...] "the party at Tony Brown's house" [...] after Highlanders first five-eighth Tony Brown. The match in front of a sellout 41,500 person crowd the Highlanders scored first, and led 149 at half time. However, the decisive try was to Crusaders' wing Afato So'oalo when he chipped the ball, then out-sprinted All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson to collect the ball and score. Although the Highlanders' scored a try to Isitolo Maka with three minutes remaining the Crusaders won 2419.|$|E
500|$|An {{early morning}} {{kick-off}} away to fierce rivals Liverpool {{ended in a}} routine victory for United. Losing to Juventus in the last match of the Champions League before hiatus had {{seemed to have no}} effect on United's domestic dominance. They comprehensively defeated Aston Villa thanks to a solitary Giggs goal and followed it up with a heroic Schmeichel performance to deny Newcastle United at St James' Park. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a lifelong fan of the Geordies, was among the crowd and was in awe over Ferguson's team, believing that the manager had assembled [...] "one of the greatest sides of the century". Two out of two became three as Everton found no answer to deny the league leaders, who extended their lead {{at the top of the}} table to six points on Boxing Day. The win marked the end of Karel Poborský's spell, coming on for David Beckham in the second <b>half</b> <b>ahead</b> of a switch to Graeme Souness' Benfica. However, what was to come at the end of December exemplified the vulnerability of the defence during the second half of the season. In losing to mid-table Coventry City two days after the Everton win, United blew the chance to open up a nine-point lead at the top of the table, which would virtually slam the door shut on the challengers. They again found themselves a goal down, this time courtesy of Noel Whelan, Solskjær and Sheringham responded to restore the advantage back on the champions but a Dion Dublin penalty and mazy run from youngster Darren Huckerby in the last minute ensured an implausible victory, given the fact that Coventry were 2–1 down with five minutes to go. Prior to the game, Ferguson highlighted the fact that the league [...] "wasn't won in December", but following the defeat blasted his side's display as [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "on the verge of complacency".|$|E

She ran a time of 2:35:34 for seventh place in her first outing in North America. The 21-year-old took part in her second World Marathon Major of the year at the Berlin Marathon in September.
