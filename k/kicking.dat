50|$|A flying <b>kick,</b> in martial arts, is {{a general}} {{description}} of <b>kicks</b> that involve a running start, jump, then a <b>kick</b> in mid-air. Compared to a regular <b>kick,</b> the user is able to achieve greater momentum from the run at the start. Flying <b>kicks</b> {{are not to be}} mistaken for jumping <b>kicks,</b> which are similar maneuvers. A jumping <b>kick</b> is very similar to a flying <b>kick,</b> except that it lacks the running start and the user simply jumps and <b>kicks</b> from a stationary position. Flying <b>kicks</b> are often derived from the basic <b>kicks.</b> Some of the more commonly known flying <b>kicks</b> are the: flying side <b>kick,</b> flying back <b>kick</b> and the flying roundhouse <b>kick,</b> as well as the flying reverse roundhouse <b>kick.</b> Flying <b>kicks</b> are commonly practiced in Taekwondo, Karate, Wushu, and Muay Thai for fitness, exhibitions and competition.

5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & <b>Kicking</b> began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. The feel of the show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became <b>Kicking</b> Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature {{the main components of}} Live & <b>Kicking</b> including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a <b>kicking</b> tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the <b>kicking</b> team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, <b>kicking</b> the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the <b>kicking</b> team.|$|E

Geelong began their finals series against Fremantle in a Qualifying Final, but were defeated by 15points. The defeat forced the club into a Semi Final against Port Adelaide—the first finals game between both clubs since the 2007 AFL Grand Final. Selwood contributed 27 disposals, 4 marks, and 4 tackles to lead Geelong to a 16point victory—his first finals win as captain. The win ensured Geelong's progression through to the Preliminary Final against Hawthorn, to play-off for a position in the 2013 AFL Grand Final.

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Mississippi came {{storming}} back. Following the field goal, Tech head coach Jerry Claiborne ordered an onside kick {{in an effort}} to gain another chance on offense and potentially build an insurmountable lead. Onside kicks, unlike an ordinary free kick, can be recovered by the <b>kicking</b> team—but only after the ball has traveled 10 yards. If the <b>kicking</b> team touches the ball before it has traveled 10 yards, the receiving team takes possession at the place the ball was touched. Unfortunately for Virginia Tech, Simsak's onside kick—though it surprised Ole Miss—did not travel the requisite 10 yards. Mississippi took over at the Virginia Tech 49-yard line, and many of the Ole Miss players were angered by what they considered to be an insult.|$|E

Once Live & <b>Kicking</b> had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final episode won a BAFTA award.

5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the <b>kicking</b> team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play.

On a safety kick, the <b>kicking</b> team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the <b>kicking</b> team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.|$|E

50|$|The {{impact point}} of the Front <b>Kick</b> can, with {{specific}} techniques and in certain styles, be more exotic. Certain Japanese styles have a Front <b>Kick</b> generally used as a stop-kick where the blade of the foot is used to connect, like for a side <b>kick</b> (The Foot Blade Front <b>Kick).</b> The heel is often used straight (Mae Kakato Geri) or with the foot tilted (Tilted Heel Front <b>Kick),</b> especially in stop-kicks, close <b>kicks</b> or high front <b>kicks.</b> Japanese Nin-Jitsu has variations using the straightened and hardened toes. Front <b>Kicks</b> to the groin (Kin Geri) like the lift <b>kick</b> or the upward front <b>kick</b> (Mae Geri Keage), use {{the top of the}} foot. The phantom Groin <b>Kick</b> uses the whole of the in-side of the foot to connect very effectively. Stop <b>Kicks</b> often use the whole plant of the foot to push away the opponent.|$|R
