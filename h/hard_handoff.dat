40|$|Achieving IP handoff {{with a short}} latency {{and minimal}} packet loss is {{essential}} for mobile devices that roam across IP subnets. Many existing solutions require changes {{to be made to}} the network or transport layer, and they tend to suffer from long handoff latency in either soft or <b>hard</b> <b>handoff</b> scenario, or both; and some are difficult to deploy in practice. We propose a new protocol, called the adaptive multipath protocol, to achieve efficient IP handoff. Based on link-layer signal strength measurements, two different schemes are used to handle soft and <b>hard</b> <b>handoff</b> respectively. Seamless IP handoff is achieved by using multiple transport layer connections on top of persistent link-layer connectivity during soft handoff. To achieve low handoff latency during <b>hard</b> <b>handoff,</b> a set of distributed sessions repositories (SRs), which are independent of the end hosts, are employed. Simulation results clearly support our claims.
