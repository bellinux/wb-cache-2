5000|$|Where {{a rising}} damp problem {{is caused by}} a lack of a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> (common in {{buildings}} over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} purpose of wainscoting was {{to cover the}} lower part of walls, which, in houses constructed with poor or non-existent <b>damp-proof</b> <b>courses,</b> are often affected by rising dampness. Its purpose is now decorative.|$|R
50|$|There {{were once}} cottages for workmen {{along the banks}} of the Humber west of the railway bridge. Access was via a {{footpath}} that went through a gate at the north-western end of the railway bridge over the Haven or via West Marsh Lane and two wooden gates on either side of the railway line. These cottages were not provided with electricity, water or sanitation facilities. Kerosene lamps, hand pumps and earth toilets were standard. Floors were generally constructed of brick laid directly on the ground and the walls had no <b>damp-proof</b> <b>courses.</b> Cast iron fireplaces, consisting of a coal-fired open grate with a boiler box on one side and an oven on the other, were the sole means of heating and cooking. Disposal of household rubbish and night soil consisted of dumping into the Humber at any convenient tide. A shop stocked with produce through the market boat catered for the immediate needs of the local population, but more substantial purchases required travelling to Barton on Humber, or to New Holland and from there by ferry to Hull. An additional shop, run by a Mrs Dee, was on the Barrow Road; it was a lean-to attached to a house. A coal yard was next to the shop, on the Clew Bridge side of the building, which was first owned by Mr. Dee's, but in the 1930s it was owned by a Clifford Hastings. His coal was delivered by barge along the Haven. In later years he had a further coal yard just south of the station.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{assessing}} damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, {{the next step is}} to look for the presence of a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course.</b> If a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which damp proof courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another.|$|E
5000|$|Rising damp {{is widely}} {{referred}} to in Victorian literature and the Public Health Act of 1875 introduced the requirement for a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> in walls to prevent rising damp. An entry in the British Medical Journal from 1872 describes the phenomenon of rising damp as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Rising damp is a {{condition}} caused by ground moisture rising up a masonry wall by capillary action. It often occurs {{where there is no}} <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> (DPC) or where the DPC has been damaged or bridged. Older houses, such as depicted in the show, were built without damp-proof courses or with a barrier material that is liable to failure.|$|E
5000|$|Rising damp is a {{phenomenon}} that is fully predicted {{by the laws of}} physics, has been researched on a worldwide scale, and has been documented since Roman times. Nevertheless, a small number of people have expressed the view that rising damp is a myth and that it is, in fact, impossible for moisture to rise from the ground into the wall structure through pores in the masonry. A former chairman of the construction arm of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), Stephen Boniface, has said that 'true rising damp' is a myth and chemically injected <b>damp-proof</b> <b>courses</b> (DPC) are 'a complete waste of money'. However he has recently clarified this statement on a comment post made on the Surveying Property website, [...] "Whilst I have often been quoted as stating [...] "rising damp is a myth" [...] the only time I have ever said that phrase (or similar) is once when delivering a paper at a conference and then using the intake of breath as a cue to then develop the argument further and explore the issue of damp. In other words, I used the phrase provocatively (it usually worked). I then went on to state that whilst I accept rising damp (as a term often used by the public and professionals alike) might exist it is indeed extremely rare. I have at other times referred to the myth of rising dampness and explained what I understand without actually stating myself that it is a complete myth." ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} {{design of}} a single-nave hall with the span of 12 m and pole height from 3. 0 to 4. 5 m. The hall {{can be used for}} warehousing goods, garaging vehicles or shedding farm animals. Construction material is mostly round timber. The structure consists of a strut brace frame with reinforced saddle diaphragm beam in longitudinal module 3. 6 m, timber binding rafter and transversal trusses. Material, construction type and solution of details meet requirements and possibilities of do-it-yourself manufacture and assembly. The construction system of the hall has options for the rigid <b>damp-proof</b> roof <b>course</b> or for the prestressed canvas made of technical textile with water-proof surface finish. Foundation of the building is on concrete abutments, or – in a less traditional way – on concrete-encased poles in the ground shaft. Optional technical solutions (textile roofing, pole foundations) can reduce the framework costs including roofing by about 9 % and total house raising costs by about 45 %...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{represent}} significant {{investment of}} developers and, as such, {{it is important}} to ensure value for the capital injected into the construction of buildings. Unfortunately, due to neglect of proper construction practices, buildings are facing defects, and one of such defects is rising damp. This study sought to identify some of the construction practices contributing to rising damp in buildings and their effects and suggest some remedial measures for controlling and treatment of rising damps. Snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques were used to gather data from a cross section of 78 building environment professionals in Kumasi and Ejisu who have experienced the effects of moisture rise. Relative Importance Index was used to rank the significance of the causes. The study revealed that failure to use <b>damp-proof</b> membrane or <b>course,</b> presence of groundwater, porosity of masonry, and concrete element sand flooding were the main causes of rising damp. Undersetting and saw slotting, making good plumbing leakages, using approved waterproof chemical injection, and application of admixtures were the main measures recommended to avert rising damp...|$|R
50|$|After the 1982 {{introduction}} of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Hong Kong trading company Locumals commissioned Intelligent Software, headed by international chess player David Levy, to develop a home computer in the UK. During development the machine had the codename DPC, which stood for <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course,</b> to confuse potential competitors. The machine was also known by the names Samurai, Oscar, Elan and Flan before the Enterprise name was finally chosen.|$|E
5000|$|Konrad Fisher's article [...] "The Fraud of Rising Damp" [...] {{points out}} that the {{historic}} city hall in Bamberg stands in the river Regnitz and its bridge remains dry without any chemical, mechanical or electronic <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course.</b> However, evidence suggests that not all walls are capable of supporting rising damp, so merely observing that rising damp does not occur in a particular wall does not disprove its existence in other walls.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> (DPC) is {{a barrier}} through the {{structure}} {{designed to prevent}} moisture rising by capillary action such as through a phenomenon known as rising damp. Rising damp {{is the effect of}} water rising from the ground into property. The damp proof course may be horizontal or vertical. A DPC layer is usually laid below all masonry walls, regardless if the wall is a load bearing wall or a partition wall.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{forms of}} {{dampness}} {{can be prevented}} by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include damp proofing {{in the form of}} a synthetic <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> (DPC), about 15 cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or [...] "engineering bricks" [...] with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem.|$|E
5000|$|In many cases, damp {{is caused}} by [...] "bridging" [...] of a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> that is {{otherwise}} working effectively. For example, a flower bed next to an affected wall might result in soil being piled {{up against the wall}} above the level of the DPC. In this example, moisture from the ground would be able to ingress through the wall from the soil. Such a damp problem could be rectified by simply lowering the flower bed to below DPC level.|$|E
50|$|Walls are not {{subjected}} to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as housewraps {{are designed to}} be porous enough to let moisture escape. Walls also have vapor barriers or air barriers. Damp proofing is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> to prevent rising damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement waterproofing membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the ground}} floor {{might have had a}} boarded wooden floor, more likely the {{cheapest}} houses would have had flagstones laid on compacted ash, much in the manner of the scullery floor after regulation. This had advantages, but in low-lying districts it would remain permanently damp. The upper floors would have been of wooden planks laid on joists; in poorer houses there were no plastered ceilings. Walls may have been plastered or not. Some houses had a slate <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> but some had none. After poor weather or flooding the walls would dry out only slowly.|$|E
5000|$|... "Even if {{the rising}} damp be arrested {{by what is}} {{technically}} called an impervious <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course,</b> it will be frequently found that this is built in the wall too near the ground line, so that the heavy rain besplatters the ground and splashes above it. As time rolls {{on the surface of}} the ground also becomes elevated, and this damp course is soon lost to sight. Attempts have been made to remedy this evil of porous bricks by the substitution of the hard blue bricks of Staffordshire; and then it may often be noticed that the wet has only struck, sailor-like, across the mortar-joints and chequered the inside walls like a tartan plaid." ...|$|E
50|$|A birch-bark roof (in Finnish: malkakatto or tuohikato) is a roof {{construction}} traditional in Finland for farmhouses and farm buildings built from logs. The birch-bark roof was the prevailing roof type in rural Finland {{up until the}} 1860s, when it {{was replaced by the}} use of other materials such as metal sheeting and later roofing felt. The tradition of birch-bark roofs has been revived in recent years as a craft in connection with the restoration of old farm buildings that have been converted into open-air museums. The main reason for using birch bark was that when added in several layers, it acts as an efficient water- and <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course.</b> The birch trees would normally be de-barked, using a knife, during the summer.|$|E
5000|$|Replastering {{may not be}} {{necessary}} where salt contamination is not severe. BS6576:2005 states that [...] "Where the plaster {{appears to be in}} sound condition, the extent of plaster to be removed may be minimised by delaying any decision to replaster until the drying period is complete." [...] Avoiding the need to replaster in this way can reduce disruption and mess and has the advantage of allowing the original lime or gypsum-based plaster to be maintained. However, the deficiencies of any remedial <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> will be more apparent if the wall is not covered with a waterproof render. For this reason it is important to check the BBA certificate of the damp-proofing system to ensure that it is valid for use where replastering is not being carried out.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} no <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> and rising damp is {{suspected}} (tide mark, moisture confined to lower section of wall etc. ...) then a number of diagnostic techniques {{can be used to}} determine the source of dampness. BRE Digest 245 states that the most satisfactory approach is to obtain samples of mortar in the affected wall using a drill and then analysing these samples to determine their moisture and salt content to assist in providing appropriate remedial building solutions. The fact that this technique is destructive to the wall finish often makes it unacceptable to homeowners. It {{is for this reason that}} electrical moisture meters are often used when surveying for rising damp. These instruments are unable to accurately measure the moisture content of masonry, as they were developed for use on timber, but the reading patterns that are achieved can provide useful indicators of the source of dampness.|$|E
40|$|The present Australian Masonry Code {{states that}} the shear {{capacity}} of a masonry wall containing <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> is to be taken as zero. <b>Damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> {{is used in the}} building industry as a means of preventing moisture through masonry walls. The inclusion of a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> within a mortar joint creates a plane of weakness. If the <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> is not sandwiched within the mortar (placed directly on the block), the bond between the mortar and masonry block is broken. Although this bond has been broken the mortar joint still possess some frictional shear capacity. The University of Newcastle has proved the existence of shear capacity for various membrane type damp-proof courses using clay bricks. A study has also been done by W. Kelly of Central Queensland University on the effects of <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> positioning and mortar types for masonry walls using concrete blocks and Supercourse 500. In plane shear tests will be conducted on 36 specimens with variables including the inclusion and omission on <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course,</b> three Central Queensland mortar sands and three precompression loads. The provisions of the Australian Masonry Code shall be reviewed {{on the basis of these}} test results combined with Kelly's (2) previous research...|$|E
40|$|This village school adapts the {{traditional}} materials {{of earth and}} bamboo {{to make them more}} durable. In terms of the earth construction, the most important technical advances were introducing a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course,</b> adding a brick foundation and mixing straw into the loam. The potential of bamboo construction is demonstrated by the ceiling (a layering of bamboo sticks, bamboo boards and earth) and the first-floor walls and roof (a frame construction consisting of beams- four layers of joined bamboo sticks- and vertical and diagonal poles). The project was hand-built by local craftsmen, pupils and teachers working in collaboration with European volunteers...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic load {{tests were}} {{performed}} on two series of unreinforced masonry wallettes with a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> placed either between the first two masonry courses or between the concrete base and the wallette. Two types of failure were observed, namely sliding and compression (toe crushing) failure. Wallettes that failed in compression exhibited limited energy dissipation. Wallettes which failed through sliding displayed considerable energy dissipation and behaved in a quasi ductile manner. Greater ductility was observed in the wallettes with the DPC in the bed joint {{rather than at the}} wallette–slab interface, indicating that the former detail would be more desirable for enhanced seismic performance. Simple analytical models for predictions of failure shear load are proposed and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The City of Adelaide {{suffers from}} rapid damage to {{historic}} building materials due to salts, rising damp, and <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> failures. Adelaide City Council has partially funded repairs to over 400 {{buildings in the}} past 15 years. To begin to examine {{the scope of this}} problem and the effectiveness of various treatments, 24 historic buildings in Adelaide were examined, with a focus on the building materials, historic interventions and current treatments applied to treat rising damp and salt decay. Analysis of 90 samples found high levels of sodium sulfate, sodium chloride and sodium nitrate in cellars, ground water and building materials, suggesting a clear example of rising damp. Samples of disintegrating masonry, depth profiles acquired by drilling, poultices and damp proof courses (DPC) were analyzed by Ion Chromatography (IC) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (ESEM/EDS). Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) and capillarity test were carried out in the building materials and DPCs showing that porous materials with high porosity, small pores and low strength are more prone to salt weathering. The City of Adelaide is a natural laboratory for comparing and analyzing different treatments of salt-laden masonry, with hundreds of treated buildings of the same age, in the same environment, and with similar building materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{earthquake}} {{response of}} pure-friction base isolated masonry building with restricted base sliding {{is presented in}} this paper. A clear smoothened surface is created at the plinth level of the building above the <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course,</b> and the superstructure rests at this level to slide freely, except for the frictional resistance and the rigid stopper. As the superstructure is free to slide at the plinth level, {{there will be a}} feeling to the occupants that it might slide more than the permissible relative displacement limit provided {{at the top of the}} substructure. This may create a fear among the occupants that the building may overturn. In view of this, a mathematical model was developed for masonry building with restricted base sliding system using rigid stopper. Feasible position of the stopper has been determined such that the seismic response of the structure is reduced considerably in comparison with that of corresponding fixed base structure. Investigation was also made to determine the seismic response of the buildings with varying time period, mass ratio, coefficient of friction and damping coefficient subjected to Koyna and five other pseudo earthquakes. The pseudo earthquakes were generated either by increasing or decreasing the ground acceleration and duration of the Koyna accelerogram. It turns out from the present study that the pure-friction isolated restricted base sliding system is effective in reducing the seismic force acting on the masonry building with low value of coefficient of friction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRising damp {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recurrent}} and well-known hazards to existing buildings and monuments. Several types of intervention exist to tackle the problem. Among these, the creation of a <b>damp-proof</b> <b>course</b> against capillary rise by means of injection of chemical products {{is one of the}} most diffused methods, thanks to the relatively easy and cheap application. Despite positive results when applied under controlled conditions in laboratory, these interventions do not always deliver the desired result in practice. Several studies have shown varying degrees of success. Various factors, like the lack of homogeneity of the substrate and a high moisture and salt content may affect the effectiveness of treatments. Moreover, the type of substrate and the combination of materials with different pore size distribution influence the spreading and the effectiveness of chemical products. Since rising damp is a problem that is mainly manifested in masonry, that is usually composed of at least two materials, the last factor may be of great importance. The current paper reports the results of a research on the transport of chemical injection products in relatively small mortar/brick combinations. Since no easy to perform test method for small combined specimens, giving results within a short time, was available, a special test method was developed. The effect of the interface between brick and mortar on the transport of the products was studied by the application of several injection products and creams. The tested products include pore filling and water repellent products and products in water as well as in organic solvent. The obtained results show clear differences in spreading and effectiveness in the different substrates and between products in organic solvent and water based ones, as well as between creams and liquid products. The results show that water based products can easily be transported through the mortar joint, differently from what occurs with products in an organic solvent. This is the consequence of the different transport mechanisms of water based products and products in organic solvent in water filled pores...|$|E
