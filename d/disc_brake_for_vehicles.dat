2500|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>for</b> heavy <b>vehicles.</b> In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThermal fatigue of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> <b>for</b> railway <b>vehicles</b> {{has been}} a {{troublesome}} problem {{since the advent of}} <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> To develop cast-iron <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> with high heat resistance to thermal shock loading, three candidate materials with different components were developed. Main components of the cast irons are Fe, C, Si, Mn, Ni, Cr, Mo, Cu and Al. Mechanical and thermal properties were measured. Then thermal fatigue tests were carried out by a thermal fatigue test equipment developed by the authors. The possible temperature range of the equipment is 20 ∼ 1500  °C. Cylindrical solid specimens ϕ 20 × 80 mm were heated by an induction coil and cooled in water. At an interval of 20 ∼ 30 thermal cycles, the surfaces of the specimens were examined with an optical microscope to check thermal cracks. To quantify the total length of cracks an image analyzing program that can measure the length of cracks from micrographs was developed. It was found the fatigue lifetime of cast iron can be elongated by regulating composition and metallurgical structures...|$|R

2500|$|V-brakes {{function}} {{well with}} the suspension systems found on many mountain bikes {{because they do not}} require a separate cable stop on the frame or fork.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> is {{a device}} for slowing or {{stopping}} {{the rotation of}} a wheel. Friction causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop. Brakes convert friction to heat, but if the brakes get too hot, they will cease to work because they cannot dissipate enough heat. This condition of failure is known as <b>brake</b> fade. <b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> are exposed to large thermal stresses during routine braking and extraordinary thermal stresses during hard braking. The aim of the present work is to model a <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> used in Honda Civic. Coupled field analysis (Structural + Thermal) is done on the <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> The materials used are cast iron and aluminum. Analysis is also done by changing the design of <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> Actual <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> has no holes, design is changed by giving holes in the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>for</b> more heat dissipation. Modeling is done in CATIA and Analysis is done in ANSYS...|$|R
