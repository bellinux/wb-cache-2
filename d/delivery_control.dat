50|$|The central {{concept of}} the system is a unique number, a PlusCode, {{assigned}} to each program, and published in television listings in newspapers and magazines (such as TV Guide). To record a program, the code number is taken from the newspaper and input into the video recorder, which would then record on the correct channel at the correct time. The number is generated by an algorithm from the date, time and channel of the program; as a result, it does not rely on an over-the-air channel to serve as a conduit to ensure the recording is properly timed. This means it will not compensate for a disrupted schedule due to live sporting events or bulletins for breaking news events, however many video recorders with these systems also incorporate Programme <b>Delivery</b> <b>Control</b> (PDC) and use that to alter times if possible.|$|E
50|$|Yet another {{service in}} the U.S. that relied on data {{delivery}} via the VBI like teletext, was the Guide+ (Guide Plus, {{also referred to as}} GuidePlus+ as well) service provided and developed by Gemstar. There were several models of television sets made throughout the 90s by Thomson Consumer Electronics under the RCA and General Electric brands that had built-in Guide+ decoders. Guide+ was an on-screen interactive program guide that provided current TV schedule listings, as well as other information like news headlines. Some Guide+ equipped sets from RCA even had an IR-emitting sensor that could be plugged {{into the back of the}} TV, to control a VCR to record programs which could be selected from the on-screen Guide+ listings.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, a number of {{probabilistic}} models for drug delivery have been developed.

We present here a model based on Monte Carlo and Cellular Automata approaches, for simulating drug release from coated microspheres in the gastro-intestinal tract. Controlled release is obtained using ethylcellulose as the coating polymer. Modelling features, such as the drug and coating dissolution are nontrivial, since material is non-homogenously dispersed and the dissolution exhibits complex behaviour. Important underlying mechanisms of the process, such as erosion, are described here...|$|R

40|$|The {{improvement}} of pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as tablets, towards drug <b>delivery</b> <b>control</b> and cost efficiency {{is of great}} importance in formulation technologies. Here, three examples: in situ coating, freeze casting and protein-based biocomposites are presented that address the above mentioned issues and contribute to further developments in formulation technologies. The in situ coating increases the economic efficiency by saving process steps in comparison to a conventional tableting process and provides a crystalline coating for a tailorable drug delivery rate. The freeze casting allows the control over the surface area of a drug delivery system (DDS) by providing different numbers and sizes of pores, which in conjunction with adequate additives offer an efficient instrument for drug <b>delivery</b> <b>control,</b> especially by accelerating the dissolution effect. Protein-based biocomposites are attractive materials for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications {{that can be applied}} as a polymeric DDS. They inherently combine degradability in vivo and in vitro, show a good biocompatibility, offer sites of adhesion for cells and may additionally be used to release embedded bioactive molecules. Here, a new approach regarding the incorporation of crystalline active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) into a protein matrix in one process step is presented.
