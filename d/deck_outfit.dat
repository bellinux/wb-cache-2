According to Brendon Chung, the sole developer behind Blendo Games, Quadrilateral Cowboy takes place in the same universe as his previous games, Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, and shares the same [...] "blocky" [...] aesthetics.|$|R
5000|$|One {{of three}} sister ships, she was {{launched}} on 19 August 1974 as the Monte Cruceta at the [...] "S. A. Juliana Gijonesa" [...] shipyard in Gijón, Spain, for the Spanish shipping line Naviera Aznar. The vessels were built as long-distance multi-purpose roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferries, handling both cargo and passengers, with fully refrigerated vehicle <b>decks.</b> <b>Outfitting</b> delays postponed her maiden voyage until 1976, {{by which time}} she had been renamed as Monte Castillo. The ships ran a summer service in the Mediterranean, and in the winter carried fruit and vegetables across the Bay of Biscay to Liverpool and Newhaven from Spain and the Balearic Islands ...|$|R
50|$|Starting in 2014, SpaceX {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS) from <b>deck</b> barges, <b>outfitted</b> with station-keeping engines and a large landing platform. The ships, which are stationed hundreds of kilometers downrange, allow for first stage recovery on high-velocity missions which cannot return to the launch site.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853 Congress, {{which had}} {{approved}} {{the construction of}} the first Soo Locks on the St. Mary's River, appropriated $5,000 for the construction of what would be the first lighthouse at Point Iroquois. [...] In 1855-1856 the United States Lighthouse Board implemented this appropriation and built a wood and rubble stone lighthouse at the Point; this aid to navigation commenced operations on June 18, 1856. The first Point Iroquois light was a 45 ft rubble stone tower with a wooden lantern <b>deck,</b> <b>outfitted</b> with a flashing white fourth order Fresnel lens. Being built on the Point's highest ground, this first light had a 63 ft focal plane, and a range of visibility of [...] A dwelling for a full-time lightkeeper was included as part of the complex. [...] The St. Martin Reef Light is a twin of this first light station.|$|R
50|$|An {{autonomous}} spaceport drone ship (ASDS) is an {{ocean-going vessel}} {{derived from a}} <b>deck</b> barge, <b>outfitted</b> with station-keeping engines and a large landing platform. Construction of such ships was commissioned by aerospace company SpaceX to allow for recovery of rocket first-stages at sea for high-velocity missions which do not carry enough fuel {{to return to the}} launch site after lofting spacecraft onto an orbital trajectory.|$|R
5000|$|America is an {{overnight}} riverboat built by Chesapeake Shipbuilding in Salisbury, Maryland for American Cruise Lines (ACL) for overnight river cruising on the Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers in the United States. America replaced paddlewheeler American Pride on the Mississippi River in 2016 when that ship was repositioned to the Columbia River. [...] According to American Cruise lines, America will have [...] "features {{never seen before}} on a riverboat". America is slightly larger than previous ACL riverboats with a 185-passenger capacity. The ship's hull was launched on August 7, 2015 {{and moved to a}} basin where construction of the upper <b>decks</b> and <b>outfitting</b> will take place.|$|R
50|$|The crane, {{capable of}} muscling up to 10,000 cars in one lift, allows the mating {{of an entire}} <b>outfitted</b> <b>deck</b> box of a semi-submersible rig onto its hull/pontoons in one single operation. The {{shipyard}} states that this will reduce work hazards at high altitudes and in the open sea. The lifting of the complete deck box reduces man-hours {{by as much as}} half.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime Prior to 1992 Woodbine was {{modified}} {{and used as}} a mobile fish-processing vessel in Alaska for the Woodbine Alaska Fishing Company (WAFCO). The buoy deck was enclosed and used as a processing floor with 4 large freezers. On the stern a galley was built and the whole deck aft of the wheelhouse was inclosed to shelter the cardboard used to pack frozen fish in. The forward <b>deck</b> was <b>outfitted</b> with multiple holding tanks for fish waiting to be processed. Towards her end as a processor another shelter {{was added to the}} buoy deck. To off set for all the building upwards 30,000 lbs of cement had to be poured in to the lower hold. The design of the processing operation was very simple and had none of the labor saving equipment the other companies used. It was a very labor-intensive at times. unloading the holds of frozen fish had to be done by hand. we ran an all male crew because of close quarters and hard labor conditions. I last stood on her decks in 1995. I quite the company and the M/V Woodbine left of another season. 8 years ago I found the M/V Woodbine tied to the docks in Astoria,Oregon. Her home port had always Been Rio Vista California so I asked around what the story was.I was told [...] "1996 the crew was taking her home for the off season and the company did not make payroll and checks were no good. They decided to not complete the trip and pulled in to Astoria",where the M/V Woodbine would sit for her remaining years until she was sold for scrap around 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shortage}} of multiproduct replenishment {{ships in the}} early 1970s {{led to the development}} of an improvised system for dispensing fuel from ammunition and stores ships that allowed them to transfer fuel to smaller combatants. Neither type of ship had cargo fuel, but each could share its own fuel with destroyers and frigates in an emergency. The lack of sufficient numbers of AOEs or AORs precluded the deployment of these types in support of any of the surface warfare groups, which were generally composed of destroyers and frigates. The old saw that necessity is the mother of invention proved to be true when Rear Admiral John Johnson devised a practical solution to the {{shortage of}} fuel-carrying UNREP ships based on the modification of existing cargo transfer gear on ammunition and stores ships. As commander Task Force 73 (the service force of the Seventh Fleet) in 1973, Admiral Johnson had to contend with the problem of how to provide logistic support for the two Seventh Fleet destroyers deployed to the Indian Ocean for an extended period of time. The answer was to turn the [...] into a mini multiproduct ship by adding two cargo reefer boxes as <b>deck</b> cargo and <b>outfitting</b> it with a jury-rigged fuel station. The latter was achieved by temporarily rigging a 7-inch fuel hose to the starboard side cargo station—the one closest to the ship's fuel receiving raiser. The highline was used as a span wire, and fuel hose saddles were supported from a wire whip from a nearby hauling winch or a fiber whip from a nearby gypsy. Fuel was pumped from the ship's own fuel bunkers to the receiving ship alongside using the fuel-transfer pump normally carried aboard the AE. The pumping rate was considerably less than that of a fleet oiler and, while workable, contained many drawbacks.|$|R
