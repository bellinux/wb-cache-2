2500|$|The biggest {{difference}} between Belgian Dutch and Dutch {{used in the}} Netherlands is in the pronunciation of words. The Dutch spoken {{in the north of}} the Netherlands is typically described as being [...] "sharper", while Belgian Dutch is [...] "softer". In Belgian Dutch, there are also less vowels pronounced as diphthongs. When it comes to spelling, Belgian Dutch language purists historically avoided writing words using a French spelling, or search for specific translations of words derived from French. While the Dutch prefer to stick with French spelling, as it differentiates Dutch more from the neighbouring German. For example, the Dutch word [...] "punaise" [...] (English: <b>Drawing</b> <b>pin)</b> is derived directly from the French language. Belgian Dutch language purists have lobbied to accept the word [...] "duimspijker" [...] (literally: thumb spike) as official Dutch, though the Dutch Language Union never accepted it as standard Dutch. Other proposals by purists were sometimes accepted, and sometimes reverted again in later spelling revisions. As language purists were quite often professionally involved in language (f.e. as a teacher), these unofficial purist translations are found more often in Belgian Dutch texts.|$|E

50|$|A {{thumb tack}} (North American English) or push pin {{is a short}} nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and {{intended}} to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are {{used to refer to}} different designs intended for various purposes. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively. These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation. <b>Drawing</b> <b>pin</b> or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.|$|E

40|$|In a fiber {{spinning}} process molten polymer is extruded into a fiber. The resulting fiber known as as-spun fiber is relatively weak and shows a large plastic central zone in its constitutive behavior. As {{a result the}} fiber deforms substantially without {{a significant change in}} load thus making it unsuitable for stress bearing applications. The range of plastic deformation is related to the natural draw ratio. In order to improve the mechanical properties of as spun fibers, {{fiber spinning}} is followed by a fiber draw process. With multi stage draw the as-spun fiber is drawn beyond the plastic region in various drawing zones which produces greater orientation of the polymer chains in the axial direction of the fiber thus enhancing mechanical strength characteristics of the fiber. The multistage draw process consists of several rollers each rotating at a speed greater than the one prior to it. The objective of this work is to develop a first approximation to model fiber draw in the multistage drawing process, with and without a <b>draw</b> <b>pin.</b> As the first step the slippage of fibers on rollers was analysed by including centrifugal acceleration and acceleration due to stretching. The draw in a free span is also modelled. Several representative draw processes were examined. It was found <b>draw</b> <b>pin</b> localizes the <b>draw</b> significantly although the resulting mechanical unloading complicates the analysis. Draw in the free span is impossible for isothermal draw processes, and anisothermal draw induces thermal unloading in the system. A comprehensive analysis of various draw processes will be examined.

In this method, pins are pushed into the paper at two points, which become the ellipse's foci. A string tied at each end to the two pins and {{the tip of a}} pencil pulls the loop taut to form a triangle. The tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut. Using two pegs and a rope, gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed—thus it is called the gardener's ellipse.|$|R
