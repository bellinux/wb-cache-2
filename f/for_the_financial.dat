5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} the Electorate of Cologne.

When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Airbus {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding with Drukair in July 2003 for two 114-seat Airbus A319-115, powered by two CFM56-5B engines, for delivery {{in the second half}} of 2004. The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E

Following his departure from the Negro leagues in 1950, Day spent a season with the semi-professional Winnipeg Buffalos of the Mandak League. Finally, in 1951 Day made his debut in organized baseball, albeit in the minors, with the Toronto Maple Leafs, a Triple-A club that Day tallied a 1–1 record with in 14 games. Day also played for two other teams in the farm system, the Scranton Miners and the Edmonton Eskimos, before retiring from professional baseball in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|He {{played a}} crucial role at the {{beginning}} of internal autonomy (1956–1958), although the relatively conservative Boganda remained sympathetic to French interests and still did not advocate immediate independence. For Boganda, the 1956 election, in which he took 89% of the vote against another Oubanguian, was an uncontested speaker's platform with which the colonial administration had come to terms; the French had realised that opposing him would be dangerous and sought to accommodate him. That year he agreed to European representation on election lists in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> support of French business leaders, and on 18 November, was elected as the first mayor of Bangui. On 31 March 1957, MESAN won all seats in the Territorial Assembly election; on 18 June, Boganda was elected president of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa (a forum he used to broadcast his views on African unity) and in May was appointed vice-president of the Oubangui-Chari Government Council (the French governor was still its president).|$|E
5|$|In 1457, Skanderbeg had {{achieved}} {{his most famous}} victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena (Ujëbardha), which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy. In order to repay Alfonso <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> and military assistance given to him years before, Skanderbeg took up the pope's pleas to help out Alfonso's son by sending a military expedition to Italy. Before leaving, Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, to ensure his domain's safety. Mehmed had not declared a truce {{and he was still}} sending his armies against Bosnia and the Morea. It was not until 1459, after Mehmed's conquest of Serbia, that Mehmed not only declared a truce, but also a three-year ceasefire with Skanderbeg. This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity to send his men to Italy.|$|E

5|$|Knox {{had avoided}} being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice {{to return to}} tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later {{he was still in}} charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He {{toyed with the idea of}} fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox {{remained}} a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine. Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} of Rufus in 1100, Ranulf was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Rufus' {{successor}} Henry I of England. Ranulf was a convenient scapegoat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> extortions of Rufus' reign. He became the first prisoner {{to escape from the}} Tower and went into exile in Normandy with Rufus' and Henry's older brother Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy. Ranulf became a leading advisor to Robert, and assisted in his unsuccessful invasion of England, an attempt to oust Henry from the throne. The brothers reconciled, but although Ranulf was restored to office he spent the next few years in Normandy, returning only after Henry had defeated Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray. Ranulf subsequently retired from political life, with only occasional appearances in public. He remained active in ecclesiastical affairs, attending councils and working to defend the rights of his see.|$|E
5|$|The nominal gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) of Uttar Pradesh grew {{at an annual rate}} of 8 to 12 percent between 2002–03 and 2006-07. When Mayawati began her five-year tenure as chief minister from May 2007, the average annual state GDP growth rate between 2007–08 and 2010-11 shot up to 17 percent. In financial year 2011, UP’s state GDP was predicted to grow by 11 per cent. Thus, UP’s nominal GDP growth in these four years (2007–11) was almost the same as what the entire country clocked in that period. State’s per capita income went up by 136 per cent from about Rs 11,000 in 2007 to Rs 26,000 in 2011. UP continued to be one of the few states with a revenue surplus and Mayawati has used this surplus to reduce the state’s fiscal deficit from 4 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to a budgeted figure of 2.97 per cent <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> year 2011. Mayawati also ensured that the state’s indebtedness came down from 43 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to 32 percent in 2011-12. Mayawati in her five years added about 4,000 MW of generation capacity to the state’s power sector. Mayawati also planned to create 7,000 MW more generation capacity by the end of 2012 for achieving her target is to make state a power-surplus state by 2017 for which the state is already executing power projects with a total capacity of 10,000 MW.|$|E
