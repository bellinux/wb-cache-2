40|$|The {{high-frequency}} rheology of concentrated liquid charge-stabilized dispersions {{has been}} measured using a surface-loaded torsional resonator. The high-frequency shear moduli are {{extracted from the}} measurement {{as a function of}} ionic strength and surface acid content. A theory which enables the determination of the effective surface charge of the concentrated dispersions is presented. At high ionic strengths the theory simplifies to an analytic formula relating the effective surface charge to the high-frequency limiting shear modulus in terms of an effective hard-sphere diameter. The effective hard-sphere diameter is obtained experimentally from the high concentration asymptote of the zero-shear viscosity. The resulting effective surface charge increases with added electrolyte content in agreement with charge renormalization theory. The effective charge also increases with added weak and strong surface acid content. The method, which operates on concentrated dispersions, is found to yield effective charges that agree with <b>dilute</b> <b>measurements</b> of the electrophoretic mobility.

This study aims to examine this by correlating preoperative PFA- 100 ® measurement with perioperative bleeding in patients receiving cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. Methods. PFA- 100 ® with adenosine- 5 '-diphosphate (ADPCT) and epinephrine (EPICT) cartridges were measured before operation in consecutive patients undergoing elective total knee replacement and taking different COX inhibitors. Surgery and anaesthesia were performed by the same team using standardized techniques. Intraoperative blood loss and postoperative drain output were recorded by anaesthetists and nurses blinded to the PFA- 100 ® measurements. Surgeons, similarly blinded, {{were asked to rate}} the quality of haemostasis. Correlation was sought between these data and PFA- 100 ® measurements. Results. Thirty patients were studied, involving 51 knees. Preoperative PFA- 100 ® EPICT was correlated with drain output (r= 0. 30, P= 0. 03). The correlation becomes stronger when a 20 in vitro haemodiluted sample was used for measurement (r= 0. 42, P= 0. 01). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis using the <b>diluted</b> <b>measurements</b> [area under curve (AUC) 0. 74 (95 CI 0. 54 - 0. 94) ] suggested using a cut-off value of 188 s for EPICT, which will predict excessive drain output with 89 sensitivity, 54 specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 1. 93. Diluted EPICT was also correlated with surgeon rating of haemostasis (r= 0. 36, P= 0. 04) although none of the measurements correlated with intraoperative blood loss. Conclusions. Preoperative PFA- 100 ® prolongation is correlated with increased postoperative drain output.

Conjugated polymers are being considered for application as the semi-conducting layer in low-cost field-effect transistors (FETs) for the fabrication of flexible or disposable electronic devices. A second application using the light-emitting properties of conjugated polymers is as an emissive layer in light emitting diodes (LEDs) and large area displays. The third application that is being considered {{is the use of}} conjugated polymers as the light absorbing layer in photovoltaic devices. Finally, the fourth possible application is the use of conjugated polymers is as molecular wires in single molecule electronics. All of these applications critically rely on the ability of the conjugated polymers to transport charges. A thorough understanding of the properties of charge carriers and their mobility is therefore of obvious importance. Some of the applications involve electronically excited states of conjugated polymers. In LEDs the lowest singlet excited state is the emissive state, while in photovoltaic devices the excited state is the primarily formed species. Therefore it is also of interest to study the properties of conjugated polymers or oligomers in their electronically excited state.

MethodsWe studied 56 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in which the left internal thoracic artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery. The first 26 consecutive internal thoracic arteries were harvested as a pedicled graft (group 1), and the next 30 consecutive internal thoracic arteries were dissected by using the carbon dioxide insufflation technique (group 2). The internal thoracic artery harvesting was performed by 2 experienced surgeons by using the same instrumentation and technique. First, free flows of the internal thoracic arteries were registered after distal cutting of the vessel in both groups. After the first <b>measurements,</b> <b>diluted</b> papaverine was sprayed on the internal thoracic artery pedicle only in group 1, and then second measurements were registered after 15 minutes in both groups. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded with each measurement. ResultsThe first free flow measurement was significantly higher in the carbon dioxide–insufflated internal thoracic arteries (group 2, 60 ± 32 mL/min; group 1, 28 ± 19 mL/min; P <. 05). Although the second free flow measurement of the carbon dioxide–insufflated group was higher than in group 1, {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (68 ± 46 mL/min vs 53 ± 32 mL/min; P =. 53).

A {{diesel particulate filter}} (DPF) {{can be used to}} reduce the particulate matter (PM) emissions from a vehicle. However, when these devices fail the tailpipe emissions can change. The main goal of this project was to determine if a soot sensor provided by Honeywell could detect a failed filter, defined as an exhaust aerosol concentration downstream of the DPF greater than the current US heavy duty PM standard of 13 mg/kWh (10 mg/bhp-hr). In this study a DPF failure was first simulated on an engine dynamometer test stand using an exhaust bypass valve. Then the valve was removed and the filter was actually failed in a series of steps by drilling out individual channel end caps. Exhaust was cooled and diluted using a partial flow air ejector dilution tunnel, and dilution ratios were determined using raw and dilute nitric oxide (NO) <b>measurements.</b> <b>Dilute</b> diesel exhaust aerosol was characterized upstream and downstream of a DPF. Filter samples and an AVL photo-acoustic soot sensor were used to estimate PM mass emissions, and TSI aerosol instruments were used to measure aerosol size distributions and total number concentrations.

Downstream measurements were repeated as the filter was progressively failed in a series of steps. These measurements were then used to evaluate the response of the Honeywell exhaust soot sensor. Under certain steady state conditions the sensor output showed a statistically significant increase as the filter was failed but the output was susceptible to interference from mechanical vibration and was dependent on engine operating conditions, and the exhaust system used. Exhaust aerosol charge measurements showed the concept is viable but further work is required to refine the sensor...|$|R

Effects on the mandibular gland, involved in the production of brood food and in royal jelly, have not been examined in relation to primer pheromones while effects on the hypopharyngeal glands, also involved in the production of brood food, have not been examined in relation to queen mandibular pheromone. This thesis provides preliminary insight into how these pheromones affect the extractable protein content of brood food glands. The first study in this thesis assessed the effects of brood pheromone (BP), queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), and pollen presence on the protein content of hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of the honey bee. In this study, newly emerged bees were caged for 12 days in one of eight treatments: Queenless state: 1) control (no pollen + no pheromone), 2) pollen, 3) BP, 4) BP + pollen; Queenright state: 1) QMP, 2) QMP + pollen, 3) BP + QMP, 4) BP + QMP + pollen. This study indicated that regardless of pheromone treatment, the most influential factor on gland protein content and size was pollen. The second experiment examined effects of varying pollen dilution on hypopharyngeal and mandibular gland protein content, bee mass, and lipid content of the honey bee. In this experiment, newly emerged bees were caged for 7 days and fed one of five treatments: pollen, 1 : 1 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol), 1 : 2 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol); 1 : 3 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol), and cellulose.

Acid was diffused into {{one end of}} the cell through a patch pipette filled with an isotonic KCl solution of pH 3. 0. Intracellular H+ mobility was low, acid taking 20 - 30 s to move 40 μm down the cell. Inhibiting sarcolemmal Na+-H+ exchange with 1 mm amiloride had no effect on this time delay. Net Hi+ movement was associated with a longitudinal intracellular pH (pHi) gradient of up to 0. 4 pH units. Hi+ movement could be modelled using the equations for diffusion, assuming an apparent diffusion coefficient for H+ ions (DappH) of 3. 78 × 10 − 7 cm 2 s− 1, a value more than 300 -fold lower than the H+ diffusion coefficient in a <b>dilute,</b> unbuffered solution. <b>Measurement</b> of the intracellular concentration of SNARF (≈ 400 μM) and its intracellular diffusion coefficient (0. 9 × 10 − 7 cm 2 s− 1) indicated that the fluorophore itself exerted an insignificant effect (between 0. 6 and 3. 3 %) on the longitudinal movement of H+ equivalents inside the cell. The longitudinal movement of intracellular H+ is discussed in terms of a diffusive shuttling of H+ equivalents on high capacity mobile buffers which comprise about half (≈ 11 mm) of the total intrinsic buffering capacity within the myocyte (the other half being fixed buffer sites on low mobility, intracellular proteins).

This study evaluates the impact of SLMP {{on the value of}} agricultural production in select woredas by using a panel survey from 2010 to 2014. Whereas previous studies have used cross-sectional data and short timeframe field trials to measure sustainable land management (SLM) effects on agricultural productivity, this analysis exploits data collected over four years to assess impact. The results of this analysis show that participation by farmers in SLMP, regardless of the number of years of participation in the program, is not associated with significant increases in value of production. This may be due to several reasons. First, similar to previous studies, it is possible that longer term maintenance is necessary in order to experience significant benefits. For example, Schmidt and Tadesse (2014) report that farmers must maintain SLM for a minimum of seven years to reap benefits in value of production. Second, this analysis finds that value of production, as well as SLM investments, increased significantly in both treatment and non-treatment areas over the study period. Previous research has found that non-treatment neighbors learn from nearby program areas, and adopt technologies similar to programmed areas, which would <b>dilute</b> the impact <b>measurement</b> of program effects (Bernard et al. 2007; Angelucci and DiMaro 2010). Finally, {{it is important to note}} that kebeles that were not selected in the SLMP, but are downstream relative to a targeted kebele may receive indirect benefits through reduced flooding, increased water tables, etc. Thus, the impact of the SLMP may be underestimated in this analysis if non-program kebeles are benefiting indirectly from the program.

40|$|Background: The {{transactional}} {{model of}} stress describes a psychological and physiological stress response that is elicited when an environmental demand {{is perceived to}} outweigh the {{ability to cope with}} the demand. With perception at its core, this theory explains large variances in human stress responses. A frequently cited measure of stress perception is the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). A two-step approach to structural equation modelling (SEM) necessitates that a valid measurement model for stress be first established through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and then the impact of stress on the biomarkers be assessed. Methods: The aims of this study were to explore and confirm the factorial structure of the 10 -item PSS (PSS- 10) in a sample of healthy Australians (n = 194) and to crossvalidate it in an independent sample (n = 117) of healthy Australians with chronic work stress, and to explore the impact of stress on the production of the ex vivo stimulated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukins IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), using SEM. As only Sample 1 had data on both PSS scores and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, SEM would be confined to Sample 1. 198 J. Bradbury. Results: Perceived Stress was found to have different factorial structures in the different samples. In Sample 1, it was best represented by three correlated factors; Overwhelmed (items 2, 10, 6, 8), Coping (items 4, 7, 5), and Emotional Reactivity (items 1, 9, 3). This three-factor model for was not cross-validated in Sample 2, which fit the two-factor model reported in the literature. The SEM suggested that the three factors predicted significant differential effects on proinflammatory cytokines that were less evident for the two-factor model. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that if the measurement model does not adequately represent the relationship structures within the data, differential effects on biomarkers may be <b>diluted</b> by larger <b>measurement</b> errors. This analysis has highlighted the importance of testing the assumptions of the measurement model used to represent stress in human populations. Further research is required to determine whether the construct known as perceived stress comprises two or three inherent factors in population norms...|$|R
40|$|Three maize (Zea mays L.) {{experiments}} {{were established in}} 1983 and 1984 {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of various methods and sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in a reduced-till sprinkler irrigation practice. Phosphorus method-source studies were conducted on a calcareous soil at Loup City, NE and an acid soil at Mead, NE. ^ Dual placed (DP) N and P in a localized band (anhydrous ammonia applied with liquid P sources) increased P uptake and corn grain yields on a calcareous soil as compared to P banded to the side of the seed (BS) and banded below the seed (BB). Broadcast preplant (BRP) applications were equally as effective as DP methods under reduced tillage practices. Explanation of enhanced DP yields and P uptake could lie in the synergistic effect of N and P placed together, especially when the ammoniacal form of N is used. Urea phosphate (UP) provided greater yields and total P uptake in both the grain and stover as compared to P sources ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) at the calcareous soil site. The greater early uptake of P when BB and BS did not increase grain yield and or P uptake versus DP and BRP methods of P placement. ^ Anhydrous ammonia injected preplant and or sidedress provided superior yields and uptake efficiencies when compared to all other sources of N used (sulfur coated urea, urea ureaphosphate, urea and urea ammoniumnitrate). Data suggest that N sources should be placed below the soil surface in reduced-tillage practices to prevent microbial immobilization and volatilization losses. Nitrogen from ear-leaf tissue samples (analyzed for total-N) that were taken at early silking was highly correlated with yield. Results of ear-leaf analysis might be used to recommend the amount of N to be applied through irrigation during grain fill. ^ Tissue samples were taken throughout the growth cycle of maize and analyzed for phosphate phosphorus (dilute acetic acid extractable) and total phosphorus (nitric-perchloric acid digestion). High correlation was found between the results of these two procedures, indicating that one method is as good as the other for assessing the relative P status of the plant. The <b>dilute</b> acid extractable <b>measurement</b> can also be used to predict total P uptake by the plant. ...|$|R
