40|$|Background: Determination of seizure {{threshold}} {{can help}} guide selection of stimulus dosage in electroconvul-sive therapy (ECT); however, this threshold {{is subject to}} a variety of influences. Objective: To compare the ef-fect of two stimulus-titration schedules on initial seizure threshold, in 88 patients. Method: One strategy was to use the <b>factory-set</b> stimulus characteristics on the Thymatron DGx instrument, which includes uniform stimulus dose increments of 5 % of maximum charge. The other strategy was our approximation of stimulus dose increments of 5 % of maximum charge on the MECTA SR 1 instrument. Subjects were assigned randomly in groups with three age-related stratifications. Results: Measured seizure thresholds were higher with the stim-uli used from the MECTA schedule than with Thymatron in 79 % of patients. Conclusions: The stimulus ti-tration schedule used in ECT administration is clinically significant since it may affect both adverse conse-quences and therapeutic insufficiency (German J. Psychiatry 2001; 51 - 56) ...|$|E
30|$|The pXRF {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out in situ using a Niton XL 3 t 900 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) portable energy-dispersive XRF analyser, equipped with a miniaturized X-ray tube coupled to a high-performance, thermoelectrically cooled Si-PIN diode detector. A silver anode X-ray tube (50  kV, 40  μA, 2  W maximum) with a polyimide film (Kapton®) was used to access the energies {{of a wide range}} of elements including the light ones. The analyser is fitted with an internal CCD camera for closer visualization of the measured painting spot. Collimating the primary beam to 8  mm diameter, instead of 3  mm, was sufficient to cover the details on the wall paintings, at the same time maximizing the X-ray fluorescence detected. The instrument was run in the Cu/Zn mining mode. Additional descriptions of the instrument and the parameters selected are given elsewhere [6]. The concentrations of the elements were obtained by means of the algorithm for the fundamental parameters using the <b>factory-set</b> internal calibrations. The data, which were treated as semi-quantitative, were used just to estimate the relative proportions of the elements. Qualitative identification of the elements based on the spectral interpretation was mainly applied in this study.|$|E
40|$|A new Volvo Penta {{carbureted}} 4. 3 GL engine underwent {{emissions and}} dynamometer durability testing from break-in to expected {{end of life}} using an accelerated ICOMIA marine emissions cycle and E 15 fuel. Only ethanol content was controlled. All aging used splash-blended E 15 fuel. Exhaust emissions, exhaust gas temperature, torque, power, barometric pressure, air temperature, and fuel flow were measured at five intervals using site-blended E 15 aging fuel and certification fuel (E 0). The durability test cycle showed no noticeable impact on mechanical durability or engine power. Emissions performance degraded beyond the certification limit for this engine family, mostly occurring by 28 % of expected life. Such degradation is inconsistent with prior experience. Comparisons showed that E 15 resulted in lower CO and HC, but increased NOX, as expected for non-feedback-controlled carbureted engines with increased oxygen in the fuel. Fuel consumption also increased with E 15 compared with E 0. Throughout testing, poor starting characteristics were exhibited on E 15 fuel for hot re-start and cold-start. Cranking time to start and smooth idle was roughly doubled compared with typical E 0 operation. The carburetor was <b>factory-set</b> for lean operation to ensure emissions compliance. Test protocols did not include carburetor adjustment to account for increased oxygen in the E 15 fuel...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experimental {{study of}} air-to-air heat/energy {{exchangers}} {{for use in}} Arctic housing Colin J. Beattie The thesis presents the experimental results of an air-to-air heat/energy exchanger (HEE), tested with four different cores, to assess the performance under Arctic climate conditions. Four per-formance indicators are presented: (i) the outlet supply air temperature; (ii) the exhaust air flow rate; (iii) the sensible and latent heat transfer effectiveness; and (iv) UV-value. The mass of ice formed within the core was also measured {{at the end of}} each experiment. The experiments are separated into three phases: Phase 1 with one HEE without recirculation defrost, Phase 2 with one HEE with recirculation defrost, and Phase 3 with two HEEs in parallel with alternating recir-culation defrost. Correlation−based models were developed that predict the change in heat transfer effectiveness in terms of the change in exhaust air mass flow rate, inlet supply air temperature and core type. The experiments with recirculation defrost proved that the <b>factory-set</b> defrost times are a conservative approach that manages the formation of frost. Because of the reduced operating time as controlled by the timer, all cores have almost the same sensible heat transfer effectiveness. The use of vapour-permeable cores reduced the rate of frost growth and the amount of frost at inlet supply air temperatures where core frosting was a concern. The rate of core frosting was dependant on the inlet supply air temperature. Frost formation impeded the transfer of heat between the two airstreams and reduced the adjusted sensible and latent heat transfer effectiveness for all cores. Recirculation defrost effectively managed the formation of frost in all tested exchanger cores for the duration of the tests at inlet supply air temperature down to − 35 °C. However, the use of recirculation defrost intermittently interrupts the supply of outdoor air resulting in reduced ventilation rates. The use of two heat/energy exchangers with alternating recirculation defrost adequately managed core frosting while providing a continuous supply of outdoor air...|$|E
