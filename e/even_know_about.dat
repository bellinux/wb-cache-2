25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{has never}} {{overruled}} its 1946 Yamashita decision. The precedent the decision established, called command responsibility or the Yamashita standard, {{was that a}} commander can be held accountable before the law for the crimes committed by his troops {{even if he did}} not order them, did not stand by to allow them, or possibly <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> them or have the means to stop them. This doctrine of command accountability has been added to the Geneva Conventions and was applied to dozens of trials in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It has also been adopted by the International Criminal Court established in 2002.|$|E

[...] Namath noted, [...] "When I remember that game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game.

At Montag and Pratt's wedding, it was depicted on the series as if Conrad and Cavallari were displeased with each other's presence, though the latter commented that they gave each other [...] "a big hug, and that's it". She also stated that when she joined The Hills, [...] "It's work! And drama sells. I think that's why they're bringing me in, because I know what works".|$|E

According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that [...] "Tom {{had nothing to do}} with this matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> it.

It wasn't supposed to be out there." [...] Sia recorded a demo of the song, which was then sent to Blige and other artists. Eventually, Guetta decided {{to stay with her}} version. He explained, [...] "The first time I heard what Sia did, because she was not in the studio with me, I fell in love with it...I didn't even want to give it to anyone else; it was perfect the way it was. It's not only about how big you are in America, it's about the song and the voice." [...] American pop singer Katy Perry {{was the first person to}} be offered the track but turned it down because she felt its message was too similar to that of her song [...] "Firework". An insider told Take 40 Australia, [...] "So that 'Titanium' song, Sia wrote it for Katy, but [...] didn't want to do a song with Guetta..." [...] According to Sia's manager, Jonathan Daniel of Crush Management, Sia wrote the song for American R singer Alicia Keys. Guetta considered approaching other female singers to record on the song, however Perry advised him to keep Sia on the track. Guetta ultimately followed this suggestion.

500|$|Before each segment, {{there are}} {{trailers}} advertising fake films, {{as well as}} vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. [...] "I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> it until I {{read it in the}} trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" [...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

60|$|This castle of Nottingham was {{situated}} upon a hill, {{on the side}} of which was a range of excavations which had been made in a chalky stone by some sort of quarrying. There was a subterranean passage from the interior of one of these caves which led to the castle. The castle itself was strongly guarded, and every night Isabel required the warden, on locking the gates, to bring the keys to her, and she kept them by her bedside. The governor of the castle, however, made an agreement with Lord Montacute, who was the leader in the conspiracy against Mortimer, to admit him to the castle at night through the subterranean passage. It seems that Mortimer and the queen did not know of the existence of this communication. They did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the caves, for the mouths of them were at that time concealed by rubbish and brambles.|$|E
