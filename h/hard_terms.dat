60|$|There is no {{question}} but the French may hold the war out several years longer; but their king is too wise to let things run to extremity. He will rather condescend to peace upon <b>hard</b> <b>terms</b> now than stay longer, if he finds himself in danger {{to be forced to}} worse.|$|E
60|$|Boab. Take {{this for}} answer, then,-- Whate'er your arms have conquered of my land, I will, for peace, resign to Ferdinand.-- To <b>harder</b> <b>terms</b> my mind I cannot bring; But, as I still have lived, will die a king.|$|R

The service, the food, the wines--everything is cheap and bad. I take no pride in my work.|$|E

When he told them of these <b>hard</b> <b>terms</b> he could not refrain from weeping bitterly, and wailing and lamentation arose all round him. Should all starve together, or sacrifice their best and most honored after all suffering in common so long? ...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{model in}} which lepton number {{violation}} is solely triggered by a dimension 4 <b>hard</b> breaking <b>term</b> in the scalar potential. A minimal model which contains a SU(2) triplet with hypercharge Y= 2, {{and a pair of}} singlet doubly charged scalar fields in addition to the Standard Model (SM) Higgs doublet is constructed. The model is technically natural in the sense that lepton number is preserved in the limit that the <b>hard</b> <b>term</b> vanishes. SM phenomenology restricts the vacuum expectation value of the triplet scalar field $v_T< 5. 78 $ GeV. Neutrino masses controlled by $v_T$ are generated at the two loop level and are naturally to the sub-eV range. In general they exhibit normal hierarchy structure. Here the neutrino mass term does not dominate neutrinoless double beta decays of nuclei. Instead the short distance physics with doubly charged Higgs exchange gives the leading contribution. We expect weak scale singly and doubly charged Higgs bosons to make their appearances at the LHC and the ILC.

"Well, if it {{will not}} hurt you we will not say any more about it," [...] the sailor replied; [...] "seeing {{that we have had}} a bad time of it lately, and have scarce money enough left between us to victual us until we get home.

60|$|The {{rejoinder}} being complete, {{all that}} remained was to find a suitable medium for its publication. This was not so easy. Distinguished mediums would not lend themselves to contradictions of Grampus, or if they would, Merman's article was too long and too abstruse, while he would not consent to leave anything out of an article which had no superfluities; for all this happened years ago when the world was at a different stage. At last, however, he got his rejoinder printed, and not on <b>hard</b> <b>terms,</b> since the medium, in every sense modest, did not ask him to pay for its insertion.|$|E
60|$|But {{all this}} time, no attempt {{whatever}} {{was made to}} relieve them. The French and Irish generals were disputing {{as to what was}} the best plan of campaign. The king was busy making money with his trade with France; and, after holding out until they had burned their last grain of powder, the gallant garrison were forced to capitulate. Schomberg was too glad to get the place to insist on <b>hard</b> <b>terms,</b> and the garrison marched out with all the honours of war--drums beating, and matches alight--and were conveyed, with all their stores, arms, and public and private property, to the nearest Irish post.|$|E

6000|$|... [Footnote: The {{details of}} this {{remarkable}} event are, as given in the preceding chapter, imaginary; but {{the outline of the}} events is historical. Sir Robert Lindesay, brother to the author of the Memoirs, was at first intrusted with the delicate commission of persuading the imprisoned queen to resign her crown. As he flatly refused to interfere, they determined to send the Lord Lindesay, one of the rudest and most violent of their own faction, with instructions, first to use fair persuasions, and if these did not succeed, to enter into <b>harder</b> <b>terms.</b> Knox associates Lord Ruthven with Lindesay in this alarming commission. He was the son of that Lord Ruthven who was prime agent in the murder of Rizzio; and little mercy was to be expected from his conjunction with Lindesay.|$|R
6000|$|There is a vivid {{illustration}} of this unexpected business-like quality in Diderot, {{in a conversation}} that he once had with D'Alembert. The dialogue is interesting to those {{who happen to be}} curious as to the characters of two famous men. It was in 1759, when D'Alembert was tired of the Encyclopædia, and was for making <b>hard</b> <b>terms</b> as the condition of his return to it. [...] "If," [...] said Diderot to him, [...] "six months ago, when we met to deliberate on the continuation of the work, you had then proposed these terms, the booksellers would have closed with them on the spot, but now, when they have the strongest reasons to be out of humour with you, that is another thing." ...|$|E

[...] "No, no," [...] he said, [...] "I didn't mean that--I am sure you love me--take my arm again. Do you know, Regina, I doubt whether your uncle has told you everything that passed between us. Are you really aware of the <b>hard</b> <b>terms</b> that he insists on? He expects me to increase my five hundred a year to two thousand, before he will sanction our marriage." ...|$|E

It was, too, a cruelty which he certainly had done nothing to deserve. He could lay his hand on his heart and assure himself that he had treated that mad, pig-headed tradesman well in all respects. He knew himself to be the last man to make a promise, and then to break it wilfully. He had certainly borrowed money of Neefit;--and at the probable cost of all his future happiness he had, with a nobleness which he could not himself sufficiently admire, done his very best to keep the <b>hard</b> <b>terms</b> which in his distress he had allowed to be imposed upon himself.

60|$|I do not know, Tresham, by what witchery this {{fascinating}} creature obtained such complete management over a temper which I cannot {{at all times}} manage myself. I had determined on entering the library, to seek a complete explanation with Miss Vernon.

And yet, while I was {{on the point of}} leaving the apartment, and breaking with her for ever, it cost her but a change of look and tone, from that of real and haughty resentment to that of kind and playful despotism, again shaded off into melancholy and serious feeling, to lead me back to my seat, her willing subject, on her own <b>hard</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
