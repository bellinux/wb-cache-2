5|$|The wild {{landscape}} was largely formed by a severe process of <b>desertification</b> in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Many {{localized}} {{areas are}} subject to human-made pollution {{of the air and}} water, acid rain and toxic substances, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, <b>desertification),</b> loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.|$|E
5|$|Problems with moving {{dunes and}} <b>desertification</b> were {{subsequently}} {{brought under control}} in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by establishing large plantations of grasses, bushes and fir trees. Two significant migratory dunes remain in the area, {{one of which is}} the enormous RÃ¥bjerg Mile.|$|E
5|$|The UN also {{declares}} and co-ordinates international observances, {{periods of}} time to observe issues of international interest or concern. Examples include World Tuberculosis Day, Earth Day, and the International Year of Deserts and <b>Desertification.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. <b>Desertification</b> is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of <b>desertification,</b> there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, Triassic and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} <b>desertification,</b> {{subsidence}} and uplift occurred and Wales was alternately inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several exceptionally cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains we see today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|In {{his role}} of UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, Jarre {{performed}} a concert named Water for Life in Morocco, on 16 December 2006, {{to celebrate the}} United Nations Year of <b>Desertification</b> in the world. The performance {{was in front of}} the Erg Chebbi Dunes of Merzouga, in the Sahara. A free event, it was attended by about 25,000 people. Images of water and the environment were projected onto nine vertical screens, held in place by sand which was watered to keep it hard. Several permanent drinking fountains were built on the site, along with a permanent electricity installation. Jarre was accompanied by over 60Moroccan artists.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a {{small village}} of little {{importance}} until 1958, when it {{was chosen as the}} capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. It was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people, but droughts and increasing <b>desertification</b> since the 1970s have displaced a vast number of Mauritanians who resettled in Nouakchott. This caused massive urban growth and overcrowding, with the city having an official population of just under a million as of 2013. The resettled population inhabited slum areas under poor conditions, but the living conditions of a portion of these inhabitants have since been ameliorated.|$|E
5|$|Following its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the Akkadian empire, to form {{a center}} of the provincial administration. The city {{included}} the whole tell and a lower town at {{the southern edge of}} the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early Akkadian periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple and might have served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the <b>desertification</b> of the region.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian {{government}} has commissioned the overseas production and launch of four satellites. The Nigeriasat-1 {{was the first}} satellite to be built under the Nigerian government sponsorship. The satellite was launched from Russia on 27 September 2003. Nigeriasat-1 {{was part of the}} worldwide Disaster Monitoring Constellation System. The primary objectives of the Nigeriasat-1 were: to give early warning signals of environmental disaster; to help detect and control <b>desertification</b> {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria; to assist in demographic planning; to establish the relationship between malaria vectors and the environment that breeds malaria and to give early warning signals on future outbreaks of meningitis using remote sensing technology; to provide the technology needed to bring education to all parts of the country through distant learning; and to aid in conflict resolution and border disputes by mapping out state and International borders.|$|E
5|$|The {{natural range}} of A.vera is unclear, as the species {{has been widely}} {{cultivated}} around the world. Naturalised strands of the species occur in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula, through North Africa (Morocco, Mauritania, Egypt), as well as Sudan and neighbouring countries, along with the Canary, Cape Verde, and Madeira Islands. This distribution is somewhat {{similar to that of}} Euphorbia balsamifera, Pistacia atlantica, and a few others, suggesting that a dry sclerophyll forest once covered large areas, but has been dramatically reduced due to <b>desertification</b> in the Sahara, leaving these few patches isolated. For comparison, several closely related (or sometimes identical) species within other plant groups {{can be found on the}} two extreme sides of the Sahara: dragon trees (Dracaena) and Aeonium being two of the most representative examples.|$|E
5|$|The saxaul sparrow {{is found}} in remote parts of Central Asia, where its {{distribution}} is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records. It {{is found in}} deserts, especially around rivers and oases. It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul (Haloxylon), poplar (Populus), or tamarisk (Tamarix). Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter. It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common across a wide range, and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it seems to have}} lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and <b>desertification</b> caused by overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent <b>desertification,</b> have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, <b>desertification,</b> and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E
5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil {{and is one of}} the causes of increased <b>desertification.</b> Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to <b>desertification.</b> Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers <b>desertification</b> by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include <b>desertification</b> {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
25|$|The type of <b>desertification</b> {{caused by}} year-round {{pasturing}} of cattle has been termed {{the most devastating}} in Central Asia, with the gravest situations in Turkmenistan and the Kazakh steppe along the eastern and northern coasts of the Caspian Sea. Wind erosion and <b>desertification</b> also are severe in settled areas along the Garagum Canal; planted windbreaks have died because of soil waterlogging and/or salinization. Other factors promoting <b>desertification</b> are the inadequacy of the collector-drainage system built in the 1950s and inappropriate application of chemicals.|$|E

25|$|According to estimates, as {{a result}} of <b>desertification</b> {{processes}} and pollution, biological productivity of the ecological systems in Turkmenistan has declined by 30% to 50% in recent decades. The Karakum and Kyzyl Kum deserts are expanding at a rate surpassed on a planetary scale only by the <b>desertification</b> process in the Sahara and Sahel regions of Africa. Between 8,000 and 10,000kmÂ² of new desert now appears each year in Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, The United Nations Sahelian Office (UNSO) {{was created}} to address the {{problems}} of drought in the Sahel region following the West African Sahel drought of 1968-73. In the 1990s, the United Nations Convention to Combat <b>Desertification</b> (UNCCD) was adopted and UNSO became the United Nations Development Programme's Office to Combat <b>Desertification</b> and Drought, as its scope broadened to be global rather than only focused on Africa.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to identify successive stages {{in the process of}} degradation of these various forest formations, from an optimum state to the final phase of <b>desertification.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{groundwater}} pumping {{continues at}} a higher rate than the rate at which water recharges the aquifer, resulting in a long-term trend of <b>desertification</b> in the Owens Valley.|$|E

25|$|<b>Desertification,</b> another {{important}} environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, {{also known as}} the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. <b>Desertification</b> means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are egraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid caatinga ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} Acheulean tools â {{and thus the}} peoples who made them â is often interpreted as being the result of palaeo-climatic and ecological factors, such as glaciation and the <b>desertification</b> of the Sahara Desert.|$|E
25|$|The Amazon basin has a {{high flow}} of water and it is prone to floods. The Parana basin {{represents}} approximately 42% of the total area of Bolivia and it is prone to droughts and <b>desertification.</b> The {{quantity and quality of}} hydrological information is very poor.|$|E
25|$|Dust in the Middle East {{has been}} a {{historic}} phenomenon. Recently, because of climate change and the escalating process of <b>desertification,</b> the problem has worsened dramatically. As a multi-factor phenomenon, there {{is not yet a}} clear consensus on the sources or potential solutions to the problem.|$|E
25|$|The first Regulation was {{superseded}} by Regulation No 2242/87 â ACE II â which ran until July 1991. Its scope was widened {{to include the}} financing of demonstration projects {{in the fields of}} waste, contaminated site restoration and remedial action for land damaged by fire, erosion and <b>desertification.</b>|$|E
25|$|Firewood usually {{relates to}} timber or trees {{unsuitable}} for building or construction. Firewood is a renewable resource provided the consumption rate is controlled to sustainable levels. The shortage of suitable firewood {{in some places}} has seen local populations damaging huge tracts of bush possibly leading to further <b>desertification.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{areas are}} {{hot and humid}} from February to May, but can {{be subject to the}} hot, dry, and dusty trade wind known as the Harmattan. The southern regions have a more equatorial climate, but they are subject to <b>desertification,</b> while the extreme northeast regions of the country are already desert.|$|E
25|$|Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate {{started to}} become drier at an {{exceedingly}} fast pace. This climate change caused {{lakes and rivers}} to shrink significantly and caused increasing <b>desertification.</b> This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{mitigate}} the effects of <b>desertification</b> include planting vegetation in the newly exposed seabed; however, intermittent flooding of the eastern basin is likely to prove problematic for any development. Redirecting what little flow there is from the Amu Darya to the western basin may salvage fisheries there while relieving the flooding of the eastern basin.|$|E
25|$|Sankara {{pushed for}} agrarian {{self-sufficiency}} and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles. His national agenda also included planting over 10,000,000 trees {{to halt the}} growing <b>desertification</b> of the Sahel. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour.|$|E
