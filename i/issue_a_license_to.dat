The permit allows construction of a project needed to divert the water according to the terms and conditions of the permit, which includes submission of periodic progress reports by the applicant with SWRCB to ensure the application of the water is for beneficial use.

5000|$|California law {{provides}} that the Sheriff of a county or a city Police Chief may <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> <b>to</b> carry a concealed weapon upon {{proof that the}} person applying is of [...] "good moral character" [...] and that [...] "good cause" [...] exists for the issuance. While it is generally believed to be extremely difficult to obtain a license to carry a concealed weapon (CCW) in California, the difficulty varies greatly by city and county of residence. In most rural counties, qualified applicants are usually successful in obtaining a license, while some cities and counties, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, are extremely restrictive in what they perceive to be good cause, such as a clear and immediate threat on the applicant's life that cannot be avoided or mitigated by other means. There are also jurisdictions with [...] "moderately restrictive" [...] policies, where an applicant must show circumstances that demonstrate {{a need for a}} permit above that for the general populace, such as residing or conducting lawful business in high-crime areas, where a general risk of victimization exists even if no specific threat has been identified. Some jurisdictions have established additional local requirements the applicant must meet before the issuing authority grants a CCW permit. For example, the counties of Alameda and Monterey require applicants to obtain a mental health assessment at the applicant's expense as part of each county's permit application process.|$|E

5000|$|After her incarceration, {{marriage}} {{licenses to}} all couples were issued {{from the office}} of the Rowan County clerk by deputy clerks who were ordered to do so by court order. However, her son, Nathan Davis, a deputy clerk under her immediate supervision, also refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Once Davis was released from jail, she confiscated the marriage license forms and instructed her deputy clerks to only use forms from which her name and any reference to the clerk's office had been removed. In place of the title [...] "County Clerk" [...] or [...] "Deputy Clerk," [...] which in Kentucky statute is required on the form, Davis replaced the title with [...] "notary public." [...] The legal status of the forms was in question. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all county clerks to abide by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Governor Beshear, was asked by federal court judge David Bunning to brief the court on the validity of the altered licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means in which the marriage licenses were altered.As of October 2, 2015, three counties refused, or had not been confirmed to be ready, to issue licenses to same-sex couples. Whitley and Casey clerks claimed that the First Amendment of the US Constitution or Section Five of the Kentucky Constitution protects their religious freedom to refuse to issue licenses to same-sex couples. Knott County officials refused to state whether they would <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> <b>to</b> a same sex couple but none had applied to do so. In Whitley County, the Whitley County clerk claimed technical issues prevented the issuing of licenses, saying licenses would be issued once difficulties were resolved. However, reports regarding Whitley County clerk Kay Schwartz's appearance at a religious rally outside the state capitol on August 22, 2015 shed new light on the reason behind the delay. Schwartz claimed that issuing the licenses violated her religious liberty. She participated in the event alongside Rowan County's Kim Davis and Casey County's Casey Davis. The event was organized by the conservative Christian group The Family Foundation.|$|E
