50|$|In 2002, VH1 {{broadcast}} a ten-part series entitled <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '80s. The series {{was adapted from}} a BBC series, first broadcast in 2000, in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '80s, coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from 2003's <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '70s, to further variants like <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '80s Strikes Back, <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '90s, and <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '90s: Part Deux. More recently, VH1 premiered <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '80s 3-D and <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the '70s: Volume 2. So eager was the network {{to capitalize on the}} trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, {{despite the fact that the}} decade had not yet ended (<b>I</b> <b>Love</b> the New Millennium, broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000-2007).
