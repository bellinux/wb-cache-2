5|$|Politically, Crease {{presented}} {{himself as a}} foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony over the colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to the}} Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an independent member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de Cosmos) for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, as <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> de Cosmos right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed Crease Attorney-General of British Columbia, and Crease resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing literally hundreds of laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including land settlement and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E

Poirot also asks if she has met a Mr Cole at the sanctuary. Miss Carnaby has and to her he is a very strange man. As <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> her assertion correct, soon afterwards Mr Cole accosts Miss Carnaby with tales of his strange visions which involve sacrifices, Jehovah, and even Odin. She is saved from further strange tales by the arrival of Mr Lipscombe, the lodge-keeper of the Devonshire estate.|$|E
2500|$|In July {{the pace}} of arrests and charges more than doubled, as <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> {{there had been a}} large insurrection that needed controlling.

6000|$|Ingleby laughed almost light-heartedly. [...] "I think I {{have enough}} to take us all out at the {{cheapest}} rates, and you must let me lend it <b>to</b> you, <b>if</b> only <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that {{what you believe in}} isn't an impracticable fancy." ...|$|R

2500|$|Buck himself sized up CBS' {{handling}} of the announcers by saying [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let [...] McCarver run the show.' In television, all {{they want you to}} do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of [...] "trying to predict plays, as <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> he was still on top." ...|$|E
2500|$|The movie Saaz was {{supposedly}} based on Lata and Asha's rivalry. Asha {{said about the}} movie– [...] "To have two women in long plaits, {{take a couple of}} incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time." [...] In the last few years, Asha and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with The Times of India, Asha once said– [...] "I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, as <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> their loyalty. Later, didi and I would have a good laugh!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Freedom '90" [...] was {{the second}} of only two of its singles to be {{supported}} by a music video (the other being the Michael-less [...] "Praying for Time"). The song alludes to his struggles with his artistic identity, and prophesied his efforts shortly thereafter to end his recording contract with Sony Music. As <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the song's sentiment, Michael refused {{to appear in the}} video (directed by David Fincher), and instead recruited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, and Cindy Crawford to appear in and lip sync in his stead. It also featured the reduction of his sex symbol status. It had a No. 8 success on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E

2500|$|A lengthy {{obituary}} {{devoted to}} Bishop White in the National Gazette and Literary Register described him thus: [...] "...he {{duties of the}} several important relations in which he stood to society were performed with undeviating correctness and suavity; he possessed the rare merit of winning the respect and love of an entire community {{to which he was}} an ornament and a blessing. [...] His piety was deep and unfeigned; his walking humble yet dignified; his acquirements profound; in his mind the welfare of the Christian church was always the prominent consideration...He was one of those examples of steady virtue sent upon earth by Divine providence, as <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> how near the great pattern of perfection it is permitted to approach." ...|$|E

The early shows were successful, and the program stayed on Sunday nights from 6:00-7:30pm ET for its first season, shifting to 6:30-8:00pm ET in its second. NBC went full-throttle {{in an attempt to}} keep radio from its predicted death, and The Big Show was thought to be a key to that effort. Newsweek stated it was [...] "the biggest bang to hit radio since TV started." [...] As <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> big bang and big bucks were mutual partners, some $100,000 could be budgeted for a single installment.|$|E
2500|$|During 1988, Arena {{appeared}} as a guest on Australian TV shows recalling her tenure on Young Talent Time {{and looking for a}} new record label.

In April she issued a single, [...] "I Need Your Body", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane described it as [...] "uptempo" [...] with the associated music video [...] "projecting a raunchy disco-diva persona... flaunting a pouting rock starlet with bouncing cleavage and attitude to burn."

30|$|The effect rates {{reported}} {{are often}} close to statistical significance (even <b>if</b> unable <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> superiority of one specific technique), {{confirmed by the}} results of the included RCTs.

It marked Hopper's artistic maturity. Lloyd Goodrich praised the work as [...] "one of the most poignant and desolating pieces of realism." [...] The work {{is the first of}} a series of stark rural and urban scenes that uses sharp lines and large shapes, played upon by unusual lighting to capture the lonely mood of his subjects. Although critics and viewers interpret meaning and mood in these cityscapes, Hopper insisted [...] "I was more interested in the sunlight on the buildings and on the figures than any symbolism." [...] As <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the point, his late painting Sun in an Empty Room (1963) is a pure study of sunlight.|$|E
