40|$|Communicated by Yacine Chitour) Abstract. We give a {{complete}} {{answer to the}} question of when two curves in two different Riemannian manifolds can be seen as trajectories of rolling one manifold on the other without twisting or slipping. We show that, up to technical hypotheses, a rolling along these curves exists if and only if the <b>geodesic</b> <b>curvatures</b> of each curve coincide. By using the anti-developments of the curves, which we claim can be seen as a generalization of the <b>geodesic</b> <b>curvatures,</b> we are able to extend the result to arbitrary absolutely continuous curves. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature rolling on itself, two such curves can only differ by an isometry. In the case of surfaces, we give conditions for when loops in the manifolds lift to loops in the configuration space of the rolling. 1. Introduction. Rollin...|$|R

2500|$|Parallel {{transport}} of tangent vectors along a {{curve in the}} surface was the next major advance in the subject, due to Levi-Civita. It {{is related to the}} earlier notion of covariant derivative, because it is the monodromy of the ordinary differential equation on the curve defined by the covariant derivative with respect to the velocity vector of the curve. Parallel transport along geodesics, the [...] "straight lines" [...] of the surface, can also easily be described directly. A vector in the tangent plane is transported along a geodesic as the unique vector field with constant length and making a constant angle with the velocity vector of the geodesic. For a general curve, this process has to be modified using the <b>geodesic</b> <b>curvature,</b> which measures how far the curve departs from being a geodesic.|$|E
