5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area of medicine. One {{of those with}} overall {{responsibility}} for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, {{was the first to}} order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Muller's Asian {{trip was}} comprehensive. He visited British India and Ceylon, Burma, Malaysia and the Philippines and French Indochina, {{travelled}} extensively through the Dutch East Indies, and returned via Japan, Korea – {{where he had}} an audience with the last Korean emperor –, Manchuria, China, and Siberia. Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country and its economic development potential. Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly {{under the auspices of}} the Comité Nederland-Japan (Dutch-Japanese Committee).|$|E
5|$|The first chess match by {{electric}} telegraph {{took place in}} 1844, between Washington and Baltimore. In April 1845 Staunton and Captain Kennedy travelled to Gosport to play two games by telegraph against a group in London. Staunton took a long-term <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> solution to the difficulties of travel, and reported telegraph games in The Illustrated London News. In 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between Sydney and Adelaide calculated that the 74 moves of the longest game had travelled a total of 220,000miles (not {{much less than the}} distance between Earth and Moon).|$|E
5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E

5|$|In 1899, Wheeler joined Bradford Grammar School {{shortly before}} his ninth birthday, where he {{proceeded}} straight to the second form. In 1902 Robert and Emily had a second daughter, whom they named Betty; Mortimer showed little <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> younger sister. In 1905, Robert agreed to take over {{as head of the}} London office of his newspaper, by then renamed the Yorkshire Daily Observer, and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in December, settling into a house named Carlton Lodge on South Croydon Road, West Dulwich. In 1908 they moved to 14 Rollescourt Avenue in nearby Herne Hill. Rather than being sent for a conventional education, when he was 15 Wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in London, where he frequented The National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the reflector sight being used with fighter aircraft was in 1918. The optical firm of Optische Anstalt Oigee of Berlin, working from the Grubb patents, developed 2 versions {{what came to be}} known as the Oigee Reflector Sight. Both used a 45 degree angle glass beam splitter and electrical illumination and were used to aim the plane's machine guns. One version was used in operational trials on the Albatros D.Va fighter biplane and Fokker Dr.1 fighter triplane. There was some <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> sight after World War I but reflector sights in general were not widely adopted for fighter and bomber aircraft until the 1930s, first by the French, then by most other major airforces. These sights were not only used for aiming fighter aircraft, they were used with aircraft defensive guns and in bombsights.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking {{in the back seat of}} the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E
