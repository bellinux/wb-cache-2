She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. If he had not appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising, and the lineage of the title would have been broken.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-AThis paper {{describes}} a study investigating attitudes to noise as an occupational hazard. The {{objectives of the}} study were to understand the individual and organizational factors which affect attitudes towards noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) and to relate these to the standards of hearing conservation achieved in industry as demonstrated by compliance with the Noise at Work Regulations. The study comprised a survey of 48 organizations across Britain, and a more detailed examination of 10 of these as case studies. Methods used included desk research, audits of hearing conservation programmes, questionnaires and interviews. Whilst there is widespread acceptance that industrial noise is a hazard, it is one that is frequently taken for granted, and measures to deal with it are often inadequate. Most organizations place the onus on the workforce to protect their own hearing through the use of personal hearing protectors Workers reactions to noise tended however to be passive and much of the time neither managers nor the workforce are concious of the noise hazard. This is the case even where some managers are committed to <b>good</b> industrial <b>housekeeping</b> and accident prevention.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to define the optimum limits of {{chemical}} and physical conditions that reduce soil salinity and maximize indigenous aerobic microbiological populations in the bioremediation of oil field waste solids. Specifically, the study centers around treatment of surface contained oily waste having low density and limited solubility in water. Successful remediation is defined by total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) reduction to 1 % and no hydrocarbon or salinity impact on ground water resources. The Department of Energy, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission have encouraged oil and gas producing states to identify and develop improved methods such as this to reduce, recycle or treat solid waste generated with the exploration and development of domestic petroleum resources (IOGCC, 1995). With encouragement and funding assistance through the Department of Energy, Ohio is developing these bioremediation practices to protect soil and water resources.

40|$|A {{pamphlet}} {{providing information}} on how to prevent occupational silicosis was presented. The pamphlet, which was published by NIOSH and the United States Department of Labor, provided guidelines for both employers and workers to reduce exposures to crystalline silica (14808607) dust and summarized the properties and sources of exposure to silica dust and OSHA and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations for controlling occupational silica dust exposures. Recommendations that employers can take include making a commitment to prevent silicosis at the worksite. This involves complying with OSHA and MSHA regulations regarding silica exposure, performing air monitoring at the worksite, maintaining engineering controls, substituting less hazardous materials for silica for abrasive blasting operations, and supplying vacuums with high efficiency particulate air filters. Strategies to improve worker health include training them about the health effects of silica, establishing a written respirator program, providing medical evaluations for employees potentially exposed to silica, reporting all silicosis cases to state health departments and the MSHA and recording cases on OSHA logs, and posting warning signs to identify work areas where respirable silica is present. Actions that workers can take to protect themselves include cooperating with their employers to prevent silicosis at the worksite, use of engineering controls installed by the employer for reducing silica dust levels, minimizing dust exposures by following <b>good</b> work and <b>housekeeping</b> practices, wearing, maintaining, and correctly using approved particulate respirators when engineering controls alone cannot reduce silica exposures below permissible levels, using positive pressure abrasive blasting respirators if and when sandblasting is performed, participating in all air monitoring, medical surveillance, and training programs, and talking with the employer, employee representative, or union if concerned about the presence of dust in the workplace.
