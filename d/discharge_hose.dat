25|$|Pump-Type water {{consists}} of a - or 5-gallon non-pressurized metal or plastic container with a pump mounted to it, and a <b>discharge</b> <b>hose</b> and nozzle. Pump type water extinguishers are often used where freezing conditions may occur, {{as they can be}} economically freeze-protected with calcium chloride (except stainless steel models), such as barns, out buildings and unheated warehouses. They are also useful where many, frequent spot fires may occur, such as during fire watch for hot work operations. They are dependent on the user's strength to produce a decent discharge stream for firefighting. Water and antifreeze are the most common, but loaded stream and foam designs were made in the past. Backback models exist for wildland firefighting, and may be solid material such as metal or fiberglass, or collapsible vinyl or rubber bags for ease of storage.|$|E
50|$|Another suction hose, {{called a}} soft suction, is {{actually}} a short length of fabric-covered, flexible <b>discharge</b> <b>hose</b> used to connect the fire pumper suction inlet with a pressurized hydrant. It is not a true suction hose as it cannot withstand a negative pressure.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} types of hose {{designed}} specifically for the fire service.

50|$|In the Irish Sea, 400 {{passengers}} {{aboard the}} Le Havre to Rosslare ferry arrived 10 hours late after being tossed in the storm. In Merseyside at the Tranmere Oil Terminal, high winds caused the Shell oil tanker Myrina to break loose (breaking 14 mooring lines and oil <b>discharge</b> <b>hoses)</b> and strand on a sandbank. Thirteen tugs re-floated the tanker {{on the next}} day's high tide. A recently opened landing stage for the Mersey Ferry was sunk, having cost 1.25 million pounds. The former Isle of Man steamer TSS King Orry (IV) broke her mooring and ran aground in the Lune estuary, while berthed at Glasson Dock waiting to be dismantled.|$|R
50|$|Mulconroy/Holedall swaged hose {{coupling}} is commonly found on larger diameter hoses used in higher pressure applications {{or where the}} hose is exposed to higher end pull, e.g., Oil Suction & <b>Discharge</b> (OS&D) <b>hose).</b> They are installed with special hydraulic ram machinery and special dies.|$|R
50|$|Though in the USA tank {{containers}} {{are typically}} the same dimensions (20 * 8 * 8.5 ft). {{as a standard}} ISO ocean container, tank chassis are much longer than the typical 20 ft container chassis. Tank chassis typically measure 40 - 43 ft in length by 8 x 4 ft wide x tall. This chassis has a standard drop-frame design providing a lower center of gravity than conventional trailers and an overall length suitable to legally scale most tanks. Twistlocks provide a secure mounting mechanism for the tanks and {{eliminate the need for}} straps or chains. The lower center of gravity is crucial for reducing the chances of a roll over with the constant shifting weight of the liquid cargo. These chassis can also be fitted with additional accessories including: lift kits to facilitate product <b>discharge,</b> <b>hose</b> tubes, and hi/lo kits to carry two empty tanks.|$|E
40|$|Screening {{tests of}} Sand Mantis {{candidate}} materials selected for erosion resistance have been completed. The {{results of this}} testing identified that over {{a relatively short period}} of operation (< 1 hour), measurable erosion will occur in each of the candidate zoom tube materials given equal operating exposure. Additionally, this testing has shown that erosion of the rubber <b>discharge</b> <b>hose</b> directly downstream of the vehicle could be expected to limit the service life of the <b>discharge</b> <b>hose.</b> On the basis of these test results, SRNL recommends the following; {lg_bullet} redesign of critical system components (e. g., zoom tube, <b>discharge</b> <b>hose)</b> should be conducted to improve system characteristics relative to erosion and capitalize on the results of this testing, {lg_bullet} continued efforts to deploy the Sand Mantis should include testing to better define and optimize operating parameters, and gain an understanding of system dynamics, {lg_bullet} discontinue wear testing with the selected materials pending redesign of critical system components (1 st recommendation) and inclusion of other candidate materials. The final selection of additional candidate materials should be made following design changes, but might include a Stellite alloy or zirconia...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The lateral {{distribution}} uniformity {{produced by}} several commercially available anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) manifold configurations was determined using a dynamic water absorption technique. For a conventional cast manifold, {{top and bottom}} inlet configurations were compared, as were open versus restricted manifold outlet barbs. Coefficient of variation for lateral distribution (lateral CVs) ranged from 15 to 20 % for the top inlet and from 8 to 10 % for the bottom inlet. For the conventional manifold, the use of open [(5. 6 mm ID (0. 22 in. ID) ] versus restrictorâ€“type hose barbs [2. 4 mm ID (0. 09 in. ID) ] had little influence on lateral distribution. The Continental vertical dam manifold produced lateral CVs ranging from 10 to 13 %. For both manifolds, the influence of unequal <b>discharge</b> <b>hose</b> lengths was reduced as manifold pressure increased...|$|E
50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and <b>discharge</b> <b>hoses</b> or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|R
50|$|The dry {{mix method}} {{involves}} placing {{the dry ingredients}} into a hopper and then conveying them pneumatically through a hose to the nozzle. The nozzleman controls the addition of water at the nozzle. The water and the dry mixture is not completely mixed, but is completed as the mixture hits the receiving surface. This requires a skilled nozzleman, {{especially in the case}} of thick or heavily reinforced sections. Advantages of the dry mix process are that the water content can be adjusted instantaneously by the nozzleman, allowing more effective placement in overhead and vertical applications without using accelerators. The dry mix process is useful in repair applications when it is necessary to stop frequently, as the dry material is easily <b>discharged</b> from the <b>hose.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is {{standard}} training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to avoid handling swarf with bare hands. Similarly, {{it is also}} standard training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to minimize or entirely avoid handling swarf by blowing chips away with compressed air, but this practice is considered burdensome or impractical by some machinists - {{the rule of thumb}} is to reduce the potential hazard by trying to eliminate the problem as far as reasonably practicable this could simply be done by keeping a clean working environment. Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way wipers and bearing seals. Alternatives to blowing chips away include vacuuming them away with an industrial vacuum (shop vacuum); gently washing them away with a coolant <b>hose</b> <b>discharging</b> at typical garden-hose pressures; or preventing their generation in the first place (for example, forming threads instead of cutting them).|$|R
40|$|Tomco Equipment Company {{has participated}} in the dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, CO 2) {{cleaning}} industry for over ten years as {{a pioneer in the}} manufacturer of high density, dry ice cleaning pellet production equipment. For over four years Tomco high density pelletizers have been available to the dry ice cleaning industry. Approximately one year ago Tomco introduced the DI- 250, a new dry ice blast unit making Tomco a single source supplier for sublimable media, particle blast, cleaning systems. This new blast unit is an all pneumatic, single <b>discharge</b> <b>hose</b> device. It meters the insertion of 1 / 8 inch diameter (or smaller), high density, dry ice pellets into a high pressure, propellant gas stream. The dry ice and propellant streams are controlled and mixed from the blast cabinet. From there the mixture is transported to the nozzle where the pellets are accelerated to an appropriate blasting velocity. When directed to impact upon a target area, these dry ice pellets have sufficient energy to effectively remove most surface coatings through dry, abrasive contact. The meta-stable, dry ice pellets used for CO 2 cleaning, while labeled 'high density,' are less dense than alternate, abrasive, particle blast media. In addition, after contacting the target surface, they return to their equilibrium condition: a superheated gas state. Most currently used grit blasting media are silicon dioxide based, which possess a sharp tetrahedral molecular structure. Silicon dioxide crystal structures will always produce smaller sharp-edged replicas of the original crystal upon fracture. Larger, softer dry ice pellets do not share the same sharp-edged crystalline structures as their non-sublimable counterparts when broken. In fact, upon contact with the target surface, dry ice pellets will plastically deform and break apart. As such, dry ice cleaning is less harmful to sensitive substrates, workers and the environment than chemical or abrasive cleaning systems. Dry ice cleaning system components include: a dry ice pellet supply, a non-reactive propellant gas source, a pellet and propellant metering device, and a media transport and acceleration hose and nozzle arrangement. Dry ice cleaning system operating parameters include: choice of propellant gas, its pressure and temperature, dry ice mass flow rate, dry ice pellet size and shape, and acceleration nozzle configuration. These parameters may be modified to fit different applications. The growth of the dry ice cleaning industry will depend upon timely data acquisition of the effects that independent changes in these parameters have on cleaning rates, with respect to different surface coating and substrate combinations. With this data, optimization of cleaning rates for particular applications will be possible. The analysis of the applicable range of modulation of these parameters, within system component mechanical constraints, has just begun...|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{breathing}} gas containing a high fraction of helium {{is a significant}} part of the cost of deep diving operations, and can be reduced by recovering the breathing gas for recycling. A reclaim helmet is provided with a return line in the diver's umbilical, and exhaled gas is <b>discharged</b> to this <b>hose</b> through a reclaim regulator, which ensures that gas pressure in the helmet cannot fall below the ambient pressure. The gas is processed at the surface in the helium reclaim system by filtering, scrubbing and boosting into storage cylinders until needed. The oxygen content may be adjusted when appropriate. The same principle is used in built-in breathing systems used to vent oxygen-rich treatment gases from a hyperbaric chamber, though those gases are generally not reclaimed. A diverter valve is provided to allow the diver to manually switch to open circuit if the reclaim valve malfunctions, and an underpressure flood valve allows water to enter the helmet to avoid a squeeze if the reclaim valve fails suddenly, allowing the diver time to switch to open circuit without injury.|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} {{to develop a}} bench scale test facility, using a mixer, transfer pump, and transfer line to determine the impact of conveying the grout through the transfer lines to the vault on grout properties. Bench scale testing focused on the effect the transfer line has on the rheological property of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Rheological and other physical properties of grout samples were obtained prior to and after pumping through a transfer line. The Bench Scale Mixing Rig (BSMR) consisted of two mixing tanks, grout feed tank, transfer pump and transfer hose. The mixing tanks were used to batch the grout which was then transferred into the grout feed tank. The contents of the feed tank were then pumped through the transfer line (hose) using a progressive cavity pump. The grout flow rate and pump discharge pressure were monitored. Four sampling stations were located {{along the length of}} the transfer line at the 5, 105 and 205 feet past the transfer pump and at 305 feet, the <b>discharge</b> of the <b>hose.</b> Scaling between the full scale piping at Saltstone to bench scale testing at SRNL was performed by maintaining the same shear rate and total shear at the wall of the transfer line. The results of scaling down resulted in a shorter transfer line, a lower average velocity, the same transfer time and similar pressure drops. The condition of flow in the bench scale transfer line is laminar. The flow in the full scale pipe is in the transition region, but is more laminar than turbulent. The resulting plug in laminar flow in the bench scale results in a region of no-mixing. Hence mixing, or shearing, at the bench scale should be less than that observed in the full scale, where this plug is non existent due to the turbulent flow. The bench scale tests should be considered to be conservative due to the highly laminar condition of flow that exists. Two BSMR runs were performed. In both cases, wall shearing was shown to reduce the rheological properties of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Samples taken at the static feed tank showed that gelling impacted the rheological properties of the grout before it was fed into the pump and transfer line. A comparison of the rheological properties of samples taken at the feed tank and transfer line discharge indicated shearing of the grout was occurring in the transfer line. Bench scale testing of different mixing methods with three different salt solutions showed that method of mixing influences the rheological properties of the grouts. The paddle blade mixing method of the salt solution used for the BMSR testing provided comparable rheological properties of the grout prepared in the BMSR after 14 minutes of processing, B 3. The paddle blade mixing method can be used to represent BMSR results and mixing time can be adjusted to represent larger scale mixing...|$|R
