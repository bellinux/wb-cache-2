5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; and <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> after the close of my life, that you grant {{to me from the}} throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E
5|$|Virgin, {{whom the}} {{messenger}} salutes in angelic speech, {{you were born}} without stain: <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> that you implore him – who, born from the conception of celestial seed holds the mysterious command as triunal deity – to forgive me my sins, that he may deign to grant longlasting joys through his own eternity and to look upon me with {{the sight of his}} holy vision.|$|E
5|$|Your honor, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> no mercy, I {{plead for}} no immunity. I realize that finally the right must prevail. I never more fully comprehended than now the great {{struggle}} between the powers of greed {{on the one hand}} and upon the other the rising hosts of freedom. I can see the dawn of a better day of humanity. The people are awakening. In due course of time they will come into their own.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Aunt Alice to beg {{you to come}} here. I {{was afraid}} you wouldn't if <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him what}} he meant by coming here to asperse my character. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him who the deuce he was. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him how he came to know {{anything}} about Mameena, and finally I told him that soon or late I would be even with him, and paused exhausted.|$|R
60|$|Often {{and often}} during the weary months that followed, whilst I {{wandered through the}} temple or amid the winter snows upon the Mountain side, did I seek to solve this question--Whither had She gone? <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> it of my heart; <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> it of the skies; <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> it {{of the spirit of}} Leo which often was so near to me.|$|R
5|$|Then the accompanist {{returns to}} Life's A Funny Proposition until {{the father is}} sitting down in the house. What's the Use of Dreaming leads to Gee, But It's Great to Meet a Friend {{with the arrival of}} a friend. A waltz accompanies the gallery scene until the picture is shown, leading to Some Day When Dreams Come True as the artist becomes famous. The {{introduction}} with the society woman is accompanied by How Do You Do Miss Josephine and then by So Long Mary as she exits. No Place Like Home begins the next scene until the wife recognizes the emotional distancing of her husband when All <b>I</b> <b>Ask</b> is Love is played. The studio scene begins with I Love My Wife, But Oh You Kid and leads to Be Sweet to Me Kid or Next to your Mother... with Nobody's Little Girl during the crying scene.|$|E

25|$|All <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{of you is}} one thing... <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> this {{particularly}} {{of the young people}} who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they {{thought they were going to}} get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|E
60|$|What was I to do? <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> {{myself that}} {{question}} several times, and now <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> it again.|$|R
6000|$|First, Howells and I had a chat together. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> about Mrs. H. He {{said she}} was fine, still {{steadily}} improving, and nearly back to her old best health. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> (as if <b>I</b> didn't know): ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you remember, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you a {{question}} before I went away? You refused to marry me then, but {{you told me that}} if <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> again when <b>I</b> came back, the answer might be different.' ...|$|R
25|$|Baxter: I {{did not ask}} {{you whether}} you like them; <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you whether there were any about that night.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul {{to the roof}} and tells him about her {{subterranean}} encounter with the Phantom ("Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There"). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and protect her, and Christine reciprocates his vow ("All <b>I</b> <b>Ask</b> of You"). The heartbroken Phantom, having overheard their entire conversation, angrily vows revenge {{before returning to the}} auditorium and sending the chandelier crashing to the stage during the curtain call ("All <b>I</b> <b>Ask</b> of You (Reprise)").|$|E
25|$|My heart...is {{to agree}} on all {{subjects}} with Charles Fox: but your opinions have been terribly at variance. New occurrences and change of circumstances will, I hope, bring us together again—but still I am anti-Gallican: <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> not, what sort of Government prevail, but under none, can I submit patiently to the strange assumption of power over independent nations, daily making by France. Here {{is the root of}} my present opinions: I am sure, it is the growth of good Whig soil.|$|E
6000|$|... "But couldn't {{she make}} a will in my favour? I know she'd {{do it if}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her--if <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her now--now she's going off, you know. I'm sure she'd do it. Don't you think she would?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you that}} before. But <b>I</b> always <b>ask</b> everybody what ship they came over in, and so sometimes <b>I</b> forget and <b>ask</b> again. You going to Geneva?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather flatter myself," [...] he continued, [...] "that I showed tact. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{simply to}} be allowed to sit at your table. Before we had {{finished}} dinner <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you, for the second time, to marry me." ...|$|R
25|$|Therefore I, Liliuokalani of Hawaii, do hereby {{call upon}} the President of that nation, to whom alone I yielded my {{property}} and my authority, to withdraw said treaty (ceding said Islands) from further consideration. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the honorable Senate of the United States to decline to ratify said treaty, and I implore {{the people of this}} great and good nation, from whom my ancestors learned the Christian religion, to sustain their representatives in such acts of justice and equity as may be in accord with the principles of their fathers, and to the Almighty Ruler of the universe, to him who judgeth righteously, I commit my cause.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "I {{asked him}} from--from--Let me see; <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him because- -from--Yes, I say it boldly; <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him from an enthusiasm for art, and a sincere wish {{to learn the}} use of oil, as he called it. Yes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{there an}} herb [...] . ?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked.</b> [...] "Or none?" [...] Yes, thus <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him desperately. [...] "--There is," [...] he said; [...] "a certain one [...] " [...] Would he had sworn that none knew he! ...|$|R
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|Assessing himself, Robinson said, [...] "I'm not {{concerned}} with your liking or disliking me... all <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> is that you respect me as a human being." [...] Regarding Robinson's qualities on the field, Leo Durocher said, [...] "Ya want a guy that comes to play. This guy didn't just come to play. He come to beat ya. He come to stuff the goddamn bat right up your ass." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{her if she}} had any suggestions. She said, {{what about}} Tempest Storm? <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her {{if she had any}} other suggestions. Well, she said, what about Sunny Day? Well, I said, I guess {{it might as well be}} Tempest Storm.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why?' I says. 'Never you mind,' says he. 'Well, who is he?' <b>I</b> <b>asks.</b> What do {{you think}} happens then? He thinks hard for a spell, rolls his eyes, and says: 'Search me. I've forgotten.' 'Know where he lives?' <b>I</b> <b>asks</b> him. 'Nope,' he says.|$|R
60|$|We {{passed the}} bridge, {{and soon after}} that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> if she saw the lock. She said no, {{she did not see}} any lock; and I said, “Oh!” and pulled on. Another five minutes went by, and then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her to look again.|$|R
500|$|Harrison {{became the}} first United States {{president}} to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but they were assumed to be directed at Vice President Tyler: [...] "Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> nothing more." [...] Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4– April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Blood {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in the same way}} as the first two OSI albums. Matheos and Moore worked together on the album long-distance, mainly by emailing each other files. Matheos would send Moore song ideas, [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs," [...] Moore said. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> what I can do, and I mess around, complete a verse and add a chorus, do editing, add some vocals, and send it back to him." ...|$|E
