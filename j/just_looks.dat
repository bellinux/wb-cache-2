500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{were thought}} to be very good, using the id Tech 3 engine effectively. Describing the graphics as superb, Game Revolution commented that [...] "from detailed weapons to terrific lighting effects to smooth character animation, everything <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> great". Eurogamer commented that the characters were [...] "very well done" [...] on the engine, although Allgame felt that the character models for the original Voyager cast were [...] "just a little off". Other reviewers were equally impressed; IGN described the graphics as [...] "fantastic" [...] while GameSpy commented that [...] "in each environment it's obvious that the artists were limited only by their imaginations".|$|E
500|$|While the {{original}} level geometry was kept, the levels received new textures, characters and weapons were recreated, and skyboxes were rebuilt. Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that I give a lot of credit to the developer on. It <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> right. They were smart about the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN also {{repeatedly}} {{named him}} a character {{they wished to}} see in the crossover fighting series Super Smash Bros., describing him an [...] "intimidating hero", a [...] "unique breed of ass kicker" [...] {{and one of the best}} things to happen to the Resident Evil series. GamesRadar described Leon's Resident Evil 4 design as [...] "David Bowie piloting the Memphis Belle", stating that, while it was appealing, the hairstyle required modifications for encounters in the games. In 2010, Game Informer chose Leon as one of the 20 Capcom characters they would like to see in a rumored crossover fighting game titled Namco Vs Capcom, his Namco equivalent being Nightmare from the Soul series: [...] "The only man with enough experience and courage to take out this mutated menace is none other than Leon S. Kennedy. We bet this fight ends with a rocket launcher." [...] In 2011, Ryan Woo of Complex ranked Leon among the fourth most stylish video game character, opining he the best dressed person in the Resident Evil series and [...] "Jill <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> goofy in comparison." ...|$|E

500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{was pleased}} that Wyman directed, as he found it nice to have [...] "somebody who's in the writer's room day-in and day-out and knows the show so intimately, come in and jump behind the camera and are just a font of information." [...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening. We played so many things that weren't in the script, that were between the lines in <b>just</b> <b>looks,</b> and he told me how he was gonna shoot it so I could really play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end, and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't in the script." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Soviet Union had {{not signed}} the Geneva Convention, {{this did not}} mean their {{soldiers}} were entirely exempted from the protection it afforded; Germany had signed the treaty and was thus obligated to offer Soviet POWs treatment according to its provisions (as they generally did with other Allied POWs). According to the Soviets, they had not signed the Geneva Conventions in 1929 due to Article 9 which, by imposing racial segregation of POWs into different camps, contravened the Soviet constitution. [...] Article 82 of the convention specified that [...] "In case, in time of war, one of the belligerents is not {{a party to the}} Convention, its provisions shall nevertheless remain in force as between the belligerents who are parties thereto." [...] Despite this Hitler called for the battle against the Soviet Union to be a [...] "struggle for existence" [...] and emphasized that the Russian armies were to be [...] "annihilated", a mindset that contributed to war crimes against Soviet prisoners of war. [...] A Nazi memorandum from 16 July 1941, recorded by Martin Bormann, quotes Hitler saying, [...] "The giant [...] area must naturally be pacified as quickly as possible; this will happen at best if anyone who <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> funny should be shot". Conveniently for the Nazis, the fact that the Soviets failed to sign the convention played into their hands as they justified their behavior accordingly. Even if the Soviets had signed, {{it is highly unlikely that}} this would have stopped the Nazis' genocidal policies towards combatants, civilians, and prisoners of war.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{disagreed}} {{about how}} successful {{the film was}} in capturing the novel's ambiguity, {{which is part of}} the enduring appeal of James's story. For Tim Dowling, a columnist for The Guardian, the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the children are being controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that [...] "there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> like having it both ways." [...] As a result, [...] "the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation [...] "feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that [...] "when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time so do we, and the thing that really haunts us as we read the story—uncertainty—vanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about when something is next going to pop out at us." [...] By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for The Times) felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of [...] "hysterical imagination", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more likely to believe (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. The Scotsmans Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative.|$|E

2500|$|After relabeling, {{the former}} <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> like ω itself, i.e. 3 + ω = ω, {{while the latter}} does not: [...] is not equal to ω since [...] has a largest element (namely, 2') and ω does not (even if ω and [...] are equipotent, they are not isomorphic). Hence, this {{addition}} is not commutative. In fact it is quite rare for α+β to be equal to β+α: this happens {{if and only if}} α=γm, β=γn for some ordinal γ and natural numbers m and n.

2500|$|The basic {{language}} construct is the unit. A unit {{may be a}} formula, an enclosed clause, a routine text or one of several technically needed constructs (assignation, jump, skip, nihil). The technical term enclosed clause unifies some of the inherently bracketing constructs known as block, do statement, switch statement in other contemporary languages. When keywords are used, generally the reversed character sequence of the introducing [...] keyword is used for terminating the enclosure, e.g. ( [...] if ~ then ~ else ~ fi, case ~ in ~ out ~ esac, for ~ while ~ do ~ od [...] ). This [...] syntax was reused by Stephen Bourne in the common Unix Bourne shell. An expression may also yield a multiple value, which is constructed from other values by a collateral clause.

But if I cut three ways, then it <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> like an action picture." [...] Russell also had the Foley department tone down the sounds of gunfire, saying he didn't want to [...] "Bruce Willis-ize" [...] the film." [...] One frequently noted shot in the film is an image of a bullet piercing a number of internal organs, releasing bile into the abdominal cavity, used when Gates is describing sepsis as the effect of a gunshot wound. This internal camera is again used when SFC Barlow is shot in the torso and his chest begins to fill with air, crushing his lung. Both of these scenes were inspired by Russell asking an emergency room doctor friend [...] "What's the weirdest wound you've ever seen?" [...] It also erupted a minor controversy, when Russell began to joke around that the gunshots were fired into a real corpse; a statement everyone vehemently denied later.|$|E
