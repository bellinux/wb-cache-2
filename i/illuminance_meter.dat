In this work a simplified method to directly determine the illuminance responsivity to light sources other than illuminant A of commercial illuminance meters, whereby knowledge of the relative spectral responsivity of the <b>illuminance</b> <b>meter</b> to be calibrated is not necessary, is presented. The method has been proved to be useful for illuminance meters with different degrees of spectral mismatch from V(λ) function and to different spectral power distributions. Peer reviewe...|$|E

An experiment was also carried out to evaluate the modelling of human face at the window which simulated the typical pattern of vertical illuminance distribution. The relation between the vertical illuminance ratio and the subjective scale value is systematically separated by the window size and luminance, and is rather different with that proposed by Tabuchi. The relation between the semi-cylindrical illuminance ratio and the subjective scale value is separated mainly by the window luminance, and the ratio may be an index suitable for the modelling at a window...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{measurement}} of the luminous flux are presented: the first {{is based on an}} integrating sphere and a luminous flux standard lamp, the second utilizes an accurate goniometer and an accurate <b>illuminance</b> <b>meter.</b> A comparison between the two methods is carried on for two different light sources: an LED and a halogen source, presenting different luminous fluxes. The measuring procedure and an evaluation of the measurement uncertainties are described for both the methods. The comparison shows a good agreement between the two measuring processes: both of them allow the identification of the luminous fluxes with relative uncertainties of about 1. 5 %, covering the differences between the luminous flux values. The comparison is considered a valid possibility of verifying the calibration constancy of the laboratory luminous flux and illuminance standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{range of}} {{calibration}} of <b>illuminance</b> <b>meters</b> and luminance meters has been normally limited to levels {{up to several}} thousand lx and several thousand cd/m 2 using a high-power luminous intensity standard lamp. The calibration of instruments at much higher levels is required in applications such as daylight measurement, evaluation of solar simulators, and testing light sources in imaging devices. A calibration facility and procedures have been developed at NIST utilizing the detector-based method to allow illuminance calibrations at levels up to 100 klx (about the level of direct sun light) and luminance up to 30 kcd/m 2, The calibration source {{is based on a}} commercial solar simulator source using a 1000 W xenon arc lamp with optical feedback control, and it is combined with a set of color glass filters that corrects the spectral power distribution to be close to CIE Illuminant A. The illuminance level can be varied without changing the color temperature significantly and without changing the distance. The developed source was evaluated for stability, spectral distribution, illuminance uniformity, and divergence of the beam. Experiments were also conducted to study the effect of heat by radiation on the glass filters used with the source and various diffuser materials, such as PTFE, opal glass, and acrylic, used to create luminance standards. The linearity and the effect of heat on standard photometers and commercial <b>illuminance</b> <b>meters</b> were also investigated, and appropriate procedures for high illuminance/luminance calibrations have been established...|$|R
40|$|The NIST candela is {{maintained}} via standard photometers which have shown long-term stability better than 0. 1 % per year. The detector-based method has {{allowed us to}} reduce the uncertainties of calibrations and to expand the range of calibration capabilities. There have been several new developments in photometry at NIST. A high-illuminance calibration facility has been developed. Four temperature-controlled standard photometers, tested for linearity and effect of heat at high illuminances, are used with a high-pressure xenon arc source to provide the illuminance scale at levels up to 100 klx. A flashing light photometric unit (lx·s) has been realized using four standard photometers equipped with current integrators and two independent methods. Calibration services for <b>illuminance</b> <b>meters</b> at high <b>illuminance</b> levels and flashing-light photometers are now available at NIST. On-going new projects include {{the development of a}} detector-based luminous flux calibration facility using a 2. 5 m integrating sphere, realization of the total spectral radiant flux scale, {{and the development of a}} reference spectroradiometer for colorimetry of displays. Calibration services are planned in these areas of photometry and colorimetry in the near future.

40|$|The candela, {{one of the}} SI base units, {{has been}} {{realized}} by using absolutely calibrated detectors rather than sources. A group of eight photometers was constructed using silicon photodiodes, precision apertures, and glass filters for V(λ) match. Their absolute spectral responsivities were calibrated against the NIST absolute spectral responsivity scale. The measurement chain has been significantly shortened compared with the old scale based on a blackbody. This resulted in improving the calibration uncertainty to 0. 46 % (2 σ), a factor-of- 2 improvement. This revision has made various photometric calibrations at NIST more versatile and flexible. Luminous intensities of light sources ranging from 10 - 3 to 104 candelas are directly calibrated with the standard photometers, which have a linear response over that range. <b>Illuminance</b> <b>meters</b> are calibrated directly against the standard photometers. A luminance scale has also been realized on the detector base using an integrating sphere source. Total flux ranging from 10 - 2 to 105 lumens {{can be measured in}} a 2 m integrating sphere using a photometer with a wide dynamic range.

40|$|NIST has {{recently}} established a detectorbased luminous intensity unit (candela, cd), which {{is derived from}} the NIST absolute cryogenic radiometer. Subsequently, the luminous flux unit (lumen, lm) and the luminance unit (cd/m 2) have been established based on the detector-based candela, and now all the NIST photometric units are tied to the cryogenic radiometer. The illuminance unit is realized and maintained on five standard photometers. The large dynamic range of the standard photometers eliminates the need for maintaining many working standard lamps of various wattages. The luminous intensities of lamps are determined from the illuminances measured with these photometers and the distances measured with a linear encoder system. Transfer photometers and <b>illuminance</b> <b>meters</b> are calibrated by direct comparison with the standard photometers with no distance measurements involved. The luminous flux unit is realized using an absolute integrating sphere method newly developed at NIST. The luminance unit is realized on an integrating sphere source, which is used for calibration of other luminance sources and luminance meters. These detector-based methods have made it possible to reduce the uncertainties of photometric calibrations and to provide more varieties of photometric calibration services at NIST.

While LED technology holds promise to provide affordable, high quality lighting services, the widespread dissemination of low quality products {{may make it}} difficult to realize this potential. This study includes performance results for three brands of commonly available LED flashlights that were purchased in Kenya in 2009. The performance of the flashlights was evaluated by testing five units {{for each of the three}} brands. The tests included measurements of battery capacity, time required to charge the battery, maximum <b>illuminance</b> at one <b>meter,</b> operation time and lux-hours from a fully charged battery, light distribution, and color rendering. All flashlights tested performed well below the manufacturers? rated specifications; the measured battery capacity was 30 - 50 percent lower than the rated capacity and the time required to fully charge the battery was 6 - 25 percent greater than the rated time requirement. Our analysis further shows that within each brand there is considerable variability in each performance indicator. The five samples within a single brand varied from each other by as much as 22 percent for battery capacity measurements, 3. 6 percent for the number of hours required for a full charge, 23 percent for maximum initial lux, 38 percent for run time, 11 percent for light distribution and by as much as 200 percent for color rendering.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between light and electrons in oxide compounds {{forms the basis}} for many interesting and practical effects, which are related to microstructure, energy band, traps, carrier transport and others. Thin films of oxides like WO 3, Ga 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3 and SrTiO 3 were investigated using various improved optical and luminescent techniques. The home-made systems for optical and luminescent measurements were described in detail. The facilities of photo-Hall and photoconductivity transients have been proven to be powerful tools in the studies, which allow us to perform photoinduced process and relaxation measurements over a wide time range from 10 − 8 to 104 s. Furthermore, we extended the measurement capabilities of the commercial luminoscope by using an interferometer system with optical fiber and <b>illuminance</b> <b>meter</b> instead of an optical microscope. The cathodoluminescent measurements can be performed at a relative high pressure (20 – 60 mTorr) compared to ultra-high-vacuum condition of most commercial products.

After an introduction on the main involved definitions and equations linking the illuminance and the luminance measurements, this paper presents the instruments to which the procedures are applied and, at the end, results regarding the absolute calibration of the instruments under test, the check of their linearity, and the analysis of their spectral responsivity within the visible range. Following this way, this paper shows the main results in the connection among instruments devoted specifically to illuminance and luminance measurements. Then, it also introduces a comparison to other photometric heads, e. g., sensors {{that are part of}} more complex systems, like an integrating sphere for luminous flux measurement. In this last case, it has no significance to evaluate the difference between the absolute outputs, but it is interesting to compare the response of the two devices considering their linearity and their relative spectral response.

This approach is simple, facile and environmentally friendly. The PPy nanoparticles of uniform size and shape were readily integrated with interdigitated microelectrode arrays for sensitive photo and chemical gas sensors. PPy nanoparticles-based sensing devices were fabricated via a simple drop casting of PPy nanoparticles on the interdigitated microelectrode arrays. Based on the internal photoelectric effect of the PPy nanoparticles, {{the performance of the}} PPy nanoparticles-based sensing device as an UV <b>illuminance</b> <b>meter</b> was investigated. It was found that the limit of detection was 2 Lux and the sensitivity was 3. 425 % per Lux of UV light illuminance. The PPy nanoparticles-based sensing device was also tested as an ammonia gas detector, based on the un-doping process of the PPy nanoparticles. The limit of detection was found to be 4 ppm and the sensitivity determined to be 0. 274 % per ppm ammonia in the concentration range from 0 ppm to 100 ppm, which covers the ammonia threshold limit values (25 ppm and 35 ppm), as defined by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Furthermore, the enfluence of the size of PPy nanoparticles and the thickness of the PPy nanoparticle layer on the sensitivity of the sensing device was investigated. It was found that smaller PPy nanoparticles lead to higher sensitivity, while the thickness of the PPy nanoparticle layer does not affect the sensor performance. The novel PPy nanoparticle synthesis approach developed in this study represents a progress towards simpl, cheap and environmentally friendly production of nanostructured conductive polymers.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have linked the {{benefits}} of roadway lighting to a reduction in crash rates at night for a variety of roadway types including rural intersections. Assessing the effectiveness of intersection lighting has primarily relied upon crash database modeling comparing lighted intersections to unlighted intersections. The current research effort gathered similar metrics for comparison but also measured the amount of lighting within isolated rural intersections. Sixty-three intersection locations were chosen for lighting measurement from six different counties within Minnesota. A vehicle mounted <b>illuminance</b> <b>meter</b> data collection system was used to collect data at each intersection. The data collection system utilized five separate illuminance meters and captured horizontal illuminance while driving through all 63 intersection locations. Following data collection, a series of negative binomial regression models were used to assess the horizontal lighting level in conjunction with the nighttime crash ratio, intersection configuration type, and proximity of an intersection to a curve in the roadway. The first model used data from the lighted an unlighted intersections. The results showed that across all intersections, an increase in the average horizontal illuminance (3. 91 lux) by 1 -lux (~ 0. 09 fc) reduced nighttime crash rates by 9 %. A second model used only lighted intersection data and showed an increase in 1 -lux from average (6. 41 lux) reduced crashes by 20 %. A third and final model used unlighted intersections only. A 1 -lux increase from average (0. 20 lux) or increasing illuminance to lighted levels (as defined by the modeling), reduced nighttime crash ratios by 94 %. Intersection configuration and proximity to curves also affected the nighttime crash ratios. The results of this effort are discussed in terms the impact of horizontal illuminance on crash rates. Additional items discussed include thresholds for minimum and maximum lighting levels and future research investigating and validating these efforts.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a field {{study of how}} the platforms are seen during the dark hours by people with and without visual impairment cataract. The field study was carried out with both qualitative and quantitative data as a basis. The qualitative data was collected through a visual assessment of the platforms in {{four out of five}} station classes that Swedish Transport Administration has. The observations were made with and without simulated visual impairment to provide a comprehensive picture about the orientation and visual comfort for all travelers. Photometric data were collected with an <b>illuminance</b> <b>meter</b> to see how the platform met the requirements for its associated lighting class and whether there was any connection between the illuminance on the surface, and the experience of the environment visually.   The questions answered in this report, if five lighting classes are necessary and how the platforms are experienced by travelers with and without visual impairment. Earlier research on the guidance route and contrasts confirmed {{the results of the study}} in which observations of platforms shows that orientation in environments without contrasts between surface colors will be difficult to get around in for people with visual impairment. There is little difference in visual comfort and orientation of the various station classes. The results show that the most important thing for a person with cataract is a uniform illumination and clear guidance route. Without loss of vision it seems that the quality of light and how well maintained the facility is perceived to be affecting the sense of security more than surface colors and light contrasts. Denna rapport redovisar en fältstudie av hur tågplattformar på tågstationer uppfattas under dygnets mörka timmar av personer med och utan synnedsättningen grå starr. Fältstudien har genomförts med både kvalitativa och kvantitativa data som grund. Kvalitativ data samlades in genom en visuell bedömning av tågplattformar inom fyra av fem stationsklasser som Trafikverket har. Observationerna gjordes med och utan simulerad synnedsättning för att ge en helhetsbild kring orientering och synkomforten för alla resenärer. Fotometrisk data samlades in med luxmeter för att se hur tågplattformen uppfyllde kraven för sin tillhörande belysningsklass och om det fanns något samband mellan belysningsstyrkan på markytan och upplevelsen av miljön visuellt. Frågeställningarna som besvaras i rapporten är om det behövs fem belysningsklasser samt hur tågplattformar upplevs av resenärer med och utan synnedsättning kvällstid. Tidigare forskning kring ledstråk och kontraster bekräftas i studiens resultat där observation av tågplattformar som synnedsatt visar att orientering i miljöer utan kontraster mellan ytfärger blir svåra att ta sig fram i. Det är liten skillnad i visuell komfort och orienterbarhet mellan de olika stationsklasserna. Resultaten visar att det viktigaste för en synnedsatt person är en jämn belysning och tydliga ledstråk. Utan synnedsättning verkar ljuskvaliteten och hur väl underhållen anläggningen upplevs vara påverka trygghetskänslan mer än ytfärger och ljushetskontraster. ...|$|E
