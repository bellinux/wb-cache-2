40|$|Abstract. Internet {{protocol}} (IP) traffic follows rules {{established by}} routing protocols. Shortest path based protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), direct traffic based on arc weights {{assigned by the}} network operator. Each router computes shortest paths and creates <b>destination</b> <b>tables</b> used for routing flow on the shortest paths. If a router has multiple outgoing links on shortest paths to a given destination, it splits traffic evenly over these links. It is also {{the role of the}} routing protocol to specify how the network should react to changes in the network topology, such as arc or router failures. In such situations, IP traffic is re-routed through the shortest paths not traversing the affected part of the network. This paper addresses the issue of assigning OSPF weights and multiplicities to each arc, aiming to design efficient OSPF-routed networks with minimum total weighted multiplicity (multiplicity multiplied by the arc length) needed to route the required demand and handle any single arc or router failure. The multiplicities are limited to a discrete set of values and we assume that the topology is given. We propose an evolutionary algorithm for this problem, and present results applying it to several real-world problem instances. 1...|$|R

50|$|Depending on the {{specific}} router implementation, the table in which the destination address is looked up could be the routing table (also known as the routing information base, RIB), or a separate forwarding information base (FIB) that is populated (i.e., loaded) by the routing control plane, but used by the forwarding plane for look-ups at much higher speeds. Before or after examining the <b>destination,</b> other <b>tables</b> may be consulted to make decisions to drop the packet based on other characteristics, such as the source address, the IP protocol identifier field, or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number.|$|R

The message flows between two communicating systems A and B {{in the presence of a}} router R are illustrated in figure 4. Datagrams are passed from router to router until a router is reached that can deliver the datagram on a physically attached network (called direct delivery). [...] To decide whether a datagram is to be delivered directly or is to be sent to a router closer to the <b>destination,</b> a <b>table</b> called the IP routing table is consulted. The table consists of pairs of networkids and the paths to be taken to reach known networks. The path can be an indication that the datagram should be delivered directly or it can be the address of a router known to be closer to the destination. [...] A special entry can specify that a default router is chosen when there are no known paths.|$|R

The mov ement generation is addressed through an extension of the category index model, which takes into account the hierarchy in the classification system of the economic activities, thus avoiding aggregating the many existing classification codes into pre - specif ied groups. The trip distribution is addressed through an adaptation of the gravity model, which takes into account that deliveries are organized in tours.

The source address is irrelevant to the router. However, in multicast routing, the source address (which is a simple unicast address) is used to determine data stream direction. The source of the multicast traffic is considered upstream. The router determines which downstream interfaces are destinations for this multicast group (the destination address), and sends the packet out through the appropriate interfaces. The term reverse path forwarding is used to describe this concept of routing packets away from the source, rather than towards the destination.|$|R

TB {{is a member of}} a class of traffic-aware routing algorithms based on the behavior of ants. TB maintains in every router a probability table that controls the selection of outgoing links for a given <b>destination.</b> This <b>table</b> is modified by passing scout packets. Some scout packets follow existing high probability paths, and other scout packets explore new paths by making random “mistakes ” in order to find detours around congested areas of the network. Scout packets do not have global knowledge of the network topology. Rather, they are influenced by probability trails left by previous scout packets, and leave a trail of updated probability information. TB is meant to be an extension of existing link-state protocols such as OSPF or IS-IS, which provide shortest-path information to initialize the probability table. Simulations of UDP traffic in congested networks show a reduction of packet drops by factors of 3. 4 – 38. 4 and 1. 8 – 8. 2, for single-path and multi-path shortest-path routing, respectively, with a bounded reordering window. Even though TB may cause packet reordering which may affect the congesting control mechanisms of TCP, TCP traffic sent over TB has a similar bandwidth to shortest-path routing. Simulation of a hybrid routing algorithm that routes TCP traffic over shortest paths and UDP traffic over TB show reduced interference between TCP and UDP traffic. 1...|$|R

40|$|Network on Chip (NoC) {{has emerged}} as a {{competitive}} and efficient communication infrastructure for the core based design of System on Chip. Resource (core), router and interface between router and core are the three main parts of a NoC. Each core communicates with the network through the interface, also called Resource Network Interface (RNI). One approach to speed up the design at NoC based systems is to develop standardized RNI. Design of RNI depends to some extent on the type of routing technique used in NoC. Control of route decision base the categorization of source and distributed routing algorithms. In source routing a complete path to the destination is provided in the packet header at the source, whereas in distributed routing, the path is dynamically computed in routers as the packet moves through the network. Buffering, flitization, deflitization and transfer of data from core to router and vice versa, are common responsibilities of RNI in both types of routing. In source routing, RNI has an extra functionality of storing complete paths to all <b>destinations</b> in <b>tables,</b> extracting path to reach a desired destination and adding it in the header flit. In this thesis, we have made an effort towards designing and prototyping a standardized and efficient RNI for both source and distributed routing.

40|$|What is Internet? Internet is a {{hierarchical}} network composed of communication de-vices, the routers, interconnected with point-to-point links. The interconnection between the Autonomous systems composes {{the top level}} of the hierarchy. An autonomous sys-tem (AS) is basically a local network with a gateway to the outside (for instance, the local network of an university). Autonomous systems are of various types or, more precisely, belong to different domains (Stub domains, Transit domains, or Multi-homed domains). Basically, Transit domains interconnect Stub domains. The graph we will consider is the graph whose nodes are the ASs and whose edges are the link between them. Links between autonomous systems are unknown: network companies keep their net-work structure secret. This motivates the need of a model: because the real network is unknown, one needs a model to design algorithms or calibrate structures for the Internet.

Destination terminals ask for cooperation when they fail in decoding data frames transmitted by source terminals. In that case, each destination terminal D calls a specific relay terminal B with a signaling frame to help its transmission with source terminal S. To select appropriate relays, <b>destination</b> terminals maintain <b>tables</b> of relay terminals, one for each possible source address. These tables are constituted by passively overhearing ongoing transmissions. Hence, when cooperation is needed between S and D, and when a relay B is found by terminal D in the relay table associated with terminal S, the destination terminal sends a negative acknowledgment frame that contains the address of B. When the best relay B has successfully decoded the source message, it sends a copy of the data frame to D using a selective decode-andforward transmission scheme. The on-demand approach allows maximization of the spatial multiplexing gain and the cooperation of the best relay allows maximization of the spatial diversity order. Hence, the proposed protocol achieves optimal diversitymultiplexing trade-off performance. Moreover, this performance is achieved through a collision-free selection process...|$|R

40|$|A {{spectrum}} of traffic engineering and modern transportation planning problems requires {{the knowledge of}} the underlying trip pattern, commonly represented by dynamic Origin- <b>Destination</b> (OD) trip <b>tables.</b> In {{view of the fact that}} direct survey of trip pattern is technically problematic and economically infeasible, there have been a great number of methods proposed in the literature for updating the existing OD tables from traffic counts and/or other data sources. Unfortunately, there remain several common theoretical and practical aspects which impact the estimation accuracy and limit the use of these methods from most real-world applications. This dissertation itemizes and examines these critical issues. Then, the dissertation presents the developments, evaluations, and applications of two new frameworks intended to be used with the current and near-future data, respectively. The first framework offers a systematic and practical procedure for preparing dynamic demand inputs for microscopic traffic simulation under planning applications with an estimation module based solely on traffic counts. Under this framework, the traditional planning model is augmented with a filter traffic simulation step, which captures important spatial-temporal characteristics of route and traffic patterns within a large surrounding network, to improve the flow estimates entering and leaving the final microscopic simulation network. A new bounded dynamic OD estimation model and a solution algorithm for solving a large problem are also proposed. The second framework utilizes additional information from small probe samples collected over multiple days. There are two steps under this framework. The first step includes a suite of empirical and hierarchical Bayesian models used in estimating time dependent travel time distributions, destination fractions, and route fractions from probe data. These models provide multi-level posterior parameters and tend to moderate extreme estimates toward the overall mean with the magnitude depending on their precision, thus overcoming several problems due to non-uniform (over time and space) small sampling rates. The second step involves a construction of initial OD tables, an estimation of route-link fractions via a Monte Carlo simulation, and an updating procedure using a new dynamic OD estimation formulation which can also take into account the stochastic properties of the assignment matrix...|$|R
