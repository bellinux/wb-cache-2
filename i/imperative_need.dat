[...] Ende's school in Sorrowland is run by a dragon who has a skull on her door, reminding of Heinrich Himmler's Totenkopfverbände, and she terrorizes the children with a baton and teaches them lessons on eugenics and racial purity.

30|$|One of the {{well-known}} challenges relating the effective usage of encryption {{in the cloud}} is key management. According to the Cloud Security Alliance, three main <b>imperatives</b> <b>need</b> to be met [17]. The first concerns {{the security of the}} key stores in order to avoid compromising all encrypted data. Then comes the actual policing of the access to those keys; to ensure only legitimate users get access to the keys, and the implementation of a clear policy to ensure keys are not stored by the entity meant to be using them. Finally, ensure that safe backups exist for data recovery in case of key loss. Nonetheless there are signs that things are moving on that side as the advancement on order preserving encryption and database systems have facilitate the emergence of application where the cryptographic key remains at the client [52].|$|R
30|$|Each {{group has}} {{different}} levels of flexibility possible for herd management (breeding, feeding, watering practices, purchases and sales of animals). In group A, the relatively low productivity of cattle in the Sahelian context (the growth rate of herds {{is no more than}} 10 % to 12 % in Sahel; see Ba et al. 2011; Otte and Chilonda 2002) does not enable the families to remove a sufficient number of animals to fulfil their economic needs without endangering the renewal of the herd. After a major loss of animals, more than a decade is necessary to recover to the levels of the initial stock, supported by only natural growth rate (Lesnoff et al. 2012). The lack of access to other income sources to buy feed or veterinary products and the lack of labour beyond the <b>imperative</b> <b>needs</b> for watering are major constraints to productivity.|$|R

The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought hope for the deeply distressed Tibetan people. In conforming to the law of historical development and the interests of the Tibetan people, the Central People's Government worked actively to bring about Tibet's peaceful liberation.

The results show that patients {{are much more likely to}} be positive in predicting community growth when their expectations are met, and also tend to appreciate financial benefits more.

40|$|The author {{argues that}} the {{deterioration}} of the natural environment in China provides a persuasive reason to reorient China’s economic growth towards a more sustainable path. Reconciling the development and environment <b>imperatives</b> <b>needs</b> to become an urgent priority for the Chinese government in order to avert the cascading implications that will arise in terms of social unrest, loss of further development opportunities as well as deepening income inequality. This paper thus examines the inter-relationship between the current ecological challenge in China and the need for economic sustainability. It evaluates the extent of environmental damage in China and focuses on the environmental impact on development and social inequality. The paper then examines the recent legislative measures that have been taken by the Chinese government {{to address the problem of}} inefficient environmental monitoring. The author suggests that further reform is needed to achieve an economically and ecologically just pathway for China’s future. The paper therefore demonstrates that the environment–development challenge in China is mainly a challenge of governance. Resolving it will contribute to better environmental justice and development. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Epidemics of FMD have {{resulted}} in the slaughter of millions of animals, despite this being a frequently nonfatal disease for adult animals (2–5% mortality), though young animals can have a high mortality. The Taiwan outbreak that only affected pigs also showed a high mortality for adults. The destruction of animals is primarily to halt further spread, as growth and milk production may be permanently affected, even in animals that have recovered. Due to international efforts to eradicate the disease, infection would also lead to trade bans being imposed on affected countries. Critics of current policies to cull infected herds argue that the financial <b>imperative</b> <b>needs</b> to be balanced against the killing of many animals, especially when a significant proportion of infected animals, most notably those producing milk, would recover from infection and live normal lives, albeit with reduced milk production. On the ethical side, one must also consider FMD is a painful disease for the affected animals. The vesicles/blisters are painful in themselves, and restrict both eating and movement. Through ruptured blisters, the animal is at risk from secondary bacterial infections and, in some cases, permanent disability.|$|R
40|$|The Singapore {{government}} has long {{relied on the}} inherent public pedagogical qualities of culture in the forms of official cultural and media policies and in the unscripted signifiers of cultural conduct, {{such as in the}} public's attitude towards the arts. The prime objective is to instrumentalise citizens on how they should become both economically productive and creative whilst adhering to prescribed sociopolitical norms. The paper begins with a discussion of a 2012 debate surrounding a Singapore street artist, dubbed the 'Sticker Lady', who was arrested for vandalising public property with political incorrect stickers and provocative phrases. The saga sparked questions of whether Singapore is ready to embrace the increasingly open, technologically advanced and creativity-led twenty-first century. This paper argues that while the authorities are cognisant of the need to open-up society, it is finding it difficult to cede some aspects of control. Instead of making the case for a fundamental change, it argues that public pedagogical <b>imperatives</b> <b>need</b> to be better applied to realign the direction of cultural policy in Singapore. In essence, the perception of what creativity is and how it might engender sociopolitical openness is needed to 'inculate' a culture of creativity in Singapore...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the process}} of privatisation in Brazil and argues {{that it was a}} pragmatic response to short-term macroeconomic problems arising from the state of disarray of national fiscal accounts. Privatisation was propelled by the fact that foreign ownership of infrastructure and basic input sectors ceased {{to be seen as a}} threat to “national security”, because of a shift in the focus of development policies towards efficiency and away from the mere accumulation of capital, and due to a close relationship between privatisation and macroeconomic policy. Of the three, the author attributes greatest weight to the macroeconomic policy connection. Hence the first curbs on SOE expansion in the mid- 1970 s, when the growth cycle started in the forties showed the first signs of exhaustion. Indeed, until very recently, failure to stabilize the economy and resume sustained growth served as the main motive for privatisation. The author attempts to show that privatisation in Brazil met the <b>imperative</b> <b>needs</b> of the stabilization effort, more than it resulted from an ideological conversion process (although these two were not the only motives). 1 Paper presented at the workshop “Changing nature of business-state relations in Brazil: strategies o...|$|R

30|$|Instructors {{can control}} many {{elements}} of an online course, including {{the presentation of}} materials and the communication of content. Another important element that affects learner experience, however, may reside in the technology and media being utilized in an online course. Ausburn (2004) suggests that a learner’s skills and experience with technology may strongly influence his or her feelings of comfort and security unless an instructor’s reassuring presence is demonstrated. The structure and the technological aspect of an effective online course may be complex. However, course design needs to fit with learner needs and perceptions, encourage technology literacy, contribute to self-efficacy, and provide quality communication, {{all of which have}} impact on the experience of students (MacDonald and Thompson 2005). Online instructors should communicate through course design features that facilitate student access and mobility in an online course, which includes easy navigation, legible, user-friendly screen design, and informative multimedia (MacGregor and Lou 2004). The dialog between students and their peers should be developed in many forms––e-mails, chat discussions, synchronous discussions, and even phone calls for complex or <b>imperative</b> <b>needs</b> using an educational technology (Johnson et al. 2000). If students and instructors can acknowledge their shared role as educators and learners in an online course, there are opportunities to not only overcome technical difficulties but also create an effective online learning community (Tisdell et al. 2004).|$|R
