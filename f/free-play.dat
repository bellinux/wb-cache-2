2500|$|Since Humans vs. Zombies {{can last}} for days, rules {{establish}} [...] "safe zones" [...] where gameplay does not take place, and where players can stop participation in the game for a certain period. Safe zones are designated by the administrators in conjunction with University rules and/or other applicable rules. Safe zones include dorm rooms, bathrooms, dining halls, Academic buildings, Health centers and other such places. Safe zones vary by the rules set at each separate University. [...] Some include every building on the campus and all vehicles, others may exclude some, but not all buildings and vehicles. [...] Players are also considered safe attending a mandatory academic or athletic event. They are not safe, however, going to or coming from these events. Some colleges also consider a [...] "wheel rule" [...] where players are in a safe zone if {{they are on a}} skateboard, bicycle, or wearing rollerblades. Generally, HvZ is played on-campus, so off-campus is considered a safe zone as well. Under the original rules, however, all Humans must sleep on-campus and being away for longer than 24 hours warrants automatic death or removal. Every area not designated a safe zone by administrators is considered a <b>free-play</b> area where players may tag or be tagged. Under the original rules, the game is played at all times and never stops until the game has reached the conclusion.|$|E

50|$|A {{group of}} 72 pre-school {{children}} were tested on their rhythmic ability; {{half of the}} children had <b>free-play</b> (35-40 min.) twice {{a week for a}} 10-week period while the other half had rhythmic movement classes for the same amount of time. The group that had classes (experimental group) did significantly better than the group that just had <b>free-play</b> (control group). The experiment group scored four or more points better in every area tested than the control group in the final test. This shows that eurhythmic classes can benefit a child’s sense of rhythm.|$|E

50|$|One {{study found}} that parents {{reliably}} facilitate the use of mutual exclusivity in their children. In two studies, 12- to 24-month old {{children and their parents}} were recorded while doing <b>free-play.</b> In both studies, parents reliably preferred to give their children only one label for an object rather than two. When they did offer two, they often also gave clarifying information to explain why two labels were appropriate.|$|E
50|$|Lottery {{policies}} within {{states can}} have conflicting goals. Given that instructions are {{passed down from}} state legislatures, lottery implementation is often expected {{to be carried out}} with reduced advertising and funding while still producing the same amount of revenue. This issue led states to look for loopholes in the system. Massachusetts, for example, had its advertising budget dramatically cut, and therefore started using <b>free-play</b> coupons as money to pay for advertising. This led to an IRS investigation into alleged non-reporting of income because the IRS considered the coupons to have monetary value.|$|E
5000|$|Like its namesake, Okyeame was {{not simply}} a mouthpiece; it was also an [...] "interpreter" [...] and an [...] "ambassador in foreign courts".

50|$|The {{premise of}} the game is to create a {{functional}} prison complete with walls, guard towers, housing wings, dining, workout and medical facilities. The objective {{of the game is}} ultimately to turn your low security incarceration facility into a profitable maximum security prison. Funding is collected by the player through state funding, charitable donations and inmate labor depending on a myriad factors, such as employee satisfaction and inmate happiness and rehabilitation.

50|$|In a 2001 study {{conducted}} in Germany examining German infants {{during their first}} 12 weeks of life, researchers studied the relationship between eye contact, maternal sensitivity and infant crying to attempt to determine if eye contact and maternal sensitivity were stable over time. In this correlational study, they began by categorizing the mother’s sensitivity placing them into one of four behavioral categories: inhibited/intense behavior, distortion of infant signals, over and understimulational, and aggressive behavioral. Next, the observer video-taped the mother and infant’s <b>free-play</b> interactions {{on a weekly basis}} for 12 weeks. When watching the videos, they measured the mutual eye contact between the mother and the infant by looking at the overlap in time when the mothers looked at their infant’s face and when the infants looked at their mother’s face. The mothers were also asked to record their infant’s crying in a diary.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1997, John Hancock {{deployed}} {{to the coast}} of Tunisia to participate in Exercise NADOR 97-3. John Hancock was also there in March for NADOR 97-2. For NADOR 97-3, the John Hancock crew operated with two Tunisian combatant patrol boats and increased the level of difficulty. They conducted air and high speed surface gunnery exercises, air tracking and engagement simulations, and <b>free-play</b> [...] "encounter" [...] exercises. John Hancock also performed a maritime interdiction demonstration on board the two patrol boats. Simulating merchant vessels, the patrol boats were queried using the bridge-to-bridge radio. After evaluating the suspect merchants answers, John Hancocks boarding team was sent to each vessel using a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The boarding team inspected each merchants manifest and cargo, and directed the suspect vessel to continue on its journey or divert to the nearest port for a full inspection of cargo.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 June 1962, Salmon {{departed}} San Diego for {{her third}} WestPac deployment. She visited Papeete, Tahiti, from 13 to 16 June, {{then proceeded to}} Yokosuka for duty with Seventh Fleet. She subsequently operated with antisubmarine warfare (ASW) hunter-killer groups in fleet exercises and often engaged in <b>free-play</b> battle problems with individual surface units. During this deployment, she visited Hakodate and Sasebo, Japan; Naha, Okinawa and Hong Kong. Salmon returned to San Diego, California, on 20 December and became flagship of Submarine Flotilla 1; and, {{in addition to that}} distinction, was awarded the Golden [...] "E" [...] for excellence in battle efficiency for the past five consecutive years, which rated her as the leading submarine of her division.

50|$|Capturing bases {{is done by}} {{comparing}} the attacking troops' numbers with the defending, with larger numbers winning. Bases come in several varieties, and some bases, such as mines and castles, provide additional bonuses to the side that holds them, such as increased movement speed or attack power. Other bases, such as ports, form choke points on the map by allowing travel on other terrain such as over water. When a base is captured, it {{has a chance to}} give the capturing side an item, which may be consumed later to grant a bonus, such as increased speed or defense, to all the units of that side. The match ends when one player controls the entire map. Each match takes around ten to twenty minutes to complete. Some battles feature more than one enemy player. In addition to the campaign mode, which is ten missions long, there is a <b>free-play</b> mode where the player can fight enemies on the map of their choosing.|$|E
50|$|Crime Life: Gang Wars is a {{video game}} {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game is a fictionalized simulation of gang wars, with the game play focused on street fights involving many gang members at once. Weapons include baseball bats, lead pipes, hammers and guns. The game includes over 25 story-mode missions, {{as well as some}} <b>free-play</b> missions. Free roam is also available as in the popular Grand Theft Auto. The areas are relatively small but can prove useful when trying to locate your fellow gang members. The game features harsh language and violence is definitely a staple of it. The game's music is all hip-hop, reflecting the urban and hip-hop atmosphere of the game. There are various methods of earning money, ranging from mugging to burglaries. The soundtrack of the game is provided by the hip-hop group D12, which also contributed the likenesses and voices for some of the game's key characters.|$|E
50|$|Children {{are more}} likely to develop SAD if one or both of their parents was {{diagnosed}} with a psychological disorder. Recent research by Daniel Schechter and colleagues have pointed to difficulties of mothers who have themselves had early adverse experiences such as maltreatment and disturbed attachments with their own caregivers, who then go on to develop responses to their infants' and toddlers' normative social bids in the service of social referencing, emotion regulation, and joint attention, which responses are linked to these mothers own psychopathology (i.e. maternal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.) These atypical maternal responses which {{have been shown to be}} associated with separation anxiety have been related to disturbances in maternal stress physiologic response to mother-toddler separation as well as lower maternal neural activity in the brain region of the medial prefrontal cortex when mothers with and without PTSD were shown video excerpts of their own and unfamiliar toddlers during mother-child separation versus <b>free-play.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} explore her ideas on child {{psychology}} further, {{she went back}} to Sarah Lawrence College in 1937 and founded The Nursery School, a laboratory where she could research children's personality development. Murphy also looked at the positive aspects of social development, such as the origin of sympathy. In 1941 she was The Nursery School's first director. The same year she became director, she published Methods for the Study of Personality in Young Children, which was based on the research done at The Nursery School. [...] "Theories of <b>free-play,</b> Rorschach analysis of children, and the application of the Miniature Life Toy Technique were all explored during her time at the school." [...] Later she combined many sources of data in a single case, a case study of one child at The Nursery School, Colin: A Normal Child (1956). While she was at Sarah Lawrence College she also published, Emotional Factors in Learning (1944) and Achievement in the College Years (1960).|$|E
