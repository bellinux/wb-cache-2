25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very <b>defensive</b> <b>about</b> Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the {{legitimacy}} of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E

500|$|Lansbury was <b>defensive</b> <b>about</b> Jessica Fletcher, having {{creative}} input {{over the}} character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives {{to put her}} in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her [...] "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life." [...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as [...] "a television landmark" [...] in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E

500|$|Following Taraki's {{fall from}} power, Amin was elected Chairman of the Presidum of the Revolutionary Council and General Secretary of the PDPA Central Committee by the PDPA Politburo. The {{election}} of Amin as PDPA General Secretary and {{the removal of}} Taraki from all party posts was unanimous. The only members of the cabinet replaced when Amin took power were the Gang of Four – Beverley Male saw this as [...] "a clear indication that he had their [...] support". Amin's rise to power was followed by a policy of moderation, and attempts to persuade the Afghan people that the regime was not anti-Islamic. Amin's government began to invest in the reconstruction, or reparation, of mosques. He also promised the Afghan people freedom of religion. Religious groups were given copies of the Quran, and Amin began to refer to Allah in speeches. He even claimed that the Saur Revolution was [...] "totally based on the principles of Islam". The campaign proved to be unsuccessful, and many Afghans held Amin responsible for the regime's totalitarian behavior. Amin's rise to power was officially endorsed by the Jamiatul Ulama on 20 September 1979. Their endorsement led to the official announcement that Amin was a pious Muslim – Amin thus scored a point against the counter-revolutionary propaganda which claimed the communist regime was atheist. Amin also tried to increase his popularity with tribal groups, a feat Taraki had been unable or unwilling to achieve. In a speech to tribal elders Amin was <b>defensive</b> <b>about</b> the Western way he dressed; an official biography was published which depicted Amin in traditional Pashtun clothes. During his short stay in power, Amin became committed to establishing a collective leadership; when Taraki was ousted, Amin promised [...] "from now on there will be no one-man government..." ...|$|E
500|$|Clements and Musker {{enjoyed the}} song but would {{sometimes}} disagree with Ashman over its lyrics, which Ashman had insisted be very specific. Musker specifically {{wanted to change}} the line [...] "I wanna be where the people are" [...] because he felt that it sounded too political and reminded him of Governor of Illinois Dan Walker, suggesting that [...] "the" [...] be removed. Appalled by this suggestion, Ashman insisted that the line remain unchanged to prevent the word [...] "where" [...] from having to be held longer; Musker would eventually admit that his suggestion was [...] "idiotic". Although Ashman was very <b>defensive</b> <b>about</b> the song and typically dismissed most of the directors' suggestions, he agreed to revise lyrics that originally described the contents of Ariel's grotto using eloquent terms such as [...] "fine china" [...] and [...] "books bound in leather and gold", {{and replaced them with}} words that would be more familiar to a mermaid who learns about humans from an uneducated seagull named Scuttle. Ashman's revisions integrated funnier lyrics such as [...] "thingamabobs” and “whozits and whatzits" [...] into the song, making [...] "Part of Your World" [...] more consistent with the film's lighthearted tone. Ashman initially pitched Ariel's reprise of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a sad lament in which the character sings [...] "I’ll never be…part of that world". Clements and Musker argued that the reprise should instead convey Ariel's determined nature as she decides to pursue her dream of becoming part of Eric's world. Howard agreed to rewrite the reprise into a more positive anthem that ultimately reads [...] "I don’t know when, I don’t know how, but I know something’s starting right now…Watch and you’ll see…someday I’ll be…part of your world", providing the film with more momentum while establishing further conflict between Ariel and her father King Triton. Ashman's willingness to rewrite both versions of the song's lyrics pleasantly surprised the directors.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the officer}} {{realized}} that Goetz {{was a genuine}} suspect, Goetz was given a Miranda warning and he waived his right to have an attorney present. After an interview that lasted over an hour, a Concord detective asked Goetz to consent to making an audiotaped statement. Goetz agreed, and a two-hour statement was recorded. That evening, New York City detectives and an assistant district attorney arrived in Concord, and Goetz submitted to a two-hour videotaped interview. Both interviews were eventually played back for the grand juries, the criminal trial, and a civil trial years later. When the audiotape was first played in open court, Goetz was described by The New York Times as [...] "confused and emotional, alternately horrified by and <b>defensive</b> <b>about</b> his actions, and obsessed with justifying them." ...|$|E

60|$|George was but {{an amateur}} physiognomist, {{but he could}} read what was obvious in the faces he encountered; and the more he looked at this girl, the less {{he was able to}} {{understand}} the scene which had just occurred. The thing mystified him completely. For all her good-humour, there was an air, a manner, a something capable and <b>defensive,</b> <b>about</b> this girl with which he could not imagine any man venturing to take liberties. The gold-brown eyes, as they met his now, were friendly and smiling, but he could imagine them freezing into a stare baleful enough and haughty enough to quell such a person as the silk-hatted young man with a single glance. Why, then, had that super-fatted individual been able to demoralize her to the extent of flying to the shelter of strange cabs? She was composed enough now, it was true, but it had been quite plain that at the moment when she entered the taxi her nerve had momentarily forsaken her. There were mysteries here, beyond George.|$|E

50|$|It was Ibrahim Khan {{battalion}} which faced & repulsed the Afghan onslaught {{during the}} battle.

Around 45,000 men from the Durrani army of Ahmad Shah Durrani lost their lives due to salvos fired at point blank range into the Afghan ranks.|$|R
50|$|The units {{grouped into}} Arkforce were near Arques-la-Bataille and its name was {{a version of}} the eponymous village. Arkforce was to form a <b>defensive</b> line <b>about</b> 30 km to the east of Le Havre, on the Fécamp-Bolbec line, to allow the 51st Highland Division and the rest of IX Corps to retreat. It was also charged with {{providing}} the reconnaissance for a line of defence closer to Le Havre to aid the evacuation.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} historical relic, {{besides the}} remnants of the old wall complexes built of elms, is the formerly fortified church, a Late Gothic hall structure with a quire enclosed on three sides and a ring of walls with what is perhaps also a Late Gothic, but Baroque-modified gatetower, which als serves as a belltower. Arising from municipal acts were the partial demolition of the wall and the total demolition of the <b>defensive</b> towers <b>about</b> 1840. The stones were used to build the schoolhouse.|$|R
50|$|The Noodle Incident is {{a running}} gag about an event at school in which Calvin was {{involved}} in the past.

50|$|There was {{a veritable}} {{explosion}} of defenses of Creole ancestry.

25|$|The Polish Army in France {{formed in}} France {{under the command}} of General Władysław Sikorski (and hence {{sometimes}} known as Sikorski's Army) in late 1939, after the fall of Poland resulting from the Polish <b>Defensive</b> War. <b>About</b> 85,000 troops {{were in the process of}} being organized into fighting formations (four infantry divisions, two independent brigades and air support) when the battle of France started.

50|$|The {{fortification}} {{consisted of}} a Confederate <b>defensive</b> line <b>about</b> a mile and 3/4 long stretching from the Mississippi River northward to Metairie Ridge. (The area further north from the ridge to Lake Pontchartrain {{was at the time}} swampland.) This was intended to protect the city of New Orleans from Union attack from upriver. As the Union fleet took the city by sailing in from below, the fortification was never used. After the capture of New Orleans, U.S. forces garrisoned and expanded the fortifications to defend against a Confederate counter-attack, which never came.|$|R
5000|$|In Dune, the {{technology}} has been adapted for reliable use in personal defensive shields which permit penetration only by objects that move below a pre-set velocity. Paul Atreides notes in Dune, [...] "In shield fighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack ...
