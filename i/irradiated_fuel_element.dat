40|$|AbstractMost {{high flux}} {{reactors}} {{for research purposes}} have fuel elements composed of plates and not pencils. The measure of inter-plate distance of a fuel element is tricky since a resolution of a micron is searched to measure plate swellings of about ten microns while the dimension between the plates {{is close to the}} millimeter. This measure should provide information about the fuel and particularly its history of irradiation. That is the reason why a solution has been considered: a robust device based upon high frequency ultrasonic probes adapted to the high radiation environment and thinned to 1 mm to be inserted into a 1. 8 mm width water channel between two fuel plates. To achieve the expected resolution, the system is excited with frequencies up to 150 MHz. Thanks to a specific signal processing, this device allows the distance measurement through an ultrasonic wave's time of flight. The feasibility of such challenging distance measurement has already been proved with success on a full size <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> of the RHF...|$|E

Fuel and fuel-boundary conditions in an LMFBR subassembly following sodium voiding and dryout under loss-of-flow conditions are simulated in each F-series test. Simulation is achieved {{with a single}} fuel element surrounded by an annular nuclear-heated wall in a dry (no sodium) test capsule. The area inside the heated wall was selected to represent the area inside the perimeter of an LMFBR coolant channel. Test F 1 was conducted with an <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> to investigate the effect of fission gas on fuel motion at design power levels following cladding melting and drainage. The principal conclusion from Test F 1 is that fission products retarded, but did not prevent, eventual fuel collapse. The collapse was retarded by a fuel/fission-product froth that prevented fuel collapse until the fission products separated from the partially molten fuel.

40|$|The {{presented}} report {{deals with}} {{investigations of the}} potential application of x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for identification and classification of pebble-bed reactor fuel elements. Measurements were carried out an graphite spheres impregnated with different chemical elements at various concentrations. The intensity of the Kα-line of the impregnating elements, as function of concentration, was measured {{in order to establish}} the optimal concentrations needed for fuel element identification, and the sensitivity of the used spectrometer. These measurements have shown that x-ray fluorescence methods can be employed with advantage for identifying pebble-bed reactor fuel elements. There are enough, suitable chemical elements and a wide range of concentrations of each element, which may be used for this purpose. However, the sensitivity of the spectrometer was too low to detect the expected concentration of Sr and Cs (< 1 ppm) resulting from "coated particle"damage. The use of pulsed x-ray tubes to excite the fluorescence lines was investigated and found unsuitable.

40|$|Detailed reactor design {{calculations}} {{have been performed}} for a 10 MW swimming pool type Pakistan Research Reactor-l (P ARR-I) utilizing low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel and a 2 ' kW tank in pool type Pakistan Research Reactor- 2 (P ARR- 2) utilizing highly enriched(uranium (HEU) fuel. These calculations were aimed at: enhancing power level of P ARR-. from 9 to 10 MW, demonstrating inherent safety of P ARR- 2, developing mathematical models for thermal hydraulic and accident analysis of P ARR- 2 and their experimental validation, developing computer code for natural convection cooling of P ARR-l and it experimental validation, improving modeling procedures and validating methodology ant computer codes by experimental measurements. Standard computer codes WIMS-D/ 4 and CITATION were employed to calculate con excess reactivity, reactivity loads due to temperatures, xenon and samarium, neutron fluxes power distribution and power peaking factors, reactivity feedback coefficients, control roc worth and shutdown margin, reactivity worth of fuel element and reflector. etc. The analytical predictions were validated by experimental measurements and. the agreement is found to b generally good. The steady state thermal hydraulic analysis of P ARR-I and P ARR- 2 was carried to compute coolant velocity, pressure drop, saturation temperature, temperature distribution in the core heat fluxes at Onset of Nucleate Boiling (ONB), Onset of Flow Instability (OFI) and Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB). Computer code DP and PARET {{were used for the}} analysis of forced convection cooling of PARR - 1 core whereas a computer code FREECOM was developed for the analysis of natural convection cooling. Thermal hydraulic analysis 0 PARR- 2 was carried out using standard correlations. The calculated core parameters, for the natural convection cooling, were validated by making experimental measurements on but the reactors and comparing analytical predictions with available experimental data for simile reactors. Good agreement was observed between theoretical and experimental values. Computer code PARET was employed to investigate the transient response PARR-l core t several accident situations like uncontrolled withdrawal of control rods. flooding of bear tube, movement of core against thermal column and removal of an inpile experiment. The. reactivity limits imposed by clad melting temperature were also determined. In all of these transients, time histories of reactor power, energy release, peak fuel, clad and coolant temperatures were calculated. On the other hand, mathematical models were developed for the accident analysis of P ARR- 2. The theoretical predictions for P ARR- 2 were validated b) conducting reactivity insertion experiments. Reactivities of different magnitudes and durations were inserted into the core and transients were allowed to be terminated by intrinsic reactor behaviour without an external control or operators intervention. An external agreement was observed between analytical and experimental values. The radiological consequence analysis of P ARR-I was also performed. Fission produce inventory of some important radioisotopes was calculated using standard computer code KORIGEN. The environmental impacts in case of design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA) resulting in core melt down and release of fission product from reactor core to the containment building and eventually to atmosphere, after passing through various retention barriers, were analyzed. The atmospheric dispersion was modeled using a conservative, approach outlined in USNRC Regulatory Guide. The consequences were estimated in term of internal and external radiation doses to the workers and surrounding population. These dose estimates were then compared with the recommended dose limits given in 1 OCFRI 00 to determine the boundaries of exclusion and low population zones. The isotopic composition and decay characteristics of an <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> of PARR-were studied. Computer code KORIGEN was used to calculate the concentrations of uranium and plutonium isotopes, radioactivity, decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron source as function of operating cycle, fuel burnup and cooling time. The amount of fissile plutonium produced during irradiation and its contribution to total fissions occurring in the system was assessed. The contribution of gamma and alpha+beta to the total decay heat as a function (cooling time was calculated. Similarly, the contribution of light elements, actinides an fission products to total activity and decay heat as a function of cooling time was also studied. The fission product decay heat was calculated by KORIGEN and compared with the obtained from ANS 5. 1 standard curves and other widely used semi-empirical correlations order to see how their predictions vary from each. other. The correlations used include Bors Wheeler formula or Way-Wigner type function, Casta-nedelik formula, SOTRAN code formula, Petterson-Schlitz Formula and EI-Wakilâ€™s Formula. Based on the preceding analyses, following conclusion are drawn: The PARR-I can safely be upgraded to IO MW without compromising the safety of the reactor; The P ARR- 2 is an inherently safe reactor and can be licensed to operate without an operator on the console desk. It is therefore considered suitable for commissioning in densely populated areas; The model developed for the steady state thermal hydraulic and accident analysis of P ARR- 2 are quit adequate; The theoretical predictions of FREECON are in good agreement with experimental measurements.

A maximum of 0. 5 metric tons (0. 6 short tons) of fuel pieces is expected to be recovered...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe research presented here focuses on spent nuclear fuel assembly inspection using neutron computed tomography. Experimental measurements involving neutron beam transmission through a spent nuclear fuel assembly serve as benchmark measurements for an MCNP simulation model. Comparison of measured results to simulation results shows good agreement. Generation of tomography images from MCNP tally results was accomplished using adapted versions of built in MATLAB algorithms. Multiple fuel assembly models were examined to provide a broad set of conclusions. Tomography images revealing assembly geometric information including the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> lattice structure and missing elements can be obtained using high energy neutrons. A projection difference technique was developed which reveals the substitution of unirradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> for <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> using high energy neutrons. More subtle material differences such as altering the burnup of individual elements can be identified with lower energy neutrons provided the scattered neutron contribution to the image is limited. The research results show that neutron computed tomography {{can be used to}} inspect spent nuclear fuel assemblies for the purpose of identifying anomalies such as missing elements or substituted elements. The ability to identify anomalies in spent fuel assemblies can be used to deter diversion of material by increasing the risk of early detection as well as improve reprocessing facility operations by confirming the spent fuel configuration is as expected or allowing segregation if anomalies are detected...|$|R
40|$|Argonne National Laboratory is {{developing}} an electrometallurgical treatment for spent nuclear fuels. The initial demonstration {{of this process}} is being conducted on U-Zr and U-Pu-Zr alloy <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> <b>irradiated</b> in the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). The electrometallurgical treatment process extracts usable uranium from <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> and places residual fission products, actinides, process Zr, and cladding hulls (small segments of tubing) into two waste forms [...] a ceramic and a metal alloy. The metal waste form will contain the cladding hulls, Zr, and noble metal fission products, and it will be disposed of in a geologic repository. As a result, the expected composition of the waste form will need to be well understood. This report deals with the condition of the cladding, which will make up a large fraction of the metal waste form, after irradiation in EBR-II and before insertion into the electrorefiner. Specifically, it looks at layers that {{can be found on the}} inner surface of the cladding due to in-reactor interactions between the alloy fuel and the stainless steel cladding that occurs after the fuel has swelled and contacted the cladding. Many detailed examinations of <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> <b>irradiated</b> in EBR-II have been completed and are discussed in the context of interaction layer formation in irradiated cladding. The composition and thickness of the developed interaction layers are identified, along with the irradiation conditions, cladding type, and axial location on <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> where the thickest interaction layers can be expected to develop. It has been found that the largest interaction zones are observed at combined high power and high temperature regions of <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> and for <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> with U-Pu-Zr alloy fuel and D 9 stainless steel cladding. The most prevalent, non-cladding constituent observed in the developed interaction layers are the lanthanide fission products...|$|R
