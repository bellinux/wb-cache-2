5|$|In January 1776, Allen and his {{men were}} put on board HMS Soledad, which sailed for Cork, Ireland. The people of Cork, when they learned that the famous Ethan Allen was in port, took up a {{collection}} to provide him {{and his men}} with clothing and other supplies. Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast. At one point, while aboard HMS Mercury, she anchored off New York, where, among other visitors, the captain entertained William Tryon; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition, although it is likely the New York governor <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> In August 1776, Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax, owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship; due to food scarcity, both crew and prisoners were on short rations, and scurvy was rampant. By the end of October, Allen was again off New York, where the British, having secured the city, moved the prisoners on-shore, and, as he was considered an officer, gave Allen limited parole. With the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until August 1777. He then learned {{of the death of}} his young son Joseph due to smallpox.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of years, Webern wrote pieces which were freely atonal, much {{in the style of}} Schoenberg's early atonal works. Indeed, so in lockstep with Schoenberg was Webern for much of his artistic {{development}} that Schoenberg in 1951 wrote that he sometimes no longer <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> Webern had followed so well in his footsteps and shadow, occasionally outdoing or stepping ahead of Schoenberg in execution of Schoenberg's own or their shared ideas.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 24February 1932, when Puyi {{accepted}} the offer to be Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a party was thrown to celebrate with geishas being imported for the celebration, during which Itagaki become very drunk, and forgetting that the geisha are entertainers, not prostitutes, made outrageous sexual advances on the geisha, fondling their breasts and vaginas, telling Puyi that as a general he could do anything he wanted to the geisha. During the party, while Itagaki boasted to Puyi that now was {{a great time to}} be a Japanese man, Puyi was much offended when none of the geisha <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Vaughn said that, [...] "We {{wrote the}} script and the comic {{at the same time}} so it was a very sort of collaborative, organic process. I met [...] at the premiere of Stardust. We got on really well. I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> and what he had done but I didn't know him. He pitched me the idea. I said, 'That's great!' He then wrote a synopsis. I went, 'That's great, let's go do it now! You write the comic, I'll write the script. Jane Goldman one of the screenwriters, said that when she works with Vaughn she does the [...] "construction work" [...] and the [...] "interior designing" [...] while Vaughn acts as the [...] "architect." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, on {{the album}} Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commented on Big in a skit called [...] "Shark Niggas (Biters)." [...] Alleging that he copied the cover from Nas' {{landmark}} release Illmatic, as well as styles from other rap artists. This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with B.I.G., and in later interviews, both rappers would downplay the incident: [...] "It {{was one of them}} skits where we was looking at our competition. And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying, we kinda <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about, but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef. It's just sometimes, when you get in the booth and you start saying what you wanna say, it just happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} 13 finale [...] "Family First," [...] after {{learning}} of Ziva's {{death in the}} bombing of her Israel home caused by Trent Kort, the NCIS crew mourn her. Tony is then introduced to his almost two-year-old daughter, Tali. Conflicted, Tony asks Mossad Director Orli Elbaz about Ziva's motivations for not telling him about Tali. Orli tells him that she wanted to, especially as Tali grew but that she feared {{he would not be}} pleased, to which Tony tells her [...] "Then she never knew me at all." [...] Later in the episode, Tony finds a picture of him and Ziva in Paris, to which Tali points to each of them, saying [...] "Ima" [...] and [...] "Abba" [...] indicating that she <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> her father.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1954, at age 39, Smith {{was named}} {{manager of the}} Philadelphia Phillies, {{replacing}} Terry Moore. [...] Phillies general manager Roy Hamey made the announcement and introduced Smith {{at a press conference}} in the Warwick Hotel. [...] The Sporting News described the reaction to the Phillies' hiring of an unknown minor league manager:" [...] grabbed a microphone which was convenient and said, 'This is Mayo Smith, the new manager of the Phillies.' ... For at least one minute there was an embarrassing silence. Still no one <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> [...] To say that the gathering was surprised was the greatest understatement of the year. [...] Fifty men were speechless. [...] They had more or less expected a new manager, a Lefty O'Doul, a Lou Boudreau or a Skeeter Newsome. [...] But Mayo Smith ... who is he?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2015, Kevin Moore, {{one of the}} {{witnesses}} who filmed Gray's arrest, was arrested at gunpoint following what Moore described as [...] "harassment and intimidation" [...] by police. Moore stated he had cooperated with police, and gave over his video of Gray's arrest for investigation. He claimed, despite aiding in the investigation, his photo was made public by police, who asked the public to identify {{him because he was}} [...] "wanted for questioning." [...] Moore said the police obviously <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> when they posted his photo. Moore was released from custody the next day, but two other individuals who were arrested along with Moore remained in custody. The same day as Moore's arrest, medical examiners reported Gray sustained more injuries as a result of slamming into the inside of the transport van, [...] "apparently breaking his neck; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt {{in the back of the}} van".|$|E
2500|$|Sometime during August 2011, Parks was {{contacted}} by electronic musician Skrillex for orchestral arrangements. Parks elaborated in 2013, [...] "When Skrillex called me up, I'd {{never heard of}} him. I pretended I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> [...] "'Send me the piece, and if I feel able, I'll do it.' I don't have any hobbies, you know. I love music; I do it [...] And he said, 'Oh, thank you, Mr. Parks. We will destroy the world.' I said, 'Okay...' I Google him and there he is, on YouTube, in front of 30,000 people, pouring beer onto a laptop computer, {{at which point the}} crowd jumps into the mosh pit and has an erection.…I have two things I can do: Run away from all this in horror because I’m so superior, or dig in and serve and try to bring hope to the hopeless. That can be done behind the curtain, and that’s where I’m very comfortable working.…I treat every job {{as if it were the}} very thing that will define me. Nothing is beneath me. I think that is evident to people who ask my best." [...] His arranging work was released in December 2011 as the iTunes-exclusive bonus track [...] "Skrillex Orchestral Suite by Varien" [...] on the Bangarang EP.|$|E

2500|$|The police made a {{determined}} effort {{to hunt for}} the killer, now nicknamed [...] "Bible John", but although a number of suspects were questioned, no arrests were ever made, and no further victims {{have been attributed to}} him. The hunt for Bible John was Scotland's biggest manhunt. More than 100 detectives worked on the case and over 50,000 statements were taken in door-to-door enquiries. In order to track down the killer, fearing that he would strike again, a team of 16 detectives were instructed to mingle with dancers at the Barrowland and other ballrooms in the city. In particular they frequented the Barrowland on Thursday and Saturday nights for the over-25s nights, where each victim was said to have been charmed by the killer. Despite the huge manhunt, there were no further developments and the case went cold. Many felt that he had died, been jailed, was in a mental hospital or that the police <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> but could not prove anything, or that he was still at large killing. It was speculated that he moved away and was living in the south of England. It was known that serial killer Peter Tobin (see below) who lived in Glasgow in the late 1960s moved regularly between Scotland and the South of England, a crucial factor in allowing him to remain beyond the reaches of the police. He would then live in Brighton permanently for 20 years from the late 1960s.|$|E
