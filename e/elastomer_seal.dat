40|$|To {{successfully}} mate two pressurized vehicles or {{structures in}} space, advanced seals are required at the interface {{to prevent the}} loss of breathable air to the vacuum of space. A critical part of the development testing of candidate seal designs was a verification of {{the integrity of the}} retaining mechanism that holds the silicone seal component to the structure. Failure to retain the <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal</b> during flight could liberate seal material in the event of high adhesive loads during undocking. This work presents an investigation of the force required to separate the elastomer from its metal counter-face surface during simulated undocking as well as a comparison to that force which was necessary to destructively remove the elastomer from its retaining device. Two silicone elastomers, Wacker 007 - 49524 and Esterline ELASA- 401, were evaluated. During the course of the investigation, modifications were made to the retaining devices to determine if the modifications improved the force needed to destructively remove the seal. The tests were completed at the expected operating temperatures of - 50, + 23, and + 75 C. Under the conditions investigated, the comparison indicated that the adhesion between the elastomer and the metal counter-face was significantly less than the force needed to forcibly remove the <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal</b> from its retainer, and no failure would be expected...|$|E

40|$|The {{abrasive}} wear of unfilled and fiber-filled elastomers was studied both with experiments and with finite element simulations. Wear experiments with <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> exhibited two distinct regimes: an initial, "break-in" period {{followed by an}} "aggressive wear" period. During the break-in period, few abrasive particles are able to penetrate the seal's contact band, and no substantial seal wear occurs. During the aggressive wear period, abrasive particles aggregate into distinct clusters which advance at a linear rate and abrasively wear the <b>seal.</b> Filled <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> were shown to have break-in periods significantly longer than those of unfilled <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals.</b> The aggressive wear rates and mechanisms of filled and unfilled <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> were determined to be virtually identical. Abrasion patterns typical of the {{abrasive wear}} of elastomers were observed. Micromechanical modeling of the abrasive wear of unfilled elastomers predicted {{the formation of the}} observed abrasion patterns. Modeling of fiber-filled elastomers indicated that fibers should have no effect on the aggressive wear process. Additional modeling of fiber-filled elastomers suggested several mechanisms by which the fibers might extend the break-in period of the seal. Seal wear experiments with well-defined slurries offered strong evidence that the fibers extend the break-in period of the seal by inhibiting particle ingestion and cluster formation. A seal lip surface geometry is proposed to simulate the effect of the fibers. by Ethan M. Parsons. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 165 - 167). Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Elastomer seals {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} for containing gases and liquids. Seal failure can have significant environmental and financial implications far beyond {{the cost of the}} seal itself. Explosive decompression failure can cause catastrophic cracking of an <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal,</b> causing leakage. The objective of this research was to develop a modelling methodology to predict the onset of crack damage in elastomer seals under various operational conditions. The modelling methodology uses the finite element method to determine the performance of various elastomers under decompression conditions. The model takes into account seal and groove geometry, the non-linear behaviour of the material and the operational conditions seen by the seal. The model predicts crack initiations, locations and the orientation of the propagation. The model can also calculate the safe decompression time - required for no damage in the <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal</b> by using the methodology in reverse. To carry out the modelling methodology, certain input data are required. The data was determined by designing and constructing specialist test rigs. A permeation testing facility was developed to determine the diffusion, solubility and permeation characteristics of elastomers subject to gas pressure. The physical behaviour of the elastomers was determined through extensive uniaxial and equibiaxial tensile testing. The nature of the failure initiation points is determined by microscopic analysis of seal sections. Decompression tests were performed to validate the output of the model. Comparison of the model outputs with the decompression tests show a good correlation between the prediction and the occurrences, orientations and positions of cracks. The ability to predict damage in a quantitative manner was previously not available. The methodology will be developed into a knowledge-based software tool for use in industry to predict damage and develop new materials to resist explosive decompression...|$|E

40|$|Seals {{are used}} to {{facilitate}} the joining of two items, usually temporarily. At {{some point in the}} future, it is expected that the items will need to be separated. This innovation enables control of the adhesive properties of silicone-based elastomers. The innovation may also be effective on elastomers other than the silicone-based ones. A technique has been discovered that decreases the level of adhesion of silicone- based elastomers to negligible levels. The new technique causes less damage to the material compared to alternative adhesion mitigation techniques. Silicone-based elastomers are the only class of rubber-like materials that currently meet NASA s needs for various seal applications. However, silicone-based elastomers have natural inherent adhesive properties. This stickiness can be helpful, but it can frequently cause problems as well, such as when trying to get items apart. In the past, seal adhesion was not always adequately addressed, and has caused in-flight failures where seals were actually pulled from their grooves, preventing subsequent spacecraft docking until the seal was physically removed from the flange via an extravehicular activity (EVA).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Within pressurised Metered Dose Inhalers (pMDIs) the contact between the valve components and elastomeric seals is of major significance, representing the main contributory factor to the overall system frictional characteristics. Therefore, the seal performance is extremely important and must be optimised to meet the contradictory requirements of preventing leakage and allowing smooth actuation. The environmentally driven trend to HFA formulations as opposed to CFC based ones has deteriorated this problem due to poor lubrication conditions and it has, consequently, increased the frictional losses during the pMDI actuation (hysteresis cycle). Research has been conducted into the key areas of the inhaler mechanism. As such, the contact pressure distribution and resulting reactions have been investigated, with emphasis on the correct treatment of the <b>elastomer</b> (<b>seal)</b> characteristics. The modelling of the device has been conducted within {{the environment of the}} multibody dynamics commercial software ADAMS, where a virtual prototype has been built using solid CAD geometries of the valve components. An equation was extrapolated to describe the relation between the characteristics of the ultra thin film contact conditions (sliding velocity, surface geometry, film thickness and reaction force) encountered within the inhaler valve and integrated into the virtual prototype allowing the calculation of friction within the conjuncture (due to viscous shear and adhesion). The latter allowed the analysis and optimisation of key device parameters, such as seal geometry, lubricant properties etc. It has been concluded that the dominant mechanism of friction is adhesion, while boundary lubrication is the prevailing lubrication regime due to the poor surface roughness to film thickness ratio. The multibody dynamics model represents a novel multi physics approach to study the behaviour of pMDIs, including rigid body inertial dynamics, general elasticity, surface interactions (such as adhesion), hydrodynamics and intermolecular surface interactions (such as Van der Waals forces).

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is {{developing}} a Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) for future exploration missions. The mechanism is a new state-of-the-art device for in-space assembly of structures and rendezvous of vehicles. At the interface between two pressurized modules, each with {{a version of the}} LIDS attached, a composite elastomer-metal seal assembly prevents the breathable air from escaping into the vacuum of space. Attached to the active LIDS, this seal mates against the passive LIDS during docking operation. The main interface seal assembly must exhibit low leak and outgas values, must be able to withstand various harsh space environments, must remain operational over a range of temperatures from - 50 C to 75 C, and perform after numerous docking cycles. This paper presents results from a comprehensive study of the mechanical performance of four candidate subscale seal assembly designs at - 50, 23, 50, and 75 C test temperatures. In particular, the force required to fully compress the seal during docking, and that which is required for separation during the undocking operation were measured. The height of subscale main interface seal bulbs, as well as the test temperature, were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the forces the main interface seal of the LIDS may experience during docking and undocking operations. The average force values required to fully compress each of the seal assemblies were shown to increase with test temperature by approximately 50 % from - 50 to 75 C. Also, the required compression forces were shown to increase as the height of the seal bulb was increased. The seal design with the tallest <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal</b> bulb, which was 31 % taller than that with the shortest bulb, required force values approximately 45 % higher than those for the shortest bulb, independent of the test temperature. The force required to separate the seal was shown to increase with decreasing temperature after 15 hours of simulated docking. No adhesion force was observed at 75 C, while magnitudes of up to 235 lbf were recorded at the refrigerated temperature. In addition, the adhesion force was observed to increase with bulb height. When compared with the LIDS program requirements, the measured compression force values were found to be below the maximum allowable load allotted to the main interface seal. However, the measured adhesion force values at the refrigerated test temperature were found to exceed the program limits...|$|E
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{hydrocarbons}} increases, the oil companies are forced to start {{oil and gas exploration}} in complicated and remote fields. When drilling such environment, the requirement for safety, reliability and operational efficiency of down hole tools is vital. An evaluation of different drill pipe convoyed seal plugs is performed with respect to plug features, benefits,operational procedure and limitations. A comparison based on the different plug design and a review of applications for such plugs is made. Design requirements stated in ISO 14310 :Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries, Downhole Equipment, Packers and Bridge Plugs, is presented and related challenges and technology gaps discussed. An investigation of plug failure and reason for failure between January 2009 and March 2010 is carried out. Normally, down hole seal plugs uses an elastomeric sealing element to provide the seal against the casing wall. The plugs are rated to different temperatures and pressures due to the variation {{in the design of the}} elastomeric sealing element. When operating with elastomers, proper material selection is important to construct a wide performance envelop of the seal,making the seal more flexible with respect to working area. A possible new technology for down hole sealing application is metal-to-metal sealing. Metal-to-metal sealing shows superior seal reliability compared conventional a resilient <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal</b> with respect to pressure and temperature rating. This technology may become the new solution to provide a seal with ahigh integrity level in extreme well environments. This technology is new, and does not meet the requirements stated in ISO 14310. V 0 qualication is required for casing plugs acting as a secondary well barrier used by Statoil. The survey of application utilizing drill pipe convoyed seal plugs shows the most common application for casing suspensions plugs is to act as a secondary well barrier and to provide a gas tight seal for temporary abandonment of the wellbore when pulling the blow out preventer and the marine drilling riser. The present plugs used by Statoil shows good reliability and are efficient in use. However,limitations are seen when operating in extreme wells with difficult well trajectories. An improvement in design on plugs to be used in such wells is to make the plug able to be set and retrieved without rotation, making control of the applied forces on the plug more easily. The investigation of plug failure shows a decrease in failure trend after the implementation of ISO 14310 in 2005. In the time period investigated, a total of 350 plug runs where performed with a recorded failure rate of 9 %. The main reason of failure in this period is pressure test failure of the plug, making up 57 % of the reason of failure. Before the ISO 14310 become operative the main area of failure was when latching on the running/retrieving tool to the plug. </p...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringAn {{increased}} {{frequency of}} minor gas leakages from seals in the wellhead (WH) area {{have been detected}} and recently given an increased focus among companies on the Norwegian continental shelf. Among others have Statoil and Shell reported concerns regarding this problem and are working simultaneously to identify and solve the problem. There is however uncertainties in the industry related to how the problem regarding leakages in the WH can be solved, how critical the leakages actually are, the extend of the problem, and whether test of the seals actually can trigger a leakage itself or not. Questions regarding whether the seals should be tested on a general basis and regarding specific maintenance plans for the seals have been raised. It {{has not been a}} common practice over the last years to test the seals in the WH after installation. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the extent of this problem as very limited test data exist. In addition, integrity issues in connection to the small cavities in the WH do often show unambiguous test results. Three case studies of three wells at the Oseberg East installation (Statoil) will be presented in this thesis. The case studies have been carried out {{with the use of the}} exclusion methods, analysis of pressure and trends, tests results, and simulations of hypothetic scenarios. The main discoveries follow below: It is indicated that the leakages in the seal assemblies in the WH are caused by: •	Design capabilities exceeded in operation •	Unsuccessful conversion of producers with an inactive A-annulus to producers with gas lift. •	Dirt and residual hydraulic oil from installation. •	Problems related to vibration •	Pressure tests of the DHSV •	Faulty design of WH A review of the barriers on the wells concludes that the wells have in the first place two independent barriers that are possible to test. An additional third barrier gives increased safety against leakages to the atmosphere if seals fail. It is not possible to test the seal in the third barrier without introducing a risk to damage a unidirectional seal in the secondary barrier. It is considered that the frequency of the leakages to the atmosphere is expected to increase with time. It is in particular expected that the total number of leakages will increase through the test ports. The consequences of these leakage rates are considered to be negligible compared with the rates of leakages that are considered to give high risk of explosion and/or fire. The leakages might however be of significant enough size to be detected by the gas-detector and thereby cause the production at the installation to be shut down. The test ports should be monitored and an increased focus on maintenance should be initiated. With these initiatives, leaks to the environment are considered to represent a negligible risk. It is a severe escalation of the leakage to cavities in the wellhead, if the consequence is that the unidirectional seal in the secondary barrier becomes weakened. This danger is reduced by being able to monitor the pressure between the <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal</b> and the unidirectional seal. Examples of recommended compensating measures that will be discussed are: •	Pressure monitoring •	Use of foam around test plugs •	Use of chemical sealant •	Evaluate injection of nitrogen to cavities It is recommended to bleed of pressure in the WH cavities before performing test on DHSV or commencement of other well activities. New recommended accept criteria’s in the WH follows: •	Operate the well with a 35 bar limit in the cavities •	AC. for leakages : o	 35 bar/ 24 hr for internal leakages o	 0, 1 kg/s for leakages to the atmosphere The case studies that have been carried out are related to gas lift wells. There is however indication that minor gas leakages in the WH might exist on other types of wells as well...|$|E

Though swell packers can significantly reduce costs and increase productivity, their failure can lead to serious losses. The integrity and reliability of swelling <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> under different field conditions is a major concern. The investigation of changes in material behavior over a specified swelling period is a necessary first step for performance evaluation of <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals.</b> The current study is based on experimental analysis of changes in geometric and mechanical behavior (hardness, tensile, compressive, bulk) of an elastomeric material due to swelling.

Elastomer compounds impacted include Parker's S 0383 - 70 and Esterline's ELA-SA- 401 in the as received condition, or after an atomic oxygen treatment. Bare, anodized and nickel coated aluminum targets were tested simulating the candidate mating seal surface materials. After impact, seals and aluminum plates were leak tested: damaged seals were tested against an undamaged aluminum plate; and undamaged seals were placed at various locations over craters in aluminum plates. It has been shown that silicone <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> can withstand an impressive level of damage before leaking beyond allowable limits. In general on the tests performed to date, the diameter of the crater in either the elastomer, or the aluminum, must be at least as big as 80 % to 90 % of width of the bulb of the seal before significant leakage occurs...|$|R

Examples include: (1) self-repairing <b>elastomers</b> for <b>sealing</b> gaskets and dampers inspired by self-healing processes in latex bearing plants, (2) self-adaptive biomimetic attachment systems inspired by permanent attachment organs of plants, (3) adaptive biomimetic antiadhesion surfaces inspired by leaf surfaces, and (4) (self-) adaptive elastic façade shading systems inspired by the bird of paradise flower...|$|R
5000|$|The seals are {{considered}} / designed as per the cylinder working pressure, cylinder speed, operating temperature, working medium and application.Piston seals are dynamic seals, {{and they can}} be single acting or double acting. Generally speaking, <b>Elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> made from nitrile rubber, Polyurethane or other materials are best in lower temperature environments, while seals made of Fluorocarbon Viton are better for higher temperatures. Metallic seals are also available and commonly use cast iron for the seal material.Rod seals are dynamic seals and generally are single acting. The compounds of rod seals are nitrile rubber, Polyurethane, or Fluorocarbon Viton.Wipers / scrapers are used to eliminate contaminants such as moisture, dirt, and dust, which can cause extensive damage to cylinder walls, rods, seals and other components. The common compound for wipers is polyurethane. Metallic scrapers are used for sub zero temperature applications, and applications where foreign materials can deposit on the rod.The bearing elements / wear bands are used to eliminate metal to metal contact. The wear bands are designed as per the side load requirements. The primary compounds used for wear bands are filled PTFE, woven fabric reinforced polyester resin and bronze ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{conducted}} experiments {{to determine the}} equilibration rates of some major precipitants used in protein crystallography aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The solutions {{were placed in the}} Protein Crystallization Apparatus for Microgravity (PCAM) which mimic Cryschem sitting drop trays. The trays were placed in cylinders. These cylinders were placed inside a Single locker Thermal Enclosure System (STES), and were activated for different durations during the flight. Bumpers pressed against <b>elastomers</b> <b>seal</b> drops in a deactivated state during pre-flight and prior to transfer to the ISS. Activation occurs while in flight on the ISS by releasing the bumpers allowing the drops to be exposed to the reservoir. PCAM was flown to the ISS on STS 100, Flight 6 A, on April 19, 2001. Six series of equilibration experiments were tested for each precipitant {{with a small amount of}} Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Cylinder 10 was never activated, 7 was activated for 40 days, 8 was activated for 20 days, 9 was activated for 10 days, 11 was activated for 4 days and 12 was activated for 2 days. Upon the return to Earth by STS 104 on July 24, 2001 the samples were transferred to Marshall Space Flight Center. The samples were then brought to the lab and the volumes of each sample were measured...|$|R
