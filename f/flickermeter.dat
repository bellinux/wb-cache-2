40|$|<b>Flickermeter</b> is {{a common}} name for a system that {{measures}} the obnoxiousness of flicker caused by voltage fluctuations. The output of <b>flickermeter</b> is a value of short-term flicker severity indicator,. This paper {{presents the results of}} the numerical simulations that reconstruct the processing of <b>flickermeter</b> in frequency domain. With the use of standard test signals, the characteristics of <b>flickermeter</b> were determined for the case of amplitude modulation of input signal, frequency modulation of input signal, and for input signal with interharmonic component. For the needs of simulative research, elements of standard IEC <b>flickermeter</b> signal chain as well as test signal source and tools for acquisition, archiving, and presentation of the obtained results were modeled. The results were presented with a set of charts, and the specific fragments of the charts were pointed out and commented on. Some examples of the influence of input signal’s bandwidth limitation on the <b>flickermeter</b> measurement result were presented for the case of AM and FM modulation. In addition, the diagrams that enable the evaluation of flickermeter’s linearity were also presented...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{more and}} more lamp types are being used. Since {{different}} lamp types have different working principles, they also have different flicker responses. This paper shows the measurement results of different flicker responses for various types of lamps. These results prove that the UIE/IEC <b>flickermeter,</b> which has been used widely {{around the world for}} many years, cannot be used to advise on the flicker level of all lamp types. This is {{because of the fact that}} this <b>flickermeter</b> is based on a 230 V, 60 W or 120 V, 60 W incandescent lamp and can be used as reference only for this type of lamp or as reference to the standard. The UIE/IEC (International Union for Electricity Applications/International Electrotechnical Committee) <b>flickermeter</b> and the existing standards are therefore insufficient for other lamp types.

40|$|The {{response}} of the human eye to flicker depends {{on the type of}} lamp used. Standard <b>flickermeters</b> measure the voltage across the lamp and assumes a 60 -W incandescent lamp as a light source. When a different lamp is the light flicker source, standard <b>flickermeters</b> give erroneous results. This paper presents a dynamic model of the eye-brain response to flicker. The model is based on the analysis of the light emitted by the lamp. A suitable measurement system has been developed, and three different kinds of lamps have been considered. Experimental results show how the emitted light spectra and the human eye response to different colors combined to determine the level of annoyance. The uncertainty affecting such results, which arises from the hardware of the developed system, has been also estimated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{estimate}} the flicker severity index using the Hadamard transform. A weighting filter in the sequency domain is utilized for direct computation of the flicker index. The proposed method is compared with a flicker meter in the frequency domain that uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It is seen by numerical simulations that the proposed method yields flicker severity indices within the stipulated range for six test signals prescribed by the IEC. The computational simplicity of the Hadamard transform may be potentially useful in hardware realizations of digital <b>flickermeters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) {{have emerged}} as cost-competitive, energy {{efficient}} direct replacements of the conventional incandescent lamp. However, little regard {{has been given to}} their widescale adoption in terms of the electrical network and power quality. Discrepancies have emerged over the CFLs light flicker sensitivity to voltage fluctuations and concerns at the level of harmonics they generate. This thesis develops an objective measurement method for light flicker, overcoming the limitations of the existing IEC <b>flickermeter</b> standard and develops models using the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) framework and Harmonic Domain (HD) for harmonic studies. The new light <b>flickermeter</b> proposed, measures light directly to quantify flicker, thereby removing the dependency of the incandescent lamp modelled in the current <b>flickermeter</b> standard, IEC 61000. 4. 15. The light <b>flickermeter</b> methodology resembles the same functional blocks of the IEC <b>Flickermeter</b> to produce equivalent perceptibility levels. This allows for the direct comparison of the two procedures. The Light <b>flickermeter</b> along side the IEC voltage flicker are implemented in the experimental system and fully calibrated to the newly proposed CCU 2 /CIGRE <b>flickermeter</b> test protocol. The sensitivity of CFLs to common voltage fluctuations are investigated and the light <b>flickermeter</b> is utilised in the design of a new LED fluorescent tube replacement lamp. A linearised Harmonic State-Space (HSS) framework is developed for the modelling of non-linear devices. The methodology includes basic Kirchhoffs voltage and current laws to realise a control block diagram approach to a device’s operation. The HSS is centred around linear time periodic (LTP) systems and the use of harmonic transfer functions to model the switching behaviour (including Switching Instant Variation (SIV)) of converters. Importantly the models are suitable for both transient and steady state simulation. An example of a simplified CFL circuit is presented. An automated sequential harmonic injection technique is developed for the experimental derivation of linearised harmonic admittance matrices of non-linear loads. This technique eliminates the traditional analytical based HD or HSS methods and creates a harmonic domain based model from the actual device. Models are presented for a number of consumer lamps. Detailed validation of these models are achieved under multi-frequency terminal conditions and through the illustration of self distortion by the system impedance. This research paves the way in better understanding, management and coordination of flicker levels in electrical networks. The Light <b>flickermeter</b> apparatus provides a calibrated method for assessing light flicker sensitivity for both current and emerging technologies. The harmonic modelling methods are focussed towards lower powered devices and suited for studying their large scale use...|$|E
40|$|It can be shown, {{that many}} flickermeters do not yield {{credible}} output readings although the manufacturers declare their {{compliance with the}} requirements of standard IEC 61000 - 4 - 15. Modifications or revisions to the standard and increasing the number of requirements, what is currently taking place, seem to be interim actions, whose results are dubious. On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that since over ten years the standardization of voltage fluctuations is based on the UIE <b>flickermeter.</b> The authors ’ idea is to treat a <b>flickermeter</b> – from its analogue input to the output of block 4 – as a black box, filled in by a designer accordingly to its decision, while maintaining the IN/OUT characteristics in conformity with those of the <b>flickermeter</b> regarded as a standard one...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − The {{monitoring}} of power quality (PQ) on supply networks is today {{an issue of}} worldwide interest. In this field, {{one of the most}} important parameter is the flicker effect, a phenomenon due to luminance fluctuations of the lighting caused by voltage variations. The IEC standardized the implementation of a <b>flickermeter,</b> to supply information about the human reaction to the voltage amplitude modulation [1, 2]. Starting from a different flicker measurement approach proposed by the authors [3], in this paper a low-cost smart flicker sensor has been designed and applied. The proposed sensor can transmit data over a TCP-IP network, in order to allow for a remote {{monitoring of}} power quality.

40|$|The {{international}} standard EN 61000 - 4 - 15 gives functional and design specifications for the <b>Flickermeter</b> currently {{used to evaluate}} the flicker severity, as defined in the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary. That instrument doesn't work properly if light sources different than incandescent-filament one are considered. This paper is aimed at presenting a step towards an innovative <b>Flickermeter</b> which is able to account a larger variety of luminous sources. In particular, the goal {{of this study is to}} find a new method to define the human annoyance under flicker condition, based on the measurement of the pupil size in presence of different flicker stimuli. The design and characterization of an automatic system able to generate flicker and measure the pupil size will be presented. In addition, the results obtained on human subject will be illustrated...|$|E
30|$|More specifically, PQ {{algorithms}} {{have been}} investigated. McGranaghan and Santoso in [10] presented {{a summary of}} the problems encountered during both offline and online analyses of PQ algorithms. In [11], a discrete model of the IEC 61000 - 4 - 15 <b>flickermeter</b> was presented. The full discrete <b>flickermeter</b> channel, developed as Simulink diagram, is shown, however the aim of this model is only simulation, and hence the implementation path is not considered. An implementation method for a Simulink algorithm that conforms the IEEE 1459 - 2000 standard for measurement of electric power quantities is presented in [12]. The MATLAB xPC Target toolbox was used to run the code generated automatically from the Simulink diagram on a PC computer. The methods defined by the IEC 61000 - 4 - 30 standard were investigated in [13]. The modelling and analysis of the algorithms were carried out in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. The algorithms were then automatically executed on a dSPACE DS 1104 board.|$|E
30|$|The MATLAB/Simulink package {{provides}} toolboxes and blocksets {{for both}} digital and analogue system design and analysis. Therefore, {{implementation of the}} <b>flickermeter</b> in MATLAB/Simulink follows the development stages of the rapid development method. The basic structure of the Simulink diagram that implements the signal processing stages is shown in Figure  7 (b). Note that the model closely resembles the description in the standard. Each filter defined by spectral properties is defined in the z domain by means of standard tools available in the MATLAB/Simulink package. The weighting filter requires special procedures. In [11], the transfer functions of the filters were obtained analytically by defining the filter in the s domain and next using a Bilinear Transform to obtain the transfer function in the z domain. This procedure does not match the rapid implementation approach. Filter parameters in the <b>flickermeter</b> blocks are strictly defined in the standard, but their selection depends on the voltage level. On the other hand, there are several discretisation methods and the choice can affect {{the properties of the}} <b>flickermeter.</b> The discretisation also depends on sample time, which is related to the hardware platform, and therefore can be unspecified at modelling time. Consequently, the best option is to discretise the filter numerically and let the software perform all necessary computations. The MATLAB/Simulink package supports this operation by providing commands for the immediate discretisation of transfer functions. This functionality is used to obtain a fully automatic discretisation of the weighting filter. Therefore, the filter is defined in the s domain and then numerically discretised using MATLAB commands.|$|E

30|$|Finally, it is {{worthwhile}} to note that from the implementation {{point of view on}} a general PQ instrument, the proposed analytical approach requires only some manipulations, of different complexities depending on the level of approximation desired (see (20), (21) and (22)), of the spectra which are already evaluated by the PQ instrument for the harmonic and interharmonic analysis. On the other hand, the digital signal processing of the conventional IEC <b>flickermeter</b> requires the implementation of blocks 1 to 4 independently from the spectral analysis.|$|E

40|$|Power and voltage {{generated}} by a wind turbine are more variable than that produced by conventional generators. Therefore, with the increasing penetration of wind energy into the grid, {{it is very important}} to simulate precisely the wind turbine/grid interaction to evaluate voltage fluctuation and other power quality aspects. In this paper, the wind turbine instantaneously generated power and voltage at the point of common connection (PCC) with grid are simulated by considering all the aerodynamical and mechanical effects, which could affect them. The inherent effect of the wind speed on the entire blade swept area is simulated in the model of the wind speed. This model takes into account the effects of tower shadow and the rotational sampling of turbulence. The generated power is obtained by the simulation of the wind speed time series into a wind turbine model. The proposed wind turbine model includes detailed sub-models of aerodynamic rotor, drive train and ac generator. A dq arbitrary reference frame is used for modeling of asynchronous generator. The flux variations in the stator circuit are involved. The <b>flickermeter</b> model which expresses voltage fluctuations is simulated according to the IEC standard 61000 - 4 - 15. The wind speed, wind turbine and <b>flickermeter</b> models are simulated in Matlab/Simulink software. Both of grid and site parameters, which affect voltage fluctuation, are investigated.

There are numerous factors that affect flicker and harmonic emission of grid-connected wind turbines during continuous operation, such as wind characteristics (e. g. mean wind speed, turbulence intensity), type of generator and grid conditions (e. g. short circuit capacity, grid impedance angle).
