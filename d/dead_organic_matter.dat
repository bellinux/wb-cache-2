5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found in rows, growing from plant detritus. The species favours bracken, especially Pteridium aquilinum, but the colonisation of dead matter from other plants is not unknown. Upon these substrates, it feeds as a saprotroph, {{breaking down the}} <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in order to sustain itself. The species has been recorded in Europe and northern Africa. In Europe, the fruit bodies can be encountered from April to December.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{saprobic}} fungus, Cyathus olla obtains {{nutrients from}} {{the breakdown of}} <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> and as such is usually found growing on woody debris; specimens found growing on soil are usually attached to bits of wood or stems present in the soil. Brodie notes that this species usually grows in moist and shaded locations, although its discovery in the arid regions of Lima, Peru, {{suggest that it is}} tolerant of low-moisture conditions. It is the most abundant species of Cyathus found in Europe, and is also common in North America. Its range extends north to Sweden and far south in South America; it has also been reported in Australia, South Africa, Iran, and India.|$|E
30|$|Generally, macrofungi are {{regarded}} as important bioresource because of their diverse ecological, nutritional, health and medicinal benefits (Odeyemi et al. 2014). They are decomposers of <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> especially those containing lignin and cellulose, and also aid nutrient recycling in the environment (Nilsson et al. 2011). In addition, they are rich in protein, crude fibre, vitamins and minerals, and possess medicinal benefits including anticholesterol, antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, antineoplastic, antimutagenic, antioxidant, antilipidemic, antidiabetic antihyperglycaemic, antihypotensive, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory hepatoprotective, hypocholesterolemic, immunodulatory and anti-ageing properties (Borchers et al. 2008; Rathee et al. 2011; Patel et al. 2012; Duru and Çayan 2015).|$|R
50|$|An organism, {{especially}} a fungus or bacterium, that derives its nourishment from <b>dead</b> or decaying <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is also called saprobe.|$|R
50|$|Conocoryphe is a genus of {{primarily}} eyeless trilobites {{belonging to}} the family Conocoryphidae. They lived during the Middle Cambrian period, about 505 million years ago. These arthropods lived on the sea bottom (epifaunal) and lived off <b>dead</b> particulate <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (a lifestyle called detritivorous).|$|R
5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E
25|$|The cup fungus, for instance, can {{be found}} in the Caribou. As the {{sanitary}} agents of the forest that consume <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> fungi spread on the floor of a conifer area. Fungal spores blow in on the winds and take up residence at the foot of trees. One type, called the king bolete, is the edible mushroom most sought. Not all fungi have a symbiotic relationship with the trees, some fungi are parasitic, causing heartwood rot.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of nutrients {{taken in by}} such organisms {{must be able to}} provide carbon, proteins, vitamins and in some cases, ions. Due to the carbon composition of the {{majority of}} organisms, <b>dead</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> provide rich sources of disaccharides and polysaccharides such as maltose and starch, and of the monosaccharide glucose.|$|R
500|$|Like other Agaricus species, A.deserticola is saprobic—feeding off <b>dead</b> or {{decaying}} <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The fruit {{bodies are}} found growing singly to sometimes more numerous, at low elevations, and typically in sandy soil.|$|R
500|$|All {{species of}} Phallus {{are known to}} be saprobic, feeding off <b>dead</b> and {{decaying}} <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> P.calongei is known only from the type locality in Pakistan, where it was found growing on the ground at [...] above sea level.|$|R
25|$|Acarines are {{extremely}} diverse. They live in practically every habitat, and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other arthropods {{in the soil}} organic matter and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predatory and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others are detritivores that help to break down forest litter and <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> such as skin cells. Others still are plant feeders and may damage crops.|$|E
25|$|Predation is a {{biological}} interaction where a predator (a heterotroph that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators {{may or may}} not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey. The other main category of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse. Selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations.|$|E
25|$|Forests can be carbon stores, {{and they}} are carbon dioxide sinks when they are {{increasing}} in density or area. In Canada's boreal forests as much as 80% of the total carbon is stored in the soils as <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> A 40-year study of African, Asian, and South American tropical forests by the University of Leeds, shows tropical forests absorb about 18% of all carbon dioxide added by fossil fuels. Truly mature tropical forests, by definition, grow rapidly as each tree produces at least 10 new trees each year. Based on studies of the FAO and UNEP {{it has been estimated}} that Asian forests absorb about 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare each year. The global cooling effect of carbon sequestration by forests is partially counterbalanced in that reforestation can decrease the reflection of sunlight (albedo). Mid-to-high latitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground, thus contributing to warming. Modeling that compares the effects of albedo differences between forests and grasslands suggests that expanding the land area of forests in temperate zones offers only a temporary cooling benefit.|$|E
40|$|Models of detritus-based {{ecosystems}} with delay {{have received}} {{a great deal of}} attention for the last few decades. This paper deals with the dynamical analysis of a nonlinear model of a detritus-based ecosystem involving detritivores and predator of detritivores. We have obtained the criteria for local stability of various equilibrium points and persistence of the model system. Next, we have introduced discrete time delay due to recycling of <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> and gestation of nutrients to the growth equations of various trophic levels. With delay differential equation model system we have studied the effect of time delay on the stability behaviour. Next, we have obtained an estimate for the length of time delay to preserve the stability of the model system. Finally, the existence of Hopf-bifurcating small amplitude periodic solutions is derived by considering time delay as a bifurcation parameter. Copyright © 2006 Hindawi Publishing Corporation.

50|$|Soils supply {{plants with}} nutrients, {{most of which}} are held in place by {{particles}} of clay and <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (colloids) The nutrients may be adsorbed on clay mineral surfaces, bound within clay minerals (absorbed), or bound within organic compounds as part of the living organisms or <b>dead</b> soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> These bound nutrients interact with soil water to buffer the soil solution composition (attenuate changes in the soil solution) as soils wet up or dry out, as plants take up nutrients, as salts are leached, or as acids or alkalis are added.|$|R
40|$|Thatch is a {{layer of}} <b>dead</b> and {{decaying}} <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> between the soil surface and {{the base of the}} turfgrass plant. Under ideal conditions, soil microorganisms break down this <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> before it has a chance to accumulate and form a thatch layer. Thatch accumulation occurs when plant production exceeds breakdown. Excessive thatch accumulation has negative consequences that can affect the turf and soil environment...|$|R

They outnumber other arthropods {{in the soil}} organic matter and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predaceous and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others are detritivores that help to break down forest litter and <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> such as skin cells. Others still are plant feeders and may damage crops. Damage to crops {{is perhaps the most}} costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives (Tetranychoidea), earth mites (Penthaleidae), thread-footed mites (Tarsonemidae) and the gall and rust mites (Eriophyoidea). Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsial pox. A well-known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by the respiratory disease. The use of predatory mites (e.g. Phytoseiidae) in pest control and herbivorous mites that attack weeds is also important. An unquantified, but major positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem.|$|E
500|$|Creatures {{living at}} the ocean surface have the same [...] ratios as the water they live in, {{and as a result}} of the reduced / ratio, the {{radiocarbon}} age of marine life is typically about 440 years. Organisms on land are in closer equilibrium with the atmosphere and have the same / ratio as the atmosphere. These organisms contain about 1.3% of the carbon in the reservoir; sea organisms have a mass of less than 1% of those on land and are not shown on the diagram. Accumulated <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> of both plants and animals, exceeds the mass of the biosphere by a factor of nearly 3, and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment, it has a / ratio lower than that of the biosphere.|$|E
500|$|Crucibulum is a genus in the Nidulariaceae, {{a family}} of fungi whose fruiting bodies {{resemble}} tiny egg-filled bird's nests. Often called [...] "splash cups", the fruiting bodies are adapted for spore dispersal by using the kinetic energy of falling drops of rain. The [...] "eggs" [...] inside the bird's nests (technically known as peridioles) are hard waxy shells containing spores, and tend to stick to whatever nearby [...] they land on, thus increasing the odds of being consumed and dispersed by herbivorous animals. Members of this genus are saprobic, obtaining nutrients from <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> and are typically found growing on decayed wood and wood debris. The three known Crucibulum species (C.laeve, C.parvulum, and C.cyathiforme) are distinguished from other genera of the Nidulariaceae by their relatively simple funiculus – a cord of hyphae that connects the peridiole (the [...] "eggs") to {{the exterior of the}} bird's nest.|$|E

2500|$|Although molds {{can grow}} on <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> {{everywhere}} in nature, their presence is {{visible to the}} unaided eye only when they form large colonies. A mold colony does not consist of discrete organisms but is an interconnected network of hyphae called a mycelium. [...] All growth occurs at hyphal tips, with cytoplasm and organelles flowing forwards as the hyphae advance over or through new food sources. Nutrients are absorbed at the hyphal tip. In artificial environments such as buildings, humidity and temperature are often stable enough to foster the growth of mold colonies, commonly seen as a downy or furry coating growing on food or other surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|Cystodermella cinnabarina {{is found}} fruiting in {{coniferous}} and deciduous forests, on ground among moss, grass and litter. Being a saprotrophic fungus, it decays <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> It {{has been recorded}} under pine (Pinus nigra, Pinus pinea), oak, spruce (Picea orientalis), fir (Abies cephalonica) and chestnut (Castanea sativa) in Greece and Turkey. Fruiting bodies appear solitary or in small groups, {{during the summer and}} autumn. It is widely distributed around the world on continents including Asia, Africa, Europe and North America, though in many places it is uncommon. The preliminary red data list of threatened British fungi lists Cystodermella cinnabarinum under the IUCN [...] "Near Threatened" [...] status.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{microbes}} are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using {{organic compounds}} as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as commensals or parasites) or find in <b>dead</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of all kind (saprophages). Microbial metabolism {{is the main}} contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many eukaryotic microorganisms are heterotrophic by predation or parasitism, properties also found in some bacteria such as Bdellovibrio (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as Myxococcus (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most pathogenic bacteria {{can be viewed as}} heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic polymers such as cellulose, chitin or lignin which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide (mineralization) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes. [...] There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products. [...] Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in bioremediation.|$|E
50|$|Colus hirudinosus is saprobic, {{meaning that}} it obtains {{nutrients}} by decomposing <b>dead</b> or decaying <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Fruit bodies grow in manured soil, in sand, or often among Cistus litter.
