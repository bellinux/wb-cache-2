In particular, any investment in capital goods by importers that cost more than USD500,000 needed a formal American review before approval. Nhu also publicly criticized the review policy on several occasions, citing several private infrastructure investments that were blocked by American administrators.

5|$|Malaysia's {{unprecedented}} {{and recent}} rapid development has attracted millions of migrant workers from across Asia {{in the recent}} years. The majority of whom are undocumented, which the Malaysian government is struggling to combat. Its treatment and crackdown on migrant workers has often been criticised by international human rights watchdogs. Today, Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, ranked 4th largest in Southeast Asia and 38th largest in the world. With a GDP per capita of $9,766 and an HDI of 0.78 currently, Malaysia is classified as an <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> by the World Bank. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also classifies Malaysia as an emerging and developing country. It is {{a founding member of}} the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the East Asia Summit, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Malaysia is also a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Non-Aligned Movement. In 2017, Malaysian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 164 countries and territories, ranking the Malaysian passport 5th most powerful in the world.|$|E

500|$|Hamilton {{has been}} portrayed as the [...] "patron saint" [...] of the American School of {{economic}} philosophy that, {{according to one}} historian, dominated economic policy after 1861. He firmly supported government intervention in favor of business, after the manner of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, {{as early as the}} fall of 1781. Hamilton opposed the British ideas of free trade, which he believed skewed benefits to colonial and imperial powers, in favor of protectionism, which he believed would help develop the fledgling nation's <b>emerging</b> <b>economy.</b> Henry C. Carey was inspired by his writings. Hamilton influenced the ideas and work of the German Friedrich List. In Hamilton's view, a strong executive, linked to the support of the people, could become the linchpin of an administrative republic. The dominance of executive leadership in the formulation and carrying out of policy was essential to resist the deterioration of republican government. Ian Patrick Austin has explored the similarities between Hamiltonian recommendations and the development of Meiji Japan after 1860.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In recent years, most <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> have {{experienced}} large {{foreign direct investment}} inflows to the real estate sector (FDIRE) and increases in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions.

40|$|During {{the crises}} of the 1990 s, <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> usually lacked the policy tools {{to deal with}} {{external}} shocks that were available to advanced economies. Worldwide turbulent episodes found most <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> unable to perform countercyclical policies and, in many cases, their own vulnerabilities and poor institutional frameworks amplified negative external shocks leading to sharper recessions. This paper shows that the 2008 - 2009 global financial crisis represents a structural break in the way <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> conduct their policies, with more countercyclical policies pursued {{before and during the}} global crisis. Moreover, breaking with the past, <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> did not fall more than developed economies during the global financial crisis, thus becoming more similar to developed economies. The resilience of <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> during the 2008 - 2009 crisis might be partly attributed to a combination of sounder macroeconomic and financial policy frameworks with a shift towards safer domestic and international financial stances.

Design/methodology/approach - The findings reported in the paper are based on desk research and review of the papers contained in the volume. Findings - The paper finds that the adoption of appropriate corporate governance systems is becoming a central issue in less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> Factors such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the adoption of international donor led reforms, and the globalisation of capital markets are among the factors that are driving corporate governance reforms in less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> Research limitations/implications - The pressure from international donors has compelled some less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> to adopt corporate governance models developed in the West with no modification. The paper argues that while it is imperative for less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> to reform their corporate governance systems, {{it is important that}} these systems are adapted to suite the specific needs of individual countries. Originality/value of paper - The paper is a summary of studies exploring various corporate governance issues in less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> The issues addressed in these studies are important to understand corporate governance issues in both the private and public sectors in less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> © 2008 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
