5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its <b>food</b> <b>resources.</b> Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit <b>food</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> at stopover points along the migration route.

30|$|Bee is {{a typical}} kind of social animal. They fully exploit {{individual}} intelligence to improve the efficiency and effect of the overall work greatly. In nature, this kind of animal, {{no matter where they}} are, can always find the best honey resource. In the process of gathering honey, three kinds of bees are involved: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. When an employed bee finds a <b>food</b> <b>resource,</b> it will go back to the beehive with the information of that <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> and lead other onlooker bees to that place. Then onlooker bees will begin to search potential better <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> around that <b>food</b> <b>resource.</b> Scout bees are responsible for finding potential new <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> in the whole searching space. Based on this model, Karaboga came up with a new meta-heuristic search algorithm [16], i.e., the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Individual-level health {{outcomes}} {{are shaped by}} environmental risk conditions. Norms figure prominently in socio-behavioural theories yet spatial variations in health-related norms have rarely been investigated as environmental risk conditions. This study assessed: 1) the contributions of local descriptive norms for overweight/obesity and dietary behaviour to 10 -year change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), accounting for <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability; and 2) whether associations between local descriptive norms and HbA 1 c were moderated by <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability. Methods HbA 1 c, representing cardiometabolic risk, was measured three times over 10  years for a population-based biomedical cohort of adults in Adelaide, South Australia. Residential environmental exposures were defined using 1600  m participant-centred road-network buffers. Local descriptive norms for overweight/obesity and insufficient fruit intake (proportion of residents with BMI[*]≥[*] 25  kg/m 2 [n[*]=[*] 1890] or fruit intake of < 2 serves/day [n[*]=[*] 1945], respectively) were aggregated from responses to a separate geocoded population survey. Fast-food and healthful <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability (counts) were extracted from a retail database. Separate sets of multilevel models included different predictors, one local descriptive norm and either fast-food or healthful <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability, with area-level education and individual-level covariates (age, sex, employment status, education, marital status, and smoking status). Interactions between local descriptive norms and <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability were tested. Results HbA 1 c concentration rose over time. Local descriptive norms for overweight/obesity and insufficient fruit intake predicted greater rates of increase in HbA 1 c. Neither fast-food nor healthful <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability were associated with change in HbA 1 c. Greater healthful <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability reduced {{the rate of increase}} in HbA 1 c concentration attributed to the overweight/obesity norm. Conclusions Local descriptive health-related norms, not <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability, predicted 10 -year change in HbA 1 c. Null findings for <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability may reflect a sufficiency or minimum threshold level of resources such that availability poses no barrier to obtaining healthful or unhealthful foods for this region. However, the influence of local descriptive norms varied according to <b>food</b> <b>resource</b> availability in effects on HbA 1 c. Local descriptive health-related norms have received little attention thus far but are important influences on individual cardiometabolic risk.

5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their <b>food</b> <b>resources.</b> A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E
5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} <b>food</b> <b>resources,</b> effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation.

5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> on politics.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of <b>food</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{species that}} prey upon similar <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> include the caimans and large fish that are {{themselves}} piscivores.

Two river dolphins, the tucuxi and boto, might potentially compete with the giant otter, but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap. Furthermore, Defler observed associations between giant otters and the Amazon river dolphins, and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from the otters. The spectacled caiman is another potential competitor, but Duplaix found no conflict with the species in Suriname.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} <b>food</b> <b>resources</b> in the world's seas and oceans, {{and to a}} great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the pygmy slow loris is seasonal.

5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by <b>food</b> <b>resources.</b> Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
