25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} {{to the early}} 1990s, KOFY also {{featured}} an in-studio, live kids cartoon show called Cartoon Classics. Hosted by Maestro Dick Bright, the show offered such cartoons as Mighty Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry and Popeye. The show frequently featured local magician Magic Mike (played by Michael Stroud) performing for the studio children. Finally the live-action in-studio segment was scrapped and the show <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> the cartoons straight. Afternoon cartoon shows such as these eventually became {{a thing of the}} past as cable television was able to feature round-the-clock cartoons aimed at younger viewers.|$|E
500|$|After {{the forced}} {{removals}} and demolition, carried {{out under the}} Natives Resettlement Act of 1954, [...] the area was rezoned for whites only and renamed Triomf —Afrikaans for Triumph—by the government. The social engineers of apartheid tried to create a suburb for the white working class. In the end {{it turned out that}} Triomf became a suburb mainly for poor white Afrikaners. This <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> how apartheid failed even those it was ideologically designed to benefit.|$|E
500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} entry of the series to be {{directed}} by Duchovny. While Duchovny was working on plot points with Carter, the two agreed that the episode would serve as Duchovny's directorial debut. As the episode did not heavily feature his character, since it is framed as a flashback, Duchovny was {{able to focus on}} pre-production. This narratological method also gave Anderson a minor respite from her work. While Duchovny later expressed gratitude that [...] "The Unnatural" [...] enabled him {{to get a feel for}} directing, he also experienced severe anxiety during the production process because of the stress of both writing and directing. However, when the episode was finished, Duchovny was pleased, calling the results [...] "great." [...] He later noted that his stress was largely uncalled for because the episode would have been made even [...] "if [...] <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> up and drooled for 24 hours a day." ...|$|E

500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role." ...|$|E

[...] "He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|WWE Hall of Famer Bret Hart gave a {{strongly}} negative {{appraisal of the}} show, ranking the Rumble match as [...] "one of the least exciting" [...] in history, and the overall event as perhaps [...] "the worst Royal Rumble". Of Triple H's WWE World Heavyweight Championship win in the Rumble match, Hart said: [...] "I didn't like the decision that Triple H, surprise, put the belt on himself again... it <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> a real lack of imagination if you ask me".|$|E

All right, if you think so I never saw the man yet that I was hard up for. And when any man thinks I can't get along without him, I <b>just</b> <b>show</b> him the latest pattern in that line of goods and give him his walking-papers." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You're hoss {{enough for}} me. Come on," [...] he said, and, waving {{the other men}} aside, he turned toward the green, shady hill above which the red and white of the house <b>just</b> <b>showed.</b>|$|E

60|$|He {{rubbed the}} lump that <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> beneath his hair. I did not wonder at his emotion. Whoever had wielded the sand-bag {{had done his}} work well, in a manner to cause hard {{feelings}} {{on the part of}} the victim.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never," [...] I thought; and ardently I {{wished to}} die.

6000|$|Mrs. Brook <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> {{the chill}} of it, but she had always her courage. [...] "Why that you don't like her."

6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} enough for me," [...] broke in the Left Bower, [...] "when the other day, you {{remember}} when, {{he proposed to}} us white men to settle down to plain ground sluicing, making 'grub' wages just like any Chinaman. It <b>just</b> <b>showed</b> his idea of the Lone Star claim." ...|$|E

60|$|Particularly, I remembered {{standing}} {{with my father}} on the wharf when a large ship was getting under way, and rounding {{the head of the}} pier.
