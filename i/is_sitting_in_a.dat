5|$|In the video, Selena <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{restaurant}} where a mariachi band is performing. A waiter offers her {{a glass of}} water. As the singer enjoys her dinner, the waiter returns with a note saying that her lover (for whom she has been waiting) has left her for another woman. Selena {{takes a sip of}} water before she leaves the restaurant, crying.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair clutching a rifle {{in front of an}} American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E
25|$|Momentum is a {{measurable}} quantity, and the measurement {{depends on the}} motion of the observer. For example: if an apple <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a frame of reference, in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.|$|E

For the Orlando attraction, Krusty <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> control room and pushes an emergency button on a control panel, causing the vehicle to vibrate, ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> control room and takes a picture of the guests (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction). After the gullwing doors on the car lift up, guests exit the ride.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In My Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. It debuted on 17 June 2002 on AOL. It features a by-the-numbers band performance, in which Coldplay are playing in a huge, nearly empty room. The two women in the background {{were members of the}} video crew: a makeup artist/wardrobe assistant and the video commissioner. The video starts off with band playing; while they play, Chris Martin, who <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner, gets up and joins them in the song. During the video, Martin sings directly to the camera. During the guitar solo, Martin runs up to the two women in the background, talks to them for a while, and then returns to sing the rest of the song. The video concludes with the band finishing the song.|$|E
500|$|When Principal Skinner {{tells the}} {{children}} at school that Valentine's Day is not a joke (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback in which he <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, [...] "Sending your chick a Valentine?", to which Johnny replies [...] "Yep", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain." [...] After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent {{in a letter to}} the show that read, [...] "I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback. Do you really think this was funny, this horrible experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening—the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran—"loved" [...] the sequence as well as the episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Take Back" [...] {{was directed by}} Toku, and took one day to shoot and two days to edit. According to Figlerowicz, who reviewed the singers' DVD compilation 7 Spirits, the video opens with a [...] "young Koda Kumi that has long and black hair. She presents herself in this video in two different ways. In the first one, though wearing a leather dress, she looks natural, gentle and pretty. In the latter one, she is presented with disheveled hair and strange things plaited in it, but despite that, she still attracts the viewer's attention with her enthusiasm flowing out from the screen." [...] In the video, Kumi is accompanied by her three fellow background dancers; they're dancing in a white photo shoot room, while she <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> white chair. Figlerowicz stated that the dancers complimented the early 2000s music video era: [...] "there are only three dancers near the singer, so it probably wouldn't distinguish from other PVs of the same era." [...] Scenes interspersed through the main video show Koda lying nude on a crimson red Ferrari and clutching a microphone in her hand. Figlerowicz commented that the video, in conjunction with her other videos on 7 Spirits, [...] "didn't appeal to the Japanese audience's tastes [...] With some time, people's opinions of them might change, but they are worth taking a look at.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Till {{arguing with}} his girlfriend through a phone call. As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to {{communicate}} by holding up signs through their bedroom windows. Till closes his curtains, and Swift holds up a sign saying, [...] "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance {{in front of a}} mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times. Afterward, Swift <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two converse. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, the antagonist, kisses him and gives a hostile look towards the protagonist. Suddenly, she is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate, resulting in a heated argument which results in their breakup. Meanwhile, Swift, the protagonist stares in amazement. Back in their bedroom windows, they again communicate through signs, Till asked Swift, the protagonist, if she was attending prom and she responded, [...] "no, studying". Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves and changes her mind. Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift, the antagonist in a red dress, attempts to impede him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying [...] "I love you" [...] and kiss. To date, the video has over 770 million views on YouTube, making it the most viewed country song on YouTube.|$|E

[...] He said that the legal problems his office had to struggle with [...] "extend all the way to extreme cases such as so-called targeted killing ... Imagine someone knew what cave Osama bin Laden <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in.</b> <b>A</b> remote-controlled missile could then be fired in order to kill him." [...] The interviewer said: [...] "Germany's federal government would probably send a public prosecutor there first, to arrest bin Laden." [...] Schäuble responded: [...] "And the Americans would execute him with a missile, and most people would say: 'thank God'." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{retained}} {{the post of}} wine editor at Gourmet until 2002, and thereafter contributed a selection of wines to each issue until the magazine discontinued in 2009. Many of his wine essays from Gourmet have been republished in book form; five volumes of these columns have been published, most recently A Carafé of Red in 2012. Asher's writing and knowledge of wine are both acclaimed, with British wine critic Jancis Robinson calling him [...] "America's most elegant wine writer". James Beard, an American chef and food writer, says Asher's writing [...] "makes one feel that one <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> room with Gerald, enjoying his ... awesome knowledge and expertise {{in the world of}} wine." [...] Asher has received many accolades for his writing and work with wine during his life. He was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame by the Culinary Institute of America in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Asher is {{generally}} considered a highly respected authority {{in the field of}} wine, and has received acclaim throughout his career for his expertise and writing style, which is widely held to be elegant and enjoyable. In her 1997 book Tasting Pleasure, British wine critic Jancis Robinson calls Asher [...] "America's most elegant wine writer". S. Irene Virbila of the Los Angeles Times gave A Carafé of Red a very positive review, describing Asher as a [...] "wonderful prose stylist ... His wide-ranging, astute appreciation is where it's at." [...] In a glowing review of On Wine (1982), the American chef and food writer James Beard called the book [...] "a delight". [...] "Reading it makes one feel that one <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> room with Gerald, enjoying his personal views, his prejudices, his delightful sense of humour and his appreciation of life," [...] Beard elaborated; [...] "not to mention his awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Still Life with Apples, Pears, Lemons and Grapes (F382) was Van Gogh's {{opportunity}} to explore Blanc's recommendation about combining colors: [...] "If one brings together sulfur (yellow) and garnet (dark red), which is its exact opposite, being equidistant from nasturtium (orange) and campanula (blue-mauve), the garnet and sulfur will excite one another, because they are each others' complementaries." [...] In the background, Van Gogh used short brushstrokes of light blue and pink, giving {{the impression that the}} fruit <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> basket. [...] Van Gogh may have seen Claude Monet's Still Life with Apples and Grapes in Paris, but while the subject matter is roughly the same, the composition is not. [...] Monet paints the fruit on a diagonally placed table to [...] "anchor his composition in space." [...] Having removed any form of distraction, such as a [...] table or background, Van Gogh placed each piece of fruit by itself, creating a [...] "semi-abstract, decorative effect." ...|$|E

6000|$|The best view of Victoria Park is {{from the}} front window of St. Dominic's Parsonage, from which not a single chimney is visible. The parsonage is a semi-detached villa with a front garden and a porch. Visitors go up the flight of steps to the porch: tradespeople {{and members of the}} family go down by a door under the steps to the basement, with a breakfast room, used for all meals, in front, and the kitchen at the back. Upstairs, on the level of the hall door, is the drawing-room, with its large plate glass window looking on the park. In this room, the only sitting-room that can be spared from the {{children}} and the family meals, the parson, the Reverend James Mavor Morell does his work. He <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strong round backed revolving chair at the right hand end of a long table, which stands across the window, so that he can cheer himself with the view of the park at his elbow. At {{the opposite end of the}} table, adjoining it, is a little table; only half the width of the other, with a typewriter on it. His typist is sitting at this machine, with her back to the window. The large table is littered with pamphlets, journals, letters, nests of drawers, an office diary, postage scales and the like. A spare chair for visitors having business with the parson is in the middle, turned to his end. Within reach of his hand is a stationery case, and a cabinet photograph in a frame. Behind him the right hand wall, recessed above the fireplace, is fitted with bookshelves, on which an adept eye can measure the parson's divinity and casuistry by a complete set of Browning's poems and Maurice's Theological Essays, and guess at his politics from a yellow backed Progress and Poverty, Fabian Essays, a Dream of John Ball, Marx's Capital, and half a dozen other literary landmarks in Socialism. Opposite him on the left, near the typewriter, is the door. Further down the room, opposite the fireplace, a bookcase stands on a cellaret, with a sofa near it. There is a generous fire burning; and the hearth, with a comfortable armchair and a japanned flower painted coal scuttle at one side, a miniature chair for a boy or girl on the other, a nicely varnished wooden mantelpiece, with neatly moulded shelves, tiny bits of mirror let into the panels, and a travelling clock in a leather case (the inevitable wedding present), and on the wall above a large autotype of the chief figure in Titian's Virgin of the Assumption, is very inviting. Altogether the room is the room of a good housekeeper, vanquished, as far as the table is concerned, by an untidy man, but elsewhere mistress of the situation. The furniture, in its ornamental aspect, betrays the style of the advertised [...] "drawing-room suite" [...] of the pushing suburban furniture dealer; but there is nothing useless or pretentious in the room. The paper and panelling are dark, throwing the big cheery window and the park outside into strong relief.|$|E
