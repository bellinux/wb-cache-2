25|$|Moreover, {{since the}} Supreme Court has {{recognized}} voting {{as a fundamental}} right, the Equal Protection Clause places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.|$|E

In many penannular brooches, {{the gap between the}} terminals is now too narrow for the pin to pass through; whether this was always the case is uncertain.|$|E

25|$|He had {{personally}} opposed {{the use of}} violence against both companies and laborers in labor disputes, and had favored the elevation of African Americans from an inferior social position to one of equality. As neither principle was actively supported by successful politicians of either party, either before or after his term as governor, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> attribute the principles to him personally, and to note that he was out-of-step with his nineteenth century contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|In bidding, Beasley adopted many of Culbertson's ideas, but was displeased {{with the}} strong twos and their {{negative}} response of two no trumps.

For many years all the British bidding systems used this method of dealing with strong hands: Acol (both standard and Benjaminised), CAB, Two Clubs and Baron systems all used it. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> mention that others have also claimed authorship of this fruitful idea.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{allegedly}} overly unrealistic {{assumptions are}} one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say that many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Its disregard for social reality and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E

25|$|Hephaestion’s {{exact age}} is not known. No concise {{biography}} {{has ever been}} written about him, likely stemming {{from the fact that}} he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion’s age as being similar to Alexander’s so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assume that he was born about 356BC. He is said to have become a page in 343BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon. As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.|$|E
25|$|R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, {{ex parte}} Coughlan is a seminal case {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1999 which {{clarified}} the court's role in relation to cases which involve substantive legitimate expectations. The Court held that when reviewing a decision of a public authority which is contrary to a prior assurance or representation by the authority, its role is not always limited to assessing if the decision is Wednesbury unreasonable or irrational. In some situations, it is entitled to determine whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> compel the authority to fulfil its representation, or {{whether there is a}} sufficient overriding public interest which justifies allowing the authority to depart from the promise made.|$|E

25|$|The American middle class, {{at least}} those living the lifestyle, has become known {{around the world for}} {{conspicuous}} consumption. To this day, the professional middle class in the United States holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances, and most automobiles. In 2005, the average new home had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 226 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent {{a small portion of the}} housing stock in the US, with most suburban homes having been built in the 1970s when the average square footage was 1,600, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class.|$|E
25|$|Cassiodorus devoted much of {{his life}} to {{supporting}} education within the Christian community at large. When his proposed theological university in Rome was denied, he was forced to re-examine his entire approach to how material was learned and interpreted. His Variae show that, like Augustine of Hippo, Cassiodorus viewed reading as a transformative act for the reader. It is with this in mind that he designed and mandated the course of studies at the Vivarium, which demanded an intense regimen of reading and meditation. By assigning a specific order of texts to be read, Cassiodorus hoped to create the discipline necessary within the reader to become a successful monk. The first work in this succession of texts would be the Psalms, which the untrained reader would need to begin with because of its appeal to emotion and temporal goods. By examining the rate at which copies of his Psalmic commentaries were issued, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assess that as the first work in his series, Cassiodorus's educational agenda had been implemented to some degree of success.|$|E
500|$|We {{must live}} with our {{virtually}} complete ignorance of Padarn’s life. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say, however, {{that if he}} had died at Llanbadarn {{there would have been a}} shrine, traditions of which would have survived for centuries; none are recorded. Therefore, we can see him as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales (Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llanbadarn Garreg), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn, Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [...] ), if he didn't establish them himself.|$|E

500|$|The republished version enjoyed greater {{success than}} the original. Although, {{by the time}} of his death in 1968, Steinbeck's {{reputation}} was at an all-time low owing to his mediocre output during the last decades of his life and his support for American involvement in Vietnam, his books have slowly regained their popularity. The Log from the Sea of Cortez became an important work within his oeuvre, not only as an interesting travelogue and work of non-fiction, but for its first-hand account of Ed Ricketts, the man whose thinking had so much influence on the course of Steinbeck's writing and on whom he had based so many of his pivotal characters. Whereas earlier critics mostly assumed that [...] "Mr. Ricketts contributed some of the biology, and Mr. Steinbeck all of the prose", the publication of Ricketts' rediscovered original notes in 2003 has revealed how closely Steinbeck followed Ricketts' journal. This has forced a re-evaluation of how far <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> attribute authorship of the narrative portion of Sea of Cortez to Steinbeck, and has caused critics to view the removal of Ricketts' name from the cover as reflecting badly on Steinbeck.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.|$|E
500|$|Although Sgt. Pepper's was {{preceded by}} several albums that had begun to bridge the line between [...] "disposable" [...] pop and [...] "serious" [...] rock, it {{successfully}} gave an established [...] "commercial" [...] voice to an alternative youth culture and marked {{the point at which}} the LP record emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of the single. Bill Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that Sgt. Pepper's transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music. He believed that: [...] "Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assume that there would have been no progressive rock." [...] In the aftermath of Sgt. Pepper, magazines such as Melody Maker drew a sharp line between [...] "pop" [...] and [...] "rock', thus eliminating the [...] "roll" [...] from [...] "rock and roll" [...] (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained [...] "rock" [...] would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from [...] "radio friendly" [...] standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective [...] "progressive" [...] for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van Der Graaf Generator, and King Crimson.|$|E
