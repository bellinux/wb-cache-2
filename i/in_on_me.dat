500|$|During {{a promotional}} {{interview}} in September, {{the month before}} the album was released, Noel spoke about the rivalry with Damon Albarn and Alex James from Blur, and {{was quoted in the}} 17 September edition of The Observer saying he hoped [...] "the pair of them would catch AIDS and die because I fucking hate them two." [...] The quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that [...] "my whole world came crashing down <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> then". However, in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, Blur's guitarist Graham Coxon explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. [...] "At least they were outright about it. They weren't pretending to like us and then slagging us off, which is what we'd been used to. In that way, I quite appreciated them." ...|$|E
2500|$|His last single, [...] "Nineteen", {{released}} {{a few weeks}} before his death, was produced by Paul Hardcastle. It bore no relation to the producer's chart-topping single of the same title some months earlier. [...] "This was a guy whose records I used to play when I was at school," [...] said Hardcastle. [...] "He was a hero of mine – I couldn't work out why he wanted to work with me. He said to me, 'You're {{at the top of your}} game technically right now, so can you help me?'" [...] The producer played the bassline on Lynott's Fender. [...] "He walked <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> playing it and I thought, 'Shit!' said Hardcastle. [...] "But he said, 'That's fokken great – we're keeping that on there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gimblett's own words, {{quoted in}} the Foot biography, tell the story. [...] "I couldn't take much more. I was taking {{sleeping}} pills to make me sleep and others to wake me up. By the end of 1953 the world was closing <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> I couldn't offer any reason why and I don't think the medical profession knew either." [...] In the winter of 1953-54, Gimblett spent 16 weeks in Tone Vale Hospital, a psychiatric institution, where he was given electro-convulsive therapy, and was released in time to join the Somerset team {{for the start of}} the 1954 season. He played in the first two county matches of the new season, but was not fit enough mentally to continue and– though the details vary– Somerset agreed to give him time off. He did not appear in first-class cricket again. Later in the 1954 season, according to Gimblett's own report, he went to Somerset's Taunton ground to watch some of the cricket, and was [...] "ordered out of the ground".|$|E
