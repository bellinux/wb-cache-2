The data pertained to variables indicating municipal receipts and expenditures with respect to basic education during the decade of the 1990 s and also to the test scores of students enrolled in the municipal fundamental schools. The results revealed an absence of significant correlations between indicators of municipal <b>financial</b> <b>commitment</b> to education and student achievement. On the other hand, the findings demonstrated that there is a greater variation in levels of <b>financial</b> <b>commitment</b> among the richer municipalities than among the poorer ones. Thus, the data indicate that where there exists a relative power to make decisions about education expenditures, there is a weak positive association between <b>financial</b> <b>commitment</b> and school achievement levels...|$|R

2500|$|In this context, utility {{executives}} {{were required to}} make investment decisions committing millions of dollars over extended periods. As summarized by one utility manager: [...] "Major decisions must be made without adequate information or even the ability to obtain adequate information." [...] For example, after a protracted struggle involving the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, the Ohio Office of Consumer's Counsel, industrial customers, the Ohio Sierra Club, and the United Mine Workers at American Electric Power Company's affiliate Meigs high-sulfur coal mines, [...] construction of scrubbers by AEP at its two-unit, 2,600 MWe Gavin plant in Ohio were expected to cost about $835 million, reducing sulfur dioxide emissions there by 95%. In February 1993, AEP was still unsure {{whether it would be}} allowed by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission to transfer emissions credits from the Gavin scrub to Phase I units in other states. Thus, substantial <b>financial</b> <b>commitments</b> had to be {{made on the basis of}} best judgments by utility planners and construction begun in the absence of definitive information or final regulatory approvals.|$|E

On the other hand, the west coast was important for investors, farmers, manufacturers, and government officials because of their <b>financial</b> <b>commitments.</b> Hence, The Times of London as well as The New York Times covered {{the events of the}} war as much as possible, albeit in the absence of their own correspondents. Information was culled from Government representatives in Europe and the USA, from merchant houses and Lloyd's of London, from articles printed in the Panama Star and Herald and also from Reuters. [...] The result was a mix of brief telegraphic dispatches a few days old from cities with cable stations, along with lengthier (but older) reports carried by steamships to London or New York. For example, the Battle of Iquique occurred on 21 May, but first mention of it appeared in the May 30 edition of both The Times and The New York Times with an incorrect message. It wasn't until 17 June that The Times was able to provide a reasonably accurate version of the battle.|$|E

However a project to quarry Bath Stone near his property, for sale to the London property development market, failed to return the significant investment it had required due to poor quality stone and Smith found himself in default to co-investor Charles Conolly. [...] Smith had used his Bath estate as security against Conolly's loan but there was excess to pay. In attempting to stave off his debt Smith sold his 'fossil collection' to the British Museum for £700, but this proved insufficient and funds fell short of the sum owed to Conolly by £300 and as a consequence Smith was sent to debtor's prison in 1819. Through all this financial turmoil, Smith managed to publish his map and subsequent associated publications but in 1817 he remarked [...] "My income is as yet not anywise improved by what has been done, the profits being required to liquidate the debt incurred by publication." ...|$|E
