5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> <b>accidents</b> involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E

40|$|Accidents are a {{major public}} health concern, {{resulting}} in an estimated 1. 2 million deaths and 50 million injuries worldwide each year specifically, the relationships between drivers' characteristics <b>and</b> road <b>accidents</b> are not fully understood. Many factors {{are involved in the}} accident occurrence at construction site. Some important elements that create a significant portion of accidents include: safety management error, poor training programs, human element, act of god, outdated procedure and no clear monitoring policy. Although some of these items are inevitable, but the occurrence of the largest part can be prevented. Therefore, for ameliorating the safety in a project each of these items should be analyzed and a practical approach introduced. In general, near miss, <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> <b>accident</b> are three dependent levels that mainly lead to injury. Risk and hazard are allocated in first level which means near miss, therefore, no on-time identification of hazard and risk causes to create <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> preventing <b>accident</b> in <b>incident</b> stage is unavoidable...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an Aircraft Performance Risk Assessment Model (APRAM). The model consists of a set of software tools that processes aircraft data available from Digital Flight Data Recorders (DFDRs) and Quick Access Recorders (QARs) to identify precursor events <b>and</b> compute <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> <b>accident</b> risks. The feasibility version of the generic risk assessment model is limited in scope to controlled flight towards terrain (CFTT) and controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> <b>accident</b> types respectively. The objective of this research is to develop a computer model that uses both empirical data and expert judgement to quantify the risk of an incident and/or accident. The general approach taken in assessing risk is to develop an automated means of analyzing commercial aircraft flight recorder data from routine flights, combining the use of exceedance information from the data with information about the contextual factors that are not directly available from the data recorders. Expert opinion is incorporated through the use of knowledge-based rules. This information is analyzed to identify <b>incident</b> and/or <b>accident</b> precursors <b>and</b> their contributing factors. The output from the model is a risk estimate that includes consequence, severity, and probability of occurrence, similar to that used for aircraft certification.

Accidents or incidents tend to occur because of very small differences from an ideal situation. From the above viewpoint, we introduce scenario violation model and regard scenario violation as a gap from the proper scenario. Previously, we proposed abduction-based scenario violation determination strategy, {{but in this}} paper, we adopt the Kamishibai-KeyGraph to analyze multiple patterns at the same time.

[...] This station was taken over by the RNLI the following year. In 1876 a replacement boathouse with slipway was built, the remains of which can be seen down the estuary at Black Rocks, but this was abandoned in 1932, leaving the nearest other stations at Fishguard and Aberystwyth. The subsequent popularity of this area, with increased leisure <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> <b>accidents,</b> led to the decision to construct a station on the present site.|$|E

2500|$|Although a naval Board of Inquiry was {{suggested}} by senior RAN officers {{as the best}} way to investigate the incident, a series of <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> <b>accidents</b> during the 1950s and early 1960s had left the general public with a mistrust of navy-run investigations, and Prime Minister Robert Menzies made it clear that an inquiry supervised by a federal judge would be the only acceptable route: anything else would be seen as a cover up. Regulations for such an externally supervised inquiry were supposed to have been drafted following an explosion aboard [...] in 1950, but they were never enacted, so Menzies' only option was to call for a Royal Commission. The commission, to be headed by Sir John Spicer, was announced by Menzies on 13 February 1964. This commission was directed primarily to investigate the immediate causes of the collision, and the circumstances which led up to it. Secondary considerations included the suitability of both ships for the exercise, and the rescue and treatment of survivors. These instructions were prepared without the consultation of the RAN. The high number of competing arguments slowed the investigation, and it was not until 25 June that the inquiry was ended and the report begun. The Spicer Report was released publicly on 26 August 1964.|$|E
