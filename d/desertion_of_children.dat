50|$|Controversy arose out the safe-haven law {{enacted in}} Nebraska in July 2008: the Nebraska law in {{force at the}} time was {{interpreted}} to define a child as anyone under 18, and resulted in the <b>desertion</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> older than infants, some as old as teenage years. Under the prior version of the law, at least 35 children were dropped off in Nebraska hospitals in a four-month span, at least 5 of them from other US states.

5000|$|The NICHD study <b>of</b> Early <b>child</b> {{care was}} {{designed}} to assess the long-term outcomes of non parental care giving. Non Parental care giving involved both relatives (kinship care) and non relatives (Day care). The NICHD study {{was based on the}} ecological theory of Uri Bronfenbrenner (1979). Analysis of the effects <b>of</b> family and <b>child</b> care revealed that the characteristics of the family and the nature and quality of the mothers relationship with the child was a significantly better predictor of children's outcome.Prolonged separations from parents have profound disruptive influence on children's development. Such prolonged separations include separations due to death, institutionalization which entails sending a child to live in an institution or setting without parents, divorce and <b>desertion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child</b> by parent and hospitalization or prolonged absence due to illness. [...] Prolonged exposure to poor institutional care could lead to despair, apathy and deficit in social responsiveness. According to Rutter (1979). it is the failure to develop secure attachment with parents that leads to problems in social responsiveness. Institutionalization is extreme form of separation <b>of</b> the <b>child</b> from its parents.|$|R

Legal abandonment includes a variety of parental actions in which a parent fails to provide for a child's health. welfare, and well-being, the most obvious being simple <b>desertion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child</b> for long periods without adequate provision being made forthe child's physical and psychological needs. While the Ie gal definition of abandonment includes the common language use of the word, the legal construction of abandonment extends it to those situations in which parents fail to provide for their child's welfare for reasons that lie outside their willful or conscious control. In many states, legal abandon-ment occurs when a parent is jailed or is involuntarily committed because of mental illness. In these two situations. the state may assert jurisdiction and assume responsibility for the minor child left unattended by the parent'...|$|R
