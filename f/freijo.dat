40|$|This work {{aimed to}} study the {{behavior}} of the species Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex Ducke) Barneby (In the Portuguese language ‘Paricá’) at different ages and cultivation systems in Aurora do Pará (Pará state, Brazil). The experiment was carried out in the experimental territory of ‘Tramontina Belém S. A. company’ (2 ° 10 ’ 00 ”s; 47 ° 32 ’ 00 ”w), using a thoroughly random statistical outline with subdivided plots. There were selected six plantation forests of Paricá: 1 - agroforestry system of Paricá and Curauá (Ananas comosus var. erectifolius) (SAFpc); 2 - monoespecific plantation of Paricá (MONp); 3 - agroforestry system with Paricá, <b>freijo</b> (Cordia goeldiana) and curauá (SAFpfc); 4 - consortium of Paricá and <b>Freijó</b> (CONpf); 5 - agroforestry system with Paricá, <b>Freijo,</b> Mogno and Curaua (SAFpfmc); 6 - Consortium of Paricá, Magno and <b>Freijo</b> (CONpmf). The plot size was 18 m x 24 m with four repetitions per treatment, amounting for 28 plots and 10. 368 m 2 of experimental area. The numbers used as reference to evaluate the growth of Paricá were height (H) and breast height diameter (DAP). Based on those values the average increments per year were calculated in DAP (IMAdap), H (IMAalt) and volume (V); The data was submitted a Variance Analysis and the average compared through Student Newman Keuls test (SNK), at 95 % probability level. The results showed that Paricá and Curaua, if associated, presented statistically higher numbers in height and diameter at breast height, increment and volume, if compared to same age treatments {{in the absence of the}} agricultural species...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{is considered the}} most damaging radiation to wood, affecting its properties and especially its color. The application of finishing products such as varnishes, stains and inks can minimize the action of this radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ultraviolet radiation, through artificially accelerated aging, on the color of <b>freijó</b> wood (Cordia goeldiana Huber) treated with “polisten” and sealer (nitrocellulose), by means of spectrocolorimetric tracking. The samples of wood were subjected to cycles of ultraviolet radiation in a photochemical reactor for 84 and 168 hours. The colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*, C, h*) were measured {{before and after the}} treatments. The treatment with “polisten” offered greater protection against ultraviolet radiation, yielding greater stability to the parameters. The treatment with sealer led to a greater change in color after the simulation of aging in the photochemical reactor. </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the physical-mechanical performance of laminated veneer lumber (LV) produced with different compositions of tropical Amazonian species and Pinus oocarpa. Three tropical species were used: Cordia goeldiana Huber. (<b>Freijó),</b> Parkia gigantocarpa Ducke (Faveira) and Brosimum parinarioides Ducke (Amapá doce). For comparison, Pinus oocarpa wood obtained from an experimental stand was used. Three types of veneer combination were evaluated: (i) one species; (ii) the three Amazonian species combination and (iii) combination of Amazonian species with Pinus oocarpa. The acoustic propagation velocity was also evaluated with the stress wave timer for correlation between dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEd) and static modulus of elasticity (MOEs) of the panel. Panels produced with Amazonian species presented lower water absorption than Pinus oocarpa panels. Regarding the mechanical properties, the lowest strength was verified for "faveira" panels. There was no statistical difference among panels in glue line shear strength. The stress wave timer {{could be used for}} prediction of MOEs by using MOEd...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi estudar a influência da relação do fósforo com o zinco sobre o crescimento, teor e conteúdo de nutrientes em plantas de <b>freijó</b> (Cordia goeldiana Huber). Utilizaram-se amostras de um Latossolo Vermelho-Escuro, da camada de 0 - 20 cm de profundidade do campus da Universidade Federal de Lavras, que apresentava 1 mg de P (Mehlich 1) e 0, 9 mg de Zn por dm³ de solo. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial 4 x 3, sendo quatro doses de P (0, 150, 300 e 450 mg dm- 3) e 3 de Zn (0, 5 e 10 mg dm- 3), com quatro repetições. Aos 12 meses após o plantio, foram colhidas as plantas e a matéria seca das folhas, caules e raízes, moídas separadamente, para as determinações químicas. A aplicação do fósforo promoveu aumento no crescimento das mudas e nos teores e conteúdos de P nas diferentes partes da planta de <b>freijó</b> e provocou redução nos teores de zinco nas folhas. Nas raízes, na presença de doses de zinco a interação do fósforo com o zinco reduziu o teor de zinco. As doses de zinco proporcionaram aumentos tanto no teor quanto no conteúdo deste nas folhas e raízes diminuíram os conteúdos de P nas folhas e caules das plantas. O efeito sobre os demais macronutrientes foi variado em função da parte da planta analisada. The {{objective of}} this work was to study {{the influence of the}} zinc-phosphorus relationship on the growth, content and accumulation of nutrients in Brazilian walnut (Cordia goeldiana Huber). Samples of Dark-Red Latosol, 0 - 20 cm depth, from the campus of the Federal University of Lavras, with 1 mg P (Mehlich 1) and 0. 9 mg Zn per dm³ soil. The experiment was arranged in a complete randomized factorial design 4 x 3, with 4 P doses (0; 150; 300 and 450 mg dm- 3) and 3 Zn doses (0; 5 and 10 mg dm- 3), with 4 repetitions. At 12 months after planting, plants were harvested, and dry matter of shoots, roots and leaves were ground separately for chemical analysis. Phosphorus application promoted increase in seedling growth and in the contents and accumulation of P in the different plant parts, but caused reduction in leaf zinc contents. The zinc-phosphorus interaction caused reduction in the zinc content in the roots, when {{in the presence of the}} different zinc doses. The zinc doses provided increases in both the level and content of zinc in the leaves and roots and reduced P contents in the leaves and shoots.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} were tested: (1) Teachers ' ratings of high-SES pupils will exhibit less composite halo than will teachers ' ratings of low-SES pupils, and (2) The SES of pupils {{will have a}} greater effect on composite halo in ratings than will {{the race of the}} pupil or teacher. Principal components analysis was used to investigate the hypotheses, using teachers ' ratings of more than 8, 000 fourth-grade pupils on 21 related behavior changes. The {{hypotheses were}} confirmed. The results are at variance with one set of literature while in support of another set of literature. It was suggested that the relationships between social distance, race, SES, and evaluator accuracy (one example of which is absence of composite halo) be resurrected for closer scrutiny in the face of conflicting evidence. This study attempts to identify the relationship between the race and socio-economic status (SES) of teachers and pupils, and the composite halo in teachers' ratings of pupils ' progress. It also attempts to determine the relative influence of differences in race and socio-economic status of teachers and pupils on the composite halo in teachers ' ratings of pupils ' progress. The current study is based upon earlier research conducted by the authors. The reader should refer to a report of that research (Jaeger & <b>Freijo,</b> 1975) for a complete treatment of the theoretical and methodological foundations on which this study is based.

40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{characterized}} by diverse assemblages {{of plant and animal}} species compared to temperate forests. Corollary to this general rule is that most tree species, whether valued for timber or not, occur at low densities (< 1 adult tree ha(- 1)) or may be locally rare. In the Brazilian Amazon, many of the most highly valued timber species occur at extremely low densities yet are intensively harvested with little regard for impacts on population structures and dynamics. These include big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), ipe (Tabebuia serratifolia and Tabebuia impetiginosa), jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril), and <b>freijo</b> cinza (Cordia goeldiana). Brazilian forest regulations prohibit harvests of species that meet the legal definition of rare - fewer than three trees per 100 ha - but treat all species populations exceeding this density threshold equally. In this paper we simulate logging impacts on a group of timber species occurring at low densities that are widely distributed across eastern and southern Amazonia, based on field data collected at four research sites since 1997, asking: under current Brazilian forest legislation, what are the prospects for second harvests on 30 -year cutting cycles given observed population structures, growth, and mortality rates? Ecologically `rare` species constitute majorities in commercial species assemblages in {{all but one of the}} seven large-scale inventories we analyzed from sites spanning the Amazon (range 49 - 100 % of total commercial species). Although densities of only six of 37 study species populations met the Brazilian legal definition of a rare species, timber stocks of five of the six timber species declined substantially at all sites between first and second harvests in simulations based on legally allowable harvest intensities. Reducing species-level harvest intensity by increasing minimum felling diameters or increasing seed tree retention levels improved prospects for second harvests of those populations with a relatively high proportion of submerchantable stems, but did not dramatically improve projections for populations with relatively flat diameter distributions. We argue that restrictions on logging very low-density timber tree populations, such as the current Brazilian standard, provide inadequate minimum protection for vulnerable species. Population declines, even if reduced-impact logging (RIL) is eventually adopted uniformly, can be anticipated for a large pool of high-value timber species unless harvest intensities are adapted to timber species population ecology, and silvicultural treatments are adopted to remedy poor natural stocking in logged stands.
