40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the evaluation, modification and modelling {{of a mass}} flow <b>feeding</b> <b>silo,</b> stand pipe and standard air slide system for use in handling and transporting alumina in the aluminium smelting industry. Stability and repeatability of gravitational flow rates from <b>feeding</b> <b>silos</b> and stand pipes (addressed as interfaces) is crucial from operational {{point of view and}} needs to be achieved before one can further estimate and model the flow of alumina and the capacity of an air slide. Although techniques for design of storage vessels (based on the flow characteristics of particulates) have been in the public domain since the 1960 ’s, they have been slow to gain acceptance in the industry (due to a lack of awareness of their existence amongst engineers). The use of the stand pipe concept to increase flow rates during gravity discharge and to achieve stability of flow has been examined experimentally in a small rig at Tel-Tek department of POSTEC. The stand pipe should be integrated into the mechanical design of an air slide, because if the material cannot be delivered (discharged) properly from the feeding unit onto the air slide, there will be no stable conveying conditions. It has been found by Gu, Arnold and McLean (1993) that the stand pipe is efficient only if it is kept full of powder - the <b>feeding</b> <b>silo</b> acting more as a buffer for the stand pipe. Their concept was implemented in practice during the tests conducted at POSTEC by monitoring the weight of material in the stand pipe and the flow rates of alumina in real time by using LabView software and weighing cells. What makes the research work reported in this document unique is the integration of different mechanical and modelling concepts from different engineering fields (continuum and soil mechanics, fluid dynamics, rheology, cybernetics and powder technology). Previous work undertaken by Haugland (1998) for Hydro focused the flow of alumina as a Newtonian fluid and was itself based on the modelling work of Woodcock (1978). Yet, besides their work, no accurate mathematical model has been developed which could be used to predict the velocity and mass flow rates of alumina flow and capacity of an air slide for a range of alumina qualities. Such a model would be extremely useful when designing new air slide systems, as the capacity of air slides could be predicted from the rheology of powder and the knowledge of bulk particulate characteristics. Previous research, measurement campaigns and extensive literature studies, all point out that in terms of controlling discharge from gravity flow equipment (and after studying the transport behaviour of an air slide), it is often the gravity discharge approach that generates the greatest degree of variability, in terms of both consistency and repeatability. The root of the problem of inconsistent discharge rates has been identified to lie with the flow channel development within the <b>feeding</b> <b>silo</b> and/or the stand pipe (discharge head). The potential causes of flow irregularities are even more critical to be aware of, in the cases where mass flow principles are intended to be applied - {{especially in the case of}} highly segregable materials like alumina blends. This thesis is aimed at developing a reliable means for predicting the average velocity of alumina flow and capacity and also to understand the mechanisms that govern the flow behaviour. To enable online estimation and further modelling of full-scale air slide capacity, a small-scale rig with adjustable length was built at POSTEC in 2012 and further modified in 2013. Air slide capacity (alumina flow rates) for different lengths of 3 m, 7 m and 15 m and inclination angles from 0 to 3. 1 degrees of air slide were measured by using pressurized air in the range of 3 to 6. 5 barg. Empirical models have been developed from test results as a first step. It was found based on empirical models that the velocity of alumina bed has a power law behaviour. However, these models would require the use of expensive and time-consuming air slide trials to determine the values of the power law coefficients for each alumina quality. The degree of segregation when handling and transporting alumina has proven to be quite considerable, in terms of undesirable effects on the production process. This thesis was prompted by several measurement programmes of work undertaken for Hydro by the author with the aim of mapping the performance of volumetric feeders and the degree of segregation in a feeding air slide rig at The Reference Centre in Årdal. Sampling from feeders and chemical analysis of the samples have clearly shown the degree of segregation, especially when fluidizing and transporting binary mixtures of alumina and aluminium fluoride. Pressure measurement results showed pressure drops along the air supply tube, which also have been found to have an impact on segregation. Fluidization and shearing trials have been conducted both on alumina and binary mixtures in order to establish a benchmark procedure for powder characterisation that could be used as an operational support tool. Currently the minimum fluidization velocity for all Hydro Aluminium plants is set to 2. 0 cm/s, which is much higher than what it is actually needed to achieve an optimal fluidization. There is a strong analogy with the flow of Newtonian or non – Newtonian fluids in an open channel that can be applied to the flow of fluidized alumina on an air slide. In this thesis, the hydrological non- Newtonian model developed from the general Saint-Venant model of open channel in a rectangular channel has been applied as a second step. Such theoretical mechanistic models, based on the mass and momentum balance with bottom friction along the powder bed, are numerically challenging to solve. The model requires use of rheometrical benchmark tests to determine the flow index coefficients for a specific quality of alumina for a given initial inlet bed depth and steady state estimated capacity. The use of an Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solver in MATLAB to predict the height and the velocity of alumina bed in an open channel seemed promising and showed similar trends when compared to the alumina bed results obtained from the air slide tests conducted at POSTEC. Results obtained so far indicate that a more detailed analysis needs to be conducted in order to find out how to ‘fine tune’ the model parameters to further improve the model fit to measurement data. Although more experimental data is needed, e. g. shear stress measurements and flow coefficients at different fluidization velocities and for different alumina qualities, the correlation between measurements and the model obtained so far confirmed that further investigation would be justified. Thus, the effect of interfaces, the <b>feeding</b> <b>silo</b> and the stand pipe should be considered and included into further design approaches for mechanical equipment, by balancing headroom availability in pot rooms versus increase in transport capacity of bulk solids to optimize production...|$|R

In the 339 mink where cause(s) of death were established, 311 (91. 7 %) died from a single disease or condition, whereas 28 (8. 3 %) had 2 diseases or conditions contributing to death. Where cause(s) of death were evident, 11 diseases accounted for 321 (94. 7 %) of the diagnoses: bacterial pneumonia (67, 18. 8 %), Aleutian mink disease (61, 17. 7 %), mink viral enteritis (56, 16. 2 %), hepatic lipidosis (28, 8. 1 %), nutritional myopathy (24, 7 %), bacterial enterocolitis (17, 4. 9 %), bacterial septicemia (16, 4. 6 %), starvation (15, 4. 3 %), epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis of mink (14, 4. 1 %), pancreatitis (13, 3. 8 %), and bacterial metritis (10, 2. 9 %).

It was {{the aim of}} the study to find out possible relationships between positive results and predilection sites or farm management. The procedure: Samples were taken from the animal environment. Following the black and white separation scheme of the farms, samples were allocated to the interior (faeces, slatted floors, feeding and drinking troughs, flies, boots), to the exterior (water from the site, soil, bird faeces, rectal swabs from dogs or cats) and from the supply and disposing area (<b>feed</b> <b>silos,</b> municipal or fountain water, compost). In addition, farm internal management factors were taken as well as a ground view of the aerea was set up. All farms were visited twice during the year 2003 (between January and June and between September and November). In total, 657 samples were tested for Salmonella (following DIN ISO 6579) and Campylobacter (following ISO DIS 10272). The obtained Salmonella strains were serotyped at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the species differentiation of the Campylobacter isolates was performed via biochemical reactions in the laboratory of the institute. Results: Isolates: Results reflect a different burden and distribution of the zoonotic agents in the environment. Salmonella was detected in 5, 9 % of all samples. Three of six farms were positive, the percentage ranged from 0, 0 % to 28, 1 %. Based on all results, isolates were obtained from 6 % of samples from the interior, from 7, 8 % of samples from the exterior and in 2, 7 % of cases from the supply and disposal area. Predominantly identified were Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Derby. Campylobacter was obtained from 27, 4 % of all samples, with a detection rate between 12, 5 % and 41, 2 %. Campylobacter isolates were only found in the interior (35, 0 %) and in the exterior (11, 6 %). Predominantly identified species were Campylobacter lari and Campylobacter coli. Management: Circumstances which might promote the occurrence of Salmonella and Campylobacter were identified. Salmonella positive were the animal environments in farms with more than 12 animals per pen (farm D and F) as well as farms with a stocking number of more than 1000 and more animals (farm C and D). However, the effect of stocking number was not always the case: (farm E and F). It was concluded that the presence of more than one species present on the site (farm C) or not appropriate hygiene and farm management (defect drinking trough facilities, spilling liquid manure [farm D]) might further promote the occurrence of Salmonella in the animal environment. A higher burden of Campylobacter was obtained in the environment of farms without disinfection in contrast to farms performing disinfection (farm A and C), with the exemption of farm F (no disinfection), showing the second lowest Campylobacter detection rate. A massive burden of flies (farm E) went along with a high Campylobacter prevalence in the animal environment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{clinical}} and epidemiological studies listed in re-cent reviews [1 – 3] have highlighted close associations between acute or chronic respiratory diseases and agricul-tural occupational exposure. This is especially {{the case for}} grain workers [4, 5] and swine farmers [6], in whom a risk of chronic airway obstruction has been demonstrated or strongly suspected. Dairy farmers have been less extensively studied. In Fin-land, the annual incidence of chronic bronchitis appears to be higher in farmers than in nonfarmer control subjects [7]. Cross-sectional studies with control groups have sug-gested that dairy farmers have a moderate, but significant, alteration of their expiratory flow rate [8 – 10]; however, such results have not been confirmed by other studies [11, 12] and, to our knowledge, no longitudinal study of respi-ratory function has been conducted in dairy farmers. In the Doubs, a damp and rainy semi-mountainous reg-ion of France, most of the agricultural activity is devoted to dairy farming. In order to obtain the quality stamp for milk and cheeses, most farmers do not use <b>silo</b> <b>feeds</b> or cereal or flour feeds. Moreover, chemical fertilizers and pesticides are not used. Thus, hay and micro-organisms inside constitute the principal occupational exposure.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} was to evaluate the effects of corn silage supplemented with 1 -propanol or inoculated with L. buchneri on the ruminal fermentation profile, digestibility, and production traits of lactating Holstein cows. Whole-corn plants were harvested at 350 g/kg dry matter (DM) and packed in nine bag silos (13 t/silo). At ensiling, two treatments were applied: control (no additive; six silos) and L. buchneri inoculation with 1 × 105 cfu/g (three <b>silos).</b> <b>Feeding</b> started after 247 days of storage; one L. buchneri and two control silos were opened in each experimental period. Twenty-one multiparous Holstein cows (~ 33 kg/day of milk) were allocated to seven balanced 3 × 3 Latin squares with 21 -day periods (14 days of adaptation). The experimental diets contained (DM basis) : 80 g/kg cottonseed, 95 g/kg citrus pulp, 180 g/kg soybean meal, 90 g/kg corn grain (ground), 25 g/kg minerals and vitamins premix, and 530 g/kg of corn silage. Source of corn silage was {{the only difference between}} experimental treatments: control, L. buchneri, or control silage supplemented with 1 -propanol (10 g/kg of diet DM). The 1 -propanol was dissolved in water (1 : 1) and sprinkled onto the ration during mixing, immediately before each feeding. Dry matter intake, nutrient digestibility, milk yield, and composition were not affected by treatments. Cows fed 1 -propanol had greater concentrations of 1 -propanol in the rumen fluid, higher concentration of glucose, and lower concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in blood plasma. Corn silage inoculated with L. buchneri at 1 × 105 cfu/g does not affect silage fermentation, ruminal fermentation profile, or milk production.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} baled silages {{produced}} in Ireland have identified considerable filamentous fungal contamination.

Mycotoxins are potentially detrimental to livestock health and some can pose a risk to consumers of animal products. Baled (n= 20) and pit (n= 18) silages from a sample of farms (n= 38) in Co. Meath were examined to assess the occurrence of mycotoxins and ascertain whether sampling position within the pit <b>silos</b> (<b>feed</b> face vs. 3 m behind the feed face) {{has an effect on}} mycotoxin content or other chemical compositional variables. Of the 20 mycotoxins assayed, baled silages contained [mean of positive values (no. of values in mean) ] mycotoxin concentrations (μg/kg dry matter) of beauvericin 36 (2), enniatin (enn.) A 9. 3 (3), enn. A 1 54 (8), enn. B 351 (9), enn. B 1 136 (10), mycophenolic acid (MPA) 11, 157 (8) and roquefortine C (Roq. C) 1037 (8) and pit silages contained beauvericin 25 (2) enn. A 1 18 (2), enn. B 194 (9), enn. B 1 57 (3), MPA 287 (6), Roq. C 3649 (6) and zearalenone 76 (1). There was no difference (P> 0. 05) observed in the mycotoxin concentrations between baled and pit silages, and 11 of the 20 mycotoxins assayed were below the limits of detection. The position of sampling had no effect on the mycotoxin concentration detected in pit silages. It is concluded that mycotoxin concentrations detected in these pit and baled silages in Co.

This phenomenon is known as dust cloud formation which is likelihood for an explosive atmosphere. Thus, understanding of dust cloud formation in silo is important for safety measures. This paper {{presents the results of}} flow field, in terms of mean and root mean square (RMS) velocity of dust cloud in a <b>silo</b> during axial <b>feeding</b> using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code,Fluent. The influence of grid size, modeling approach and discretization schemes were examined using turbulence model namely renormalization group k-ε (RNG) combined with disperse phase model (DPM) which follows Eulerian-Lagrangian (E-L) approach. The E-L approach treats solid particles as moving points in the computational domain and their movement is tracked as they moved through the gas flow. Two-way coupling effect was considered since the continuous phase flow field is impacted by the discrete phase. The profiles of mean and RMS velocity at five different axial locations Z = 750 mm, 1750 mm, 2750 mm, 3750 mm and 4750 mm were examined to recognized the flow pattern inside silo. Predicted mean and RMS velocity using combination of DPM and RNG turbulence model with various discretization and pressure interpolation schemes were plotted and compared against experimental measurement adopted from literature,showing a plausibly good agreement with second order upwind scheme and standard pressure interpolation scheme. It was found that predicted flow field has a great influence to the silo height. Higher mean velocity in downward direction was predicted in the center region closer {{to the top of the}} silo due to gravitational force on the particles. Moreover, it was found that turbulence flow (RMS velocity) is correspondingly increase with increasing the axial positions, indicating that region closer to the feeding inlet favor the initial turbulence formation. This suggests that combination of RNG turbulence model and DPM could be employed in dust cloud formation study...|$|R

In the same time, 391 feed samples and 234 serum samples were analysed for zearalenone. On average, 17, 7  % (n= 68) of the feed samples and 55, 2  % (n= 182) of the serum samples were ochratoxin A positiv. Zearalenone was found in 74, 4  % (n= 291) of the feed samples and in 6, 0  % (n= 14) of the serum samples. Those results showed that an individual determination of the recovery rate for each feed sample is very important for the real value. If ochratoxin A was traced in the feed, it can also be found in the sera of pigs fed with this feed. Due to the different detectibility limits with 0, 1  ppb in sera and 1  ppb in feed, even smallest amounts can be analysed in the blood serum. If zearalenone intoxication is suspected, the feedstuff analysis is to prefer because the half time period of zearalenone in blood is very short. In this study different influences on the intoxication levels could be shown: Seasonality: The frequency of intoxication increases with the time of feed storage. Because of the varing climatic circumstances, the values differ from year to year. Farm type: More frequently, the serum samples of fattening herds were more often ochratoxin A positiv than the samples of sow herds. Zearalenone was found more frequently in feed of fattening herds than in sow herds. Storing type: Compared to indoor silo or storage on the floor, the ochratoxin A contamination of the <b>feed</b> in outdoor <b>silos</b> was lower. The highest ochratoxin A-contamination rate was found by storage in sacks or on the floor. The highest zearalenone contamination rate was found in feed stored in outdoor silo. Feedstuff derivation: In comparison to pigs which got home mixed feed, pigs supplied with purchased feed showed serologically more ochratoxin A positiv results. There was no different in the zearalenone contamination of purchased feed and home mixed feed. Straw bedding: The analysis of straw often showed high values of both mycotoxins. Therefore, an analysis of the straw seams to be necessary if an intoxication with mycotoxins is suspected. This study demonstrates that samples accidentially taken for the field study are more frequently ochratoxin A contaminated than toxin-suspected samples. It showed further more, that in toxin-suspected feed samples zearalenone was more frequently detected than in the samples of the field study.
