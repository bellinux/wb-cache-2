I had one advantage over them, however, for when I was no longer a novelty, I could occasionally slip in, unperceived, behind an immense marquetry bureau. There in the dust I could sit at peace, comparing its back with its front, and could enjoy at leisure the conversation beyond.|$|R

He finished ahead of Zane Jordan of Zambia (58.77 seconds) but behind heat winner Barbados's Bradley Ally (56.27 seconds). Unamboowe finished 42nd out of 43 competitors overall, and did not advance into the semi-final after finishing 3.42 seconds behind the slowest swimmer who made the later stages. After his participation ended, he spoke of an pre-existing shoulder injury that was aggravated and underwent physiotherapy upon finding this in his right shoulder: [...] "All I wanted initially was to better the Sri Lanka record.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} I discuss the {{theoretical}} {{issues and the}} aesthetic consequences of dubbing, both in general – when the translation is faithful and the dubbing {{is a good one}} – and in peculiarly bad cases – when either the translation or the dubbing, or both, are inaccurate. Dubbing is widely used in European countries such as Germany, France, the ex-Soviet countries and Italy. Being a film scholar with a specialization in Hollywood cinema, <b>I</b> am <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>watching</b> Hollywood films in their original versions. Being a native Italian speaker, I cannot help but noticing the differences between the original films and the Italian dubbed versions. Inaccurate translations and bad dubbing can severely harm the film's original meaning on the one hand, and lead to aesthetics changes on the other– e. g., an actor's persona or a character's characterization can be modified if dubbed with a voice that is radically different from the original. The case of Marilyn Monroe is exemplary: the Italian dubbing was designed to make her sound definitely more stupid than in the original version – by changing her dialogue, and by choosing a more “goose-like” voice timbre and tone...|$|R

How often have I listened to it as it told the beads of time, and wondered at its constancy!

I said little while I was there, but I thought a good deal, and most of my thoughts were of you. You fancied yourself invisible, but I saw you glaring at me, and I clenched my fists beneath the blankets. I could paint your portrait.

These broad and well-kept pathways rise and decline over the elevations and along the bases of gentle hills which diversify the whole surface of the Park. The loftiest, and most abrupt of them (though but of very moderate height) is one of the earth's noted summits, and may hold up its head with Mont Blanc and Chimborazo, as being the site of Greenwich Observatory, where, if all nations will consent to say so, the longitude of our great globe begins. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> regulate my <b>watch</b> by the broad dial-plate against the Observatory wall, and felt it pleasant to be standing at the very centre of Time and Space.|$|R

Her face has just that peculiarity of her mother's, which, of all human countenances that I have ever known, was the one that passed most quickly and completely from the expression of gaiety to that of repose. Repose in her face always suggested sadness; and while you were watching it with a kind of awe, and wondering of what tragic secret it was the token, it kindled, on the instant, into a radiant Italian smile.

There are the same precious pictures on the walls of the salon--the same great dusky fresco in the concave ceiling. The daughter is not rich, I suppose, any more than the mother.

It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren.
