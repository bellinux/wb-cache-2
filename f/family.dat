5|$|Different {{societies}} and cultures have used <b>family</b> symbols in advertising to varying extents of success. Because <b>family</b> life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend to use more <b>family</b> symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with <b>family</b> advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Family</b> and <b>family</b> history {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his <b>family</b> from Sketch of the Eliot <b>Family,</b> which described how Eliot's <b>family</b> lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the <b>family</b> history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own <b>family</b> when he travelled away from his <b>family,</b> a <b>family</b> that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} the current study is to examine the {{relationship}} and difference between sociodemographic data of <b>families</b> (adoptive- and foster <b>families</b> versus biological <b>families,</b> reconstituted <b>families</b> versus biological <b>families,</b> one-parent <b>families</b> versus two-parent <b>families</b> and big <b>families</b> versus small <b>families)</b> and the risk of child abuse (physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect) for toddlers between the ages of 2 to 4 years old in the Netherlands. The <b>family's</b> experienced burden was chosen as a mediator in this relationship. It was expected that adoptive- and foster <b>families,</b> reconstituted <b>families,</b> one-parent <b>families</b> and big <b>families</b> would experience a higher risk of child abuse, with the <b>family’s</b> burden as a mediator in this relationship. Method: Adoptive- and foster <b>families,</b> sexual abuse and physical abuse {{were not included in the}} research due to limited data. 230 Participants, consisting of the pedagogical assistants of preschools and one parent for every toddler, took part in several questionnaires. MANOVA and multiple regression-analyses were used. Results: Only toddlers living in big <b>families</b> are significantly more at risk of neglect and emotional abuse as opposed to toddlers living in small <b>families.</b> There was no difference between reconstituted and biological <b>families,</b> nor between one-parent and two-parent <b>families</b> regarding the risk of child abuse. The <b>family’s</b> burden was not a significant mediator. Conclusion: Future research should consider a bigger sample of reconstituted and single-parent <b>families</b> and should take into account the parents' bias towards giving socially acceptable answers...|$|R

5|$|The {{extended}} <b>family</b> {{consists of}} grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.

5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>family</b> {{structure in}} the United States is considered a <b>family</b> support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, nuclear <b>family</b> has become less prevalent, and alternative <b>family</b> forms have become more common. The <b>family</b> is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended <b>family</b> of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear <b>family.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractMatroidal <b>families</b> were {{introduced}} by Simões-Pereira [5]. Although we know uncountably many matroidal <b>families</b> of simple graphs and infinitely many matroidal <b>families</b> with multigraphs as members, {{it is an}} open question how one can find all matroidal <b>families.</b> In this paper we give a solution of this problem by certain submodular functions on the set of all finite graphs characterizing the <b>families</b> of connected graphs being matroidal <b>families...</b>|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this article}} is {{concerned}} with two different types of <b>families</b> of finite sets: separating <b>families</b> and splitting <b>families</b> (they are also called "systems"). These <b>families</b> have applications in combinatorial search, coding theory, cryptography, and related fields. We define and study generalizations of these two notions, which we have named $n$-separating <b>families</b> and $n$-splitting <b>families.</b> For each of these new notions, we outline their basic properties and connections with the well-studied notions. We then spend the greatest effort obtaining lower and upper bounds on the minimal size of the <b>families.</b> For $n$-separating <b>families</b> we obtain bounds which are asymptotically tight within a linear factor. For $n$-splitting <b>families</b> this appears to be much harder; we provide partial results and open questions...|$|R
