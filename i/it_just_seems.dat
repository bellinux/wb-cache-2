I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E

These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power.

500|$|The {{radio tower}} scene {{initially}} called for Electro {{to climb to}} {{the very top of}} the structure, a concept the crew found [...] "clunky" [...] throughout the storyboarding and directing process.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} are mixed. Andy Patrizio from IGN.com wrote that [...] "The Robbery" [...] was the best episode of the first season of Seinfeld, saying that it showed [...] "the {{dynamics}} that would come to define the show." [...] However, Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "It lacks the great banter and play that marks the best episodes, but it doesn't come across as a total dud. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> a bit uninspired in the greater scheme of things." ...|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry {{speculated that}} after several episodes of a [...] "semi-normal" [...] Michael, the writers [...] "were aching {{to bring back}} cringe worthy Michael." [...] She criticized the decision, calling his {{behavior}} [...] "borderline ridiculous (and not in a good way). <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> implausible that someone could be so very clueless that they would act like that in public." [...] Skerry however did find high points, such as the opening sequence and any scene with Dwight and Angela. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A".|$|E
500|$|Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, {{reporter}} for the New York Chronicle. Law believed so much in Conran's movie that {{he became one of}} the producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember [...] "any other name coming up. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board." [...] Paltrow said in an interview, [...] "I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|However, Internet {{film critic}} James Berardinelli, {{in spite of}} {{awarding}} it {{two and a half}} stars out of four, gave the film a somewhat scathing review. On his website, Berardinelli wrote that [...] "Meet the Parents is put together like a TV sit-com," [...] that Roach [...] "strings together a series of hit-and-miss lowbrow gags with little care for whether any of the connecting material is coherent, interesting, or enjoyable (in most cases, it's none of those three)" [...] and concluding that [...] "even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it's available on video." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News, another detractor of the film, proclaimed Meet the Parents [...] "only erratically funny" [...] and accused Roach of taking [...] "the cheap way out with a series of unfunny jokes." [...] Critic Peter Bradshaw's review of the film in The Guardian concludes that Meet the Parents [...] "is somehow less than the sum of its parts. It strains to come to life, but never quite makes it." [...] After the film was released on home media, DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone magazine contributor Douglas Pratt in his book Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More! stated that [...] "perhaps in the crowded theater the film is hysterical, but in the quieter venue of home video, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> sadistic, and as the humor evaporates, the holes in the plot become clearer." ...|$|E
500|$|After reading God of War #1, Joe Juba of Game Informer said [...] "If {{you have}} a choice between reading this comic and doing {{something}} else, you should do something else...like play God of War III again." [...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> to be setting Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The idea here screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{negative}} reviews {{came from}} American film critics. Among the negative reviews, Janet Maslin from The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Lynch's taste for brain-dead grotesque {{has lost its}} novelty". Fellow Times film critic Vincent Canby concurred, [...] "It's not the worst movie ever made; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> to be". In his review for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy said, [...] "Laura Palmer, after all the talk, {{is not a very}} interesting or compelling character and long before the climax has become a tiresome teenager". USA Today gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it, [...] "a morbidly joyless affair". Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, [...] "though the movie ups the TV ante on nudity, language and violence, Lynch's control falters. But if inspiration is lacking, talent is not. Count Lynch down but never out". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley described the film as a [...] "perversely moving, profoundly self-indulgent prequel".|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the album on Punknews.org was far more {{critical}} of the album, stating [...] "there is [...] "substance" [...] here—there are guitar solos, tempo changes, gang vocals—but there isn't substance. There's no authenticity; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> like the songs were built from a collection of [...] "brutal" [...] ideas written on pieces of paper, put together in a hat, and splashed out on the floor." [...] The album received a 1.5 out of 5 rating. A review on AbsolutePunk was also critical of the album, stating that while some songs were [...] "heavy, but catchy" [...] and [...] "sounds like {{it would have a}} room full of people moshing until they drop", at some points it feels like the band is [...] "half-arseing it", going on to say [...] "Sometimes you wish they would throw in some thrash beats, and fast riffing. This can disappoint and I feel like a few solo's wouldn't go amiss." [...] However, the reviewer concludes by saying [...] "All in all, Suicide Season has impressed me. The boys from BMTH have come back and shown they aren't just a generic haircuts band." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Don't Stop" [...] {{reflects}} Christine McVie's feelings {{after her}} separation from Fleetwood Mac's bass guitarist, John McVie, {{after eight years}} of marriage. [...] "'Don't Stop' was <b>just</b> a feeling. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a pleasant revelation to have that 'yesterday's gone'," [...] she remembers in The Fleetwood Mac Story: Rumours and Lies, [...] "It might have, I guess, been directed more toward John, but I'm just definitely not a pessimist." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Gun Control" [...] {{was written}} {{following}} the Virginia Tech massacre on April 16, 2007. John-Angus MacDonald said [...] "We {{were sitting around}} the apartment and watching all the coverage from CNN and Fox, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> so blatantly obvious they were beating around the bush.

2500|$|In 2004, she starred {{with her}} The Talented Mr. Ripley co-star Jude Law and Angelina Jolie in the science-fiction film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Her {{role in the}} film was Polly Perkins, a {{reporter}} for the fictional New York Chronicle. Law became one of the producers of the film and used his clout to get Paltrow involved.

2500|$|Unlike Made in the Dark, {{the song}} writing {{approach}} to One Life Stand was {{less of a}} collaborative effort. Only three or four songs were written as a group whilst the rest were written by Goddard and Taylor, though Doyle said [...] "we did have input {{in the way it}} was produced". Doyle described the writing process for the album as [...] "a bit like writing a poem" [...] because there was [...] "a certain structure" [...] that the band needed to work to whilst exercising [...] "as much freedom" [...] as they could. Goddard described the band's approach to song-writing as a [...] "mix of things [...] a lot of very careful thinking about rhythms, and interlaying a lot of different ideas and influences" [...] though, at certain points, there would be the sense that something needed to occur and these elements in songs were created spontaneously from the interaction between himself and Taylor: [...] "this melody will somehow suddenly explode in your mind. It's never planned, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> to happen; almost like it has to." [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love" [...] and [...] "Slush" [...] were written by Taylor whilst Goddard wrote [...] "Brothers". Doyle stated that [...] "One Life Stand" [...] and [...] "I Feel Better" [...] were put together [...] "in a slightly more piecemeal way".|$|E
2500|$|After {{his initial}} failure as a Test batsman in 1955 Barrington [...] "set out to {{eliminate}} fun from his game {{and replace it}} with something very near impregnability". Ian Chappell wrote with feeling [...] "Every so often you encounter a player whose bat seem about a yard wide. It's not, of course. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> that way. England's Ken Barrington was one. Our own Bill Lawry was another. Gee, they were hard to dislodge". This was not always appreciated by the selectors, spectators and the press; and he once met a man on a train who told him [...] "I always switch off the television when you come in". This lack of appreciation may have been affected {{by the fact that he}} scored most of his centuries overseas and that he could play entertaining strokes, but chose not to do so. He was controversially dropped from the England team after 57 Tests for taking over seven hours to make 137 against a weak New Zealand attack in 1965 in which he [...] "almost brought the game to a standstill". But when quick runs were needed in the Fifth Test at Melbourne in 1962–63 he surprised everyone by smashing a hundred off 122 balls and bringing up the century with a six into the stands. Though he rarely expressed open dissent he used to pull faces if he disagreed with an umpire or thought that the light was too bad or the bouncers too frequent. His grimacing and nervous jump when receiving hostile fast bowling led some to believe that he was afraid, but he stood up to Wes Hall, Chester Watson, Charlie Griffith and Peter Pollock even if injured.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Sounds, drummer Mark Brabbs said that [...] "It came from Viv Stanshall's book and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> sounded apt 'cos we all like his humour. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to describe the sort of {{people who came to}} see us when we first started they were the same as us, just having a party, starting drinking each day at lunchtime, so it seemed apt, 'cos we called them The Filth even then, though not in a derogatory way!" ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{these sorts}} of {{evolutionary}} changes continued {{to take place in}} medical practice, it was increasingly necessary to uniquely identify data that was accessible only to the physician, {{and to be able to}} differentiate those observations from others that were also available to the patient, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> natural to use [...] "signs" [...] for the class of physician-specific data, and [...] "symptoms" [...] for the class of observations available to the patient.|$|R
5000|$|The album's {{title is}} taken from William Shakespeare's play, The Life and Death of King John, with Turner noting, [...] "I knew that the album was, for the most part, about mortality, and about Englishness.
