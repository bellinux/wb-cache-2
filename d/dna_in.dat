TTV <b>DNAs</b> <b>in</b> paired serum and liver tissues from three viremic individuals {{were separated by}} gel electrophoresis and characterized biophysically. TTV <b>DNAs</b> <b>in</b> sera migrated in sizes ranging from 2. 0 to 2. 5 kb. TTV <b>DNAs</b> <b>in</b> liver tissues, however, migrated at 2. 0 to 2. 5 kb {{as well as at}} 3. 5 to 6. 1 kb. Both faster- and slower-migrating forms of TTV <b>DNAs</b> <b>in</b> the liver were found to be circular and of the full genomic length of 3. 8 kb. TTV DNAs migrating at 2. 0 to 2. 5 kb, from either serum or liver tissues, were sensitive to S 1 nuclease but resistant to restriction endonucleases, and therefore, they were single-stranded. By contrast, TTV <b>DNAs</b> <b>in</b> liver tissues that migrated at 3. 5 to 6. 1 kb were resistant to S 1 nuclease. They migrated at 3. 7 to 4. 0 kb after digestion with EcoRI, which suggests that they represent circular, double-stranded replicative intermediates of TTV. When TTV DNAs were subjected to strand-specific primer extension and then amplified by PCR with internal primers, those in serum were found to be minus-stranded <b>DNAs</b> while those <b>in</b> liver tissues were found to be a mixture of plus- and minus-stranded DNAs. These results suggest that TTV replicates in the liver via a circular double-stranded DNA...|$|R

5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> living organisms.|$|E

5|$|Within {{eukaryotic}} cells DNA {{is organized}} into long structures called chromosomes.

Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA.

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is a long}} polymer {{made from}} repeating units called nucleotides. The {{structure}} of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. Although each individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} nucleotides. For instance, the <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E
