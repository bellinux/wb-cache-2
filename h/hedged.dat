5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be <b>hedged</b> to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had <b>hedged</b> downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E

In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection {{in order to give}} him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he <b>hedged</b> on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} <b>hedging</b> {{performance}} of the newly established CSI 300 stock index futures over some short <b>hedging</b> horizons. We use wavelet analysis as well as conventional models (na&iuml;ve, ordinary least squares, and error-correction) to compute the constant <b>hedge</b> ratios. The constant conditional correlation (CCC) and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) bivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (BGARCH) specifications are employed to calculate the time-varying <b>hedge</b> ratios. Overall, {{we find that the}} CSI 300 stock index futures can be an effective <b>hedging</b> tool. Among the constant <b>hedge</b> ratio models, the wavelet analysis yields the best in-sample <b>hedging</b> performance, though its out-of-sample <b>hedging</b> performance is similar to other models. Comparing the time-varying ratio models, the CCC BGARCH model is better in terms of in-sample <b>hedging</b> effectiveness while for out-of-sample <b>hedging</b> performance, the DCC model is better with short <b>hedging</b> horizons and CCC model is more favourable with long <b>hedging</b> horizons. Finally, the question whether time-varying ratios outperform constant ratios depends on the length of the <b>hedging</b> horizon.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the management of foreign-exchange risk. We take the perspective of a domestic firm that is exposed to foreign currencies (such as the GBP, CHF, and JPY) operating in a member country of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). Three important questions are involved in hedging: (i) to <b>hedge</b> or not; (ii) the choice of the <b>hedging</b> instrument; and (iii) measurement of the <b>hedge</b> ratio. Our results show that there is no difference in performance and risk under these three <b>hedging</b> strategies (always to <b>hedge,</b> to <b>hedge</b> or not to <b>hedge,</b> and always not to <b>hedge)</b> for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies. Our examination of the effectiveness of three financial <b>hedging</b> techniques&mdash;forward <b>hedging,</b> money-market <b>hedging</b> and cross-currency hedging&mdash;shows that it makes no difference whether we use forward <b>hedging</b> or money-market <b>hedging</b> (for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies). However, in relation to cross-currency <b>hedging,</b> the results are mixed. We find that the effectiveness of cross-currency <b>hedging</b> depends on the correlation between the exchange rates of the base currency against the exposure currency, and the currency used as the <b>hedging</b> instrument. In examining the effectiveness of financial <b>hedging</b> (such as forward <b>hedging)</b> versus operational <b>hedging,</b> (such as risk-sharing arrangements, currency collars, and hybrid arrangements) we find that forward <b>hedging</b> is more effective than either risk-sharing arrangements or hybrid arrangements. However, when compared with currency collars, the results are mixed. Finally, we find that the use of different econometric models to estimate the <b>hedge</b> ratio fails either to add value or improve the effectiveness of the <b>hedge.</b> This implies that {{there is no need for}} a sophisticated econometric model to estimate the <b>hedge</b> ratio, because what matters is correlation...|$|R

George also finished the building of the Hall, and in time established the family amongst the local gentry.

25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them.
