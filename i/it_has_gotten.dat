500|$|The novella has {{received}} significant critical attention {{since it was}} published, along with Vaster than Empires and More Slow, with which it is frequently compared. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> generally positive reviews from critics and scholars, although several noted {{that it was not}} Le Guin's best work. Kirkus Reviews stated in 1976 that the book was [...] "Lesser Le Guin, but often impressive", while Carol Hovanec called it [...] "brief but stunning." [...] Suzanne Reid stated that the novella was [...] "deeply moving and shocking by turns". The novel contrasts good and evil very explicitly, unlike in other Hainish cycle works such as The Left Hand of Darkness or The Dispossessed, which made The Word for World is Forest less complex than those other works.|$|E
500|$|Since the band's 1960s heyday, the {{influence}} of the Monks has grown steadily, beginning with krautrock then followed by successive generations of musicians in disparate genres such as punk rock, experimental, alternative and hip-hop, with acts such as the Dead Kennedys, the Beastie Boys, the White Stripes, and the Fall exhibiting signs of their influence. Music historian Kelley Stoltz described the Monks in 1996 as a group that [...] "overwhelms the listener with a sound they termed 'over-beat' - at their worst it is totally oddball freakrock that sounds like a pleasurable argument". Stoltz concluded the band was an innovative musical act which [...] "outsexed the [...] Pistols" [...] ten years before any other punk band emerged. In his book, The Rough Guide to Rock, writer Peter Buckley had said Black Monk Time has not [...] "aged one iota. If anything, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> stranger".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Anasazi" [...] was rated an A, being described as [...] "mind-blowing if frustrating", with it being noted that the episode [...] "made fans want to fast-forward through summer." [...] Writing The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A-, noting that the episode [...] "has {{a lot of really}} strong moments" [...] and praising Duchovny's acting. However, he felt that the episode marked {{the point at which the}} series' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus, explaining that [...] "it's troubling that instead of answering any big issues here ... the show only gives us new directions". Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I'm proud of the way it came together, what it did for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>gotten.</b> I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered." [...] He later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder. The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E

Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented {{that one of the reasons}} they love the show is because nothing is sacred—it makes jokes and gags of almost everything. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as [...] "a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do."

2500|$|Jonathan Tobin {{wrote in}} The Jewish World Review that [...] "Rosenfeld {{is careful to}} specify that {{questioning}} policies of Israeli governments {{is not the same}} as being anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. But he has the bad manners to point out that those who aggressively question Israel's right to have any government or to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it are, at best, unwitting allies of a growing anti-Jewish movement.... For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to know where we are headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> to the point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E

60|$|And if it {{be asked}} how this {{conception}} of the utmost beauty of ideal form is consistent with what we formerly argued respecting the pleasantness of the appearance of felicity in the creature, let it be observed, and forever held, that the right and true happiness of every creature, is in this very discharge of its function, and in those efforts by which its strength and inherent energy are developed: and that the repose of which we also spoke as necessary to all beauty, is, as was then stated, repose not of inanition, nor of luxury, nor of irresolution, but the repose of magnificent energy and being; in action, the calmness of trust and determination; in rest, the consciousness of duty accomplished and of victory won, and this repose and this felicity can take place {{as well in the}} midst of trial and tempest, as beside the waters of comfort; they perish only when the creature is either unfaithful to itself, or is afflicted by circumstances unnatural and malignant to its being, and for the contending with which it was neither fitted nor ordained. Hence that rest which is indeed glorious is of the chamois couched breathless on his granite bed, not of the stalled ox over his fodder, and that happiness which is indeed beautiful is in the bearing of those trial tests which are appointed for the proving of every creature, whether it be good, or whether it be evil; and in the fulfilment to the uttermost of every command it has received, and the out-carrying to the uttermost of every power and gift <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> from its God.|$|E
