40|$|Orientation: In {{order to}} ensure {{harmonious}} relationships in the workplace, work values of different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> need to be investigated and understood. Research purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the work values of a South African sample from a generational perspective, in order to foster an understanding of the similarities and differences of different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> in terms of work values. Motivation of the study: Understanding the work values of different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> could assist organisations to manage and retain human capital in an increasingly competitive environment. Furthermore, it could assist organisations to develop an advanced understanding of employee behaviour, which should inform conflict-resolution strategies to deal with reported conflict between different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Research design, approach and method: The study was conducted within the positivist paradigm and was quantitative in nature. Data were gathered from 301 employees representing three different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts,</b> namely the Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y. A cross-sectional study was conducted, and data were collected once off by means of the Values Scale. The psychometric properties of the Values Scale have a reliability coefficient of 0. 95, and the scale has been applied successfully in various iterations. Main findings: The findings indicate statistically significant differences and similarities between the various <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> in terms of work values. More specifically, similarities and differences between the various <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> were observed with regard to the values of authority, creativity, risk and social interaction in the work context. Practical/managerial implications: Organisations can use the findings of the study to strengthen employee interaction within the work environment. In addition, the findings can be used to inform retention and management strategies, in {{order to ensure}} harmonious relationships in the workplace. Contribution/value-add: The study contributes to the literature on South African <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> and work values. </p...|$|R

However, the evidence is largely anecdotal. In contrast, empirical studies investigating <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> have provided no consistent picture of a <b>generational</b> <b>cohort's</b> values and characteristics. This thesis investigates whether the popular characteristics of <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> are valid. A total of 164 participants completed a 69 -item questionnaire developed from constructs elicited from 64 repertory grid interviews in which participants identified constructs and rated their importance in their ideal job. More similarities than differences between the cohorts were found, providing limited support for the assertion in the popular literature that there are differences between the <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Limited support was found for the depiction of each of the cohorts in the popular literature and empirical studies. In addition, strong support was found for heterogeneity within cohorts, in particular with respect to gender. The use of linear discriminant analysis identified that only nine of the 69 questions provided a reasonable level of discrimination between the <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts,</b> further supporting the finding that there are more similarities than differences between the cohorts. By removing participants from the cusp years (i. e., either side of the cut-off date for cohorts) the predictive accuracy of correctly assigning participants to the correct cohort increased, supporting the assertion that cohorts are most distinct in the middle and less distinct at the edges. This study contributes to the literature through the development of a sound psychometric model for researching <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> and by providing valuable insight into what the different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> most value in the workplace. The results challenge the depiction of <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> depicted in the popular literature and identified that while there are some differences between the cohorts, there are more similarities than differences. This raises the suggestion that there may be greater heterogeneity within <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> than between them.

50|$|That said, some {{research}} fails to find convincing differences. A meta {{study conducted by}} researchers from The George Washington University and The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences questions the validity of workplace differences across any <b>generational</b> <b>cohort.</b> According to the researchers, disagreement in which events to include when assigning generational cohorts, as well as varied opinions on which age ranges to include in each generational category are the main drivers behind their skepticism. The analysis of 20 research reports focusing on the three work-related factors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to turn over proved any variation {{was too small to}} discount the impact of employee tenure and aging of individuals. Newer research shows that Millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other generations—namely, more money and a more innovative work environment. They look for versatility and flexibility in the workplace, and strive for a strong work-life balance in their jobs and have similar career aspirations to other generations, valuing financial security and a diverse workplace just as much as their older colleagues.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: Engaging {{employees}} and providing employees {{with a sense}} of meaning at work is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Although research has shown that differences between work engagement and meaningful work amongst <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> exist, results are still inconclusive. With age becoming increasingly more important as a diversity factor, {{a better understanding of the}} dynamics between work engagement and meaningful work across different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> is necessary to design the right strategy for each organisation’s unique parameters. Research purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between work engagement and meaningful work and whether there are significant variances between the levels of work engagement and meaningful work between different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Motivation for study: Work engagement has consistently been highlighted by researchers and human resources experts as a recommended solution to provide companies with the upper hand when it comes to creating a competitive edge. Yet, levels of work engagement are far from ideal, requiring intensified efforts to identify solutions towards raising overall engagement levels. In recent years, much of the focus in terms of generating engagement has been aimed in the direction of financial rewards and other benefits; some organisational experts are of the opinion that a shift is occurring towards meaningful work instead of monetary rewards as the driver of engagement. The changing nature of the work landscape also suggests that <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> experience work engagement and meaningful work differently. Understanding these complexities is mandatory in creating solutions towards improving levels of engagement and meaningful work. Research approach, design and method: A cross-sectional quantitative research approach has been followed. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and Psychological Meaningful Scale (PMS) were administered to 261 participants across several financial institutions in Gauteng, including three <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> (Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y). Main findings: A moderate relationship was found to exist between work engagement and meaningful work. The Baby Boomer generation experiences the highest levels of engagement and meaningful work. Significant differences were found between Baby Boomers and Generation X and Baby Boomers and Generation Y. No significant difference were noted between Generation X and Generation Y. Practical/managerial implications: A one-size-fits-all strategy to improve work engagement and the sense of meaning in work does not exist. Results of this study suggest that various approaches based on the needs of each cohort may be required in order to sustain engagement. Older workers in particular prove to be far more valuable and productive and should be treated with care. Contribution: Whilst a large amount of information exists in terms of <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts,</b> not all findings are supported by empirical research to link the concept of work engagement to the different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts.</b> The conventional belief that older people are less engaged and do not find meaning in their work has been proven to be a misconception, which highlights the danger of stereotypical beliefs. The findings suggest that older employees are still very valuable resources and can contribute significantly to the organisation’s success, but have different needs and values than other age groups. Customised engagement strategies tailored towards different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> might be more beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Extract] The {{future of}} {{ecotourism}} will depend {{to some extent}} on how well the tourism industry understands the social and demographic trends influencing traveller behaviour. The ecotourism market can be understood by dividing participants using multiple criteria and characteristics, including gender, age, cultural background, attitudes, motives and activity preferences. Some authors have argued that <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> theory provides another framework for investigating consumer behaviour (Stevens, Lathrop & Bradish, 2005). <b>Generational</b> <b>cohort</b> theory posits that each generation is characterized by somewhat predictable traits directly attributable to events in their formative years. Insights gained through generational theory {{have the potential to}} inform our understanding of attitudes, intentions and visitor behaviour trends in ecotourism. A <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> approach can be useful for not only analysing trends in ecotourism consumption but also production (Pendergast, 2010). From a production perspective, the contemporary tourism industry is experiencing a generational shift, with Baby Boomers likely to retire from leadership roles in the workforce, Generation X taking over the reins and Generation Y entering the workforce...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{congruency}} between the self-identity of Baby Boomer, Generation X and Generation Y consumers with the generational label and popularised identity of each <b>generational</b> <b>cohort.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using a mixed methods approach of focus groups (n= 49) followed by an online survey (n= 627) of Baby Boomer, Generation X and Generation Y consumers. Focus group data were thematically analysed. Descriptive, ANOVA and factor analysis was conducted on the survey data. Findings - The results show that most consumers only have a vague association with their generational label and profile and find it easier to characterise generations that are different to their own. Generation self-identity congruency is greater among members of the Baby Boomer cohort compared to the younger generations. Yet, even in the Baby Boomer cohort, generational identity is not homogenous among its members. Practical implications - The results challenge the explicit use of generational labels and stereotypes in marketing strategy. Originality/value - Given the immense interest and application of <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> segmentation, understanding whether and why consumers identify with cohort labels and profiles is critical. The paper questions the longevity of <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> analysis given the limited understanding and relevance of this concept to consumers.

40|$|Advertising is a {{major part}} of the {{communication}} between companies and consumers. It is supposed to create awareness and attention toward the aimed target group. For an advertisement to get the right response it is important for companies to create and uphold a relationship with their consumers. Recent research acknowledges that different advertising strategies can create different responses. Continuously, different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> have different values, perspectives and backgrounds, and therefore their perception can differ as well. It can hence be important to explore how consumers perceive different advertising strategies and if there is a difference in perception according to <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts.</b> This study intends to examine how traditional and ambient advertising in Sweden is perceived by Swedish consumers within Generation X and Generation Y. Furthermore if there is a difference between these two generational cohorts’ perception. From this the authors want to find out if it is appropriate to create the same advertisements for both generations in Sweden, or if the different <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> demand different advertising strategies. For this study, a conceptual model was based on the process of perception, through which the <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> and advertising concepts were examined. The authors additionally researched advertising properties, and their effect on consumers’ perceptions toward advertising. This research was conducted as a mix of multiple-case study and cross-sectional design. It further used a qualitative approach, using semi-structured focus groups to retrieve a deeper understanding of consumer perception and the underlying reasons behind such behavior. The conclusion that can be inferred from this thesis is that Generation Y perceives ambient advertising as better than Generation X, since they are more open to interaction with marketing events. Generation X instead perceives traditional and ambient advertising as equally powerful. Yet, the differences between the two cohorts are small, and according to some advertising properties, minimal...|$|R

40|$|Entrepreneurs {{are seen}} to {{play a vital role}} in the growth of an economy, {{particularly}} in an emerging market such as South Africa. To date, there has been a limited amount of research concerning the drivers, influences and factors that predispose an individual towards entrepreneurial intent within the South African context. Equally so, there is little research on generational theory and how this relates to entrepreneurial activity as a whole. This study focuses on comparing the X and Y generational cohorts in terms of their propensity towards entrepreneurial intent within the context of South Africa. Research was conducted following an in depth literature review which focused on the concept of entrepreneurship and its effect on the economy, generational theory and the interaction and influence of <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> theory on the drivers of entrepreneurial intent. The data gathered through the course of the literature review was utilised as a theoretical foundation on which to build propositions of entrepreneurial intent and from which a quantitative survey instrument was developed. The quantitative survey was open to any South African individual who falls within the X or Y <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> as defined in this study. Key findings include similarities and differences between the X and Y <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> individuals in terms of the following aspects: education and entrepreneurial training; exposure to technology; problem solving; leadership orientation; visionary perspective; the influence of family and organisational support networks; creativity and innovation, attitude towards risk-taking and self-confidence.

40|$|Social {{sponsorship}} {{has increased}} interest {{both in the}} academic area and in practice as a marketing communication tool to achieve brands’ objectives. Participation in social sponsorship enhances a brand’s goodwill and brand equity as well as image. Despite growing interest in social sponsorship, few studies have utilised <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> and self-congruity theory in one study, especially in a social sponsorship context. This study explored how generational cohorts’ self-congruity influences sponsorship attitude within social sponsorship, particularly {{in the context of}} a developing country, Malaysia. Three specific questions have been raised: (1) does self-congruity of different generational cohorts affect preferences for social sponsorship programmes? (2) Does it affect sponsor attitudes and loyalty? (3) To what extent does ethnicity impact generational cohorts’ preferences for sponsorship programmes? This study believes that generational cohorts have varying degrees of self-congruity, and a brand might consider participating in social sponsorship programmes congruent with its target consumers. This study applied <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> theory as a segmentation technique to identify consumers’ characteristics and the segmentation of the consumers. Besides, self-congruity theory was used to evolve the degree of consumers’ self-congruity with social sponsorship programmes based on <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> profiles (e. g. characteristics, preferences, and attitudes). Malaysia was chosen as a context for this study because of the country’s ethnic diversity, as well as being a plural society where all ethnic groups experience socialisation processes separately. An experimental method was applied in this study. Among the respondents, there were two generational cohorts (Boomers and Generation Y) and two ethnic groups (Malays and Chinese). The respondents included current students, alumni, students’ parents or relatives, and staff of Malaysian public universities. In total, this study collected 501 useable responses among the treatment and control groups.   Single and multi-group analysis was applied to analyse the data since this study aimed to investigate differences between generational cohorts and ethnic groups with respect to attitudes towards sponsorship and brand loyalty. Hence, a combination of analysis methods has been employed such as the t-test, ANOVA and Covariance-based Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). This study found that <b>generational</b> <b>cohort</b> profiles influenced consumers’ responses on perceived congruency with a social sponsorship programme (i. e. event, brand and media). Findings from the research suggest that consumers held a more favourable attitude towards social sponsorship and brand loyalty that was congruent to them. On the other hand, both generational cohorts did not statistically differ on their attitudes toward sponsorship for international events and brands. In terms of ethnicity, the study found mixed findings on social sponsorship preferences and sponsorship attitudes. Interestingly, this study found that ethnicity affects Malays and Chinese Gen Y’s attitudes towards sponsorship on both brand conditions (i. e. ethnic-based and international) since both ethnic groups perceived congruency differently. This study contributes to the growing body of research on social sponsorship since it is the first study that attempts to utilise <b>Generational</b> <b>Cohort</b> Theory and Self-congruity theory in a social sponsorship context and developing country. It also contributes to developing and empirically testing models in heterogeneous environments (i. e. across generational cohorts and in a multicultural society), especially in a developing country. From a managerial perspective, this study allows brands to identify a social sponsorship programme’s congruence with its own consumers’ self-congruity. Brands will then be able to implement social sponsorship programmes that are congruent with their target consumers and that achieve their objectives...|$|E

One of the questions the study attempts to answer is whether shopping is primarily a family activity in the Emirate of Dubai. The findings of the study will help retailers to organise store atmospherics, choose appropriate merchandise and store location etc to encourage maximum store traffic. A survey of Boomlets and their Boomer parents was conducted using an instrument with 15 questions. The results were analysed using frequency and cross tab functions in SPSS. The findings point out that there is a perceivable difference in the shopping orientations of the two cohorts and so mall managers and retailers have to engage in micro merchandising. There has been no study of <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> in the region and hence this study is of great value...|$|R

The first part addresses the importance of spelling out historical contexts for understanding virtually any aspect of the study of immigration and incorporation. By not doing so, we are left with an elegant but ahistorical positivism. The second section specifies the size and composition - and definition - of what are loosely referred to as the immigrant first and second “generations” in the United States, outlines a typology of distinctive <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> (based on differences in nativity and age at arrival), and analyzes their patterns of acculturation as well as educational and occupational attainment. In particular, I consider the utility and validity of “lumping” vs. “splitting” such <b>generational</b> <b>cohorts</b> {{in the study of the}} adaptation of foreign-born immigrant children and the native-born children of immigrants. These distinctions - in a field where the study of intergenerational relations has been criticized as ahistorical - underscore the importance of situating and understanding generational processes in specific historical contexts...|$|R
