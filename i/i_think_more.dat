In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979 (eight years after Reinboldt's high school {{graduation}} in 1971), her brother {{had told her that}} he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. [...] Jolene said that Hastert [...] "damaged Steve <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> than any of us will ever know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Masters {{described}} her fiction: [...] "All my writing is about human behaviour. There's not much drama, no great happenings in it. No violence. It's about the violence that's inside the human heart, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>more</b> than anything else". In the same interview she also credits her journalistic career for helping her creative writing: [...] "you would sometimes take quite an ordinary and humble person {{and write a}} story about them, and you'd {{be surprised at the}} quality that there was in the ordinary human being ... I learned a lot about human nature, and human behaviour, as a journalist ... there is more in life, more in situations, than meets the eye".|$|E

In an interview with Metal Hammer magazine, Sykes states that this album is [...] "100% different" [...] from Count Your Blessings. He also says: [...] "We experimented a lot more <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>more</b> with other styles of music we all enjoy, using different instruments and technology, by bringing a lot of digital stuff to the table. Every track is different." [...] Because of this drastic change in sound from Count Your Blessings they experienced a massive fanbase shift.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} its {{discovery}} {{was announced in}} the scientific and the popular press, the fossil was characterized as the [...] "most complete fossil primate ever discovered"; Sir David Attenborough has described it as [...] "extraordinary". Google commemorated the unveiling with a themed logo on May 20, 2009. During a ceremony at the American Museum of Natural History Hurum said that [...] "This specimen is like finding the Lost Ark for archeologists" [...] and [...] "It is the scientific equivalent of the Holy Grail. This fossil {{will probably be the}} one that will be pictured in all textbooks for the next 100 years." [...] Regarding the publicity, Matt Cartmill an anthropologist from Duke University said [...] "The P.R. campaign on this fossil is <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> of a story than the fossil itself".|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. Regarding {{the pace of}} the two-parter {{and the rest of the}} season episodes, he said, [...] "American Horror Story is always about a slow rollout of the season of reveals. The pace of these two is a little slower. The scenes are longer and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> thoughtful than {{the pace of the}} first three. These are two of my favorite episodes in the history of the show. Also, in these episodes, I think we really understand the world a little more and what we're trying to write about which is the horror of the insane asylum back in the '50s and '60s and the degradation and the abuse, the real-life horrors. I think we really hit that in a great way in the Anne Frank story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orwig was the {{athletic}} director at Indiana University from 1961 to 1975. [...] He took over as athletic director in February 1961, ten months into a four-year NCAA probation. [...] On accepting the post, Orwig said: [...] "No strong athletic department has been built on fraud. [...] We'll never have {{a part of that}} as long as I am the director at Indiana University. [...] I know there have been mistakes made here, but I think they've been honest ones. [...] These are mistakes to be corrected." [...] In the 61 years preceding Orwig's arrival, Indiana had won 49 conference championships and seven NCAA championships. [...] During Orwig's 15 years, the Hoosiers won 37 Big Ten championships in seven sports and six NCAA titles including a tie for the Big Ten football title in 1967 and a Rose Bowl appearance. [...] Home football attendance at Indiana averaged 25,854 the year before Orwig arrived, and by 1969 it had more than doubled to 53,319. [...] Orwig also guided the expansion of the school's athletic facilities, including the Assembly Hall basketball facility. [...] Among the coaches hired by Orwig were John Pont in football and Bobby Knight in basketball. [...] Bobby Knight said of Orwig: [...] "Bill Orwig, {{the athletic}} director who hired me, was a man of exceptional intelligence and class who knew how to get along with people and work with coaches. He had a great arrogance, in a positive way—he knew he was damned good at what he did. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> than anybody else in the school's history, Bill Orwig developed Indiana's athletic program into a major league operation—facilities, teams, coaches. [...] Sam Bell was a nationally respected track coach. Doc Counsilman {{was one of the great}} coaches of all time; John Pont took a team to the Rose Bowl; and Jerry Yeagley started the soccer program and built it from nothing into the best one going. [...] The architect of all that, Bill Orwig, is in the college athletic directors hall of fame." [...] He was also one of the founders and the first president from 1969-1970 of the National Athletic Directors of America.|$|E
