MMMol cells infected by <b>GALV</b> are resistant to subsequent infection not only by <b>GALV</b> but also by amphotropic murine leukemia virus. This suggests that <b>GALV</b> can enter MMMol via not only the <b>GALV</b> receptor (MolPit 1) but also the amphotropic murine leukemia virus receptor (MolPit 2). Therefore, MolPit 2 was cloned, sequenced, and compared with the previously reported sequence of MolPit 1. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} a stretch of nine residues (position 550 to 558) in the fourth extracellular domain of Pit 1 is crucial for <b>GALV</b> entry and that an acidic residue at position 550 is indispensable. However, MolPit 1 has isoleucine at this position and MolPit 2 has glutamine at the corresponding position (position 522), thus breaking this consensus. To determine what effect these specific changes in the fourth extracellular domain of MolPit 1 and MolPit 2 have on <b>GALV</b> receptor function, chimeric receptors were made by substituting the fourth extracellular domain of either MolPit 1 or MolPit 2 for the same region of Pit 2, a nonfunctional receptor for <b>GALV.</b> These chimeras were then tested in MDTF, a cell line that lacks functional <b>GALV</b> receptors and is resistant to <b>GALV.</b> Results show that MDTF expressing these chimeras became susceptible to <b>GALV,</b> whereas cells expressing wild-type Pit 2 remained resistant.

40|$|HIV- 1 forms {{infectious}} particles with Murine Leukemia virus (MLV) Env, but {{not with}} the closely related Gibbon ape Leukemia Virus (<b>GaLV)</b> Env. We have determined that the incompatibility between HIV- 1 and <b>GaLV</b> Env is primarily caused by the HIV- 1 accessory protein Vpu, which prevents <b>GaLV</b> Env from being incorporated into particles. We have characterized the ‘Vpu sensitivity sequence ’ in the cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of <b>GaLV</b> Env using a chimeric MLV Env with the <b>GaLV</b> Env CTD (MLV/GaLV Env). Vpu sensitivity is dependent on an alpha helix with a positively charged face containing at least one Lysine. In the present study, we utilized functional complementation to address whether all the three helices in the CTD of an Env trimer have to contain the Vpu sensitivity motif for the trimer to be modulated by Vpu. Taking advantage of the functional complementation of the binding defective (D 84 K) and fusion defective (L 493 V) MLV and MLV/GaLV Env mutants, we were able to assay the activity of mixed trimers containing both MLV and <b>GaLV</b> CTDs. Mixed trimers containing both MLV and <b>GaLV</b> CTDs were functionally active and remained sensitive to Vpu. However, trimers containing an Env with the <b>GaLV</b> CTD and an Env with no CTD remained functional but were resistant to Vpu.

40|$|Region A of Pit 1 (residues 550 to 558 in domain IV) {{and related}} receptors has {{remained}} the only sequence implicated in gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> infection, and an acidic residue at the first position appeared indispensable. The region has also been proposed to be the <b>GALV</b> binding site, but this lacks empirical support. Whether an acidic residue at the first position in this sequence is a definitive requirement for <b>GALV</b> infection has also remained unclear; certain receptors retain function {{even in the absence}} of this acidic residue. We report here that in Pit 1 an acidic residue is dispensable not only at position 550 but also at 553 alone and at both positions. Further, the virus requires no specific residue at either position. Mutations generated a collection of region A sequences, often with fundamentally different physicochemical properties (overall hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity and net charge of - 1, or 0, or + 1), and yet Pit 1 remained an efficient <b>GALV</b> receptor. A comparison of these sequences and a few previously published ones from highly efficient <b>GALV</b> receptors revealed that every position in region A can vary without affecting <b>GALV</b> entry. Even Pit 2 is nonfunctional for <b>GALV</b> only because it has lysine at the first position in its region A, which is otherwise highly diverse from region A of Pit 1. We propose that region A itself is not the <b>GALV</b> binding motif and that other sequences are required for virus entry. Indeed, certain Pit 1 /Pit 2 chimeras revealed that sequences outside domain IV are specifically important for <b>GALV</b> infection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GaLV)</b> Env protein mediates {{entry into}} {{a wide range of}} human cells and is {{frequently}} used to pseudotype retroviral vectors. However, an incompatibility exists between <b>GaLV</b> Env and lentiviral vectors that results in decreased steady-state levels of the mature <b>GaLV</b> Env in cells and prevents its incorporation into lentiviral vector particles. Results We identified the HIV- 1 Vpu protein as the major cause of the depletion in <b>GaLV</b> Env levels that occurs when lentiviral vector components are present. This activity of Vpu targeted the mature (cleaved) form of the <b>GaLV</b> Env that exists within or beyond the trans-Golgi. The activity required two conserved phospho-serines in the cytoplasmic tail of Vpu that are known to recruit β TrCP, a substrate adaptor for an SCF E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and could be blocked by mutation of lysine 618 in the <b>GaLV</b> Env tail. Moreover, the Vpu-mediated decrease of <b>GaLV</b> Env levels was inhibited by the lysosomal inhibitor, bafilomycin A 1. Interestingly, this activity of Vpu was only observed in the presence of other lentiviral vector components. Conclusions Similar to the mechanism whereby Vpu targets BST- 2 /tetherin for degradation, these findings implicate β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and the endo-lysosomal pathway in the degradation of the <b>GaLV</b> Env by lentiviral vector components. Possibly, the cytoplasmic tail of the <b>GaLV</b> Env contains features that mimic bona fide targets of Vpu, important to HIV- 1 replication. Furthermore, the lack of effect of Vpu on <b>GaLV</b> Env in the absence of other HIV- 1 proteins, suggests that a more complex interaction may exist between Vpu and its target proteins, with the additional involvement of one or more component(s) of the HIV- 1 replication machinery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Murine leukemia virus (MLV) -derived {{envelope}} proteins containing {{alterations in}} or {{adjacent to the}} highly conserved PHQ motif present at the N terminus of the envelope surface subunit (SU) are incorporated into vector particles but are not infectious due to a postbinding block to viral entry. These mutants can be rendered infectious {{by the addition of}} soluble receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins in the culture medium. The RBD proteins that rescue the infectivity of these defective MLV vectors can be derived from the same MLV or from other MLVs that use distinct receptors to mediate entry. We have now constructed functional immunologically reactive gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> envelope proteins, tagged with a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) -derived epitope tag, which are efficiently incorporated into infectious particles. Tagged <b>GALV</b> envelope proteins bind specifically to cells expressing the phosphate transporter protein Pit 1, demonstrating {{for the first time that}} Pit 1 is the binding receptor for <b>GALV</b> and not a coreceptor or another type of <b>GALV</b> entry factor. We have also determined that <b>GALV</b> particles bearing SU proteins with an insertion C-terminal to the PHQ motif (<b>GALV</b> I 10) bind Pit 1 but fail to infect cells. Incubation with soluble <b>GALV</b> RBD renders <b>GALV</b> I 10 particles infectious, whereas incubation with soluble RBDs from MLV or FeLV-B does not. This finding is consistent with the results obtained by Lauring et al. using FeLV-T, a virus that employs Pit 1 as a receptor but requires soluble FeLV RBD for entry. MLV and <b>GALV</b> RBDs are not able to render FeLV-T infectious (A. S. Lauring, M. M. Anderson, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 75 : 8888 - 8898, 2001).

40|$|ABSTRACT Gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> and koala {{retrovirus}} (KoRV) {{most likely}} originated from a cross-species transmission of an ancestral retrovirus into koalas and gibbons via {{one or more}} intermediate as yet unknown hosts. A highly similar virus to <b>GALV</b> has been identified in an Australian rodent (Melomys burtoni) after extensive screening of Australian wildlife. GALV-like viruses have also been discovered in several Southeast Asian species although screening has not been extensive and viruses discovered to date are only distantly related to <b>GALV.</b> We therefore screened 26 Southeast Asian rodent species for KoRV- and GALV-like sequences, using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing, {{in the attempt to}} identify potential <b>GALV</b> and KoRV hosts. Only one species, an undescribed species of Melomys from Indonesia, was positive yielding an endogenous provirus very closely related to a strain of <b>GALV.</b> The sequence of the critical receptor domain for <b>GALV</b> infection in the Indonesian Melomys sp. was consistent with the susceptibility of the species to <b>GALV</b> infection. The discovery of a <b>GALV</b> in a second Melomys species provides further evidence that Melomys {{may play a role in}} the spread of GALV-like viruses, especially since the genus is found in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, connecting the home ranges of koalas and gibbons. IMPORTANCE The gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> and the koala retrovirus (KoRV) are very closely related, yet their hosts are neither closely related nor overlap geographically. Direct cross-species infection between koalas and gibbons is unlikely. Therfore, <b>GALV</b> and KoRV may have arisen via a cross-species transfer from an intermediate host that overlaps in range with both gibbons and koalas. Using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing, we have screened a wide range of rodent candidate hosts from Southeast Asia for KoRV- and GALV-like sequences. Only a Melomys species from Indonesia was positive for <b>GALV.</b> We report the genome sequence of this newly identified <b>GALV,</b> the critical domain for infection of its potential cellular receptor and its phylogenetic relationships with the other previously characterized GALVs.

40|$|At {{least two}} {{subunits}} {{contributed to the}} formation in vitro of a specific complex binding to the AP 1 consensus sequence (TGAGTCA) in the gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> enhancer in MLA 144 cells. This complex can be dissociated on a monomeric <b>GALV</b> oligonucleotide affinity column. One protein, termed the core protein, was retained on the oligonucleotide affinity column. The second protein flowed through the oligonucleotide affinity column and, when alone, did not bind to DNA; however, when present with the core protein, it bound strongly and very specifically to the <b>GALV</b> sequence. MLA 144 cells contained only trace amounts of c-fos and c-jun by immunoblot analysis, suggesting that the proteins specifically binding to the <b>GALV</b> AP 1 site were distinct from c-fos and c-jun. In addition to the major complex that recognized the <b>GALV</b> element, MLA 144 cells contained a minor complex that is chromatographically different from and antigenically related to c-fos. The factor in the flowthrough complemented a human T-cell nuclear extract (Jurkat cell line), which, when alone, had no assayable complex that specifically bound to the <b>GALV</b> enhancer; this complementation {{gave rise to a}} specific complex similar to that seen in MLA 144 cells.

40|$|Background: In a {{strategy}} termed Protease Targeting, retroviral vectors carrying an EGF infectivity-blocking domain fused to the N-terminus {{of the envelope}} SU via a MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) -cleavable linker were successfully used to target gene delivery to EGF receptor-(EGF-R-) positive tumour cells over-expressing MMPs. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether this strategy {{could be applied to}} (a) limit the cytotoxic activity of a hyperfusogenic <b>GALV</b> therapeutic gene, and (b) enhance the immune-stimulatory properties of <b>GALV</b> via local, MMP-mediated release human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Methods: We generated <b>GALV</b> envelope expression constructs displaying EGF or GM-CSF blocking ligands at the N-terminus of <b>GALV</b> envelope SU via a non-cleavable, Factor Xa protease or MMP-cleavable linker and investigated their cytotoxicity on MMP-positive and negative cell lines. Results: The unmodified hyperfusogenic <b>GALV</b> envelope was cytotoxic to all cell lines tested. The non-cleavable linker <b>GALV</b> envelope constructs caused no cytotoxicity, demonstrating efficient inhibition by the displayed domains. Moderate activation of fusion of the protease-cleavable linker constructs was observed in all cell lines, regardless of their level of MMP expression and of the specificity of the linker. High levels of the blocking domain were detected in the cell supernatants due to dissociation of the surface unit (SU) from the transmembrane (TM) component of the <b>GALV</b> envelope glycoprotein TM. Conclusions: Unlike protease targeting in the context of retroviral vectors, protease activation of the cytotoxicity of <b>GALV</b> envelope by cleavage of a fusion blocking ligand at the cell surface {{does not appear to be}} specifically mediated by cell-surface MMPs. In addition, shedding of the SU-fusion protein from the TM limits the general applicability of this strategy for cancer gene therapy.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1960 s and early 1970 s, an {{outbreak}} of lymphoma and leukaemia in gibbons (Hylobatidae), attributed to the retrovirus gibbon ape leukaemia virus (<b>GALV),</b> was widely reported in the literature.

40|$|Retroviral {{transduction}} of CD 34 (+) cells on Retronectin using gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> pseudotyped vectors is inhibited by {{high concentrations}} of vector containing medium (VCM).

Activation of protein kinase C in CD 34 (+) cells with the phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate) increased the mRNA level of the <b>GALV</b> receptor (GLVR 1) and the transduction efficiency (TE), and fully reversed the inhibition of transduction seen with high-titer <b>GALV</b> VCM. A murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector with the GLVR 1 receptor and green fluorescent protein cDNAs (MGLIG) was used to transduce fibroblasts, and clones expressing different levels of GLVR 1 were isolated. The TE of these cells using a <b>GALV</b> vector correlated with the level of GLVR 1 expression. When CD 34 (+) cells or K 562 cells were first transduced with MGLIG and then with high-titer <b>GALV</b> VCM, no inhibition of transduction was seen.

This incompatibility is modulated by the HIV- 1 accessory protein Vpu. Because the <b>GaLV</b> Env CTD does not resemble tetherin or CD 4, the well-studied targets of Vpu, we sought to characterize the modular sequence in the <b>GaLV</b> Env CTD required for this restriction in the presence of Vpu. Using a systematic mutagenesis scan, we determined that the motif that makes <b>GaLV</b> Env sensitive to Vpu is INxxIxxVKxxVxRxK.

Although many of these positions can be replaced with amino acids with similar biophysical properties without disrupting the Vpu sensitivity, the final lysine residue is required. This Vpu sensitivity sequence appears to be modular, as the unrelated Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Env can be made Vpu sensitive by replacing its CTD with the <b>GaLV</b> Env CTD. In addition, F-MLV Env can be made Vpu sensitive by mutating two amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail to make it resemble more closely the Vpu sensitivity motif.

40|$|Abstract Background Both {{cell-free}} and cell-associated infection routes {{are important}} for retroviral dissemination. Regardless of the mechanism, {{the driving force of}} retroviral entry is the interaction between the viral envelope and its receptor. To date it remains unclear how decreased affinity of viruses for their receptors affects viral cell-free infection, cell-cell transmission, and spreading kinetics. We have previously characterized a mutant form of the amphotropic murine retrovirus receptor human phosphate transporter 2 (PiT 2) wherein the single substitution of a glutamic acid for the lysine residue at position 522 of this receptor is sufficient to render it to function as a gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> receptor. Results In this study we analyzed the binding affinity of the mutant receptor PiT 2 K 522 E and determined that it has a 1000 fold decreased <b>GALV</b> envelope binding affinity compared to the <b>GALV</b> wild type receptor. The decreased affinity does not restrict the initiation of cell-free <b>GALV</b> infection. The diminished binding affinity does, however, correlate with a decrease in the ability of <b>GALV</b> to spread in cells expressing this mutant receptor. Conclusions The reduced ability of <b>GALV</b> to subsequently spread among cells expressing PiT 2 K 522 E is likely resulted from reduced cell-cell transmission, the decreased ability of PiT 2 K 522 E-expressing cells to establish superinfection interference, and attendant cytopathic affects. </p...|$|E
40|$|Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the {{remnants}} of ancient retroviral infections of germ cells and have been maintained in whole or part as heritable genomic elements. The last known endogenization events occurred several million years ago, and therefore stepwise analysis of retroviral endogenization has not been possible. A unique opportunity to study this process became available when a full-length ERV isolated from koalas (KoRV) was shown to have integrated into their germ line within the past 100 years. Even though KoRV shares 78 % nucleotide identity with the exogenous and highly infectious gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV),</b> the infectivity of KoRV, like that of other ERVs, is substantially {{lower than that of}} <b>GALV.</b> Differences in the protein coding regions of KoRV that distinguish it from <b>GALV</b> were introduced into the <b>GALV</b> genome, and their functional consequences were assessed. We identified a KoRV gagpol L domain mutation as well as five residues present in the KoRV envelope (env) that, when substituted for the corresponding residues of <b>GALV,</b> resulted in vectors exhibiting substantially reduced titers similar to those observed with KoRV vectors. In addition, KoRV env protein lacks an intact CETTG motif that we have identified as invariant among highly infectious gammaretroviruses. Disruption of this motif in <b>GALV</b> results in vectors with reduced syncytia forming capabilities. Functional assessment of specific sequences that contribute to KoRV's attenuation from a highly infectious GALV-like progenitor virus has allowed the identification of specific modifications in the KoRV genome that correlate with its endogenization...|$|E
40|$|The amphotropic murine {{retrovirus}} receptor Ram- 1 shows significant sequence {{similarity to}} the gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> receptor Glvr- 1, {{and both of}} these cell surface virus receptors normally function as sodium-dependent phosphate symporters. However, Ram- 1 from humans or rats does not serve as a receptor for <b>GALV,</b> and Glvr- 1 from humans does not serve as a receptor for amphotropic virus. Here we show that the murine retrovirus 10 A 1 can enter cells by using either Glvr- 1 or Ram- 1. Furthermore, we have constructed Ram- 1 /Glvr- 1 hybrid receptors that allow entry of both <b>GALV</b> and amphotropic virus. While <b>GALV</b> and amphotropic virus are in separate interference groups when assayed on human cells, they do interfere {{with each other in}} cells expressing the hybrid receptor. These results indicate a close functional relationship between retroviruses that utilize members of this newly defined receptor family and provide a molecular explanation for nonreciprocal and cell type-specific interference observed for some retrovirus classes...|$|E
40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) have the {{capacity}} to maintain hematopoiesis throughout life. HSCs are ideal targets for permanent gene transfer, as the transgene will be expressed in all the progeny of the gene-modified stem cells. The aim of this thesis was to optimize conditions for retroviral gene transfer to human candidate HSCs and to study mechanisms interfering with efficient gene transfer. First, long-term bone marrow culture transduction of murine hematopoietic cells was investigated, showing inefficient gene transfer and loss of repopulating ability of the transduced cells. Thereafter, transduction of human CD 34 + cells was studied using the MGIN vector with the <b>GALV,</b> amphotropic and VSV-G envelopes. Amphotropic, and, particularly, <b>GALV</b> vector containing medium (VCM) inhibited transduction on fibronectin preloaded with vector. <b>GALV</b> VCM inhibited transduction of NOD/SCID repopulating cells (SRCs) as well. Optimal transduction was seen with vector preloaded to fibronectin and cells added in medium without vector. To study the mechanisms underlying <b>GALV</b> vector mediated inhibition, the GLVR 1 receptor was overexpressed using phorbol ester or a retroviral vector, showing complete abolishment the inhibitory effect from <b>GALV</b> VCM. Together our results show that low levels of GLVR 1, in combination with non-infectious vector particles in VCM, limit transduction of hematopoietic progenitors. Finally, vectors with <b>GALV,</b> amphotropic and VSV-G envelopes were compared regarding their ability to transfer genes to SRCs. The different pseudotypes were equally efficient in the presence of serum with an average transduction efficiency of 25 - 33 % of SRCs, but the engraftment levels were reduced compared to fresh cells. Only the <b>GALV</b> vectors could be used under serum-free conditions showing high level transduction of SRCs (46 %) without loss of SRC frequency as analyzed by transplantation at limiting cell numbers. In conclusion, under optimal conditions, highly efficient gene transfer human hematopoietic cells with NOD/SCID repopulating ability could be accomplished. However, for clinical applications, safety issues, particularly regarding the risk of mutagenesis from retroviral vector insertion into the genome of repopulating cells, need to be adressed carefully...|$|E
40|$|BHK cells remain {{resistant}} to xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (XMRV) or gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GALV)</b> infection, {{even when their}} respective receptors, Xpr 1 or PiT 1, are expressed. We set out to determine the stage at which viral infection is blocked and whether this block is mediated by a dominant-negative factor or {{the absence of a}} requisite ancillary factor. BHK cells bind neither XMRV nor <b>GALV</b> envelope proteins. BHK cells expressing the appropriate receptors bind XMRV or <b>GALV</b> envelope proteins. BHK cells can be infected by NZB-XMV(New Zealand Black mouse xenotropic murine virus) -enveloped vectors, expressing an envelope derived from a xenotropic retrovirus that, like XMRV, employs Xpr 1 as a receptor, and also by vectors bearing the envelope of 10 A 1 murine leukemia virus (MLV), a murine retrovirus that can use PiT 1 as a receptor. The retroviral vectors used in these analyses differ solely in their viral envelope proteins, suggesting that the block to XMRV and <b>GALV</b> infection is mediated at the level of envelope-receptor interactions. N-linked glycosylation of the receptors was not found to mediate resistance of receptor-expressing BHK cells to <b>GALV</b> or XMRV, as shown by tunicamycin treatment and mutation of the specific glycosylation site of the PiT 1 receptor. Hybrid cells produced by fusing BHKXpr 1 or BHKPiT 1 to XMRV- or GALV-resistant cells, respectively, can mediate efficient XMRV or <b>GALV</b> infection. These findings indicate that BHK cells lack a factor that is required for infection by primate xenotropic viruses. This factor is not required for viruses that use the same receptors but were directly isolated from mice...|$|E
40|$|Identification and cloning of the receptors for amphotropic {{murine leukemia}} virus (A-MuLV) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (<b>GaLV)</b> have both enabled the {{determination}} of the normal function of these virus receptors in cells and initiated experimental examination of how these receptors interact with their respective viruses. <b>GaLV</b> and A-MuLV have distinct host ranges and use different receptors to infect human cells. It was therefore surprising to find that the human <b>GaLV</b> and A-MuLV receptors were not only structurally similar but performed similar cellular functions (B. O'Hara, S. V. Johann, H. P. Klinger, D. G. Blair, H. Rubinson, K. J. Dunn, P. Sass, S. M. Vitek, and T. Robbins, Cell Growth Differ. 1 : 119 - 127, 1990; M. van Zeijl, S. V. Johann, E. Closs, J. Cunningham, R. Eddy, T. B. Shows, and B. O'Hara, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 : 1168 - 1172, 1994; M. P. Kavanaugh, D. G. Miller, W. Zhang, W. Law, S. L. Kozak, D. Kabat, and A. D. Miller, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 : 7071 - 7075, 1994; and Z. Olah, C. Lehel, W. B. Anderson, M. V. Eiden, and C. A. Wilson, J. Biol. Chem., in press). We have now determined that the murine retrovirus 10 A 1 can use both the human <b>GaLV</b> receptor and the human A-MuLV receptor to infect cells. Furthermore, we have cloned and functionally characterized a unique form of the amphotropic receptor homolog expressed in E 36 hamster cells. This receptor (EAR) can serve as both a <b>GaLV</b> receptor and an A-MuLV receptor, and it therefore differs from the receptors expressed in human cells, which function exclusively as either <b>GaLV</b> or A-MuLV receptors...|$|E
