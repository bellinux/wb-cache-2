The learning models compared were RBL, PBL and Direct learning model. Data analysis techniques used to test the hypothesis was two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The conclusions of {{the research}} were as follows. 1) RBL and PBL learning models <b>have</b> produced <b>the</b> same mathematics achievement, but RBL and PBL learning models <b>have</b> produced <b>the</b> mathematics learning achievement better than Direct Learning. 2) learners who <b>have</b> high and medium mathematical communication skills <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> same mathematics achievement, and learners with medium and low mathematical communication skills also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same mathematics achievement. But, learners with high mathematical communication skills <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a better mathematical achievement than learners with low mathematical communication skills. 3) learners with high mathematical communication skills who are learning by using RBL, PBL, and Direct learning model <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> same mathematics achievement. Learners with medium mathematical communication skills who are learning by using RBL, PBL, and Direct learning model also <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> same mathematics achievement.
