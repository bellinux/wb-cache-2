50|$|Similitude {{analysis}} {{is a powerful}} engineering tool to design the scaled-down structures. Although both dimensional analysis and direct use of the governing equations {{may be used to}} derive the scaling laws, the latter results in more specific scaling laws. The design of the scaled-down composite structures can be successfully carried out using the complete and partial similarities.In the design of the scaled structures under complete similarity condition, all the derived scaling laws must be satisfied between the model and prototype which yields the perfect similarity between the two scales. However, the design of a scaled-down structure which is perfectly similar to its prototype has the practical limitation, especially for laminated structures. Relaxing some of the scaling laws may eliminate the limitation of the design under complete similarity condition and yields the scaled models that are partially similar to their prototype. However, The design of the scaled structures under the partial similarity condition must follow a deliberate methodology to ensure the accuracy of the scaled structure in predicting the structural response of the prototype. Scaled models can be designed to replicate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>characteristic</b> (e.g. frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios) of their full-scale counterparts. However, appropriate response scaling laws need to be derived to predict the dynamic response of the full-scale prototype from the experimental data of the scaled model.|$|E
