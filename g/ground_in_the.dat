5|$|At the Pfullendorf heights, {{the fight}} began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured {{fire on the}} Austrians, who took heavy losses, but did not give up the <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> night, Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, {{flanking}} Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened {{to do the same}} to Fontaine and Ferino. As darkness fell, so ended the first day of fighting.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's {{offense was}} led by quarterback Woodrow Dantzler, who {{finished}} the regular season having completed 58 percent of his passes for 1,691 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions.

He caught 27 passes for 288 {{yards and four touchdowns}} during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} on Tristano's importance in jazz history. Max Harrison {{indicated that the}} pianist had limited influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano's albums was in print {{at the time of}} his death, suggested that he was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles of subsequent decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed new <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the music.|$|E

5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{began the}} league {{campaign}} with five points in four games, losing <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league race. They improved in subsequent games, but dropped points two more times, including at the official {{opening of the}} new Estádio da Luz. January was a difficult month for Benfica as they lost the Derby de Lisboa with Sporting, and on 25 January witnessed the death of club player—Miklós Fehér—in {{the middle of a}} game. In February and March, the team fluctuated between winning and losing streaks, including knocking out Rosenborg and losing to Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment {{to the surrounding}} basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E

5|$|Football (soccer), cricket and archery are {{the most}} popular sports in Gangtok. The Paljor Stadium, which hosts {{football}} matches, is the sole sporting <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. Thangka—a notable handicraft—is an elaborately hand painted religious scroll in brilliant colours drawn on fabric hung in a monastery or a family altar and occasionally carried by monks in ceremonial processions. Chhaams are vividly costumed monastic dances performed on ceremonial and festive occasions, especially in the monasteries during the Tibetan new year.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stanwix {{occupied}} a strategic western portage {{known as the}} Oneida Carrying Place (site of modern Rome, New York) between the Mohawk River, which flowed southeast to the Hudson River, and Wood Creek, whose waters ultimately led to Lake Ontario. Built by the British in 1758 during the French and Indian War on the only dry <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, the fort had fallen into disrepair. When the American Revolutionary War widened in 1776 to include the frontier areas between New York and the Province of Quebec, the site again became strategically important.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the problems of}} capacity, the National Stadium was also very well hidden by the neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby <b>Ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. It was only fully visible from across the River Taff in the west. Access to the ground was also very restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.|$|E
