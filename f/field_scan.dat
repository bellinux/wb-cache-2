50|$|Because {{of the low}} {{signal-to-noise}} ratio, as with amateur-radio practice, EME signals can generally only {{be detected}} using narrow-band receiving systems. This means that the only aspect of the TV signal that could be detected is the <b>field</b> <b>scan</b> modulation (AM vision carrier). FM broadcast signals also feature wide frequency modulation, hence EME reception is generally not possible. There are no published records of VHF/UHF EME amateur radio contacts using FM.|$|E

The system, first demonstrated on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 3 [...] used a rapidly rotating color wheel that alternated transmission in red, green and blue. The system transmitted on 343 lines, about 100 less than a black and white set, and at a different <b>field</b> <b>scan</b> rate, and thus was incompatible with television sets currently on the market without an adapter.|$|E

In 1939, RCA paid Farnsworth $1 million for his patents after ten years of litigation, and RCA began demonstrating all-electronic television at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City.

50|$|In the 1970s, {{computers}} and home video game systems began using TV sets as display devices. At that point, a 480-line NTSC signal was {{well beyond the}} graphics abilities of low cost computers, so these systems used a simplified video signal that made each video <b>field</b> <b>scan</b> directly {{on top of the}} previous one, rather than each line between two lines of the previous field. This marked the return of progressive scanning not seen since the 1920s. Since each field became a complete frame on its own, modern terminology would call this 240p on NTSC sets, and 288p on PAL. While consumer devices were permitted to create such signals, broadcast regulations prohibited TV stations from transmitting video like this. Computer monitor standards such as CGA were further simplifications to NTSC, which improved picture quality by omitting modulation of color, and allowing a more direct connection between the computer's graphics system and the CRT.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{magnetic properties}} of an $S$= 1 / 2 quasi-one dimensional organic antiferromagnet, D-F$_{ 5 }$PNN using magnetization measurements taken at temperatures {{as low as}} 0. 5 K. Three distinct phases were observed consisting of uniform, dimerized (D), and incommensurate (I) spin structures in the magnetic field versus temperature plane, where a significant hysteresis appears between D-I transitions in the <b>field</b> <b>scan</b> measurements. A combination of magnon ($S$= 1) and soliton ($S$= 1 / 2) excitations have successfully reproduced the observed magnetic susceptibility. In addition, such excitations provide a reasonable interpretation of the temperature dependent electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra.

The water contents of the hydrogels were controlled by the monomer molar ratio of NIPAAm/AAc, swelling media, and the temperature. In the swelling kinetics, all the dried hydrogels exhibited fast swelling behavior, and the swelling ratios were influenced significantly by the amounts of AEA-PSI and AAc content.
