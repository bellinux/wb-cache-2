5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions {{it has to be}} extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed explanation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> prisons are often violent places, and prisoners {{who wish to}} avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E

2500|$|... 25524.1(b), {{regarding}} {{spent fuel}} storage, was not ripe for review (overturning the district court).

50|$|Care {{was taken}} to {{excavate}} the entire lake floor {{to a depth of}} at least two metres to provide sufficient clearance for boat keels. Another reason given <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such a depth.|$|R
5|$|His {{relationship}} with King Edgar is unclear, particularly given {{the uncertainty of}} Thored's paternity, Oslac being banished from England in 975, the year of Edgar's death. Richard Fletcher, who thought Thored {{was the son of}} Gunnar, argued that Thored's raid on Westmorland was caused by resentment derived from losing out on the ealdormanry to Oslac, and that Edgar thereafter confiscated various territories as punishment. The evidence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Newbald, granted by Edgar to Gunnar circa 963, was bought by Archbishop Osketel from the king sometime before 971, implying that the king had seized the land.|$|E
5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, {{for a variety of}} reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
50|$|From the mid-17th {{century or}} so, France overtook Spain as the {{destination}} for Catholic Irishmen seeking a military career. The principal reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> France <b>was</b> an ascendant power, rapidly expanding its armed forces, whereas Spain was a power in decline.|$|R
2500|$|Sanders {{frequently}} {{appeared in}} ritual photos as robed {{wearing only a}} loincloth while witches surrounding him were naked.

25|$|These {{difficulties}} {{were eliminated}} in 570 BCE when pure silver coins were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BCE. The simplest reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> {{because of the}} gold content, one 14.1gram stater was {{worth as much as}} ten 14.1gram silver pieces.|$|R
5|$|The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface {{is proportional to}} the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, {{the pressure}} difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
5|$|Thored's {{relationship}} with the English monarchy under Æthelred II {{seems to have been}} good. Ælfgifu, the first wife of King Æthelred II, was probably Thored's daughter. Evidence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in the 1150s Ailred of Rievaulx in his De genealogia regum Anglorum wrote that the wife of Æthelred II was the daughter of an ealdorman (comes) called Thored (Thorth). Historian Pauline Stafford argued that this marriage was evidence that Thored had been a local rather than royal appointment to the ealdormanry of York, and that Æthelred II's marriage was an attempt to woo Thored. Stafford was supported in this argument by Richard Fletcher.|$|E
5|$|Two British athletes competed, both in alpine skiing events, and no medals were won. The size of {{the team}} was a {{decrease}} from that which had entered previous Games, in the 1998 Winter Paralympics 20 British athletes had participated. One reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> whilst funding for the two athletes {{was provided by the}} British Paralympic Association, it totalled only £1,500 compared to the £4 million worth of funding available to British athletes at the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E

50|$|Her {{youngest}} daughter, Evelyn Mothemane, was 78 {{when her}} mother celebrated her purported 132nd birthday, meaning {{she would have been}} born {{when her mother}} was 53 or 54.

50|$|Democratic peace theory <b>is</b> {{a theory}} <b>that</b> {{suggests}} {{that the nature of}} democracy means that democratic countries will not go to war with each other. The justifications <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> democracies externalize their norms and only go to war for just causes, and that democracy encourages mutual trust and respect.|$|R
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate}} as his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does not necessarily mean that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|During his exile at Cephellania, Hybrida {{pretended to}} act as {{governor}} of the island which the people secretly allowed. In 49 BC, his nephew, Mark Antony, {{was elected to the}} role of tribune of the people and a legate of Caesar's in Italy. Despite this, Hybrida remained in exile until 47 BC when he returned to Rome at the request of Caesar himself. One possible explanation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mark Antony was indebted to Hybrida; as Hybrida was in exile and had no civil rights, he could not enforce a payment and this suited Mark Antony. Hybrida was a candidate for censorship around 45 BC; his character and support from Mark Antony, however, made his attempt at the position a failure. The final mention of Hybrida during his life comes from Cicero who commented upon Mark Antony's divorce from Antonia Hybrida Major and the insult this conferred upon Hybrida himself.|$|E
50|$|He {{then began}} working with the Bufalino's {{sometime}} in the late 60's he became a made man. Later, with his Bufalino years he then became the boss in 1978 for Bufalino. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Bufalino <b>was</b> imprisoned until 1985. After Sciandra the current boss William D'Elia took over.|$|R
50|$|However, {{during the}} thirteenth century, the system became {{obsolete}} {{for the king}} and then many of the estates passed to the nobility and the church, {{in spite of the}} laws that forbade any diminution of the property. The reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the king's subjects began to pay monetary taxes.|$|R
2500|$|Some critics {{consider}} the GFDL a non-free license. Some reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the GFDL allows [...] "invariant" [...] text which cannot be modified or removed, {{and that its}} prohibition against digital rights management (DRM) systems applies to valid usages, like for [...] "private copies made and not distributed".|$|R
5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E
25|$|Sometime between 1989 and 1994, it {{had changed}} from 04862 to 0483. The {{original}} reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> 04862 <b>was</b> a RING code of GUILDFORD and actually meant 0GU62. British Telecom {{decided to move}} most UK RING codes to their related CORE codes (Guildford CORE code 0483 actually stood for 0GU3).|$|R
25|$|The {{justification}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when wages <b>are</b> higher, {{the supply}} of labor will increase relative to demand, creating an excess supply and thus depressing market real wages; when wages are lower, labor supply will fall, increasing market real wages. This would create a dynamic convergence towards a subsistence-wage equilibrium with constant population.|$|R

5|$|Plant {{material}} {{makes up}} the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs {{spend most of their time}} in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (Taxicodendron radicans), yet have shown no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were {{estimated by the}} US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult. One reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically {{be found in the}} ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine, two pegmatite, and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1955 the British Transport Commission had {{identified}} the line north of Beccles to Great Yarmouth {{as a candidate}} for closure with all trains being diverted via Lowestoft. One of the reasons <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> a number of swing bridges on the route <b>that</b> <b>were</b> expensive to maintain and there was a parallel route via Gorleston.|$|R
