5|$|Adapted from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, {{the film}} has been {{shortened}} and streamlined for the single reel format. The film focuses on a <b>grandfather</b> who gambles himself into poverty. He dotes on his granddaughter, Little Nell, and desires to give her every luxury. The <b>grandfather</b> turns to gambling to try and earn money, firmly believing that luck would favor him. His gambling results in losing everything and Nell fears {{that he will be}} taken away to an asylum. At night, Nell flees with him and they find refuge and shelter with Mrs. Jarley. The <b>grandfather,</b> seeking to win money, robs Nell of her money and proceeds to gamble it away. The <b>grandfather</b> is coerced by men to steal to pay the debts, but Nell intervenes and flees with her <b>grandfather</b> again. Exhausted and feeble in health, Nell meets a kind schoolmaster and appeals to him for aid before falling unconscious at his feet. The schoolmaster takes the two in, but it is too late to save Nell and she dies. Her <b>grandfather</b> is brokenhearted and is found dead on her grave several days later.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Allocation of free {{emissions}} allowances may distort firms' incentives or have adverse distributional effects. Nevertheless, Böhringer and Lange (2005) {{show that}} in a closed emissions trading scheme with a fixed number of firms, a first-best outcome can be achieved if the base year for allocation is continually updated (i. e. updated <b>grandfathering).</b> In this paper we examine whether updated <b>grandfathering</b> alters the entry and exit conditions for firms compared to pure <b>grandfathering,</b> and how the distributional effects are affected. We find that updated <b>grandfathering</b> functions surprisingly similar to pure grandfathering: First, the incentives to entry and exit are identical under the two regimes. Second, {{the total value of}} free quotas to existing firms, based on emissions before the system starts, is identical under pure and updated <b>grandfathering.</b> In both cases, higher prices under updated <b>grandfathering</b> exactly match the shorter time period with free allowances. The only difference occurs when there is some combination of auction and pure or updated <b>grandfathering,</b> in which case the total value of free quotas will always be highest under pure <b>grandfathering.</b> Entry and exit incentives are still the same.

5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal <b>grandfather,</b> with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his <b>grandfather.</b> The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal <b>grandfather,</b> but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal <b>grandfather.</b> And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the <b>grandfather</b> were also inherited along with any property.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the amount of}} <b>grandfathering</b> needed for an emissions trading scheme (ETS) to have a neutral impact on firm profits. We provide a simple formula to calculate profit-neutral <b>grandfathering</b> in a Cournot model with firms of different sizes and a general demand function. Using this formula, we obtain estimates of profit-neutral <b>grandfathering</b> for the electricity, cement, newsprint and steel industries. Under the current EU ETS, firms obtain close to full grandfathering; we show that while this may still leave some firms worse off, others have probably benefitted substantially. We find no evidence that any {{industry as a whole}} could be worse off with full <b>grandfathering.</b> We also show that the common presumption that a higher rate of cost pass-through lowers profit-neutral <b>grandfathering</b> is unreliable...|$|R

40|$|Emission {{allowances}} {{are often}} distributed for free {{in an early}} phase of a cap-and-trade scheme (<b>grandfathering)</b> to reduce adverse effects on the profitability of firms. If the <b>grandfathering</b> scheme is phased out over time, firms may nevertheless relocate to countries with a lower carbon price once the competitive disadvantage of their home industry becomes sufficiently high. We show {{that this is not}} necessarily the case. A temporary <b>grandfathering</b> policy can be a sufficient instrument to avert relocation in the long run, even if immediate relocation would be profitable in the absence of <b>grandfathering.</b> A necessary condition for this is that the permit price triggers investments in low-carbon technologies or abatement capital. ...|$|R
