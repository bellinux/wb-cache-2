30|$|This {{study showed}} the {{dimension}} {{effect on the}} surface checking was different for the source heights and cultivars, depending on the proportion of heartwood and sapwood. It is suggested that {{a high proportion of}} sapwood induced more surface checking, because the <b>drying</b> <b>stress</b> between the sapwood and the heartwood would be larger when the timber contains more sapwood. In order to confirm the effect of the heartwood proportion on the drying checks, the moisture gradient, shrinkage, <b>drying</b> <b>stress</b> and stress relaxation, and occurrence of drying checks will need to be monitored with different heartwood proportions. To understand the variation of surface checking, not only the variation of the moisture content [20 – 22] and shrinkage [5, 7], but also the variation of the tangential strength [23] and viscoelasticity [24 – 26] will need to be studied. A desirable drying schedule for timber containing a large portion of sapwood would reduce the moisture content gradient from the surface to the interior of the timber. For example, Noji et al.

However, the spatio-temporal pattern of heat <b>stress</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>stress</b> and {{the impacts of}} these multi-hazards on winter wheat yield have rarely been investigated. Using historical climate data, phenology data and yield records from 1980 to 2008, an analysis was performed to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of heat <b>stress</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>stress</b> in the post-heading stages of wheat growth in northern China. Additionally, these stresses' impacts on winter wheat yield fluctuations were evaluated. Spatially, the central and northern parts of northern China have seen more serious heat <b>stress,</b> while greater <b>dry</b> <b>stress</b> has been observed in the northwest and north of the research area. Temporally, the heat stress has increased {{in the western part}} but decreased in the central and eastern parts of research area. <b>Dry</b> <b>stress</b> has aggravated in the entire northern China during the past decades, indicating the complexity of the exposure to adverse climate conditions. These two hazards (heat <b>stress</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>stress)</b> have contributed significant yield loss (up to 1. 28 % yield yr(- 1)) {{in most parts of the}} research region. The yield in the west was more sensitive to heat <b>stress,</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>stress</b> was the main hazard in the south. Additionally, the opposite spatial pattern between the sensitivity and exposure revealed that the climate is not the only factor controlling the yield fluctuation, the local adaptation measures used to mitigate negative influences of extreme events should not be ignored. In general, this study highlighted a focus on the impacts of multi-hazards on agricultural production, and an equal importance of considering local adaptation ability during the evaluation of agricultural risk in the future. Additionally, paying more attention to higher sensitive areas and to more reasonable and practical adaptive strategies is critical and significant for food supply security. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

The transverse shrinkage also varies within the stem and among cultivars, depending on the microfibril angle (MFA), density, and tree ring parameters such as the ring width, latewood percentage and latewood density [9]. Therefore, drying checks are also expected to vary along the stem and among cultivars. Our previous research showed that surface checks which formed during conventional kiln drying were different between heights along the stem and among cultivars, and its variation was affected by the shrinkage properties and the heartwood percentage [10].|$|E

Utilising laser profilometry, the green density of screen printed layers (20 - 50 µm) were determined with an accuracy of 0. 1 - 0. 2 % theoretical density. Several effects {{that affect the}} accuracy of the results were taken into account and are discussed (e. g. waviness of substrate, penetration depth of the laser beam, deformation of the substrate due to <b>drying</b> <b>stresses).</b> The method can be applied on all layer materials and thick-film deposition methods with a dried thickness of 10 µm or larger that either allow a removal of the applied layer or do not deform the substrate during the coating process. In a case study, the influence of ink parameters (grain size 0. 1 [...] 0. 5 µm, solid content, binder, and dispersing agent) on the green density was studied systematically for electrolyte screen printing inks (8 mol. -% yttria stabilised zirconia = 8 YSZ) typically used in solid oxide fuel cell applications. Additional characterisation of the <b>drying</b> <b>stresses</b> by substrate bending measurements and the roughness, together with rheological data, allowed further interpretation of the data and an understanding of how varying ink components influence the state of the dried layer.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop an economically viable method of seasoning back-sawn native Tasmanian eucalypts and to reduce the seasoning time required for these timbers. The theory of unsteady state mass transfer based upon Fick's law of diffusion was used to study the drying process. The diffusion coefficients were measured directly by the diffusion cell method or deduced from a comparison of measured and calculated drying curves. The relationship between shrinkage of wood fibre and moisture concentration was obtained by slowly drying thin strips of wood and regularly measuring deformations. The effects of falling diffusivity and shrinkage with reducing moisture concentration were found to effectively cancel one-another {{in the case of the}} timbers tested during {{this investigation}}. <b>Drying</b> <b>stresses</b> in wood were studied using the theory of elasticity in anisotropic bodies. Airy stress functions were used when solving for stresses. For simplicity, sawn boards were approximated to orthotropic bodies and only boards cut with face-planes parallel/perpendicular to the principle material property directions were studied. Some elastic properties of native Tasmanian eucalypt timbers were measured on small sample populations and found to be similar to those of various North American hardwoods (with similar densities) reported by other authors. The approximate elastic properties of Tasmanian eucalypts were deduced from this comparison. The theories of mass transfer and stress analysis were combined to form a model describing the development of <b>drying</b> <b>stresses.</b> The wood was assumed to be linearly elastic and to be free of the effects of hysteresis and creep.

40|$|A {{new process}} for {{preparing}} silica xerogels with similar textural properties to silica aerogels by drying under vacuum has been studied. The xerogels {{are produced by}} adding, before gelation, 3 -(2 -aminoethylamino) propyltrimethoxysilane (EDAS) to tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) -based alcogels, synthesised in a single base-catalysed (NH 3) step.

The EDAS concentration and the basicity of the aqueous NH 3 solution are important parameters influencing {{the resistance of the}} gel to <b>drying</b> <b>stress.</b> A decreasing EDAS/TEOS ratio or an increasing concentration of NH 3 at constant EDAS content leads to less shrinkage during drying and so the final pore volume is larger.

30|$|The wood {{properties}} of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) vary within and among trees. In order to supply quality-controlled timber and decrease wood processing costs, {{it is expected}} that logs will be sorted by their wood properties and processed in suitable ways. Sugi trees were planted in large numbers during 1950 – 1970 in Japan, and thinned trees have been used as boxed-heart timber for poles and beams in housing construction. The boxed-heart timber, which is symmetrical about the pith, has little distortion by growth-stress release during sawing. However, it sometimes has bow and is susceptible to surface checking during drying. The drying of the timber proceeds from the surface and begins to shrink, while the interior can still be quite wet and not shrink. The shrinkage of the surface-layer is restricted by the inner layer, so tension <b>drying</b> <b>stress</b> is induced in the surface layer, while compression <b>drying</b> <b>stress</b> is induced in the inner layer. Tangential shrinkage is free at the corners of the timber, but is restricted between the corners owing to the shrinkage anisotropy between the tangential and radial directions, which induces large tension <b>drying</b> <b>stress</b> [1]. When the stress overcomes the tension strength of the timber, surface checking is induced. Recently, to shorten the drying time and prevent surface checking, various kiln-drying methods have been developed [2]. However, there is little information on why the drying defects such as bow and surface checking vary among timber that is dried together. The variations in the drying defects are considered to be induced by multiple wood-properties, which affect the water transportation, the deformation of the timber, and the surface checking occurrence and elongation. Therefore, the moisture content, density, shrinkage, and mechanical properties are suggested {{to be related to the}} bow and surface checking of the timber.|$|E

The results are compared to ‘Control’ in which airflow is unidirectional (no reversal).

30|$|The {{total length}} {{and the average}} length of the surface checks were longer at {{the upper part of the}} stem than the lower part (Fig.  2; Table  3). Katagiri et al. [10] also {{reported}} that the total length of surface checks was longer at the upper part of the stem than the lower part for two drying schedules. The difference between the source heights is most likely caused by the difference of HWP. As described in the introduction, when the drying proceeds from the outer part, <b>drying</b> <b>stress</b> occurs between the outer part, where shrinking has started (tension stress), and the inner part where shrinking has not occurred (compression stress). The heartwood dries more slowly than the sapwood, because the heartwood substance infiltrates the cell walls and covers the aspirated pits and decreases the moisture movement. Therefore, the timber containing the sapwood at the outer part will exhibit larger moisture gradients and drying stresses across timber compared with the timber containing only heartwood. In this study, timber 1 of the cultivars was mostly occupied by the heartwood, except for boka-sugi, whereas timber 4 contained the sapwood at the outer part (Table  1). Therefore, timber 1 might have smaller moisture gradients across the timber and less <b>drying</b> <b>stress</b> compared with timber 4. The difference in surface check along the stem was smaller for aya-sugi and yabukuguri than the other cultivars (Fig.  2; Table  3), which can be attributed to the similar HWPs of timber 1 and 4. Timber with a high percentage of heartwood and the timber with a high moisture content of heartwood will exhibit different drying speeds and <b>drying</b> <b>stress,</b> even if their average moisture contents are the same. To minimize the variation in moisture content and surface check after drying, it is better to classify the green timber not only for the average moisture content, but also for the HWP and the heartwood moisture content.|$|E

L iving cells combine molecular recogni-tion, amplification, and signal transduc-tion in an extremely small Bpackage,[making them ideally suited for miniaturized, stand-alone, environmental or physiological sensors. However, cellular integration int...|$|R
