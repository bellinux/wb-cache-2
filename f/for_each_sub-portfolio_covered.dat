The nodes of the network are those sub-portfolios generated by the network clustering of the overall static correlation network that includes every stock as a node. The index return of <b>each</b> <b>sub-portfolio</b> {{can be regarded as}} a factor that jointly determines the whole market movement. Hence, the relationships (edges) between factors (nodes) describe the time-varying relationships between individual stock returns that belong to different sub-portfolios in a reduced dimension: from 1, 324 stocks to 14 return indices. The dynamic correlation network carries summary information of the correlation structure of stock returns in the form of conditional adjacency matrix A [...]...|$|R
40|$|Lending {{rate policy}} via an {{appropriate}} investment strategy for an interacted portfolio of loans into discrete stochastic framework is {{examined in this}} paper. A bank optimization model with several control variables, stochastic inputs and a smoothness criterion described by a quadratic functional is proposed for managing the task. The state variable of the system corresponds to the accumulated surplus profit or loss can oscillates deliberately absorbing fluctuations in the different parameters involved. The theoretical model is solved using standard linearization and advanced stochastic optimization techniques resulting in analytic formulae for the control variables. These solutions are actually feedback mechanisms of the past accumulated surplus profit or loss of <b>each</b> <b>sub-portfolio</b> of loans. At the end, a numerical application is presented deriving a smooth solution {{for the development of}} the controllers. ...|$|R
40|$|Common {{practice}} {{for managing the}} credit risk of lending portfolios is to calculate maximum loss within the "value at risk" framework. Most financial institutions use largescale Monte Carlo simulations to do this. However, such simulations may impose heavy calculation loads. This paper proposes a simplified method that approximates maximum loss with minimal simulation burden. Our method divides a portfolio into <b>sub-portfolios</b> at <b>each</b> credit rating level and calculates the maximum loss of <b>each</b> <b>sub-portfolio.</b> We assume that the sub-portfolio's structure provokes little fluctuation in the ratio between the maximum loss and the standard deviation. We therefore begin with a <b>sub-portfolio</b> in which <b>each</b> exposure is of the same amount (a homogeneous sub-portfolio). Simple calculations provide the standard deviation for both the heterogeneous sub-portfolio whose risk is to be measured and the homogeneous subportfolio. The maximum loss for the homogeneous sub-portfolio {{can be obtained by}} using an [...] ...|$|R
