5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not <b>exceed</b> the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would <b>exceed</b> the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to <b>exceed</b> the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} <b>exceed</b> 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to <b>exceed</b> 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to <b>exceed</b> 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.|$|E

After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT <b>exceed</b> 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can <b>exceed</b> 10,000IU/L.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference.

Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not <b>exceed</b> £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
