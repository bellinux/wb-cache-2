40|$|The free {{vibrational}} {{characteristics of}} die springs are examined by Riccati {{transfer matrix method}} in this study. The warping deformation of spring’s cross section, as a new design factor, is incorporated into the differential equation of motion. Numerical simulations show that the warping deformation is a significant role {{of the behavior of}} natural frequencies of die springs and should be considered carefully. Approximately 40 % of the errors may occur if warping is neglected. The change laws of warping effect with the parameter variations of springs are also explored, including the height-to-width ratio of the cross section, the cylinder diameter, the helix pitch angle, and the number of coils. The warping effect exhibits the most remarkable changes with the variation in the height-to-width ratio of the cross section. However, this effect is not fairly sensitive to the changes in other parameters, and it is particularly significant when the cross section is relatively narrow regardless of the changes in other parameters. This study evidently answers the key scientific question: “under what working condition should the warping effect be considered or ignored?” The analysis results can be used to <b>guide</b> <b>spring</b> designers in engineering...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to develop a XYθZ 3 -DOF {{nanopositioning}} stage with linear displacement amplification device. This stage is used by three groups of linear displacement amplification device to composition, and thus achieves precise XYθZ 3 -DOF movement. The linear displacement amplification device makes use of a symmetrical layer mechanism, toggle amplification mechanism and parallel <b>guiding</b> <b>spring</b> to composition, and with amplification capability. Then it uses an equilateral triangle way to set the three groups of linear displacement amplification device. Overall design uses the finite element software ANSYS 12. 0 to analysis the displacement, stress and dynamic response of nanopositioning stage. Experiment demonstrated takes the laser interferometer as the standard of displacement measurement. The result of experiment measurement shows that the maximum XY axis displacement and θZ rotational angle travel of the stage is 36. 5 μm, 32 μm and 265 arc sec...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of piping system installed in industrial facilities {{have to be}} {{recognized as one of the}} significant issues in economic and safety design consideration. Piping systems are generally connected to supporting structures at several points by means of devices such as <b>guides,</b> <b>spring</b> hangers, hydraulic or mechanical snubbers and certain energy absorbers. When friction damper attracts attention, the amount of energy dissipation at contact surface is restricted, because the maximum displacement of sliding motion is limited by the clearance of the equipment. In order to increase the amount of energy dissipation, the ball screw type magnetic friction damper is proposed. This damper is expected to increase the energy dissipation by converting one directional motion to rotating motion by ball screw. In this work, the fundamental characteristics of proposed damper are clarified. The numerical model is made considering parameters obtained from testing, and the results from simulation are compared with the results from testing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{shows the}} {{development}} of the design and manufacturing of a very small engine, namely its head. The engine works under the 4 -stroke cycle, therefore having a very complex cylinder head, housing the camshaft, valves and its auxiliaries (seats, <b>guides,</b> <b>springs),</b> spark plug, inlet and exhaust passages and a coolant chamber. The geometries, both inner and outer are highly intricate which makes the production of such a part a very difficult job. In addition, when the engine is very small, as it is the case of this engine, all dimensions are miniaturized therefore making it extremely difficult to design, cast and finish. The cooling chamber, in particular, has a critical inner core removal problem due to reduced accessibility, imposing casting limitations. The cores place also a problem of air and gas removal during metal filling and solidification. Rapid prototyping may be the only solution to build the cores, and may help in the design and manufacturing phases of the casting tools. 3 D printing with a plaster based material as a rapid prototyping technique presents itself as a tool to drastically reduce the design-development-casting process effort and time cycle. This technique enables the designer to obtain new moulds for castings on the shortest time possible, following redesign and new casting simulations.
