40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} produce {{required}} <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steel</b> billets for auto industry, {{it is necessary to}} provide steel with correct content of sulfur. Effective, controlled method adding sulfur is very important in the production of sulfur <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steel</b> of consistent microstructure and hence mechanical properties and machinability. Because traditional methods of adding sulfur in steel can not provide stable results and always cause environmental pollution problems，the sulfur cored wire injection process was introduced. Stable results were obtained, and effects of parameters such as feeding rate, etc on sulfur recovery are investigated. The experimental results show that the mean recovery of sulfur was 80 %, the treatment time of adding sulfur was about 2 minutes, and the melting period was shortened. Favorable metallurgical achievements and economical benefits were gained...|$|R
40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels are {{generally regarded as}} more difficult to machine than carbon or low <b>alloy</b> <b>steels,</b> because they are strongly workhardened. They bond very strongly to the tool during cutting, and this bonding is more obvious than when cutting other steels because the chips more often remain stuck to the tool after cutting. And when the chip is broken away it also remove other fragments. In this thesis, the machinability of the Ca-S <b>free-cutting</b> stainless <b>steel</b> and its relation with compound inclusions are studied. The tool wear mechanisms and tool wear progression patterns are identified. The cutting tool temperature field for machining Ca-S <b>free-cutting</b> stainless <b>steel</b> is modelled using the MSC/NASTRAN finite element analysis software package...|$|R
40|$|Os aços de corte-fácil são especialmente projetados para oferecer melhores resultados mediante a operação com retirada de cavaco, reduzindo o coeficiente de contato ou atrito com a ferramenta. Em geral, estes aços têm que cumprir baixas especificações em outras características como resistência mecânica, resistência a fadiga e temperabilidade, entre outras. Por esta razão os principais elementos de liga que os constituem são destinados a melhoria da usinabilidade. São geralmente aços de baixo carbono com fortes adições de S, Mn, Pb, P etc [...] .. Como são fabricados, normalmente, com materiais recicláveis, elementos como Cr, Ni, Cu e Mo são sempre encontrados em suas composições, sendo considerados elementos residuais. Este trabalho visa {{investigar}} a influência de pequenas variações nos teores de cobre, níquel e cromo na usinabilidade dos aços de corte-fácil baixo carbono baseado na metodologia descrita na norma VOLVO STD 1018, 712. Ela se baseia em ensaios de vida de ferramentas monocortantes de HSS aplicadas em condições especiais no processo de fresamento frontal. Para uma melhor confiabilidade foram usadas ferramentas estatísticas através da análise de variância, teste t de Student e análise de regressão nos resultados obtidos pela norma VOLVO. Os resultados encontrados através dos experimentos mostraram que os elementos residuais realmente influenciam na usinabilidade do aço SAE 12 L 14, sendo que os mais significativos foram o Ni e Cu. Low carbon <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steels</b> {{are widely}} used for parts and components subject to moderate strength levels and relatively low shock loading, with machinability being the most important factor. Examples are hydraulic valves, keys, contact boards and other parts requiring rapid metal removal. These materials are especially designed for high machinability, that is, reduced tool-chip contact length, low coefficient of friction between the tool and the chip or the workpiece, production of easy handled chips, low cutting forces and power consumption, thereby providing long tool lives and/or high productivity by using high cutting speeds. Elements like Mn, P, S and Pb are generally present in their composition ensuring improved machinability. However, low carbon <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steels</b> also contain residual elements that often impair machinability such as Cr, Ni, Mo and Cu, which are difficult to be eliminated during the manufacturing process. This work investigates {{the influence of the}} trump elements Cr, Ni and Cu on the machinability of the SAE 12 L 14 low carbon <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steel</b> after testing in accordance with VOLVO STD 1018, 712 standard. The standard is based on tool life tests using HSS single point tools in face milling operation under special cutting conditions. The tool life results were treated statistically using ANOVA method, Student´s t distribution and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that the residual elements actually affect machinability of the SAE 12 L 14 low carbon <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steel,</b> with Ni and Cu being more significant...|$|R
