5|$|In the synoptics, the {{ministry}} of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not {{all in the same}} order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day between {{noon and}} evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|The wet, or rainy, season <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, {{covering}} {{one or more}} months, {{when most}} of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E

25|$|The {{events in}} a life script are often positive, celebrated, and normative. It {{represents}} and idealized life story. An average life would also include negative events and people would learn from experience.

25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{shoreline}} and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate, {{so there is no}} simple, general rule that predicts the time of high water from the Moon's position in the sky. Coastal characteristics such as underwater bathymetry and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting; actual high water time and height may differ from model predictions due to the coastal morphology's effects on tidal flow. However, for a given location the relationship between lunar altitude and the time of high or low tide (the lunitidal interval) is relatively constant and predictable, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast. For example, the high tide at Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., predictably occurs approximately {{two and a half hours}} before the Moon passes directly overhead.|$|E

As this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the rise of Ionia, the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the Ionian League. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.|$|E

25|$|The {{recorded}} {{chronology of}} rulers over Uruk includes both mythological and historic figures in five dynasties. As {{in the rest}} of Sumer, power moved progressively from the temple to the palace. Rulers from the Early Dynastic period exercised control over Uruk and at times over all Sumer. In myth, kingship was lowered from heaven to Eridu then passed successively through five cities until the deluge which ended the Uruk period. Afterwards, kingship passed to Kish {{at the beginning of the}} Early Dynastic period, which corresponds to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in Sumer. In the Early Dynastic I period (2900–2800BC), Uruk was in theory under the control of Kish. This period is sometimes called the Golden Age. During the Early Dynastic II period (2800–2600BC), Uruk was again the dominant city exercising control of Sumer. This period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the First Dynasty of Uruk sometimes called the Heroic Age. However, by the Early Dynastic IIIa period (2600–2500BC) Uruk had lost sovereignty, this time to Ur. This period, corresponding to the Early Bronze Age III, is the end of the First Dynasty of Uruk. In the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2500–2334BC), also called the Pre-Sargonic period (referring to Sargon of Akkad), Uruk continued to be ruled by Ur.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} the world of Krynn, and thus the {{settings}} for both the novels and gaming supplements, is roughly split into five separate ages. The first age <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> creation, when the gods are born and Krynn is formed. The Age of Dreams, the second age, is marked by the rapid growth of the world's first great civilizations and the appearance of myriad new races. This era is also marked by three great wars between dragons and their minions. Following the Third Dragon War, in the Age of Might, the Cataclysm obliterates the great empire of Istar and changes almost the entire surface of Krynn. A three-hundred year depression follows this event, in what is called the Age of Despair. This period also marks the War of the Lance. When Dragonlance was first introduced to Dungeons & Dragons, events such as the Lost Wars happened during The Age of Despair. Later Age of Mortals novels and game supplements took Krynn into [...] the Fifth Age (the Age of Mortals).|$|E
500|$|Nick Levin of Digital Spy {{reviewed}} The Time of Our Lives, saying that, {{although not}} offering much original material, it did {{provide evidence that}} Cyrus could successfully dump her Disney Channel-affiliated image. He said that each of [...] "the six genuinely new songs" [...] are worth listening to, resulting in a worthwhile EP release. Michael Hann of The Guardian felt that Cyrus managed to project a very wholesome image of herself but argued {{that she did not}} succeed in convincing adult audiences there was anything else to her: [...] "She has her name on plenty of inventive, imaginative and precisely calibrated examples of modern chart pop, songs that would have been noticed beyond her audience of young girls had they come from a more credible source". Jessica Holland of British newspaper The Observer wrote a favorable review of the EP, noting: [...] "Still not yet 17, Miley doesn't need to worry about slipping yet." [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music described the uptempo numbers on the EP as [...] "brilliantly feisty skate pop" [...] but described the record's ballads as tedious. Gill concluded that, if Cyrus were to take her music more seriously, instead of releasing albums in between various other projects, she might make a great pop album and stated that [...] "As it <b>is,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Of</b> Our Lives is a great pop EP drowning in a sea of bilge." ...|$|E
