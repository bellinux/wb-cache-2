5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> including potential cheek-like organs to keep food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain. Other early signs in adults include malaise, fatigue, decreased libido, and problems with sleep. An unusual taste <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> and personality changes are also early signs.|$|E

5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could be placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> and {{as recently as the}} 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, {{renamed the}} {{archipelago}} of islands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the St. Lawrence River for the victorious generals of the Conquest of Canada: Wolfe Island, Amherst Island, Howe Island, Carleton Island, and Gage Island.

5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into {{surrendering}} {{by threatening to}} kill or torture them.

5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe.

Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E
5|$|The finless {{porpoise}} {{is known to}} also follow seasonal migrations.

5|$|Anchored in Manila Bay, Cooke {{pretended that}} his ships were French vessels and {{successfully}} lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn.

40|$|The {{release of}} aroma {{compounds}} from rehydrated French beans in an artificial <b>mouth</b> system and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> of 12 assessors was studied by gas chromatography combined with flame ionisation detection and sniffing port detection. In an artificial mouth system, volatile compounds were isolated under mouth conditions, such as temperature, salivation, and mastication. No {{significant differences were}} determined between the aroma release from <b>the</b> beans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artificial <b>mouth</b> and release <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> of assessors. However, both the real and artificial mouth systems differed significantly from a purge-and-trap and a dynamic headspace system in aroma release. In order to study aroma release over time, volatile compounds were isolated from rehydrated French beans for 1, 1. 5, 3 and 12 min <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artificial <b>mouth</b> system and analysed by gas chromatography/sniffing port analysis. 2 -Methylpropanal, 2 -/ 3 -methylbutanal, hexanal, 2 -methyl- 2 -butenal, 1 -octen- 3 -one, and dimethyl trisulphide possessed detectable odours when isolated from <b>the</b> French beans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artificial <b>mouth</b> for all time periods. The odour active compounds 2 -/ 3 -methylbutanal and hexanal were shown to be released at a constant rate. Different sampling times resulted in identical selections of aroma compounds, while mutual proportions were retained...|$|R

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|Her oft {{worn-out}} {{and poor}} condition contributed to her being wrecked when in June 1809 she grounded on an uncharted shoal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the River Plate, whilst seeking shelter {{with the rest}} of her squadron from a storm. All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. Recently, the wreck of Agamemnon has been located, and several artefacts have been recovered, including one of her cannons.|$|E
