These waves are reflected and attenuated {{on the ground as}} well as within the ionospheric D layer, near 70 km altitude during day time conditions, and near 90 km height during the night. Reflection and attenuation on the ground depends on frequency, distance, and orography. In the case of the ionospheric D-layer, it depends, in addition, on time of day, season, latitude, and the geomagnetic field in a complicated manner. VLF propagation within the <b>Earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide</b> can be described by ray theory and by wave theory.|$|E

The group time delay difference of neighbouring frequencies in the lower VLF band is directly proportional to {{the distance of the}} source. Since the attenuation of VLF waves is smaller for west- to east propagation and during the night, thunderstorm activity up to distances of about 10000 km can be observed for signals arriving from the west during night time conditions. Otherwise, the transmission range is of the order of 5000 km.|$|E

Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as the primary means to model many scientific and engineering problems addressing electromagnetic wave interactions with material structures. An effective technique based on a time-domain finite-volume discretization procedure was introduced by Mohammadian et al. in 1991.

50|$|A {{lightning}} channel {{with all its}} branches and its electric currents behaves like a huge antenna system from which electromagnetic waves of all frequencies are radiated. Beyond a distance where luminosity is visible and thunder can be heard (typically about 10 km), these electromagnetic impulses are the only sources of direct information about thunderstorm activity on the ground. Transients electric currents during return strokes (R strokes) or intracloud strokes (K strokes) are the main sources for the generation of impulse-type electromagnetic radiation known as sferics (sometimes called atmospherics). While this impulsive radiation dominates at frequencies less than about 100 kHz, (loosely called long waves), a continuous noise component becomes increasingly important at higher frequencies. The longwave electromagnetic propagation of sferics takes place within the <b>Earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide</b> between the Earth's surface and the ionospheric D- and E- layers. Whistlers generated by lightning strokes can propagate into the magnetosphere along the geomagnetic lines of force. Finally, upper atmospheric lightning or sprites, that occur at mesospheric altitudes, are short-lived electric breakdown phenomena, probably generated by giant lightning events on the ground.|$|E

The space between the conductive Earth's surface and the conductive D layer acts as a parallel-plate waveguide which confines ELF waves, allowing them to propagate long distances without escaping into space. In contrast to VLF waves, the height of the layer is much less than one wavelength at ELF frequencies, so the only mode that can propagate at ELF frequencies is the TEM mode in vertical polarization, with the electric field vertical and the magnetic field horizontal.

30|$|In {{the light}} of newly found {{applications}} for very low frequency (VLF) (3 – 30 kHz) measurements in the prediction of earthquakes and the detection of lightning discharges and gamma ray bursts, {{there has been a}} revival of interest in the study of VLF propagation in the <b>earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide.</b> The propagation characteristics of VLF radiowaves in the <b>earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide</b> critically depend upon the lower ionospheric ionization, which determines the conductivity profile of the upper boundary of the waveguide. In this context, it is potentially worthwhile to revisit the waveguide mode analysis to compute propagation parameters of long-distance VLF transmissions while taking into account different approximations to the ionospheric conductivity. We have carried out a waveguide mode analysis of 16 -kHz VLF waves traveling great distances, assuming three different models for conductivity. The computational results show that at heights of less than 70 km, the change in the phase of the VLF waves due to changes in phase velocity is smaller when the ionosphere is sharply bound and assumed to have finite conductivity rather than infinite conductivity. The effect of a non-sharp or diffuse boundary {{at the top of the}} <b>earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide</b> is found to cause a lowering of the height of reflection.|$|E
40|$|Recordings of ELF-VLF waves {{with the}} {{right-hand}} (RH) and the left-hand (LH) circular polarization {{were made in}} Northern Finland. Analysis showed {{a difference between the}} RH and LH polarized waves. A pronounced maximum of the wave amplitude was observed at the first critical frequency of the <b>Earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide</b> (the first transverse resonance) around 1. 6 – 2. 3 kHz. The wave had the circular LH polarization at this maximum. To interpret observations, we computed the characteristics of the waveguide modes by using the full wave solution in the night model of the ionosphere. Computations show that the spectral maximum at the first transverse resonance frequency arises from a small absorption of the LH polarized radio wave in the magnetized ionosphere plasma, forming the upper boundary of the <b>Earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide...</b>|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{lightning}} location (WWLL) {{using only}} 30 lightning sensors {{has been successfully}} achieved by using only VLF propagation in the <b>Earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide</b> (EIWG). Ground propagation or mixed "sky" and ground propagation is avoided by requiring evidence of <b>Earth-ionosphere</b> <b>waveguide</b> dispersion. A further requirement is that the lightning strike must be inside the perimeter defined by the lightning sensor sites detecting the stroke. Under these conditions, {{the time and the}} location of the stroke can be determined, along with the rms errors. Lightning strokes with errors exceeding 30 mu s or To assist with identifying impulses from the same lightning stroke, the lightning sensor threshold is automatically adjusted to allow an average detection rate of three per second. This largely limits detection to the strongest 4 % of all lightning strokes, of which about 40 % meet the accuracy requirements for time and location...|$|E
