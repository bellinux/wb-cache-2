As this year's policy statement made clear, there {{is still a long way}} to go if we are to achieve the aims of the Common Fisheries Policy, namely fisheries which are sustainable for the long-term in economic, social and biological terms. The Commission is therefore proposing further cuts in effort and/or Total Allowable Catches (TACs) in a number of fisheries, while generally respecting the rule that inter-annual variations should be limited to 15 % increase or decrease, so as to provide a degree of stability for stakeholders.

Since 2012, ICES has provided recommendations with regards to these stocks. These recommendations are given for two‐year periods and are based on an approach adopted by ICES in 2012 in the case of insufficient data for an analytical evaluation (Data Limited Stocks, DLS). For 2013 and 2014, ICES recommended reducing catches by 20 % as a precautionary measure compared to 2009 ‐ 2011 for the three stocks. Considering that TACs are in force for whiting and pollack in the Bay of Biscay, the lack of diagnosis and the application of a precautionary approach could result in reductions in French <b>fishing</b> <b>possibilities.</b> Rapid improvement of the data available for stocks in the DLS category is therefore a priority.

40|$|Small blind {{estuaries}} are {{a common}} phenomenon {{on the coast of}} Nicaragua, but unfortunately not much is known on their hydrological characteristics. A blind estuary can be identified by a sandbar that temporarily closes the estuary from sea. These blind estuaries often have very diverse flora and fauna on which they play an important ecological role. Mangrove forests growing in this ecosystem often play a central position, and are valued {{for a wide range of}} functions, productivities, uses and values. Unfortunately these forests are also under threat of destruction, which is often caused by human influences. In this research human impact, as well as the impact of drought caused by an El Niño event, have been included to understand the influence of a blind estuary on the well being of the mangrove forest. The study was performed in a blind estuary at the Pacific coast of Nicaragua; located near the village El Ostional. During a fieldwork period of approximately three months, the study area was observed and measurements on predominantly water levels and salinity were conducted. The resulting information was used (1) to classify the separate morphologic, biologic, and social structures in the area, (2) identify the interactions between mangrove well being and hydrological characteristics, and finally (3) do more in-depth analyses on the salt intrusion occurring in the area. The estuary contains two main landforms; the sandbar separating estuary and sea, and the back-barrier floodplain behind it. The sandbar is formed by wave action, and can be ruptured due to a highly seasonal river discharge. The floodplain inundates when accumulation of water behind the sandbar increases. A variety of common mangroves like the Red and White mangrove, and the Buttonwood tree, can be found in the floodplain. The floodplain next to this is home to the Tea mangrove, a very rare and low salt tolerance mangrove tree. Together these mangrove trees form an interior mangrove forest. The inhabitants of El Ostional mainly use the floodplain to shortcut their route to the shore. Their main interest in the estuary is for the fishes it provides. The inhabitants on occasions like to 'help' the sandbar to open, in order to have easy <b>fishing</b> <b>possibilities.</b> Inundation in the floodplain is revealed to be extremely beneficial for the mangrove population. The crab population in the floodplain turned out to play an important ecological role, where their burrows increase permeability. This enhances infiltration into the soil, which increases soil moisture and decreases soil salinity. The blind estuary is, although stressed by drought, able to maintain relatively low salinity levels. This is caused by a steady fresh groundwater inflow. An overall outflow of estuary water occurs through the sandbar, where head differences between sea tide and estuary water level are the main forces that induce a transmission through the sandbar. The resulting relatively fresh water in the estuary permits the growth of the Tea mangrove. A mainly pressure induced muted tide is revealed in the estuary. Together with the fresh water inflow and wind influence, a circulation is established that reveals a well-mixed salt intrusion, which is caused by over-wash events. Would the sandbar be ruptured manually during drought, then the result is an increase in salinity that would be devastating for the Tea mangrove, but supply the estuary and mangroves with more water and provide the connection between sea and estuary necessary for fish reproduction. Salt intrudes the floodplain during inundation, when sea water evaporates and salt is left behind, which accumulates in the soil. The more infrequent the inundation, the higher the salinity in the soil. This only occurs in the floodplain. Salt intrusion in the subsurface of the Ostional area is due to pressure differences between fresh water in the aquifer and sea tide. This induces a mixing zone of which the interface is still near the shore; most of the wells in Ostional maintain potable water salinities. In order to protect the mangrove forest, it is thus important to protect the complete ecosystem, in this case especially the crab population. It further is important to ensure the maintenance of a groundwater inflow, by protecting the upstream forests that enhance infiltration to the groundwater system. Whether the manual rupture of the sandbar during drought is considered problematic depends on the the value given to the Tea mangrove, the other mangrove population, or the nursery function the estuary provides. Further research and monitoring for the Ostional area is necessary to confirm the formulated hypotheses, and in order to keep track of salt intrusion in the estuary and subsurface.

However, the problems addressed here are primarily due to the physical characteristics of the transmitted acoustic pulse from the echo-sounder and its interaction with fish close to the seabed. This paper looks at the factors controlling the detection of these fish {{in terms of the}} acoustic sampling volumes near the bottom, the discrimination theoretically possible between fish and seabed echoes and the ‘‘depth anomaly’’. The acoustic deadzone is defined and its volume is determined. Practical aspects of signal processing in this near seabed situation are then described, including seabed recognition and safeguarding fish signals from contamination by the bottom echo and from noise. Next, an echo-integrator deadzone comprising the acoustic deadzone, the backstep zone, and the partial integration zone (related to pulse length) is described and defined. Equations for calculating the eVective volume or eVective height of this deadzone are developed.

40|$|An ultrastructural investigation, {{performed}} on embryos, neonates, subadult and adult females, demonstrated that in Torpedo marmorata oogenesis occurs {{very early in}} life and continues, in its proliferative phase, also after birth. Clusters of early meiotic cells were already evident in the ovarian cortex of 6 -cm-long embryos, {{as well as in}} the ovary of newborns and three-month-old young. Conversely, in the ovaries of subadult and adult females, all the germ cells present were organized into follicles, and no clusters of oogonia and early meiotic cells were generally found in the cortex, except for one adult female where clusters of germ cells not organized in follicles were found in the cortex. These data demonstrated that, in Torpedo marmorata, oogenesis is immediate, and, as oogonia persist after birth, more similar to that of mouse, monkey, rabbit, and ferret (Mauleon Arch Anat Microsc, 1967; 56 : 125 - 150; Byskov and Hoyer 1994) than to that of human, rat, pig, and guinea pig (Byskov and Hoyer 1994).

The allometric relation of total gonadotropic cell volume to body length, determined for fish from six weeks up to six months of age, showed no inflections. Therefore pituitary growth in maturing fish may be partly a result of proliferation of gonadotropes, although gonadotropic cells do not contribute to pituitary hyperplasia in old fish. Thyrotropic cells showed a weak affinity to anti-carp alpha beta-GTH serum at light-microscopical level.

Surface microscopy of the dentary of albertosaurines revealed a previously undescribed sensory modification, as will be described here. While dentary "foramina" were previously thought to contain tactile sensory organs, the potential function of this theropod modification as a unique localizing system is explored in this study. Dentary surface perforations were examined by surface epi-illumination microscopy in tyrannosaurine and albertosaurine dinosaurs to characterize their anatomy. Fish lateral lines were examined as potentially comparable structures. In contrast to the subsurface vascular bifurcation noted in tyrannosaurines (which lack a lateral dentary surface groove), the area subjacent to the apertures in albertosaurine grooves has the appearance of an expanded chamber. That appearance seemed to be indistinguishable from the lateral line of fish. Dentary groove apertures in certain tyrannosaurid lines (specifically albertosaurines) not only have a unique appearance, but one with significant functional and behavior implications. The appearance of the perforations in the dentary groove of albertosaurines mirrors that previously noted only with specialized neurologic structures accommodating derived sensory functions, {{as seen in the}} lateral line of <b>fish.</b> The <b>possibility</b> that this specialized morphology could also represent a unique function in albertosaurine theropods for interacting with the environment or facilitating prey acquisition cannot be ignored.

Vessels and bile ducts were observed to be scattered without any apparent order within the parenchyma. Venous profiles appeared either isolated or included in 'venous-arteriolar tracts' (VAT) and 'venous-biliary-arteriolar tracts' (VBAT). Bile ducts also appeared either isolated or in groups which often included an arteriole. The parenchyma was organised in tubules of hepatocytes encircling biliary passages radially. Those cells were uninucleate and contained large cytoplasmic areas of rough endoplasmic reticulum; lipid droplets and dense bodies sometimes also occupied a considerable portion of the cytoplasm. Microvilli extended from hepatocytes into biliary passages and towards the space of Disse. Other cell types encountered comprised biliary epithelial cells, macrophages (including melanin laden cells), fat-storing cells and endothelial cells. The biliary tree was formed sequentially by intra- and intercellular canaliculi, preductules, ductules and ducts. Canaliculi without microvilli are described {{for the first time}} in fishes. Structural differences between the brown trout and other fishes were noted. In contradistinction to other fishes, in brown trout the triads (i. e. the VBAT) are not just occasional structures; also, they probably transmit portal veins. Our observations support the concept of a tubular arrangement of hepatocytes in <b>fish.</b> The <b>possibility</b> that the axis of the tubule may be a sinusoid instead of a biliary passage is questioned. Homology between, on one hand, the segment formed by preductules and ductules and, on the other, the canal of Hering of mammals is defended. It is concluded that among salmonids notable interspecific differences do not seem to exist...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{salinity}} (0, 10 & 20 ‰, water temperature 28 ± 1 °C) and food ration (3 and 4. 5 % bw/day) on food consumption {{and growth of}} Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (10. 77 ± 0. 21 g) were investigated. Individual food consumption was measured using X-radiography technique. Salinities (0, 10 & 20 ‰) did not have {{significant effect on the}} growth rate of groups of Nile tilapia fed at different ration levels (3 & 4. 5 % bw/day). This study showed that the growth of all-male fish was significantly better than all-female fish for all three salinities and two rations. Salinities from 0 to 20 ‰ had no effect on growth performance of males or female fish. In the present study, it was evident that fish fed at 3 % bw/day ration ate all the food offered and fish fed at 4. 5 % bw/day did not consumed all amounts. Also, growth performance did not significantly differ among fish fed at 3 % bw/day ration level and reared at different salinities. Fish reared under higher salinities (20 ‰) and fed at higher ration (4. 5 % bw/day) level had skin lesions and injuries on their body. It was assumed that fish fed at higher ration under higher salinities (20 ‰) and maintained higher osmoregulatory costs together with osmotic stress may have a negative influence on the appetite of <b>fish.</b> Another <b>possibility</b> that may have affected the appetite could be the unionized ammonia levels that were high. The high-unionized ammonia levels combined with the osmotic stress may have been the cause, or have aided, development of skin lesions and injuries on the fish at higher salinities...|$|R
