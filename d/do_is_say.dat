50|$|The pub scenes - {{the only}} {{parts of the}} film in which the {{characters}} talk, as the home scenes are narrated by the adult Karen Watson - involve {{a group of men}} discussing sexually abusive fathers, and are used to underline popular conceptions and misconceptions of the issue ("All these lasses gotta <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>say</b> no", ventures one man).

2500|$|Burns {{attributed}} {{all of the}} couple's {{early success}} to Allen, modestly ignoring his own brilliance as a straight man.

5000|$|This is the {{principle}} of complete induction, which establishes the property of induction as necessary to the system.

But this is itself induction. And hence the argument is a [...] vicious circle.|$|E

60|$|So I {{stayed on}} in the City of the Grasshopper, and busied myself with the {{questions}} of how to transport and feed a great army that must hold the field for six months or a year; also with the setting of hundreds of skilled men to the making of bows, arrows, swords and shields. Nor <b>did</b> <b>Bes</b> <b>say</b> me no in these matters. Indeed he helped them forward by issuing the orders as his own, wherein I saw the hand of Karema.|$|R
