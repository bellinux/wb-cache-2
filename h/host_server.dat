2500|$|Digital rights {{management}} (DRM) {{is a type}} {{of technology}} that is intended to control the use of digital content and devices after purchase. [...] Many companies make use of DRM to prevent copyright infringement and to protect an entity's intellectual property from public access. [...] Opponents of DRM argue that it only inconveniences legitimate customers and allows big business to stifle innovation and competition. In the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 increased the strength of DRM. Objection to DRM caused Microsoft to change its DRM policy for Xbox One. Always-on digital rights management (DRM), also known as persistent online authentication, {{is a type of}} controversial technology relating to video games. This technology requires a consumer to maintain a connection to a <b>host</b> <b>server</b> in order to use a particular product or play a game. Those against Always-on DRM focus on server connection difficulties, single player offline preferences, and game playability once companies shut down a server.|$|E
