40|$|An {{analysis}} of the overturning circulation in dry isentropic coordinates using reanalysis data is presented. The meridional mass fluxes on surfaces of constant <b>dry</b> <b>potential</b> temperature but distinct equivalent potential temperature are separated into southward and northward contributions. The separation identifies thermodynamically distinct mass fluxes moving in opposite directions. The eddy meridional water vapor transport is shown {{to be associated with}} large poleward and equatorward mass fluxes occurring at the same value of <b>dry</b> <b>potential</b> temperature but different equivalent potential temperature. These mass fluxes, referred to here as the moist recirculation, are associated with an export of water vapor from the subtropics connecting the Hadley cell to the midlatitude storm tracks. The poleward branch of the moist recirculation occurs at mean equivalent potential temperatures comparable to upper tropospheric <b>dry</b> <b>potential</b> temperature values, indicating that typical poleward-moving air parcels can ascend to the tropopause. The analysis suggests that these air parcels ascend on the equatorward side of storm tracks by following moist isentropes reminiscent of upright deep convection, while on the poleward side their moist isentropes are indicative of large-scale slantwise convection. In the equatorward branch, the analysis describes typical air parcels that follow their dry isentropes until they get injected into the boundary layer where they are subsequently moistened. The moist recirculation along with the mean equivalent potential temperature of its poleward and equatorward components are used to recover an approximate overturning circulation on moist isentropes from which it is shown that the moist recirculation accounts for the difference between the meridional circulation averaged on dry and on moist isentropes...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation model {{was developed to}} model summer preparation of desiccant corn using heat from solar collectors. The desiccant provides a storage medium for solar {{energy in the form}} of <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> and is blended with wet corn at harvest. Grain-mass/collector-area ratios from 0. 27 to 8. 5 t/m 2 (1. 0 to 31 bu/ft 2) and airflow rates from 0. 0019 to 0. 093 m 3 /s-t (0. 1 to 5 cfm/bu) were studied. The use of a solar collector during the summer is desirable because solar radiation is available more hours per day, the <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> is good, and the solar collector use period is increased. The desiccant corn is blended with wet corn in the fall to reduce the average moisture content of the wet corn, therefore reducing the electrical energy to dry and reducing the spoilage risk of the wet corn. Based on the simulation results, an airflow rate of 0. 014 m 3 /s-t (0. 75 cfm/bu) along with a grain-mass/collector-area ratio between 3 and 5. 5 t/m 2 (11 and 20 bu/ft 2) is recommended.

40|$|Building in {{cold climate}} zones {{requires}} a high insulation thickness {{and a good}} protection against interstitional condensation. Applying vapour tight membranes {{on both sides of}} a roof construction offers no <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> in case of leakages or initial moisture. Therefore the use of slightly permeable membranes at the interior side is often preferred because they allow condensed or existent moisture to dry out. However, drying to the interior space will only happen if the solar heat gains of the roof are high enough to inverse the vapour flow for a sufficient time period. This paper looks to the climate limits of building flat roofs with moderately permeable vapour retarders. The balance of interstitial condensation and subsequent drying is investigated using an adapted hygrothermal simulation tool for heat and moisture transport in building components. For the simulations a black surfaced flat roof construction with mineral fibre insulation and moderate vapour retarder is considered. Special interest is set on the <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> in relation to the building's location in Northern climate zones.

40|$|Abstract â€” A forced {{convection}} with desiccant integrated solar dryer {{has been built}} and tested. The main parts are: two flat plate solar air collectors, a drying chamber, desiccant bed and a centrifugal blower. The system is operated in two modes, sunshine hours and off sunshine hours. During sun shine hours the hot air from the flat plate collectors is forced to the drying chamber for drying the product and simultaneously the desiccant bed receives solar radiation directly and through the reflected mirror. In the off sunshine hours, the dryer is operated by circulating the air inside the drying chamber through the desiccant bed by a reversible fan. The dryer is used to dry 20 kg of green peas and pineapple slices. Drying experiments were conducted with and without the integration of desiccant unit. The effect of reflective mirror on the <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> of desiccant unit was also investigated. With the inclusion of reflective mirror, the <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> of the desiccant material is increased by 25 % and the drying time is reduced. The drying efficiency of the system varies between 48 % and 59 % and the pick-up efficiency varies between 25 % and 60 %, respectively. Approximately in all the drying experiments 68 % of moisture is removed by air heated using solar energy and the remainder by the desiccant. The inclusion of reflective mirror on the desiccant bed makes faster regeneration of the desiccant material.

The drying shrinkage along the fibres, usually small due to the reinforcing action of cellulosic microfibrils, is surprisingly high in the so called tension wood, produced by trees to respond to strong reorientation requirements. In this study, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of supercritically-dried tension wood and normal wood show that tension wood cell wall has a gel-like structure characterised by a pore surface more than 30 times higher than in normal wood. Syneresis of the tension wood gel explains its paradoxical drying shrinkage.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{shows that}} ETICS on light weight structures pose no moisture problem in cold and moderate climates when the detailing of joints and openings is well done, i. e. {{there is no}} rain water leakage. This holds for all locations investigated. However, if water leakage cannot be excluded completely and therefore the North-American Standard assumptions - penetration of 1 % of the driving rain load - are applied this picture changes, making the <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> an essential feature. The normal ETICS composed of vapour retarding EPS insulation slabs cannot provide much drying towards the exterior and may therefore bear a moisture damage risk for the underlying substrate. The application of a humidity controlled vapour retarder (PA-film) instead of a conventional polyethylene film at the interior {{side of the building}} assembly enhances the overall <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> of the construction by allowing some vapour diffusion towards the interior spaces. But only in warmer locations, like Wilmington in North Carolina or Lisbon, employing such a vapour retarder may be a compensation for small rain water leaks. The best but also most expensive solution would be to replace the expanded polystyrene (EPS) by high density mineral wool insulation slabs in the ETICS. Alternative ways of solving the rain penetration problem are currently being developed and tested in North-America. Many systems now provide a drainage plane between the substrate and the ETICS and flashing to force the water out {{at the bottom of the}} wall. Other systems keep the face seal approach and rely on more sophisticated detailing and flashing. In both cases the long-term performance is still unknown. In order to avoid a repetition of the North-American problems with ETICS on wooden structures, it is important to communicate this issue and possible solutions to the European construction trades. Hygrothermal simulations may help to raise the awareness to the damage risks and the importance of qualified workmanship involved in the application of ETICS especially in cases of high wind driven rain loads...|$|E

40|$|In hot {{and humid}} climates the {{interior}} and exterior environmental loads that building envelopes must respond to are larger than many other climatic conditions. Moisture-originated failures in low-rise residential buildings have put a significant pressure to change construction codes in North America. Solutions to moisture induced problems may be difficult when several interacting mechanisms of moisture transport are present. A new approach to building envelope durability assessment has been introduced in North America; a moisture engineering approach. This requires system information about the wall systems as constructed along with aging characteristics coupled with advanced modeling that 0 term allow the designer to predict the Iong-term performances of building envelope systems. This permits the comparison and ranking of individual building envelope systems with respect to total hygrothermal performance. Critical information {{can be obtained by}} investigating the one to one relationships of a building envelope to interior and exterior environments, however, the total behavior of the actual whole building is not accounted for. This paper goes one step further, by incorporating the individual hygrothermal performances of all walls, roof, floor and mechanical systems. The direct and indirect coupling of the building envelope and indoor environment with HVAC system are included in the analysis. The full house hygrothermal performance of an aerated concrete wall system are examined for a {{hot and humid}} climate.

40|$|Moisture {{damage in}} walls and roofs is often {{associated}} with air leakage. Many believe that installing vents prevents moisture problems; venting roofs is common building practice, and providing ventilation openings at top and bottom wallplates is accepted practice in U. S. mobile home manufacturing. This paper presents a discussion of the effect of airtightness and vents on moisture and airflow in walls typical of U. S. mobile home construction. We used mea sured airtightness data for wall components to calculate airflows, moisture flows, and wetting or <b>drying</b> <b>potentials</b> for U. S. cold winter conditions. Vents can significantly increase air leakage through the wall. If the airflow is exfiltrative, more wetting may occur during winter in vented walls than in unvented walls. There is no guarantee that vents will provide enough ventilation with outdoor air to offset this increase in wetting. Thus, we conclude that installing vents in walls is not a reliable moisture control strategy. In addition, vents degrade thermal performance and increase construction cost. An effective air barrier and vapor retarder should provide more reliable moisture control and superior thermal peformance. Similar conclusions can be drawn for cathedral ceil ings, although we believe field studies of unvented cathedral ceilings are warranted. We do not recommend change in the current practice of providing attic ventilation at this time...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{water in}} low sloped roofs almost always causes problems. Roofs are {{designed}} only {{to control the}} migration of vapor, if at all. Small amounts of water leakage/penetration, may cause mold growth or catastrophic corrosion in current roofs systems.

Depending on the surface characteristics, roof systems can be designed to effectively manage water penetration, but at an energy cost. In the roofs system examined previously, air leakage was not included. In the present study, the authors reinvestigated the effect of water penetration and the influence of air leakage on the hygrothermal performance of a few selected roofs. The <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> of a groove ventilated roof is examined. The performance concept is based on the fact that warming up of air in the groove increases it's ability to transport moisture to the outside. Solar radiation raises the temperature of air in the grooves and on average, during a sunny summer day 0. 5 L of water can be ventilated out of the roof per 1 m width of the roof. In this paper, one climatic condition was investigated; a hot and humid Climate representative of Houston, TX. The specific questions that the paper addresses are: What are the vapor and liquid control dynamic involved in the moisture migration of a roof in Houston TX? and how does airflow influence the performance of a roof that is initially wet ? A state-of-the-art numerical model was used to address these issues. Results showed that the <b>drying</b> <b>potential</b> depends on the ventilation rates. The roof system with ventilation grooves dried out faster from the initially wet stage than the roof without the ventilation grooves. The total increase in heat loss of the roof was found to be between 0 - 5 % depending on the thickness of the insulation.
