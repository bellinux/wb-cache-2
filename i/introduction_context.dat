The study was based on 29 qualitative interviews with farmers. 1) First, the description of cropping practices allowed to build a typology of crop management sequences for winter wheat and maize, which were linked to modifications in cropping systems (on cover crops management and rotations), resulting in three agronomic coherence classes. Farmers' caracteristics in each class were described. A difference appeared between farmers using deep tillage and the others, whereas the systemic approach of farmers with superficial tillage and no-tillage were rather similar. The type of farming system and the pedoclimatic conditions did not influence the classification, whereas socio-economic differences appeared, as well as evolutions in the perception of soils. 2) Focus was then put on sociological aspects by means of open-ended questions about motivations, information sources and and perception of other stakeholders of the innovation. Farmers enter a learning dynamic which bring them to reconsider their conception of soils and to adapt general principles of minimum tillage to their own specific context. The key point for accompanying innovation in tillage practices is to put farmers and their knowledge {{in the center of the}} interactions with other stakeholders, namely advisors. Considering complex cropping systems requires a joint effort from farmers and advisors to make the whole cropping system evolve. In conclusion, the diversity of crop management sequences and modifications of the cropping system reflect different stages of the learning process. However, farmers are pragmatic and are not necessarily motivated to transform their systems all the way to no-tillage due to agronomic, economic and social brakes. Group dynamics appear suitable, as they allow farmer to exchange experiences.

30|$|We ask {{the same}} {{questions}} with the proposed revitalisation efforts in the inner-city of Harare, {{the capital city of}} Zimbabwe seeking to attain an excellent city status as stipulated in its Vision 2025 document (City of Harare [2012]). One major aspect articulated in this document is to apply an ecological planning thrust, which has been conspicuous by its absence in the previous efforts to do the same. It is imperative now to explore and possibly (re-)frame the garden suburb approach, strongly rooted in the garden city concept to enable the attainment of the City of Harare Vision 2025 that the city leaders and managers have envisioned. This article examines approaches adoptable in a quest to integrate ecological thought in inner-city revitalisation focusing on the inner-city of Harare. The major focus of the article is to proffer an exploration of how ecological planning can be integrated into the realm of inner-city revitalisation. Based on this philosophy, the article argues that Harare’s pursuits of a sustained outcome will eliminate the prevailing socio-economic and environmental ills currently bedevilling the area. The methods used to collect data to enable the writing of this article included key informant interviews, ground observations and in depth analysis of secondary sources including strategic, master and local plans as well as reports and minutes of meetings. An intense literature search was done to obtain the crucial information to broaden the knowledge and get a deeper understanding of ecological planning in relation to inner-city revitalisation in Harare. Specifically, the key documents reviewed included operational development plans of the City of Harare with the Local Development Plan No 17 and city’s strategic plan 2012 – 2025 being the main data sources. Key informant interviews were for Harare City officials to establish and explore on the approaches, methods and theories used in the revitalisation efforts of the inner-city of Harare. Field surveys involved some on-site observations of the conditions and use of buildings and the environmental state in the area because of the revitalisation initiatives. The study makes use of document analysis as this has enabled the understanding of the planning philosophy previously adopted for the city. From the documents the gaps were identified which prompted the recommendation of an ecological planning approach that seem to be the missing bloc in the revitalisation maze for the inner city in Harare. The article is organised under the following subheadings: <b>introduction,</b> <b>context</b> of the study, ecological planning in inner-city revitalisation: a review, initiatives in Harare inner-city revitalisation and {{the last part of the}} article proffers a discussion and way forward to crystallise the debate to foster recommendations that can work for the city of Harare.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{scientists}} and industrial partners were pushed {{to search for}} substitutes of petroleum-based plastics due to economic and social reasons related to environmental pollution and overexploitation of finite fossil resources. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a synthetic thermoplastic aliphatic polyester, {{is one of the}} most commercially interesting options, because, apart from being bio-based, bio-degradable and compostable, it can be processed with equipments usually used for conventional plastics and its mechanical properties are relatively good with respect to other biopolymers. However, despite the many attractive qualities, there are still some aspects of PLA which need to be improved so that it can compete with conventional polymers. In this context, the aim of this work was to tune PLA material properties in order to make its production more profitable, by decreasing production costs and enlarging the application spectrum. We are convinced that this can be done by optimizing PLA crystallization behavior and melt strength. Two methods to modify the crystallization behavior of PLA were presented: (1) the addition of bio-based nucleating agents and (2) the application of flow The nucleating of amino acids and poly(amino acids) (L-alanine, poly-DL-alanine, glycine and polyglycine) effect was confirmed. In the case of polyglycine, low concentrations were sufficient to obtain a significant acceleration due to an increased nucleation density. The critical experimental flow conditions under which the crystallization process is accelerated and significant changes in morphology take place were determined with parameters from molecular rheology and the criterion of the applied mechanical work. There was a fair coincidence between the calculated critical values for orientation and the transitions experimentally measured. Rather than focusing on crystallization and melt enhancement separately, it was proposed to solve both issues at once, since it is economically interesting and more practical. Six PLA-based additives with various characteristics such as architecture, stereoregular composition and molecular weight were screened to find a match. The additive called AD 4 a had the desired double enhancing effect. This was accredited to the combination of long chain branching and the presence of HoSCo crystals formed during the extrusion step. In conclusion, this work presented two additives which can be used to tune PLA crystallization and strain hardening behavior. Polyglycine is interesting for applications were only slow crystallization rates are an issue, such as injection molding where shorter cooling cycles are wished. For example, the addition of 0. 5 wt% of polyglycine decreased the crystallization time at 130 °C of neat extruded LMw PLA from 2115 s to 761 s. This means that an injection molding cycle at 130 °C could be more than 20 minutes shorter. On the other hand, the PLA-based additives (AD 4 b) could be used in film blowing applications were both crystallization and melt strength need to be tunable to obtain the desired transparency and thickness of the film. It was also shown that the Entrance Flow Method (EFM) was the most satisfactory and adequate technique to detect melt strength enhancement and it was used, in combination with Cogswell’s analysis, to determine the extensional viscosity of two PLA model systems.

It is our opinion that this lack of consensus about contexts is in direct relation to its lack of a formal definition.

40|$|<b>Introduction</b> <b>Context</b> In {{the recent}} decades we have {{witnessed}} a massive proliferation of the Internet, which succeeded to pervade all our daily activities and to be adopted throughout the entire world. The emergence of the Internet as a general communication channel is considerably affecting the scale of current software systems and deeply transforming the architecture of future critical systems. %In fact, a report, produced by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in June 2006, envisioned how future software systems {{are going to be}} architected, introducing the so-called Ultra Large Scale (ULS) systems, which are defined as federations of heterogeneous and independent systems glued together by a middleware solution. Such systems are characterized by (i) billions lines of code, (ii) several users, (iii) large amount of data stored, accessed, manipulated, and refined, (iv) many connections and interdependencies, and (v) extremely-high geographic distribution. Traditionally, a critical system consists of a monolithic, "close world'', architecture, i. e., several computing nodes interconnected by a dedicated network with limited or no connectivity towards the outside world. An example of such traditional architecture is Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA), e. g., which is used in several current critical systems such as the control room of power plants or air traffic control systems. However, future critical systems will shift to an innovative federated, ``open world'', architecture, namely Large scale Complex Critical Infrastructure (LCCI), which belongs to the group of the so-called Ultra Large Scale (ULS) systems, which were envisioned in a report produced by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in June 2006. Specifically, an LCCI consists in a dynamic Internet-scale hierarchy / constellation of interacting heterogeneous, inconsistent, and changing systems, which cooperate to perform critical functionalities. Many of the ideas behind LCCIs are increasingly ``in the air'' in several current projects that aim to develop innovative critical systems. For example, EuroCONTROL has funded a project to device the novel European framework for Air Traffic Management (ATM) in Europe, called Single European Sky (SESAR). Current European airspace is fragmented in several areas, each one managed by a single control system. Such traditional ATM approach has been demonstrated to be not suitable to handle the future avionic traffic, so {{it is going to be}} substituted by a more integrated approach. In fact, SESAR aims to develop a seamless infrastructure that allows control systems to cooperate each other in order to have a wider vision of the airspace, which is no more limited only to their assigned fragment. As previously stated, traditional critical systems have been characterized by the use of dedicated machines and networks, so hardware and software faults were considered the only threats to the reliability and effectiveness of the system, while communication failures were assumed to be almost improbable to occur. Therefore, in the last decades the research has spent a lot of efforts investigating on how to deal with the former two kind of faults, paying less attention on how to treat communication failures. As a proof of this lack of attention, main standardized, and mature, commercial middleware used in building critical systems do not address them at all, such as Java Message Service (JMS), or provides very basic mechanisms, such as the recent OMG standard called Data Distribution Service (DDS). However, LCCIs cannot use dedicated networks due to their geographical extension, but they adopt wide-area networks that exhibit an availability between 95 percent and a little over 99 percent and do not provide any guarantees on the offered Quality-of-Service (QoS). So, when a federated architecture is adopted to device critical systems, communication failures have a high probability to occur, even greater than hardware and software failures, so guaranteeing an efficient data distribution constitutes the pivotal factor to accomplish the mission of LCCIs. The aim of this thesis is to bring a significant contribution in addressing such issue, with the goal of enabling the definition of novel strategies to support effective communication among several critical systems interconnected over wide-area networks. Problem Statement Mostly all the critical systems fall within the wider class of Monitor and Control (M&C) systems, i. e., the environment is continuously monitored and the system responds appropriately avoiding threats that may lead to losses of human lives and/or money. For example, an Air Traffic Management (ATM) system keeps track of all the flight in a given portion of the airspace (i. e., the sensing part of the system) and may change the routes of those aircraft that risk to collide (i. e., the responding part of the system). Therefore, one of the main measures to assess the effectiveness of a critical system is timeliness, i. e., a treat has to be detected on time in order to perform proper actions to avoid it. For example, a collision has to be detected within a certain time before its likely occurrence so that aircrafts have time to change their route and prevent the collision to happen. So, critical operations account the right answer delivered too late as the wrong answer, and this means that the adopted middleware has to cope with timing failures and to guarantee that deliveries occur within given deadlines, i. e., on-time information dissemination is required. For example, a radar scans a given area of the airspace hundred times in a second, and a control system usually combines the data received by several radars to view the position of all the aircrafts in a given portion of the airspace. If a message produced by a radar reaches an ACC later than 0, 6 seconds, it is not usable since the current state of the flights does not match the content of the received message, and the control system that receives it has an out-of-time view of the position of the aircrafts. This can cause disastrous consequences: when late-received radar data are fused with the timely-delivered ones, several false positives and false negatives can be generated through the process of collision detection As previously asserted, message deliveries over wide-area networks exhibit not-negligible bursty loss patterns, i. e., a message has a considerable probability P to be lost during the delivery and the succession of consecutive dropped messages has an average length ABL greater than two. The critical nature of LCCIs demands that messages have to be delivered to all the destinations despite of the faulty behaviour of the network, so the adopted middleware has to provide some means to tolerate the message losses imposed by the network in order to achieve a reliable message distribution. However, the reliability gain is always achieved at the expenses of worsening the predictability of the delivery time and leading to timing failures. Since LCCIs require that messages are guaranteed to be timely delivered to all the interested consumers despite of the occurrence of several failures, it's needed to provide a trade-off between the achievable reliability and timeliness degree. The ultra large scale of LCCIs worsens the already-tough challenge to join reliability and timeliness since several solutions to tolerate message drops exhibit severe scalability limitations. In addiction, since LCCIs are smeared on several networking domains due to their geographic distribution, network conditions, i. e. propagation latency and loss pattern, do not result uniform all over the infrastructure, but the overall LCCI is composed of several portions each one characterized by a particular configuration of the network behaviour. Therefore, the approach "one solution fits all" does not work in the case of LCCIs, but the adopted middleware has to autonomously choose the proper message delivery strategy to the experienced network conditions in order to support a reliable and timely data distribution. Last, wide-area networks do not exhibit a stable behaviour but network conditions continuously change. Therefore, the adopted delivery strategy has also to provide self-configuring capabilities in order to adapt to any changes in the behaviour of the underlying network and to provide almost the same reliability and timeliness degree masking fluctuations in the network conditions. Open Issues Publish/Subscribe interaction model is an asynchronous messaging paradigm where consumers, namely subscribers, receive only the messages produced by the so-called publishers in which they have expressed interest through a subscription predicate. Middleware services based on such model are suitable to be adopted in ULS systems since they exhibit strong decoupling properties that enforce scalability. As previously mentioned, LCCI require a reliable data distribution, so the adopted publish/subscribe service needs to provide means to cope with message losses. However, since its inception, the publish/subscribe community has been more focused on scalable architectures, efficient delivery, and expressive subscriptions rather than reliable event dissemination. However, this status quo is changing as more and more publish/subscribe services have started to be used in application domains that expose stringent reliability requirements. For example, a middleware complaint to the recent specification standardized by OMG for publish/subscribe services, namely Data Distribution Service (DDS), has been used in the novel combat management system proposed by Thales, namely TACTICOS, to manage all the C 4 I functionalities on several kind of warships. Most of the research efforts on investigating reliable publish/subscribe services focused on how to maintain the connectivity among publishers and subscribers after the occurrence of failures, while less interest has been put on dealing with message losses~. This is due to consideration that a publisher/subscriber service can be built on top of a given multicast protocol, and how to achieve loss-tolerance has not been felt challenging since it can be resolved by using a reliable multicast protocol. However, the loss-tolerance issues raised by LCCIs are far from been completely treated even using one of the best protocols available in the literature of the reliable multicast. In fact, most of the current reliable multicast approaches adopt reactive techniques to tolerate message losses, i. e., a dropped message is somehow detected by one of the destinations and a retransmission is triggered so that the message can be recovered. Such techniques allows guaranteeing an high degree of loss-tolerance, but there are no assurances on the timeliness of the deliveries. In fact, the number of retransmissions needed to successfully deliver a message depends on the number of consecutive messages dropped by the network. However, since ABL is not known a priori, it is unlikely to forecast how many retransmissions are needed to deliver a message, so the time to deliver a message in case of drops is not predictable and timeliness is not achieved. On the other hand, proactive techniques, i. e., necessary countermeasures to deal with possible message drops are taken prior their happening, are the only feasible means to guarantee both timeliness and reliability. In fact, such approaches minimize the time to recover a lost message, so communications over faulty networks do not suffer of performance fluctuations. However, current proactive approaches exhibit scalability and reliability limitations that prevent their usability in the context of LCCI. In addiction, current reliable publish/subscribe services that treat message losses suffer of two main drawbacks: (i) the event dissemination strategy is not chosen with respect to the specific conditions experienced by the network and (ii) the same strategy is adopted all over the service even if it is segmented in portion with different network conditions. Thesis Contribution The aim of this PhD thesis is to bring a significant contribution in the area of reliable multicast, with the goal of enabling the definition of novel strategies to provide both reliability and timeliness in large scale critical systems. The efforts striven in this dissertation result into the design of (i) innovative proactive techniques for Application-Layer Multicast (ALM) and (ii) a hierarchical cluster-based overlay network that optimizes the adopted reliability strategy according to the behaviour of the given routing domain. During the three years experience of the doctorate the main proactive methods have been investigated: -Forward Error Correction: additional data is coded from the message, so that the destination can recover the lost packages by decoding the received packages. FEC techniques exhibit the drawback that the coding actions are focused on the message senders leading to evident scalability problems. In fact, the redundancy degree is tailored on the destination that experiences the worst loss patter leading to unneeded traffic towards destinations that experience better loss patter than the worst one. This dissertation overcomes such issue by proposing a decentralized FEC technique where only a sub-set of interior nodes of a multicast tree performs coding actions. This allows to distributed the coding duties in several parts of the dissemination infrastructure and experimental data proved that scalability is proved respect to traditional FEC without affecting the achievable reliability degree. -Multi-tree Dissemination: studies have demonstrated that topology of the Internet is characterized by an intrinsic path redundancy degree, i. e., there are several distinct paths from a source to a given destination. Multi-tree dissemination takes advantage of such redundancy by sending several copies of a message through several paths towards the given destination. Reliability is achieved if the multicast forest, i. e., the several multicast trees built by the system among the subscribed applications, verifies the essential requirement of Path Diversity, the several paths connecting a source to a destination do not have to contain overlapping network devices. In fact, if path diversity is not verify, it is possible that the failure of an overlapping devices can leave to loss of all the messages and a destination can experience message drops. This dissertation resolves such matter by proposing a novel algorithm to built diverse trees. However, multi-tree dissemination is affected by a serious problem: a source originates additional traffic that wastes network resources and can cause congestion, which worsen the loss patterns imposed by the network. To deal with such problem, multi-tree dissemination is teamed with Network Coding. Network coding has been used in multicast solutions to achieve optimal throughput. Experimental data shows that network coding helps to mitigate the problem of un-efficient use of network resources that affect multi-tree dissemination. The last contribution of this thesis is a hierarchical architecture of a event dissemination solution for LCCIs. Such architecture is an hybrid peer-to-peer topology, characterized by two different layers: 1) the low layer is composed by a pure peer-to-peer cluster, and 2) the higher layer consists of a network of all the coordinators of each cluster of the LCCI. The cluster can be defined at deployment time of each system of the LCCI (e. g., each cluster consists of an entire system), or at run time, using a given proximity measure in order to group all the closer peers (e. g., each system may be made of several clusters). On one hand, each system administration can choose a reliability strategy tailored on the routing domain of the managed system, without considering the choice in other systems. In fact, to assist in such choice, this thesis presents a study of how the different available reliability means for ALMs perform under different network conditions. On the other hand, the network of the coordinators uses a single reliability technique that is able to guarantee event delivery even in the worst loss pattern. Since communications among coordinators have to be as much reliable and timely as possible, only the previously introduced proactive techniques are used. Thesis Organization - Chapter 1 provides the basic concepts of ULS systems and LCCIs and a description of the LCCI example that motivates the the studies which have been conducted in this thesis, concluding by emphasizing the problem of data dissemination in the context of LCCIs. On the other hand, it also gives an overview of publish/subscribe middleware, focusing on the issues of supporting reliable event dissemination. In addition, it describe the related literature on reliable publish/subscribe services, highlighting their relations with respect to LCCIs. - Chapter 2 provides an overview of the proposed loss-tolerance approaches available in literature and analyzes their pros and cons. - Chapter 3 describes the hybrid peer-to-peer topology to architect a data dissemination service suitable for LCCIs and how to choose the reliability strategy considering the network conditions experienced by the publishers/subscribers. - Chapter 4 is finally devoted to the experimental campaigns performed to assess the effectiveness of the approaches proposed in this dissertation...|$|E

The materialation of an architecture of permanence is explored through two primer projects, the first set on a disused harbour on the Shannon Estuary in the west of Ireland, the second in the new city quarter of Hamburg, Hafen City. Several texts are explored to gain an understanding of permanence within the architectural discourse. The final project, which looks at the lost demesnes of Ireland, considers permanence within the evolution of the landscape and how building within a existing system of control evolved over time can create permanence through a sense of continuity.
