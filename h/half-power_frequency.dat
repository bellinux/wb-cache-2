40|$|To {{reduce the}} effects of {{extraneous}} potentials caused by muscle tremor, sweating, and interference from power circuits, it is desirable to restrict the frequency range of the cathode ray vectorcardiograph. Mathematical analysis of idealized waves and experiments with a photoelectric electrocardiographic generator indicate that a frequency range between the <b>half-power</b> <b>frequency</b> of 0. 8 to 80 cycles per second is satisfactory for proper reproduction of most vectorcardiograms. Many investigators construct the vectorcardiogram graphically from the electrocardiogram. In this study it is shown that, unless simultaneous electrocardiograms recorded at greater than usual paper speed are used, such vectorcardiograms may be incorrect. D URING {{the past six years}} the attention of cardiologists in increasing numbers has been directed toward vectorcardi-ography. This attention has been stimulated by the hope that this phase of electrocardiog-raphy may lead to new information of clinical importance in detecting and evaluating heart disease and of physical importance in determin...|$|E
40|$|In cell-attached {{recordings}} from rods in the intact lizard retina, light decreased {{a standing}} inward membrane current with a reversal potential approximately 60 mV more positive than the resting potential. The peak amplitude of saturating responses depended upon {{the area of}} recorded membrane and varied from cell to cell over approximately 100 -fold range. Small patches of membrane gave variable responses to identical moderately intense flashes. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained on isolated frog rods with intact ellipsoids. Peak whole-cell photocurrent was related to flash intensity by a Michaelis equation with saturating response amplitudes ranging up to 30 pA in 0. 1 mM-Ca 2 + Ringer solution. In darkness the steady-state current-voltage relation, determined with whole-cell voltage clamp, showed outward rectification. Photocurrent had nearly constant amplitude between - 80 and - 10 mV, a mean reversal potential of + 8 mV and recovered from flashes more slowly at positive holding potentials. Although {{it was not possible}} to resolve light-sensitive single-channel current events, power spectral analysis revealed both low- and high-frequency components of the light-sensitive noise in both cell-attached and whole-cell recordings. The low-frequency component was described by the product of two Lorentzians using time constants derived from the kinetics of the dim flash response. The high-frequency component of the light-sensitive noise was described by a single Lorentzian with a <b>half-power</b> <b>frequency</b> of 62 Hz in lizard and 212 Hz in frog. The <b>half-power</b> <b>frequency</b> was not appreciably affected by steady illumination. The Lorentzian nature of the noise suggests that the light-sensitive channel is a pore rather than a shuttle-type carrier. In cell-attached recordings the high-frequency component declined monotonically with increasing light intensity, suggesting that less than one-half of the channels are open in darkness. Furthermore, the ratio of the variance of the high-frequency noise to the mean photocurrent was independent of light intensity. Changing external Ca 2 + from 0. 1 to 0. 5 mM reduced the ratio from 19. 7 to 9. 0 fA without a significant effect on the cut-off frequency of the noise. The results support the conclusion that the light-sensitive pore is opened by an internal transmitter that acts as an agonist and that both open and closed states of the pore may be blocked by external Ca 2 +. The conductance of the light-sensitive pore in the absence of external Ca 2 + is estimated to be 1. 25 - 2 pS. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E

Both band-pass and band-stop filters can be constructed and some filter circuits are shown later in the article. A key parameter in filter design is bandwidth. The bandwidth is measured between the cutoff frequencies, most frequently defined as the frequencies at which the power passed through the circuit has fallen to half the value passed at resonance.

40|$|Mass spectrometric {{measurement}} of DMS by atmospheric pressure ionization with an isotopically labeled standard (APIMS-ILS) is a sensitive method with sufficient bandpass for direct flux measurements by eddy correlation. Use of an isotopically labeled internal standard greatly reduces instrumental drift, improving accuracy and precision. APIMS-ILS {{has been used}} in several recent campaigns to study ocean-atmosphere gas transfer and the chemical budget of DMS in the marine boundary layer. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the method and errors associated with DMS flux measurement from ship platforms. The APIMS-ILS instrument used by most groups today has a sensitivity of 100 – 200 counts s − 1 pptv − 1, which is shown to be more than sufficient for flux measurement by eddy covariance. Mass spectral backgrounds (blanks) are determined by stripping DMS from ambient air with gold. The instrument is found to exhibit some high frequency signal loss, with a <b>half-power</b> <b>frequency</b> of ≈ 1 Hz, but a correction based on an empirically determined instrument response function is presented. Standard micrometeorological assumptions of steady state and horizontal uniformity are found to be appropriate for DMS flux measurement, but rapid changes in mean DMS mixing ratio may serve as a warning that measured flux does not represent the true surface flux. In addition, bias in surface flux estimates arising from the flux divergence is not generally significant in the surface layer, but under conditions of lowered inversion and high flux may become so. The effects of error in motion corrections and of vertical motion within the surface layer concentration gradient are discussed and the estimated maximum error from these effects is ≤ 18 %...|$|E
40|$|Inwardly {{rectifying}} K+ currents {{were studied}} in cut muscle fibres from frogs using the Vaseline-gap voltage-clamp method. Both {{faces of the}} membrane were exposed to 120 mM-K+ methylsulphate solution. At small negative potentials, - 10 and - 21 mV, the current noise spectrum, after subtraction of a control spectrum at the zero current potential, could be fitted by a Lorentzian spectral component, usually with an additional 1 /f component, where f is the frequency. At more negative potentials the 1 /f component predominated. The zero frequency amplitude of the Lorentzian averaged 2. 6 X 10 (- 24) A 2 Hz- 1 at - 10 mV and 4. 6 X 10 (- 24) A 2 Hz- 1 at - 21 mV, with a mean <b>half-power</b> <b>frequency,</b> fc, of 34 Hz and 45 Hz, respectively. The time constant of the K+ current activation upon hyperpolarization agrees with that calculated from fc, and the Lorentzian disappears upon replacement of external K+ by tetraethylammonium (TEA+) or Rb+. Thus, the Lorentzian component appears to be ascribable to fluctuations originating in the inwardly rectifying mechanism. The noise spectra and macroscopic currents were interpreted by assuming that the inwardly rectifying K+ conductance {{is proportional to the}} product of two parameters: ps representing the state of the mechanism that gives rise to the observable macroscopic current relaxations and to the current fluctuations resulting in the observed Lorentzian spectra, and pf describing the instantaneous rectification of the single-channel conductance. Alternatively, pf may represent another mechanism in series with ps, but which fluctuates too rapidly to measure. Using this model the limiting single-channel conductance, gamma, was found to be approximately 9 pS. The corresponding specific density of channels is about 1 micron- 2, assuming uniform distribution over all regions of the membrane. A preliminary value for gamma (DeCoursey & Hutter, 1982) was derived without consideration of instantaneous rectification. Systematic errors in these results due to voltage decrement in the T-tubules are evaluated in an Appendix, and are found to be tolerably small in the voltage range studied...|$|E
40|$|Low-frequency {{light-sensitive}} membrane {{current noise}} in isolated rod photoreceptors of the larval tiger salamander was recorded using suction electrodes, in the dark, and during light adaptation by backgrounds or by bleaching visual pigment. In background light, noise variance increases and then decreases. For rods desensitized to similar levels by bleaching visual pigment, the noise variance either {{does not change}} (weak adaptation) or decreases (with stronger adaptation). The power spectral density of the current noise in dark-adapted rods shows a component with <b>half-power</b> cut-off <b>frequency</b> at about 0. 1 Hz, attributed to spontaneous single events and continuous noise from dark phosphodiesterase activity. A second component, with <b>half-power</b> cut-off <b>frequency</b> at about 1 Hz, {{may be due to}} slow components in the light-sensitive channel gating. The power spectral density of the noise in background light is dominated by noise generated by the background. Background light adapts at least the first component of the noise seen in dark-adapted cells. For cells desensitized by bleaching, light adaptation of both components of the dark-adapted noise is observed. The results confirm that the low-frequency noise in dark-adapted cells arises from the transduction mechanism of the rod, in that both components can be light adapted, and show that, for rods permanently desensitized by bleaching, the desensitization is not due to the presence of active visual pigment molecules similar to those produced by background light...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the effect}} of both {{uniaxial}} anisotropy in the substrate and air gap layer on the resonant frequency and bandwidth of circular microstrip patch are investigated. The problem is rigorously formulated based on the spectral domain technic in conjunction with Galerkin approach for computing the resonant <b>frequency,</b> <b>half-power</b> bandwidth, and radiation field of a tunable circular patch antenna which is printed on isotropic or uniaxial anisotropic substrate. The TM set of modes issued from the magnetic wall cavity model theory are used to expand the unknown currents on the patch. Resonant frequency shift due to uniaxial anisotropy is firstly investigated for different anisotropy ratio values of substrate. Then, {{the effect of}} inclusion of air gap layer inserted between anisotropic substrate and ground plane on the resonance characteristics is also investigated. The results obtained from this approach are in very good agreement with the experimental results available in the literature. 1...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics {{of terrain}} {{features}} in orbital radar imagery are investigated {{on the basis}} of radar physics and the human visual system. Signal scattering, the dominant factor in radar imagery, is caused by look angle and relief displacement. Power spectra characteristics are explored, noting that surface scattering dominates the low frequencies and slope significantly affects the high frequency tone variations. The maximum human visual response has been identified for achromatic scenes as 7 cycles per degree, whereas in radar imagery the low <b>frequency</b> <b>half-power</b> point occurs near 2. 5 cycles/deg. Image feature size at a scale of 1 : 500, 000 has been calculated for the maximum human response at 1. 25 km. A hue-saturation-intensity transformation is presented for displaying two or three data sets on the same image and is demonstrated for Seasat SAR imagery.

40|$|The "combined" {{characteristics}} of the Bessel analog filters is investigated, where the combined characteristics implies the feature of the filters that represents how accurately the original signal will be reproduced when it is first divided by the low pass filter (LPF) and high pass filter (HPF), then those signals are summed after passing through these filters. It has been found that, in the gain-frequency {{characteristics of}} the combined filters (LP+HP), the Bessel filters of order N = 4 to 11, and 21 to 30 have rather flat combined gain-characteristics, while those of N = 2, 3, and 12 to 20, {{in the range of}} N ≦ 30 calculated, show dips greater than a few dB, at the cross-over angular frequency ω = 1 (renormalized with an <b>half-power</b> angular <b>frequency</b> ω 0). This is in contrast with the Butterworth filters previousely investigated: Butterworth filters of odd order have the perfect gain characteristics, namely, │G LPF (jω) +G HPF (jω) │ = 1. The group delay characteristics (τ d) of the Bessel combined filters is better than that of the Butterworth filters. The impulse response of the Bessel low pass filters shows only a simple peak near the corresponding delay time τd, and those of the high pass filters consist of a delta function at t = 0 and a slowly varing decay curve (represented by the 1 st kind Bessel function J 1 at N →∞). As the inpulse response of the combined Bessel filters is the sum of them, it is also simpler than that of the Butterworth filters...|$|R
