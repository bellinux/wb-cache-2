25|$|Wood burning: when wood is burned, it {{is usually}} best to dry it first. Damage from {{shrinkage}} {{is not a problem}} here, and the drying may proceed more rapidly than in the case of drying for woodworking purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons going up the chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100°C <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature,</b> about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning wet wood is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.|$|E
500|$|In late 1962, Air Marshal Sir John Nicholls instigated a trial when he flew Spitfire PM631, a PR Mk 19 in {{the custody}} of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, against an English Electric Lightning F 3 (a {{supersonic}} jet-engined interceptor) in mock combat at RAF Binbrook. At the time British Commonwealth forces were involved in possible action against Indonesia over Malaya and Nicholls decided to develop tactics to fight the Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang, a fighter that had a similar performance to the PR Mk 19. The first airframe (PM631) developed mechanical issues which removed it from the trial. Another PR Mk 19, PS853, which is now owned by Rolls-Royce, was on gate-guard duties at Binbrook, having been retired from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) one year before. It had been maintained in running condition by ground crews at Binbrook, and after a short time was participating in the trials. At the end of the trials, RAF pilots found that Firestreak infra-red guided missiles had trouble acquiring the Spitfire due to a low <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature,</b> and decided that the twin ADEN [...] cannons were the only weapons suited to the task, which was complicated by the tight turning circle of the Spitfire and the Lightning's proclivity for over-running the Spitfire. It was concluded that the most effective and safest way for a modern jet-engined fighter to attack a piston-engined fighter was to engage full afterburner at an altitude lower than the Spitfire, and behind it to perform a hit-and-run attack, contrary to all established fighter-on-fighter doctrine at that time.|$|E

30|$|The {{valve lift}} is read {{directly}} into the gas turbine controller. The pilot gas valve position is changed by the valve lift controller of the pilot gas. Both valves have electro-hydraulic actuators which are operated via two hardware outputs to the two coils of the electro-hydraulic actuators. Undesirable compressor operation is prevented via the compressor pressure ratio limit controller (also known as π controller). The function of the cool air limit controller is to rule out mode of operations, which leads to inadequate flow of cooling air to the turbine blades. The system <b>exhausted</b> <b>temperature</b> is being controlled by the IGVs by varying the air mass flow into the combustion chamber. <b>Exhausted</b> <b>temperature</b> is measured immediately downstream of the gas turbine via 24 triple-element thermocouples (MBA 26 CT 101 A/B/C to MBA 26 CT 124 A/B/C) placed around the surroundings of the exhaust diffuser. All B and C signals from the 24 triple-element thermocouples are {{used to calculate the}} mean turbine outlet temperature. These IGVs signal is influenced, in such a way, by two signals: one from the <b>exhausted</b> <b>temperature</b> control and the other from the compressor pressure ratio limit controller (Daewoo E&C, Siemens 2009 Approval).

40|$|Storage and {{regeneration}} {{events have}} been studied using fast-response emission analysers (∼ 10 ms) for a lean NOx trap (LNT) fitted to a light-duty diesel engine. Tests were conducted at both low and high <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperatures</b> for various storage and purging periods. The use of fast-response analysers has provided detailed information during the short regeneration periods and as combustion switched between rich and lean operating modes. It has also enabled quantification of the storage, reduction, and overall conversion efficiencies, {{as well as the}} instantaneous trapping efficiency. With <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 250 °C, storage efficiency was low (∼ 30 per cent). During purging, two distinct NO spikes (breakthroughs) were measured downstream of the LNT {{at the beginning and end}} of regeneration. For this LNT, the primary reducing mechanism is CO reacting with NO, but CO reacting with ceria and/or water, the water—gas shift reaction, is suspected. With <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 400 °C, storage efficiencies were high (∼ 80 – 90 per cent), except for the long-storage/short-purge case when the trap was near saturation. NOx breakthrough during enrichment depended on storage and purge periods and the availability of catalyst sites. NO 2 breakthrough was also observed at the end of regeneration as the combustion switched to lean operation. Generally, for the high-temperature case on this LNT, the primary reducing mechanism is CO reacting with NO 2...|$|R

In this paper, a GM (1, 1) Markov chain-based approach is introduced to forecast <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>temperature</b> by taking the advantages of GM (1, 1) model in time series and the advantages of Markov chain model in dealing with highly nonlinear and stochastic data caused by uncertain factors. In this approach, firstly, the GM (1, 1) model is used to forecast the trend by using limited data samples. Then, Markov chain model is integrated into GM (1, 1) model {{in order to enhance}} the forecast performance, which can solve the influence of random fluctuation data on forecasting accuracy and achieving an accurate estimate of the nonlinear forecast. As an example, the historical monitoring data of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>temperature</b> from CFM 56 aeroengine of China Southern is used to verify the forecast performance of the GM (1, 1) Markov chain model.

50|$|The {{nozzle area}} is {{increased}} during AB operation {{to limit the}} upstream effects on the engine.
