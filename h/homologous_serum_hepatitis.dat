40|$|The term "chronic {{hepatitis}} " {{has been}} suggested by Barker, Capps, and Allen (1) for reference to those patients with infectious hepatitis who fail to recover within 4 months of {{the onset of the}} disease. This term also appears to be applicable to those, patients with <b>homologous</b> <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> who fail to recover within 4 months. As used here the word "chronic " refers only to "duration without implication concerning the nature of the pathologic process or the eventual prognosis. " The frequency with which "virus hepatitis" becomes chronic is not known and probably varies with the patient's age, general condition (nu-tritional and otherwise), management, and pos-sibly with the strain of virus concerned. However, in a series of 431 unselected cases diagnosed as "infectious hepatitis " in the Mediterranean Theater (1), 18 per cent were classified as chronic {{on the basis of the}} above definition. Furthermore, under the favorable conditions associated with the study of induced infectious hepatitis in one group of healthy, well-nourished, adequately treated volunteers between the ages of 18 and 32, approximately 15 per cent failed to recover com-pletely within 4 months, although all achieved complete clinical recovery within one year (2, 3). On the basis of these data and the high incidence of acute virus hepatitis during recent years, the occurrence of a relatively large number of such chronic cases (as defined above) might be ex-pected. 1 This investigation was made possible by a gran...|$|E
40|$|Results of the assay of transaminases and lactic {{dehydrogenase}} in blood, {{proposed as}} a screening procedure for subclinical hepatitis in blood donors, {{show that the}} method of sampling influences the analytic results. Determinations of GOT and GPT may prove useful if made on specimens separated from cells soon after collection. Plasma in contact with cells from blood preserved in acid citrate dextrose solution appears to yield good results up to 21 days. Lactic-dehydrogenase levels are of limited value for this screening. A TTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE to detect asymptomatic carriers of ho-mologous serum jaundice virus by {{using a variety of}} liver-function tests on blood collected from donors (1, 2). Levels of glutamic oxal-acetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) are elevated in liver disease, and the determination of GOT levels on donor blood specimens has been proposed recently as a screening test to detect carriers of homolo-gous serum hepatitis. It has been shown that the incidence of homol-ogous serum disease was higher in patients who received blood with high GOT levels than in a control group who received blood with nor-mal levels of this enzyme (3). In view of the possible usefulness of enzyme determinations as screening tests to detect carriers of <b>homologous</b> <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> a study was undertaken to analyze the factors which might influence the levels of GOT, GPT, and LDH in pilot tubes and citrated blood.

40|$|Infectious {{hepatitis}} is epidemiologically and im-munologically {{distinct from}} <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> The Australia antigen is related more specifically to <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> The possible role of coronavirus-and para-myxovirus-like {{particles in the}} aetiology of some infections of the liver in man and in marmosets inoculated with human infectious hepatitis material is discussed and the difficulties {{in the interpretation of}} the currently available data are emphasized. The recent studies in Melbourne of a faecal antigen found in some patients with infectious hepatitis and the discovery of an antiserum in Milan which reacted with an antigen associated with epidemic hepatitis are discussed. Mention is made of the recent isolation in Detroit- 6 cells of virus-like particles from patients with infectious hepatitis. It is concluded that viral hepatitis is an infection of multiple aetiology and that the successful cultiva-tion in vitro of the agent or agents of hepatitis remains the outstanding and most urgent problem. Definition The usual definition of viral hepatitis is acute inflammation of the liver caused by two infectious agents, presumably viruses, named virus A, the aetiological agent of infectious hepatitis or epidemic hepatitis and virus B, which is the cause of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> or <b>homologous</b> <b>serum</b> jaundice. The definition excludes by common usage acute inflam-mation of the liver which may be induced by well recognized viruses such as yellow fever, adeno-viruses, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie viruses, herpes simplex virus and others (reviewed by Zuckerman, 1970 a).

Out of 178 cases, 18 (10. 1 %) developed <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and 3 (1. 7 %) were jaundiced. The incidence of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in the subjects who recieved blood from voluntary donors was apparently {{lower than that of}} the subjects received blood from paid donors. 2.

40|$|The {{abnormal}} electrophoretic {{patterns of}} the serum proteins in the acute stage of virus hepati-tis were first described by Gray and Barron in 1943 (1) and have since been confirmed by sev-eral investigators (2 - 5). In {{the last few years}} there has been considerable interest (6 - 13) in cases of hepatitis progressing to chronic liver dis-ease, or developing post-necrotic cirrhosis. Ex-cept for the study by Martin (4), however, little information has been presented on the serum proteins after the acute stage of the disease. The present investigation was undertaken to observe the alterations of the serum proteins dur-ing the course of virus hepatitis, including its later stages. METHODS Electrophoretic runs were performed with standard apparatus and technique, the experimental details having been given in an earlier report (14). The tests of hepatic function were performed by the usual methods as pre-viously described (14), alkaline phosphatase being re-ported in Bodansky units. In our experience (15), the thymol turbidity test with buffer pH 7. 55 has not in-frequently given values of 4 or 5 units in normal indi-viduals. CASE MATERIAL Ten volunteer subjects with normal tests of hepatic function served as controls, the data having been pre-viously reported (14). Twenty-one clinically typical cases of hepatitis were studied. Histologic verification of parenchymal in-volvement compatible with virus hepatitis was obtained in 14 cases, the tissue having been secured by one or more Vim Silverman needle biopsies or at laparotomy, and in two cases (E.

Out of 29 cases, 9 cases including 4 cases icteric <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were proved to be the subjects received blood from the donors with a history of hepatitis after 1957. Comparing with the incidence rate of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> by the blood transfusion from the voluntary donors for a same period.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the incidence, clinical feature, prognosis and prophylaxis of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> followed by blood transfusion. The results obtained were as follows; 1) Incidence of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> among the patients who had blood transfusion at local institutions in Okayama City was 3. 3 % in 1957 and 4. 7 % in 1958, on the other hand, at Okayama University Hospital in 1958 it was 5. 0 % in the First Surgical Division, 5. 4 % the Second Surgery and 5. 2 % OBGYN respectively. The patients with <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> had received the amount 2, 600 to 1, 120 cc of blood, whereas 810 to 1, 120 cc in the cases who never developed <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> after blood transfusion. 2) Mean incubation period was 72. 8 days ranging 19 to 180 days calculated from the date of last blood transfusion. Prodremal stage varied from 1 to 20 days, average 6. 1 days, icteric stage 7 to 15 days, average 35. 8 days, and convalescent stage 7 to 200 days, average 30. 0 days. 3) Characteristic initial symptoms were anorexia, malaise and jaundice by which fairly number of the cases noticed the onset of the disease. Few had febrile course but low grade in most of the cases. 4) Laboratory data were obtained from the 20 cases of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> admitted to our First Mebical Division. Serum bilirubin showed the maximum level on the 10 th day, average 13. 0 mg%. No significant changes were noted in peripheral blood picture but for a slight initial monocytosis. SGO-T and SGP-T presented a elevation earlier than that of serum bilirubin, maximum on or about the 5 th day and then decreased abruptly. Serum colloidal liver function tests; in initial stage, positive Takata's reaction in 51. %, positive CCF 46 % and TTT 58 % were noted, but even after 100 th day Takata's reaction was positive in 25 % of the cases. 5) Follow-up studies were made on 49 <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> cases discharged from our hospital with complete recovery. 69 % of these had subjective symptems in some sort or another. Enlargement of the liver was noted in 20 % of the cases. 33 cases were studied with special reference to liver function tests and liver biopsy. It was revealed that 43 % of the cases still had impairment of liver function and that by means of liver biopsy, postnecrotic cirrhosis was found 9. 1 % of the cases. Therefore, the prognosis of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> of this type was considered to be grave. 6) For the purpose of prophylaxis, 300 to 600 mg of gamma globulin was simultaneously administered on blood transfusion in 38 cases.

The immunologic relationships between <b>homologous</b> <b>serum</b> jaundice and infectious hepatitis are also not clear. Both conditions probably belong to the same general group but the evidence for cross-immunity between them is contradictory.

40|$|The meningococcus, {{like some}} other {{pathogenic}} species, varies in its agglutination in immune serum, some strains being readily agglutinable while others agglutinate with difficulty in their <b>homologous</b> <b>serum</b> {{as well as}} in heterologous serums. The different strains appear to vary also in their action as antigens. In order to secure representative strains, therefore, it was thought necessary to consider the antigenic action as well as the agglutinability of the cultures...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{suspected}} disease involving {{the liver and}} seen at a department for infectious diseases were examined routinely for Au-antigen. Of 344 patients examined, 259 {{were found to have}} biochemical evidence of liver affection. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed in 129, including 65 with <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> 18 with infections hepatitis and 46 with sporadic hepatitis. 62 patients had Au-antigen and 60 of them belonged to the group acute hepatitis. 69 % of the patients with <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and 28 % of those with sporadic hepatitis were Au-antigen positive. Most of the patients harboured the antigen only temporarily. It was demonstrated up to 2 - 7 weeks after anamnestic onset. In 5 patients Au-antigen in the serum persisted for 5 - 15 months; histologic examination of biopsy specimen showed signs of chronic liver disease in 4, only mild changes in 1. Only 3 patients had antibodies in the serum; all of them had been exposed to antigen for a long time. In one patient with arthritis Au-antigen was repeatedly demonstrated in both serum and joint exudate...|$|R
40|$|The {{records of}} 125 {{patients}} who had been treated as <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in The 1 st Department of Internal Medicine from 1965 to 1966 were analyzed from the points of view of various clinical evidences and prognosis. Clinical types of the <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were divided into the following three groups: acute type, shifting type developing from acute to chronic stage, and chronic type. In the each type, the latent period was 6 to 8 weeks in the most cases. Most cases had anorexia, weakness, jaundice, nausea and the other gastrointestinal disorders in acute type. On the other hand, no symptomes were observed frequently {{in the cases of}} chronic type. It was confirmed that chronic inducing factors; male, older age, drinking alcohol, preceding illness and complications etc. were recognized frequently in both cases of the chronic and shifting type in these studies. It was generally noted that the courses of the cases who had abnormal colloid-reactions {{at the beginning of their}} illness were predisposed to be prolonged, but they tended to be short promptly when their serum transaminase activities returned to normal rapidly...|$|R
