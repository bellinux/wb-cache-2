After the guards' {{departure}} Quatermass speaks with a tramp, who explains that {{there used to be}} a small <b>government</b> <b>research</b> unit consisting of a few huts by Winnerden Flats, and that a year ago they expanded and bulldozed the village, and built the plant and a prefab town for the construction workers. At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E

About 60 percent of RTI's staff are headquartered on a 180-acre campus inside the Research Triangle Park. Most of RTI International's funding comes from <b>government</b> <b>research</b> contracts. In 2012 it authored 627 journal articles. At the time, RTI owned 400 patents. RTI competes {{with the three}} universities that form the research triangle and other research institutes for contracts.

5|$|Henry finds a {{backpack}} and disposable camera {{belonging to a}} boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains {{was the son of}} Ned (Mac Brandt), a fellow lookout. Brian had illicitly stayed with his father, though Delilah had kept this from her superiors, and both Brian and Ned had disappeared without a trace. The teenage girls are reported missing. Henry later discovers a radio and clipboard with transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is knocked out and finds the clipboard and radio gone. Henry proceeds to break into a <b>government</b> <b>research</b> area, discovering surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's lives and conversations. After taking a tracking device, he leaves the compound. As Henry hikes back, he witnesses it set afire by an unknown individual. Using the tracking device, Henry finds {{a backpack}} with the keys to the cave. Delilah reports someone in Henry's tower. Henry finds a Walkman with incriminating conversations of him and Delilah plotting to destroy the compound.|$|E

5|$|Tennis for Two is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} in 1958, which simulates {{a game of}} tennis, {{and was one of}} the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the <b>government</b> <b>research</b> institution's Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance. He designed the game, displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers, in a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over three weeks. The game's visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing a button.|$|E

25|$|Historically, storm chasing {{relied on}} either in-field {{analysis}} {{or in some}} cases nowcasts from trained observers and forecasters.

25|$|Israel {{has made}} {{a concerted effort to}} improve the economy’s ability to benefit from an {{enhanced}} system of intellectual property rights. This includes increasing the resources of the Israel Patent Office, upgrading enforcement activities and implementing programmes to bring ideas funded by <b>government</b> <b>research</b> to the market. Between 2002 and 2012, foreigners accounted for nearly 80% of the patent applications filed with the Israel Patent Office. A sizeable share of foreign applicants seeking protection from the Israel Patent Office are pharmaceutical companies such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Janssen, Novartis, Merck, Bayer-Schering, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer, which happen to be the main business competitors of Israel’s own Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.|$|E
25|$|In most poorer countries, health care—ranging {{from basic}} {{pharmaceuticals}} and postnatal care to costly multidrug therapies—remains very limited. Market forces drive private pharmaceutical companies, and many developed country <b>government</b> <b>research</b> programs, {{to focus on}} drugs needed in their environment, not necessarily those of the poorer countries. This is generating a growing controversy between rich and poorer nations over such issues as intellectual property rights, as some developing countries make their own copies, not always with permission, of drugs under patent protection. Developing countries also are less willing to make microbial samples available to companies that will make commercial vaccines from them, which may be too costly for the country that provided the sample.|$|E
25|$|Since ancient times, shamans and {{medicine}} men have used psychedelics {{as a way}} {{to gain access to the}} spirit world. They grow naturally in certain cacti, and in seeds, bark and roots of various plants. Over the course of the '50s and '60s, scientists conducted extensive research to discover whether or not psychedelics have any medicinal purposes. Studies ceased from about 1970, due to the prohibition, to the year 2000. Research currently takes place in universities across the country. Current case studies show LSD can be used to treat addictions to opium and alcohol. Studies also show that psilocybin (magic mushrooms) are useful in treating addictions, depression and severe anxiety. Native American tribes all through North America still practice the use of psychedelics legally with authorization from the federal <b>government.</b> <b>Research</b> is also watched over by the government.|$|E
