40|$|New {{measurements}} of surface impedance in ybco {{show that the}} c-axis penetration depth and conductivity below Tc exhibit behaviour different from that observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes.</b> <b>The</b> c-axis penetration depth never has the linear temperature dependence seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ab-plane. Instead of the conductivity peak seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes,</b> <b>the</b> c-axis microwave conductivity falls to low values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superconducting state, then rises slightly below 20 K. These results show that c-axis transport remains incoherent below Tc, {{even though this is}} one of the least anisotropic cuprate superconductors. Comment: 4 -page...|$|R

The first is the ordinary focused optical imaging system, wherein <b>the</b> input <b>plane</b> is called <b>the</b> object <b>plane</b> and <b>the</b> output <b>plane</b> is called <b>the</b> image <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image <b>plane</b> is desired to be a high-quality reproduction of <b>the</b> field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> object <b>plane.</b> <b>In</b> this case, <b>the</b> impulse response of the optical system is desired to approximate a 2D delta function, at the same location (or a linearly scaled location) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> output <b>plane</b> corresponding to <b>the</b> location of <b>the</b> impulse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> input <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> actual impulse response typically resembles an Airy function, whose radius is on the order of the wavelength of <b>the</b> light used. <b>In</b> this case, <b>the</b> impulse response is typically referred to as a point spread function, since the mathematical point of light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> object <b>plane</b> has been spread out into an Airy function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image <b>plane.</b>|$|R
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E
5|$|Goldstein was {{the host}} of Gone Too Far, a drug {{intervention}} reality show for MTV. He had approached MTV in mid 2008, pitching {{the idea of a}} reality show that focused on his life to Tony DiSanto.

The show was still in pre-production when Goldstein was injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> crash. Following the crash, the show's producer Cheryl Sirulnick said she assumed the show would not go ahead, but Goldstein insisted on continuing. Eight episodes were filmed; three days before his death, Goldstein tweeted that filming had been completed.|$|E

Mrs. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E

5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> that represent the fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.|$|E
