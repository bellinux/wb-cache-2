5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E

25|$|After 1950 {{the country}} {{suffered}} economic disruptions {{about once a}} decade; the most serious crisis occurred in the late 1970s. In each case, an industry-led period of rapid expansion, marked by a sharp <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports,</b> resulted in a balance of payments crisis. Devaluations of the Turkish lira and austerity programs designed to dampen domestic demand for foreign goods were implemented in accordance with International Monetary Fund guidelines. These measures usually led to sufficient improvement in the country's external accounts to make possible the resumption of loans to Turkey by foreign creditors. Although the military interventions of 1960 and 1971 were prompted in part by economic difficulties, after each intervention Turkish politicians boosted government spending, causing the economy to overheat. In the absence of serious structural reforms, Turkey ran chronic current account deficits usually financed by external borrowing that made the country's external debt rise from decade to decade, reaching by 1980 about US$16.2 billion, or more than one-quarter of annual gross domestic product. Debt-servicing costs in that year equaled 33 percent of exports of goods and services.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperRecent <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> of catfish and {{crawfish}} {{have caused}} concern {{as to their}} impact on domestic prices. This study identifies the linkages between imports of these goods and U. S. producer prices. <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> of catfish are shown to decrease related domestic prices. However, recent trends show a simultaneous <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> both <b>imports</b> and domestic prices of crawfish. An <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> consumer income also typically indicates a corresponding <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the demand for catfish and crawfish.

The models showed different relationships between domestic prices of these goods and other aquaculture and meat products. In addition, the reciprocal of the direct elasticity is not always a good approximation of the direct flexibility because of the stochastic properties of the econometric model. As a result, it is not proper to use the indirect price flexibility from inverted direct price elasticity with other variables for catfish and crawfish...|$|R

30|$|The {{downstream}} {{agricultural industry}} in country H would be facing {{higher levels of}} import competition, which are derived from the technology and productivity upgrading efforts in country F’s downstream and upstream industries. However, it would be simultaneously benefiting from the extra lower prices of the upstream product, which are derived from the upgrading efforts in country F’s upstream industry. For instance, consider the case where {{the effects of the}} additional <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> competition levels outweigh the benefits from the extra lower prices of the upstream product. Then, country H’s downstream agricultural industry would respond by either upgrading its technology and productivity efforts (as illustrated in the previous section) or by reducing them (as illustrated in the previous section). Reversed responses could occur when the benefits from the extra lower prices of the upstream product outweigh the corresponding effects of <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> competition levels.|$|R
40|$|For a small {{open economy}} {{importing}} its capital goods, a tariff increase may cause {{the price of}} machines to rise, leading to lower investment and slower productivity growth.

A counterfactual experiment suggests that Chile would have recovered from the economic crisis of 1982 - 1983 at a sub-stantially faster rate had there been no temporary <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> prices associated with higher tariffs in the mid- 1980 s...|$|R

40|$|The Romans {{were perhaps}} the most {{impressive}} exponents of water resource management in preindustrial times with irrigation and virtual water trade facilitating unprecedented urbanisation and socioeconomic stability {{for hundreds of years}} in a region of highly variable climate. To understand Roman water resource management in response to urbanisation and climate variability, a Virtual Water Network of the Roman World was developed. Using this network we find that irrigation and virtual water trade increased Roman resilience to climate variability in the short term. However, urbanisation arising from virtual water trade likely pushed the Empire closer to the boundary of its water resources, led to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> costs, and reduced its resilience to climate variability in the long-term. In addition to improving our understanding of Roman water resource management, our cost-distance based analysis illuminates how <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> costs arising from climatic and population pressures are likely to be distributed in the future global virtual water network...|$|R

30|$|The RTA-induced {{intensification}} of market competition, realized through <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> levels, could potentially provoke domestic {{firms in the}} agricultural sector to respond by upgrading their production technology and productivity levels to maintain or expand their domestic market shares vis-à-vis foreign regional exporting competitors. These potential responses are in accordance with many conventional studies indicating that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> competition levels would potentially induce domestic firms to upgrade their innovation activities (e.g., Pugel, 1978; Caves, 1985; Levinsohn, 1991). Furthermore, following {{the formation of a}} regional trading bloc, domestic firms in the agricultural sector become more exposed to foreign production technologies and practices. In this context, Josling (2011) noted that the formation of RTAs would promote flows of knowledge and technology between member countries, particularly from highly competitive agricultural sectors in some member countries to agricultural sectors in other member countries. This exposure to foreign knowledge and technology could generate supplementary incentives for domestic firms in the agricultural sector to invest in upgrading their production technologies and practices and realize the spillover effects.|$|R

Linking industry-level data on imports with the working histories of 141, 000 manufacturing workers, we show that import competition from China is positively associated with the probability of becoming unemployed. In particular, a standard deviation <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> competition from China raises the probability of becoming unemployed between 0. 8 and 3. 5 percentage points, which represents between a 9 % and a 44 % increase relative to the unconditional probability of becoming unemployed.

Also, our estimations show that there is weak evidence of a positive association between a higher import competition from China and the probability of switching to an employment outside the manufacturing sector...|$|R
30|$|In {{assessing}} {{the effect of}} trade openness on labor demand, Rodrik (1997) argues that imports not only push the price index down but also raise the price elasticity of demand (η) as access {{to a wide variety}} of consumer goods increases. The own-price elasticity of labor demand will thus <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>import</b> competing industries. He also underscores that better access to imported intermediate inputs and parts may give domestic firms further flexibility in organizing production which implies an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> σ and thus higher wage elasticity of labor demand following a reduction <b>in</b> <b>import</b> restrictions. Slaughter (2001) provides further details on these mechanisms.|$|R
