40|$|Using {{stochastic}} modelling, we {{demonstrate that}} the best investment strategy for the accumulation phase of a defined contribution pension plan is one that limits the range of returns that are credited to the plan member’s account. In particular, we show that withprofit accumulation programmes which make use of a smoothing fund to smooth out returns over time dominate unit-linked accumulation programmes. However, for the <b>decumulation</b> phase, we show {{that it is hard}} in practice for an investment-linked <b>decumulation</b> programme to beat the income and security provided by a standard annuity, although we again find that with-profit <b>decumulation</b> programmes dominate unit-linked <b>decumulation</b> programmes.

40|$|<b>Decumulation</b> in the {{retirement}} income context is the using up of retirement savings {{by way of}} drawing out regular income – for example, a fixed amount each month. It’s the converse of accumulating retirement savings while in paid work by regularly putting money aside. And return on investment plays its part in both: in the accumulation phase it enhances the amount saved; in the <b>decumulation</b> phase it enhances the regular amount that can be paid out. The first question is whether <b>decumulation</b> is something that actually needs any policy attention. Since {{the answer to that}} question here is a qualified yes, the next part of this article outlines a number of <b>decumulation</b> methods, considering such matters as cost, risk and flexibility. The desirability of any form of decumulation to individuals will naturally vary according to their preferences in respect of those points. The article concludes by positing some public good components in respect of each <b>decumulation</b> method, and setting out some possible government interventions in response. • Geoff Rashbrooke is a Senior Associate of the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies.

40|$|Two {{explanations}} {{have been}} proposed for the observed slowness of wealth <b>decumulation</b> by the elderly in the literature: the precautionary saving induced by (uninsurable) uncertainty {{about the time of}} death or by the possibility of major catastrophes in old age that require large outlays; the desire to pass part of the accumulated assets on to one's heirs. We reconsider the issue of wealth <b>decumulation</b> by the elderly and assess the presence of a transfer motive, drawing on Italian data. We show that if intergenerational transfer of assets takes place well before the time of death, induced for instance by existence of liquidity constraints on younger families, then tests for the presence of a transfer motive based on the relative speed of <b>decumulation</b> of elderly households with and without a potential bequest motive might have little discriminatory power. We suggest that in this case one should look at the whole pattern of asset accumulation and <b>decumulation.</b> We also offer an alternative test of the bequest motive based on life insurance purchases. ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on issues related to asset <b>decumulation.</b> In {{discussing}} these issues, a key proposition is that financial institutions are most {{willing and able to}} offer <b>decumulation</b> products with fixed payment promises to the extent they are able to invest in financial assets that allow them to hedge a considerable part of the risks associated with the payment promises they extend. Indeed, what is sometimes overlooked in discussions bout shifts from asset accumulation to <b>decumulation</b> is that the <b>decumulation</b> phase also involves investment challenges, especially if specific patterns of payouts such as regular payouts of fixed amounts are aimed at. Many writers have argued for some time now that pension fund managers will have difficulty implementing asset-liability matching because there are insufficient quantities of suitable assets. As it turns out, the shortfall in hedging instruments extends to more than just the “toxic” tail of longevity risk, as is commonly being argued. The analysis in this article shows that hedging interest rate risk is also not as straightforward as one may think. ...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} study {{in a series of}} three papers {{examining}} retirement wealth decisions in Australia's superannuation system. The work seeks to introduce a holistic approach to examining decision making across the key stages of retirement wealth provision, namely: accumulation; conversion; and, <b>decumulation.</b> The central idea considered in this study relates to the <b>decumulation</b> of superannuation savings. Using a sample of 365 Australians over the age of 45, we consider three areas: financial market factors (the integration of the public pension with superannuation), attitudes to superannuation and annuity market features (the lack of financial advice/knowledge, and the skewing of savings towards housing), and the influence of demographic characteristics (gender and income) in light of <b>decumulation</b> outcomes.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, which {{presents}} a simplified behavioral finance model, we incorporate regret into {{the decision-making process}} of a pension fund and derive the optimal asset allocation of a final-wealth-maximizing pension fund in the accumulation and <b>decumulation</b> phases. We find that the optimal allocation must be congruent in both phases {{if and only if}} the pension fund is upside regret averse. In particular, our results suggest that allocation to risky assets must increase through time in the accumulation and <b>decumulation</b> phases so that the pension fund can realize gains from any upsides in the risky asset market, thereby maximizing final wealth and limiting the feeling of regret ex-post. Although decisions in both phases are congruent, we find that the optimal asset allocation generally depends on wealth levels. This evidence implies that separate management of the accumulation and <b>decumulation</b> phases of a pension fund decreases available wealth levels and is not an optimal strategy. Keywords.

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries {{have increased their}} foreign reserve stocks dramatically in recent years, in large part motivated by the desire for precautionary self-insurance. One of {{the negative consequences of}} large accumulations for these countries is the risk of valuation losses. In this paper we examine the implications of systematic reserve <b>decumulation</b> by the Czech authorities aimed at mitigating valuation losses on euro-denominated assets. The policy was explicitly not intended to influence the value of the koruna relative to the euro. Initially the timing and size of reserve sales was not predictable, eventually sales occurred on a daily basis (in three equal installments within the day). This project examines whether these reserve sales, both during the regime of discretionary timing as well as when sales occurred every day, had unintended consequences for the domestic currency. Our findings using intraday exchange rate data and time-stamped reserve sales indicate that when <b>decumulation</b> occurred every day these sales led to significant appreciation of the koruna. Overall, our results suggest that the manner in which reserve sales are carried out matters for whether reserve <b>decumulation</b> influences the relative value of the domestic currency. foreign exchange reserves, exchange rate determination, high- frequency volatility modeling...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{discussion}} about, and analysis of, old age wealth <b>decumulation</b> in New Zealand. The {{way that people}} acquire and dispose of wealth in New Zealand is very closely related to their age and stage of life, and as people enter into their elder years their income tends to slowly decrease as hours of work are reduced, and their expenditure slowly begins to increase as health and other support needs increase. In New Zealand the government {{plays a significant role}} in funding elder care, and has a series of levers which indirectly manage the rate at which wealth is decumulated. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine and critique some of the key levers that have been set by legislation and government policy that manage wealth <b>decumulation</b> in old age. This paper argues that there is a tension that needs to be managed by the legislative and policy settings for wealth <b>decumulation,</b> which is that there is a social benefit in helping elderly people retain financial independence for as long as possible, but that there is also a benefit to the state if people pay for as much of their own care as possible...|$|E

One product that appeared to address both sides of this risk tradeoff is tontine insurance, which became popular in the US in the late 1800 ’s. While tontine insurance is now illegal in the US, an effort to understand the psychological factors like intertemporal optimism and perceived fairness that made tontine insurance so successful in the past may allow us to develop more effective approaches for the annuity products of today...|$|E

40|$|Although {{consumer}} financial {{decision making}} has attracted renewed attention from marketing researchers, issues of consumer <b>decumulation</b> of retirement wealth have remained relatively unexplored. Research on <b>decumulation</b> presents an interesting problem for both behavioral and quantitative marketing researchers; it {{is a choice}} problem with large stakes, multiple sources of uncertainty, and difficult tradeoffs. As a contribution to such research, we measure and model individual preferences for life annuities using a choice-based stated-preference survey of adults aged 45 - 65 from a nationwide internet panel. Each annuity is presented {{in terms of its}} consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly inflation adjustments, period certain guarantees, and company rating, and includes a “no choice ” option that allows consumers to self-manage their assets. Our model of preferences allows each attribute to influence utility beyond its influence on the expected present value of the annuity, i. e., the expected NPV of the payments. We find that some attributes directly influence preferences beyond their impact on NPV and that valuation of those attributes depends on how information is displayed. We end by discussing the implication of such preferences for marketers and policy makers interested in promoting annuitization...|$|E
