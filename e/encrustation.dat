5|$|Inocybe godeyi {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print, while the {{individual}} spores themselves are smooth and almond-shaped. The spores measure 9 to 11.5 by 5.5 to 7micrometres. Each basidium bares four spores. Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edges of the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the faces of the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of <b>encrustation</b> at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata has {{thin-walled}} cheilocystidia, {{which are}} clavate (club-shaped), lack <b>encrustation</b> at the apex, and are colourless. The basidia are also clavate, {{and can be}} two-, three- or four-spored, and measure from 15 to 30 micrometres (μm) by 5 to 9μm. The sterigmata (the narrow horns {{on the end of}} the basidia which hold the spores) are 4 to 5μm long. It lacks pleurocystidia. The species leaves a snuff-brown spore print. The spores themselves are smooth and bean shaped; they have a yellow-brown to rusty brown colouration, and measure from 9 to 11μm by 4.5 to 5.5μm. The hyphae can have clamp connections, but can also lack them.|$|E
5|$|The Jain Temple at Lakkundi marked an {{important}} step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave (chhajja), used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified dravida outline. Miniature towers of both dravida and nagara types are used as ornamentation on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original dravida structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental <b>encrustation</b> that covers the surface of each storey.|$|E
40|$|Urinary bladder {{catheter}} <b>encrustations</b> {{are known}} complications of long-term urinary catheterisation, which is commonly seen in clinical practice. These <b>encrustations</b> can impede deflation of the balloon and therefore cause {{problems in the}} removal of the catheter. The options in managing an encrusted and incarcerated urinary bladder catheter include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and lithoclast. We describe here another technique of dealing with a stuck and encrustated catheter, via direct crushing of the <b>encrustations</b> with a rigid cystoscope inserted through a suprapubic cystostomy tract...|$|R

50|$|Zippeite is a hydrous {{potassium}} uranium sulfate mineral with formula: K4(UO2)6(SO4)3(OH)10·4(H2O). It forms {{yellow to}} reddish brown monoclinic-prismatic crystals with perfect cleavage. The typical form is as <b>encrustations</b> and pulverulent earthy masses. It forms as efflorescent <b>encrustations</b> in underground uranium mines. It has a Mohs hardness of 2 and a specific gravity of 3.66. It is strongly fluorescent yellow in UV radiation {{and is a}} radioactive mineral.|$|R
25|$|In fact, {{barnacle}} <b>encrustation</b> negatively influences {{swimming in}} C. hastata. Those swimming with barnacle <b>encrustation</b> require more energy and show a detectable difference in anaerobic energy expenditure than those without <b>encrustation.</b> In {{the absence of}} barnacle <b>encrustation,</b> individual scallops swim significantly longer, travel further, and attain greater elevation.|$|E

25|$|In 1907, {{the church}} complex {{experienced}} another repair {{which included the}} removal of the <b>encrustation</b> of brick work and the undercovering of the doorways. Then in the 1980s more restoration work took place on the walls and the columns of the church.|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{offshore exploration}} campaign, aiming at identifying and evaluating the ferromanganese-bearing <b>encrustations</b> and micronodules discovered previously {{on the top}} sediment layers of the seamounrt, provided the means for constructing the geochemical maps of Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu and of interpreting a complex metals history {{that in addition to}} ferromanganese mineralization, resulted in metal-bearing massive sulfides interpreted to be the outcome of ongoing hydrothermal activity. The data have shown meaningful associations: the first (Fe-Cu) is interpreted as being linked with the sulfides,; the second (Mn-Ni-Co), with ferromanganese bearing <b>encrustations</b> and micronodules. In relation to the area where sulfides were discovered, the zoning of Mn and Fe supports the idea that <b>encrustations</b> and micronodules are also primarily of hydrothermal origin. This interpretation is supported by using a discriminant plot. The presence of traces of ferromanganese mineralizations associated with low redox facies in depth is viewed as being caused by remobilization of previously deposited Mn mineral	 phases, thus posing the question that diagenetic processes may also have {{played a significant role in}} the deposition of the <b>encrustations</b> and micronodules...|$|R

25|$|Some scallops, {{including}} Chlamys hastata, frequently carry epibionts such as sponges and barnacles {{on their}} shell. The {{relationship of the}} sponge to the scallop is characterized {{as a form of}} mutualism, because the sponge provides protection by interfering with adhesion of predatory sea-star tube feet, camouflages Chlamys hastata from predators, or forms a physical barrier around byssal openings to prevent sea stars from inserting their digestive membranes. Sponge <b>encrustation</b> protects C. hastata from barnacle larvae settlement, serving as a protection from epibionts that increase susceptibility to predators. Thus, barnacle larvae settlement will occur more frequently on sponge-free shells than sponge-encrusted shells.|$|E

Off Jamaica, large numbers of yellow stingrays, up to one per square meter, gather beneath the aerial roots of mangrove trees used as roosts by cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis); it is theorized that the birds' droppings sustain invertebrates that attract the rays. There is no evidence of seasonal migration, though during the spring females tend to be found closer to shore than males.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{studied and}} {{categorised}} {{the collection of}} stones at Guy's, concentrating particularly on the crystal structures of the nuclei, since stone formation followed {{once there was a}} nucleus on which to form. [...] He considered the chemistry of the nuclei {{to be the most important}} aspect of stone formation. [...] Bird identified many species of stone, classified by the chemistry of the nucleus, but determined that they all fell within two overall groups: organic stones caused by a misfunctioning bodily process, and excessive inorganic salts causing sediment on which the stone could nucleate. [...] In 1842, Bird became the first to describe oxaluria, sometimes called Bird's disease, which is caused by an excess of oxalate of lime in the urine.Lee, p. 27Talbott, p. 599Schmidt, p. 342 [...] This is the second most common cause of kidney stones, the first being uric acid and its ammonium salt. [...] There are several others, such as ammonium oxalate. [...] In his great work Urinary Deposits, Bird devotes much space to the identification of chemicals in urine by microscopic examination of the appearance of crystals in it. [...] He shows how the appearance of crystals of the same chemical can vary greatly under differing conditions, and especially how the appearance changes with disease. [...] Urinary Deposits became a standard text on the subject; there were five editions between 1844 and 1857. [...] In the fourth edition Bird added a recommendation to wash out the bladder in cases of alkaline urine, after an experiment by Snow showed that stale urine became alkaline when fresh urine was slowly dripped into it. [...] Bird knew that alkaline urine encouraged phosphate precipitation and the consequent <b>encrustation</b> and stone formation. [...] The last edition of Urinary Deposits was updated after Bird's death by Edmund Lloyd Birkett.Coley, pp. 371–372Payne and McConnellRosenfeld, 1999, p. 50Vinten-Johansen, p. 109 ...|$|E

60|$|Jacob {{stooped to}} the God-forgive-me, {{which was a}} two-handled tall mug {{standing}} in the ashes, cracked and charred with heat: it was rather furred with extraneous matter about the outside, especially in the crevices of the handles, the innermost curves of which may not have seen daylight for several years by reason of this <b>encrustation</b> thereon--formed of ashes accidentally wetted with cider and baked hard; but to the mind of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that, being incontestably clean {{on the inside and}} about the rim.

60|$|Admitting what I have urged, it {{is clear}} that, {{from the moment of}} the Sun’s {{discarding}} a ring, there must be a continuous diminution both of his heat and light, on account of the continuous <b>encrustation</b> of his surface; and that a period would arrive—the period immediately previous to a new discharge—when a very material decrease of both light and heat, must become apparent. Now, we know that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable. On the Melville islands—to adduce merely one out of a hundred examples—we find traces of ultra-tropical vegetation—of plants that never could have flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our Sun to any portion of the surface of the Earth. Is such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent to the whirling-off of Venus? At this epoch must have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence; and, in fact, this influence must then have attained its maximum:—leaving out of view, of course, the period when the Earth itself was discarded—the period of its mere organization.|$|E
6000|$|The {{history of}} Christianity, with its <b>encrustation</b> and {{suffocation}} in dogmas and usages, its dire persecutions {{of the faithful}} by the unfaithful, its desiccation and its unlovely decay, its invasion by robes and rites and all the tricks and vices of the Pharisees whom Christ detested and denounced, is full of warning against the dangers of a church. Organisation is an excellent thing for the material needs of men, for the draining of towns, the marshalling of traffic, the collecting of eggs, and the carrying of letters, the distribution of bread, the notification of measles, for hygiene and economics and suchlike affairs. The better we organise such things, the freer and better equipped we leave men's minds for nobler purposes, for those adventures and experiments towards God's purpose which are the reality of life. But all organisations must be watched, for whatever is organised can be [...] "captured" [...] and misused. Repentance, moreover, is the beginning and essential of the religious life, and organisations (acting through their secretaries and officials) never repent. God deals only with the individual for the individual's surrender. He takes no cognisance of committees.|$|E
