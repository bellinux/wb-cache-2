40|$|Pain is an {{important}} indicator of poor welfare of livestock. Despite this, pain has largely gone unrecognized in farm animals due to attitudes of producers and veterinarians, although they {{play a key role}} in monitoring and managing the perception of animal pain. Producer attitudes toward animal welfare influence livestock management and production. The aim was to quantify dairy producer attitudes to the painfulness of various cattle diseases and <b>disbudding,</b> a painful routine procedure performed on farm to ensure safer handling of cattle. A questionnaire on disbudding-related opinions and practices was sent to 1, 000 Finnish dairy producers (response rate: 45 %). Attitudes toward <b>disbudding</b> were gauged using a 5 -point Likert scale and attitudes to cattle pain scored on an 11 -point numerical rating scale. Principal components analysis was used to assess the loadings, which were further tested for differences between producer gender and housing systems with Mann-Whitney U-tests, and between herd milk yield, herd size, and age and work experience of producers with a Kruskal-Wallis test. Four main factors were identified: factor I (“taking <b>disbudding</b> pain seriously”), factor II (“sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases”), factor III (“ready to medicate calves myself”), and factor IV (“pro horns”). Female producers took <b>disbudding</b> pain more seriously, were more sensitive to pain caused to cattle by diseases, and were more ready to medicate disbudded calves than male producers. Producers with tie-stalls favored horns over producers with freestalls. Male producers with tie-stalls were sensitive to cattle pain and preferred horns over male producers with freestalls. Female producers with freestalls were more ready to medicate calves, but did not prefer horns more than female producers with tie-stalls. Taking <b>disbudding</b> seriously correlated with sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases. Producers with low-milk-yielding herds were less willing to medicate calves and more willing to keep cattle with horns than producers with higher-yielding herds. Older producers were more sensitive to cattle pain than middle-aged and younger producers. No effect was established for taking <b>disbudding</b> pain seriously: the pro-horn factor was associated with work experience, age, and herd size. Women rated pain higher and were more positive toward pain medication for animals than men. Maintaining horns are more important for producers with tie-stalls than for those with freestalls...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} human–animal {{interactions}} {{is an important}} factor contributing to animal welfare and productivity. Reducing stress during routine husbandry procedures is likely to improve animal welfare. We examined how the type of early handling of calves affected responses to two common husbandry procedures, ear-tagging and <b>disbudding.</b> Forty Holstein–Friesian calves (n = 20 /treatment) were exposed to one of two handling treatments daily from 1 to 5 weeks of age: (1) positive (n = 20), involving gentle handling (soft voices, slow movements, patting), and (2) negative (n = 20), involving rough handling (rough voices, rapid movements, pushing). Heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and behaviour (activity, tail flicking) were measured before and after ear-tagging and <b>disbudding</b> (2 days apart). Cortisol was measured at − 20 (baseline), 20 and 40 min relative to <b>disbudding</b> time. There were no significant treatment differences in HR, RR or behaviour in response to either procedure. However, the following changes occurred across both treatment groups. HR increased after <b>disbudding</b> (by 14. 7 ± 4. 0 and 18. 6 ± 3. 8 bpm, positive and negative, respectively; mean ± s. e. m.) and ear-tagging (by 8. 7 ± 3. 1 and 10. 3 ± 3. 0 bpm, positive and negative, respectively). After <b>disbudding,</b> there was an increase in RR (by 8. 2 ± 3. 4 and 9. 3 ± 3. 4 breaths/min, positive and negative, respectively), overall activity (by 9. 4 ± 1. 2 and 9. 9 ± 1. 3 frequency/min, positive and negative, respectively) and tail flicking (by 13. 2 ± 2. 8 and 11. 2 ± 3. 0 frequency/min, positive and negative, respectively), and cortisol increased from baseline at 20 min post procedure (by 10. 3 ± 1. 1 and 12. 3 ± 1. 1 nmol/l positive and negative, respectively). Although we recorded significant changes in calf responses during ear-tagging and <b>disbudding,</b> the type of prior handling had no effect on responses.

30|$|Based on {{quantitative}} and application studies of phytohormones, {{indole acetic acid}} (IAA) has been believed {{to be one of}} important regulators for tracheid formation. It was reported that trees with higher growth rates had greater endogenous IAA amounts [7], and the application of exogenous IAA to <b>disbudded</b> segments increased the endogenous IAA amounts and the number of lignified tracheids in a dose-dependent manner [8]. The application of auxin to a young red pine (Pinus resinosa) producing latewood tracheids induced the formation of earlywood [9]. However, based on the other studies of tracheid differentiation, other internal factors besides the decrease in the IAA amounts may control the differentiation of tracheids. Tracheid production in response to the application of IAA decreased with cambial age in Pinus sylvestris [10]. The transition from earlywood to latewood occurred concurrently with the decrease in IAA amounts in cambial region tissues; however, it occurred at different IAA amounts for different stem positions and different trees in Pinus densiflora [11]. The IAA amounts did not change with latewood initiation in P. sylvestris [12].|$|R
40|$|Apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) shoots were decapitated {{before or}} after {{chilling}} and then forced to budburst to {{determine the influence of}} distal inhibition (paradormancy) on the chilling response of lateral buds.

Endogenous cytokinins were determined from distal and proximal segments of shoots segmented before and after chilling and/or forcing. The isolation of lateral buds from distal inhibition by decapitation before chilling resulted in a dramatic increase in growth rate. This increase is greater than that observed in terminal buds during the normal development of acrotony on intact shoots. Distal shoot tissues appear to inhibit the chilling response of lateral buds. On intact shoots cytokinin increased more in the distal shoot tissues, but in decapitated shoots cytokinin increased more in the proximal shoot tissues.

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{for this}} thesis {{was to examine}} mechanical, including pressure algometry (PA) and von Frey filaments (VF), and thermal sensitivity (TS) nociceptive tests as objective non-invasive measures of pain in swine and cattle. The second objective {{of this study was}} to examine novel pain mitigation agents to alleviate pain in swine and cattle. The first research study assessed the validity of mechanical and thermal nociceptive tests by analyzing differences in nociceptive threshold in cull sows when sound, for baseline values, and when induced-lame in one hind leg. This lameness study also assessed sodium salicylate and flunixin meglumine (Banamine ®) as analgesic treatments for pain associated with lameness. Results from this study indicate that PA is a valid non-invasive method to objectively quantify the mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) prior to lameness induction, as well as when sows were induced-lame in one hind leg. This test was valid because no differences were detected between the sound and designated lame hind leg prior to induction, and reduced MNTs were observed on the induced lame limb post induction. No improvement was detected with either analgesic treatment as assessed with PA. Due to the high variability in TS latencies from sound to lame leg at all trial days, TS was not a valid pain assessment tool in this sow lameness pain model. Objectives for the calf <b>disbudding</b> research were to evaluate VF and TS for assessing <b>disbudding</b> pain in calves relative to PA, which has been previously validated as an objective pain test in a cautery <b>disbudding</b> pain model. Pressure algometry was also utilized to objectively determine the effectiveness of ethanol or a depot formation of lidocaine for extended analgesia during <b>disbudding</b> relative to a control lidocaine cornual nerve block. In this experimental design, neither VF nor TS pain tests were practical pain assessment tools. Results from PA indicated that the ethanol anesthetized calves displayed elevated MNTs relative to the control calves, and depot-treated calves tolerated reduced MNTs relative to the control from + 1 hour post-disbudding through + 83 hours post-disbudding, which indicates that ethanol provided extended anesthetic relief, and that this depot formation of lidocaine is not a suitable anesthetic treatment for cautery <b>disbudding</b> calves. In conclusion, this research has validated the use of PA as an objective pain assessment tool for both a transient-induced sow lameness and a cautery <b>disbudding</b> pain model. Results from these studies provide promising evidence as to the range of research capabilities offered by PA. In both experimental models, TS was not an appropriate measure of nociception.

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out to {{describe}} the extent and current practice of cattle disbudding/dehorning in the EU Member States. <b>Disbudding</b> was defined as removal of horns in calves of up to 2 months of age, whereas dehorning was defined as removal of horns in older animals. Specific questionnaires were created regarding dairy, beef, and suckler production systems and they were submitted to local experts of each country belonging to relevant institutions like universities, national farmers' associations, cattle breeders associations, farm veterinarians and practitioners. Figures on disbudding/dehorning practices were produced for each production system for both the whole European Union and the North, Centre, East and South EU macro-regions. A total of 652 questionnaires were collected and 64 %, 24 % and 12 % of them related to dairy cattle, beef cattle and suckler cows, respectively. Data from the survey showed that in Europe, 81 % of the dairy, 47 % of the beef and 68 % of the suckler currently keep disbudded/dehorned animals, while the prevalence of polled cattle is rather low, especially in the dairy cattle sector (5 % of all cattle farms; < 1 % of dairy farms). Regardless of production system, prevalence of dehorned animals is {{the highest in the}} North macro-region.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the acute distress involved in the procedures of tail docking and <b>disbudding</b> of Friesian dairy calves. Different methods of tail docking (rubber ring and docking iron) and <b>disbudding</b> (scoop and cautery), with or without the use of a local anaesthetic, have been assessed using changes in plasma cortisol concentration and some behavioural observation as indices of distress. The practical objectives were to provide advice on choice of method and on the benefits or otherwise of using local anaesthetic to alleviate the pain associated with these procedures. The innervation at the docking site of the bovine tail and the efficiency of two methods of local anaesthetic administration (epidural and ring block) in desensitising the tail were assessed. Epidural local anaesthetic was found to totally desensitise the entire tail whereas a ring block adminstration of local anaesthetic around the docking site only effectively desensitised an area immediately adjacent to the site of ring block administration. Hence, to ensure total loss of sensation in the tail, an epidural administration of the local anaesthetic was used in the tail docking experiments. Tail docking, with or without a local anaesthetic, most three to four month old Friesian dairy calves was found to be no more distressing than control handling and blood sampling using both plasma Cortisol concentration and behavioural indices of distress. However, there was a degree of between-animal variation in response - a small proportion of calves which received some treatments that were not expected to cause distress showed signs of mild distress. The reasons for these responses are unknown. <b>Disbudding</b> six to eight week old Friesian dairy calves with a scoop caused a marked distress response which lasted for about five and a half hours, whereas the alternative method, the cauterising iron, was only slightly more distressing than control handling and blood sampling during the first one hour after <b>disbudding.</b> Although administration of a local anaesthetic before scoop <b>disbudding</b> produced a marked reduction in plasma cortisol concentration during the first two hours after treatment there was little or no reduction in overall distress, as judged by plasma cortisol responses. However, prior administration of a local anaesthetic to calves disbudded by cautery effected a slight reduction in the distress response, decreasing it to near control levels. The practical advice on method for these husbandry practices would be for tail docking, continued use of the rubber ring if tail docking is deemed necessary at all, and for <b>disbudding,</b> cautery alone or with local anaesthetic, if practically viable, would be recommended...|$|E

All means applied to reduce sink/source ratio resulted in a significantly higher individual flower dry mass and area in plants with a fixed number of flowers. Nevertheless, control plants responded to supplementary assimilation light with an increased number of flowers rather than producing larger flowers. Flower position had a negligible effect on flower size in both <b>disbudded</b> and control plants, except that the second-order lateral flowers were significantly smaller than the first-order ones.

HORNED IARKS Otocoris alpestris, subspecies: Depredations. In certain parts of California the horned lark is a serious crop destroyer. The damage occurs mostly in the interior valleys from Sacramento south to the Imperial Valley and along the coastal strip from San Francisco south to San Diego. Horned larks are given great opportunity for damage by the widespread abundance of cultivated products attractive to them. Among the crops severely damaged are plantlets of lettuce, carrots, beets, spinach, turnips, peas, beans, sugar beets, alfalfa, cantaloupes, watermelons, tomatoes and lettuce. Flower plantlets of any variety in commercial seed plantings are frequently devoured. Damage by horned larks usually begins after the first plants break through {{the surface of the}} soil and it may continue until the plants reach a height of several inches. CROWNED SEHRROWS Zonotrichia species and subspecies: Depredations. Direct opposites as to preference of habitat to the horned larks, crowned sparrows are birds of deep brush, river bottom jungles, dense weed fields, fence rows, brush piles or rubbish heaps. The dense hedges and thick plantings of shrubbery commonly found about many rural and suburban homes are much to their liking. Crop depredations in California by crowned sparrows can be laid to three subspecies—Gambel 2 ̆ 7 s, Nuttall 2 ̆ 7 s and Golden Crown. Due to its very wide range in the State and to the immense numbers which concentrate here, Gambel 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow must be considered by far the most important. WOODPECKERS: Depredations. In addition to the pecking of holes in buildings and poles, the California woodpecker frequently becomes a serious pest about almond or walnut orchards. The Lewis woodpecker has occasionally caused some damage to apples in certain areas of California...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} IAA upon cambial activity, xylem {{differentiation}} and translocation of assimilates from the lateral shoot {{was investigated in}} spring and late summer in decapitated and ring-barked young trees of Pinus silvestris in the forest stand. Decapitation interrupted cambial xylem production in the uppermost part of the main stem of decapitated trees in spring and late summer, regardless of whether lateral branches below were growing, dormant or <b>disbudded,</b> and the contact through phloem with the roots was maintained or severed. Auxin supplied to the decapitated stems caused an increasing stimulation of cambial xylem production in spring. It also stimulated cambial activity in August but was ineffective in September. Apical control of cambial xylem production was strongly dependent upon the continuity of phloem and/or cambial tissues of the decapitated main-stem-section with lower parts of the plant. Decapitation of the stem strongly reduced the daily rate of cell wall deposition in the cambial xylem derivatives which {{on the day the}} experiment started constituted the zones of radial enlargement and maturation. This reduction limited progressively secondary wall deposition in consecutive maturing tracheids even though the cells differentiated longer. Irrespective of the season, auxin prevented the effect of decapitation in cells which were already differentiating when the experiment started as well as extension of the maturation phase. The effect of auxin was somewhat reduced when the lateral branches were additionally decapitated in early summer. In early summer auxin caused a significant increase of the daily rate of cell wall deposition in cells of the cambial zone or the newly produced ones, thus resulting in formation of progressively thicker secondary walls. Late in summer assimilates were transported mostly to {{the lower part of the}} stem. Decapitation changed the intact tree pattern of assimilate distribution, increasing the transport in spring and reducing it later in the summer. Prevention of the contact with roots via phloem and cambium in spring (by ring-barking the stem at tree base) decreased decapitation-induced downward transport of assimilates. Application of auxin to the decapitated uppermost segment of the main stem resulted in a significant increase of assimilate translocation into the stem. At least two mechanisms of auxin involvement in regulation of the rate of secondary wall deposition in pine stem tracheids can be considered: (a) induction (or activation) of the cell wall metabolic potential which seems to occur during meristematic or early radial enlargement phases of tracheid differentiation, and (b) regulation of substrate availability during the phase of tracheid maturation...|$|R
