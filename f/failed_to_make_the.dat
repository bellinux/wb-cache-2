40|$|The so‐called ‘re‐identification condition’ (K elly 2011) {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the most prominent argument for nonconceptualism, the argument from fineness of grain. A number of authors have recently argued that the condition should be modified or discarded altogether, with devastating implications for the nonconceptualist (see, e. g., B rewer 2005, C huard 2006). The aim of this paper is to show that the situation is even more dire for nonconceptualists, for even if the re‐identification condition remains in its original form, the argument from fineness of grain still <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> case for nonconceptualism. The paper's central case rests on two claims: according to the first, if the re‐identification condition holds, then some beliefs will represent some properties nonconceptually; and according to the second, if some beliefs represent some properties nonconceptually, the argument from fineness of grain <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> case for nonconceptualism in any relevant sense. It follows that if the re‐identification condition holds, the argument from fineness of grain <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> case for nonconceptualism...|$|R
