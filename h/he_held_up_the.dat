25|$|Gyulay {{fought on}} the upper Rhine in 1794 and 1795. On 8 April 1795, he became Oberst (colonel) of the Benjowsky Infantry Regiment # 31. However, he {{continued}} to lead the Gyulay Freikorps. In 1796, he served under Michael von Fröhlich in Maximilian Baillet de Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine. He fought at Renchen on 28 June and helped cover the subsequent retreat of the Imperial troops. Archduke Charles ordered him to command a force linking the Army of the Upper Rhine and Fröhlich's corps. After the Battle of Ettlingen, Gyulay led Fröhlich's rearguard, earning praise from his superior as a skillful commander of outposts. Later that fall, he greatly distinguished himself in action at Memmingen. For eight hours on 22 September, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> advance 6,000 French with only 1,200 soldiers. On 16 May 1797 he was elevated in rank to General-Major.|$|E
25|$|Several {{years as}} party leader earned Salmond {{an unusually high}} profile for an SNP {{politician}} in the London-based media. In 1998, Salmond won the Spectator Award for Political Strategist of the Year. Following an appearance on the entertainment programme Call My Bluff, Salmond used one of the 'bluff' cards that are used as props in the show {{in the run-up to}} the first elections to the Scottish Parliament. To counter his frustration at having to sit in silence through what he claimed was an inappropriately political speech by Tony Blair at a charity lunch, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bluff card as the Prime Minister began querying Scotland's economic prospects should independence occur. Throughout his time in politics, Salmond has maintained his interest in horse racing, writing a weekly column for The Scotsman and appearing a number of times on Channel 4's The Morning Line. During the election campaign, Salmond was photographed feeding a young supporter a Solero ice cream during an event at Stirling University, creating a photograph that would become iconic.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the former}} bushwhackers {{returned}} to peaceful lives. Many left Missouri for friendlier places, particularly Kentucky, where they had relatives. Most of their former leaders, including Quantrill and William [...] "Bloody Bill" [...] Anderson, had been killed during the war. But a small core of Anderson's men, led by the ruthless Archie Clement, remained together. State authorities believed that Clement planned and led the first daylight peacetime armed bank robbery in U.S. history when <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Clay County Savings Association on February 13, 1866. The bank was run by the leading Radicals of Clay County, who had just held a public meeting for their party. The governor posted a reward for Clement, {{but he and his}} band of outlaws conducted further robberies that year. On election day of 1866, Clement led his men to polling places in Lexington, Missouri, where they intimidated Radical voters and secured the election of a conservative slate of candidates. A state militia unit entered the town shortly thereafter and killed Clement when he resisted arrest.|$|E

2500|$|Longstreet also {{received}} Bragg's order {{but did not}} act immediately. Surprised by Stewart's advance, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> order {{for the remainder of}} his wing. Longstreet had spent the morning attempting to arrange his lines so that his divisions from the Army of Northern Virginia would be in the front line, but these movements had resulted in the battle line confusion that had plagued Cleburne earlier. When Longstreet was finally ready, he had amassed a concentrated striking force, commanded by Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood, of three divisions, with eight brigades arranged in five lines. In the lead, Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson's division straddled the Brotherton Road in two echelons. They were followed by Hood's Division, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law, and two brigades of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw. To the left of this column was Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman's division. Brig. Gen. William Preston's division of Buckner's corps was in reserve behind Hindman. Longstreet's force of 10,000 men, primarily infantry, was similar in number to those he sent forward in Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, and some historians judge that he learned the lessons of that failed assault by providing a massive, narrow column to break the enemy line. Historian Harold Knudsen has described this deployment on a narrow front as similar to the style of the German Schwerpunkt in World War II, achieving an attacker/defender ratio of 8:1. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert also cites the innovative approach that Longstreet adopted, [...] "demonstrating his skill as a battlefield commander." [...] William Glenn Robertson, however, contends that Longstreet's deployment was [...] "happenstance", and that the general's after-action report and memoirs do not demonstrate that he had a grand, three-division column in mind.|$|E

5000|$|López {{has said}} that Venezuela must commit itself to {{strengthening}} production and bringing down inflation, which, he said, would reduce corruption and enable Venezuelans to save money. <b>He</b> has <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> examples of Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and Colombia as countries “that had hyperinflation and achieved price stability.” He criticized price controls, saying that Venezuela, while having “a number of controls,” also had “the continent's highest inflation.” ...|$|R
60|$|De Batz, more peremptorily this time, {{asked for}} citizen Heron, {{with whom he}} had {{immediate}} and important business, and a glimmer of a piece of silver which <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> close to <b>the</b> judas secured him the necessary admittance.|$|R

50|$|Bethell was rector of Kirby Wiske, Yorkshire, from 1808 to 1830; Dean of Chichester from 5 April 1814 and a prebendary of Exeter from 22 June 1830.
