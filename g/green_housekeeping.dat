40|$|Solving {{the waste}} problem {{is one of}} the most {{challenging}} environmental missions for Hong Kong. Currently, the amount of waste generated has reached an unsustainable level. Hong Kong’s domestic waste disposal rate is significantly higher than other international cities like Tokyo, Taipei City and Seoul. With present trends, this mounting waste has been filled up the three landfill sites at a rate much faster than anticipated. Hong Kong SAR Government is hoping to expand the landfill site and build incinerator(s). However, these plans have not been well-received by the public. Waste reduction at source would be a significant alternative for Hong Kong instead. Environmental education (EE) is a vital component of achieving sustainable waste management. This is the best strategy to help reduce waste at source. Among all the targeted trainees, it is found that little local and international research has been done on the potential role of Foreign Domestic Helpers (FDHs) in waste management. FDHs make up a significant proportion of the Hong Kong population. They are one of the best candidates to learn and implement sustainable waste management in the households. Thus, this study looks into the current EE to FDHs and analyses how to send green message among FDHs in an effective way. A framework of indicators for an effective waste reduction education program to FDHs is constructed as to help evaluate the performance of EE providers for FDHs. Information regarding current EE to FDHs is obtained from reviewing publicly available information and by conducting in-depth interviews with related personnel and stakeholders. To reconfirm the need and importance of providing EE to FDHs, a questionnaire survey to FDHs is developed and a pilot EE program to FDHs is designed and implemented. This study found that the current EE to FDHs is inadequate and ineffective. The knowledge of FDHs in waste reduction is not comprehensive and few of them have had <b>green</b> <b>housekeeping</b> habits. Through providing appropriate training incorporating the indicators identified, FDHs are enabled to proceed from having the right awareness to taking action in the households. The success of the pilot EE program to FDHs also gave us an insight into the importance of adequate and quality EE to the community. It is hoped that the suggestions being put forward in this study can guide Hong Kong in achieving the target of zero waste. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
40|$|A bed {{and breakfast}} (B&B) is a house or small hotel where someone can rent a room for a price that {{includes}} breakfast the next morning (Bed and Breakfast, 2012). According to Tsai (2008), green hotels are lodging facilities that use "operation techniques that have a low impact on the environment, while maintaining their business environment, to provide clients with green products (meals), <b>green</b> services (<b>housekeeping),</b> and living environments that are natural, healthy, clean, and comfortable" (p. 286). In order {{to better understand the}} adoption of green practices within the NC B&B industry, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate, not only how important green initiatives are to owner/operators, but also how frequently they are performed. The research design that this study employed was a cross-sectional design, and an importance-performance analysis (IPA) was used to analyze the data. From the data gathered for this study, a list of most frequently used green practices of North Carolina B&Bs was generated. The results of the study showed that NC B&Bs are implementing green practices well in all categories, except for marketing...|$|R
