40|$|Bowlby (1969, 1973, 1980) who {{proposed}} {{the concept of}} "internal working models" of self and other in attachment relationships, considered that psychopathology such as depression and pathological <b>grief</b> <b>stem</b> from early insecure attachment relationships. He suggested that defensive exclusion of internal working models cause serious emotional disorders. Recent development of AAI (Main & Goldwyn, 1984), which enabled to measure adult attachment representations, has facilitated studying the intergenerational transmission of caregiver-child relationsips and the relation between attachment and various psychopathology. This paper reviewed studies about attachment of children under unfavorable environment, relation of early attachment to children's aggressive behavior, and relation between adult psychopathology and traumatic experiences in early attachment relationships. Finally, some considerations {{were given to the}} prevention of intergenerational transmission of traumatic attachment relationships...|$|E
50|$|Rasmussen's {{model of}} grief {{operates}} {{on the assumption}} of psychological resilience, echoing the theories introduced by George Bonanno, a professor of clinical psychology at the Teachers College of Columbia University. Her theories conflict with popularized concepts of <b>grief</b> <b>stemming</b> from the 1917 and 1969 publications of Mourning and Melancholia and On Death and Dying by Sigmund Freud and Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, respectively. The defining characteristic of the model proposed by Second Firsts is the view of loss {{as a catalyst for}} change and self-growth.|$|R
40|$|Using {{prospective}} {{longitudinal data}} on an older sample beginning {{prior to the}} death of a spouse, G. A. Bonanno et al. (2002) distinguished 5 unique trajectories of bereavement outcome: common grief, chronic grief, chronic depression, depression followed by improvement, and resilience. These trajectories having been identified, the aims of the current study were to examine differences in how respondents in each group reacted to and processed the loss. Specific hypotheses were tested regarding differences in coping, meaning making, context, and representations of the lost relationship. Results suggest that chronic <b>grief</b> <b>stems</b> from the upheaval surrounding the loss of a healthy spouse, whereas chronic depression results from more enduring emotional difficulties that are exacerbated by the loss. Both the resilient and the depressed–improved groups showed remarkably healthy profiles and relatively little evidence of either struggling with or denying/avoiding the loss. The death of a spouse can be a painful and sometimes debili-tating experience. However, bereaved individuals differ markedly in how much and how long they grieve (Bonanno & Kaltman, 1999, 2001; Wortman & Silver, 1989, 2001). Comparisons across bereavement studies have revealed three basic patterns of out-come: common or time-limited disruptions in functioning (e. g., elevated depression, cognitive disorganization, health problems) lasting from several months to 1 to 2 years, chronic disruptions in functioning lasting several years or longer, and the relative absence of depression and other disruptions in functioning (for a review, see Bonanno & Kaltman, 2001). These patterns suggest potentially important implications for understanding the experiences of older bereaved adults. However, there remain a number of central but as yet unresolved questions. For example, because older bereaved adults generally experience less intense and less enduring grief symptoms (Lichtenstein, Gatz...|$|R
40|$|There {{is more to}} grief {{than what}} one might first imagine. It is complex, multi-faceted, {{and can be found}} among people of all nationalities and cultures. No one is immune from <b>grief.</b> <b>Grief</b> <b>stems</b> from {{irrevocable}} loss. The good news is the inevitable journey of grief produces blessings that would have otherwise gone unrealized. Grief creates opportunities for spiritual growth. This paper addresses these issues and deals with the role that the Christian counselor fulfills in assisting people who are grieving. Grief’s Origin The origin of grief {{can be traced back to}} the beginning of the human race. The Book of Genesis records humanity’s first encounter with it (Genesis 3 : 1 - 4 : 13). It took place in the Garden of Eden when Eve ate of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and gave the fruit to Adam to eat. The first loss was a loss of innocence, followed by loss of position, loss of relationship, loss of comfort, and a loss of a style of living. Shortly thereafter, Cain killed his brother Abel and humanity experienced its first loss of human life. These losses produced feelings of grief. Adam and Eve experienced grief and so did Cain. Grief Defined The word grief comes from the Greek word lupe, which means sorrow, heaviness or burden (Strong's Numbers and Concordance, 1994). Grief comes in various forms and impacts people on many different levels. Although grief is usually associated with the loss of a loved one, any type of loss can generate grief. Essentially, grief involves a loss of that which can never be reclaimed to the state that it once was. Grief may come suddenly without warning or it may be long anticipated...|$|R
40|$|As a {{means of}} redirecting my own {{personal}} <b>grief</b> that <b>stemmed</b> from Hillary Rodham Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s loss to Donald J. Trump {{in the most recent}} presidential election, I penned the following prose during {{the early morning hours of}} November 9, 2016 as Trump gave his victory speech. Like many Americans who voted in the 2016 Presidential Election, I support the right to vote for one 2 ̆ 7 s choice of presidential candidate; however, I am not alone in my concerns about the current presidential administration. Not only are Trump 2 ̆ 7 s attempts to silence the media and the right to freedom of speech cause for alarm, but his ideas on healthcare, human rights and international political relationships arguably contribute to apprehension and unease for any number of people. No presidency is without its issues, but the verse penned here may speak to others as the Trump presidency continues to unfold...|$|R
40|$|This study employs {{narrative}} inquiry {{to document}} participants’ experiences {{in relation to}} maintaining sobriety while living through the Christchurch earthquakes. Eight women and one man were recruited via purposive sampling. Of the 9 participants, 4 were in stable recovery (greater than 5 years), 2 were in sustained recovery (between 1 and 5 years) and 3 were in early recovery (less than 1 year). Qualitative data was gathered using semi-structured, in-depth interviews utilising thematic analysis and incorporating an abductive logic. In {{the process of recovery}} from alcohol dependence previous life trauma, environmental conditions, uncertainty about the future and limited resources can be both barriers to recovery from alcoholism and growth opportunities after natural disaster. For some of the participants who contributed to this research, memories of early childhood abuse were recalled and symbolised by the seismic activity during the greater earthquake period. Participants in early recovery or relapsing continued to experience traumatic stress through re-victimisation or trauma re-enactment. Some participants in active addiction identified the earthquakes as both a hindrance and a help with their drinking and self-harming behaviour. For others, a sense of deep personal loss was felt when viewing the devastation of the ruined city which mirrored and reminded them of their life in active addiction. The research findings extend and complement existing theories of ambiguous loss and Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) within the context of addiction and recovery capital. This research also adds to the addiction, domestic violence and disaster literature that is currently available. Narratives of participants in short or long term recovery, suggested that ambiguous loss, and associated <b>grief</b> <b>stemming</b> from both situational and cumulative trauma, surfaced when viewing the earthquake damage. Living through the earthquakes was a time of adaptation and resourcefulness for all but for alcoholics in recovery extra resilience was needed to attend to addiction recovery within the larger picture of daily disaster coping. For all participants post traumatic growth was both an outcome and a process creating a more robust identity at individual levels, post disaster. Findings indicate that trauma can be instrumental in creating alcohol abuse and dependency and that recovery from alcoholism after natural disaster is a complex process requiring personal, community and political interventions...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, landslides, killer {{storms and}} a recent tsunami {{illustrate}} the awesome power of Mother Nature. We pollute, destroy, reshape our planet and eliminate animal habitats and ecosystems in order to fit our needs and make room for more people. This research focused specifically on one ecosystem that is declining due to human interactions- the southern resident killer whale population in Puget Sound. There are three main causes for {{the decline of the}}se whales: loss of food resources, toxic pollution, and boat traffic. The researcher theorized that people who were conscious of the plight of these whales would react to their decline by experiencing environmental grief®, the <b>grief</b> reaction <b>stemming</b> from the environmental loss of ecosystems caused by natural or man-made events. This is a unique form of disenfranchised grief, which is grief that is not openly accepted or acknowledged in society. The research question asked, How do members of the American Cetacean Society react to the decline of the southern resident killer whale population, and are their reactions consistent with environmental grief? An historical perspective and literature review were developed to include the Gaia Theory and the subjects of deep ecology and the ecology of grief, to establish a foundation for environmental grief. The heuristic method of research was used, probing into the lived experiences of eight people. Co-researchers were interviewed and asked to share their reactions and experiences related to the decline of the southern resident killer whale population. Themes emerging from these interviews included anger, frustration, depression, sadness, hopelessness, and helplessness- all consistent with reactions of environmental grief. For many, naming their reactions validated the feelings they had experienced for some time. As social scientists, it would behove us to support people who are reacting to environmental grief whether we are working with lay people or professionals...|$|R
