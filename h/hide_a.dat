5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a ship is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E

5|$|The crew of a French {{salvage ship}} {{trying to raise}} a World War II-era {{submarine}} from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for one, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine {{had been involved in}} discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.|$|E

5|$|The {{final two}} co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, {{occurred}} in Kuwait and Spain. The Kuwaiti show, Iftah Ya Simsim, which ran until 1990, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Arab world. It used Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, including the use of MSA. Barrio Sésamo, made in Spain, featured a snail character who was able to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. Valentin Fuster, a native Spaniard who worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.|$|E

5|$|Jack {{receives}} {{a call from}} Hughes to say that Bradley {{is about to be}} arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E

Recognizing this as a classic setup for a hit, D'Arco fled for his life and turned himself over to the {{authorities}} to spare {{him and his family}} from Amuso and Casso and their increasingly erratic demands.

25|$|A {{daughter}} (July 1717). The Duchess {{had retired}} at the Château de la Muette {{to hide the}} term of her pregnancy. The putative father Sicaire Antonin Armand Auguste Nicolas d'Aydie, Chevalier de Rion, became Berry's lover sometime in 1716 or 1717. In his additions to the diary of Dangeau on 21 July 1719, Saint-Simon mentions that the Duchess had managed to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> first pregnancy by Rion, bringing forth a girl. She was not so fortunate the second time when she almost died in labour at the Luxembourg and provoked a public scandal, as underscored by Saint-Simon who then writes a short description of Berry's 1719 childbirth which has become the most-well known episode of her scandalous biography. According to Duclos, this child subsequently became a nun at the Abbey of Pontoise.|$|E

25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} {{him as if he}} is still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E
25|$|A second {{assassination}} {{attempt was made}} on 12 May 1982, just a day before {{the anniversary of the}} first attempt on his life, in Fátima, Portugal when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a bayonet. He was stopped by security guards. Stanisław Dziwisz later said that John Paul II had been injured during the attempt but managed to <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> non-life-threatening wound. The assailant, a traditionalist Catholic Spanish priest named Juan María Fernández y Krohn, had been ordained as a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of the Society of Saint Pius X and was opposed to the changes made by the Second Vatican Council, claiming that the pope was an agent of Communist Moscow and of the Marxist Eastern Bloc. Fernández y Krohn subsequently left the priesthood and served three years of a six-year sentence. The ex-priest was treated for mental illness and then expelled from Portugal to become a solicitor in Belgium.|$|E

After Gatto is dead, Tom sends Aldo to accompany Rocco Lampone (Michael Dobson) to Hollywood to intimidate a studio executive named Jack Woltz (Doug Abrahams) into giving Vito's godson, Johnny Fontane, the starring role in a new film. Rocco and Aldo decapitate Woltz' prized stallion, and place the head in his bed as he sleeps, terrifying him into casting Fontane. Back in New York, the Corleones purchase an apartment in Midtown for Aldo and Frankie. Sollozzo and McClusky arrange a meeting with Michael {{to try to come}} to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution. However, Michael plans to assassinate them. Clemenza has Aldo <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> gun in the toilet of the restaurant where the meeting is taking place, and Michael kills them both. Aldo then drives him to the docks, where he leaves for Sicily. Meanwhile, Vito is released from hospital and promotes Aldo to Soldier, officially making him a made man of the Corleone family.|$|E
