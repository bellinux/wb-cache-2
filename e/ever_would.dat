500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams wondered if it <b>ever</b> <b>would</b> be so clear who these people were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E
500|$|Baroque {{eventually}} {{went out}} of fashion. In some parts of Europe, it metamorphosed into the rococo, but not in Sicily. No longer ruled by Austria, Sicily, from 1735 officially the Kingdom of Sicily, was ruled by the King of Naples, Ferdinand IV. Hence Palermo was in constant association with the principal capital Naples, where there was architecturally a growing reversion to the more classical styles of architecture. Coupled with this, {{many of the more}} cultured Sicilian nobility developed a fashionable obsession with all things French, from philosophy to arts, fashion, and architecture. Many of them visited Paris in pursuit of these interests and returned with the latest architectural engravings and theoretical treatises. The French architect Léon Dufourny was in Sicily between 1787 and 1794 to study and analyse the ancient Greek temples on the island. Thus Sicilians rediscovered their ancient past, which with its classical idioms was now the height of fashion. The change in tastes did not come about overnight. Baroque remained popular on the island, but now Sicilian balconies, extravagant as <b>ever,</b> <b>would</b> be placed next to severe classical columns. Dufourny began designing in Palermo, and his [...] "Entrance Temple" [...] (1789) to the Botanical Gardens was the first building in Sicily in a style based on the Greek Doric order. It is pure neoclassical architecture, as established in England since 1760, and it was a sign of things to come.|$|E

2500|$|The next day, {{before the}} airing of the show, Duckett shot herself, a death that {{relatives}} claim {{was influenced by}} media scrutiny, particularly from Grace.

[...] For Veloso and other musicians contemplating a career abroad, Miranda's pioneering experiences continue to loom as a point of reference. Miranda helped establish and transform the relationship between Brazilian musicians and American producers that now has created several remarkable transnational collaborations... To think of her is to think about the complexity of this relationship".|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1960s, those singers {{who wrote}} songs outside the Soviet {{establishment}} {{have been known}} as [...] "bards". The first songs traditionally referred to as bard songs {{are thought to be}} written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the very existence of the genre is traditionally originated from the amateur activities of the Soviet intelligentsia, namely mass backpacking movement and the students' song movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Many bards performed their songs in small groups of people using a Russian guitar, rarely if <b>ever</b> <b>would</b> they be accompanied by other musicians or singers.

2500|$|Sumner {{was well}} {{regarded}} in the United Kingdom, {{but after the}} war he sacrificed his reputation in the U.K. by his stand on U.S. claims for British breaches of neutrality. The U.S. had claims against Britain for the damage inflicted by Confederate raiding ships fitted out in British ports. Sumner held that since Britain had accorded the rights of belligerents to the Confederacy, it was responsible for extending {{the duration of the}} war and consequent losses. In 1869, he asserted that Britain should pay damages for not merely the raiders, but also [...] "that other damage, immense and infinite, caused by the prolongation of the war.” [...] He demanded $2,000,000,000 for these [...] "national claims" [...] in addition to $125,000,000 for damages from the raiders. [...] Sumner did not expect that Britain <b>ever</b> <b>would</b> or could pay this immense sum, but he suggested that Britain turn over Canada as payment. This proposition offended many Britons, though it was taken seriously by many Americans, including the Secretary of State, whose support for them nearly derailed the settlement with Great Britain in the months before the arbitration conference met at Geneva. [...] At the Geneva arbitration conference which settled U.S. claims against Britain, the panel of arbitrators refused to consider those [...] "constructive" [...] or [...] "national claims." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Xianfeng Emperor's heir, {{the son of}} Noble Consort Yi (Empress Dowager Cixi), {{was only}} five years old.
