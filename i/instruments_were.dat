The specifications for these <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E

5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By {{the time of the}} closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E
5|$|During the war the LPO {{played in}} the capital and on continual tours of Britain, under Sargent and other conductors, {{bringing}} orchestral concerts to places where they had rarely if ever been given. Many of the players' <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> lost when the Queen's Hall was destroyed by German bombing in May 1941; an appeal was broadcast by the BBC, the response to which was enormous, with instruments donated by the public enabling the orchestra to continue.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{accommodates}} five science instruments {{at a given}} time, {{plus the}} Fine Guidance Sensors, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for science (astrometry). Early <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions.

5|$|On October 3, 2001, NASA chose Lockheed Martin as {{the primary}} {{contractor}} for the spacecraft's fabrication. By the end of 2001 all of the mission's <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> selected.

5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|The most {{practical}} application of 244Cm — though rather limited in total volume — is as α-particle {{source in the}} alpha particle X-ray spectrometers (APXS). These <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> installed on the Sojourner, Mars, Mars 96, Mars Exploration Rovers and Philae comet lander, {{as well as the}} Mars Science Laboratory to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of planet Mars. APXS was also used in the Surveyor 5–7 moon probes but with a 242Cm source.|$|E

5|$|A Sanskrit scholar Vijnaneshwara {{became famous}} {{in the field of}} legal {{literature}} for his Mitakshara, in the court of Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the most acknowledged work in that field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on Yajnavalkya) based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of modern India. An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system. Some important literary works of the time related to music and musical <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> Sangita Chudamani, Sangita Samayasara and Sangita Ratnakara.|$|E
5000|$|The {{essential}} point <b>is</b> this: synthetic <b>instruments</b> <b>are</b> synthesized. The {{whole is}} greater than the sum of the parts.

40|$|Calibration and {{validation}} of satellite <b>instruments</b> <b>is</b> vital to long-term trend estimates of ozone and other trace species.

5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} to NASA in 1996, {{but at the}} time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded as part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> built and integrated by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the spacecraft took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the spacecraft and completing its mission reached US$330million.|$|E
5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{influences}} of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in Europe during the Middles Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical instrument {{that may have been}} invented in Europe until this period. Stringed <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> prominent in Middle Age Europe. The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, stringed instruments with necks, while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar. Various harps served Central and Northern Europe as far north as Ireland, where the harp eventually became a national symbol. Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as Estonia.|$|E
5|$|During the Classical and Romantic {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical {{instruments}} capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since <b>instruments</b> <b>were</b> involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E
