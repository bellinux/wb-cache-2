5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made {{because of what they}} stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; and the lack of restrictions against campaigning {{on the day of the}} referendum. The union support for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the final verdict in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over <b>EU</b> <b>support</b> for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E

40|$|The {{territorial}} {{social and}} economic inequality {{is one of the}} most fundamental characteristics of space economics. There are not two points in the space which have the same characteristics, because their economic, social and cultural parameters are different. The existence of territorial inequalities is a significant problem also in the case of Hungary with special regards on the settlements of the Northern Hungarian region. The aim of my research is to examine the spatial patterns of the <b>EU</b> <b>supports</b> and the income per employee in the case of the Northern Hungarian region’s settlements and to analyze what kind of effect the supports have on the dispersion of the settlements’ income. According to the results, I can state that there are more hot spots in the region based on the <b>EU</b> <b>supports,</b> than by the income per capita, so the pattern is more heterogeneous. Consequently, there is observable a greater gap among the settlements based on the supports by the inequality measures.

Evaluation of <b>EU</b> structural <b>support</b> has to be not only country-wide, but also region-wide. Also, it is important to evaluate the use of <b>EU</b> structural <b>support</b> in the lowest level – Lithuanian municipalities that directly influence economic and social gap reduction between regions by dealing with Regional Development Planning documents. Purpose of paper is to analyse the absorption of <b>EU</b> structural <b>support</b> at Lithuanian municipalities level, to analyse the positive and negative impact, and further development of effective use of structural support at municipality level.
