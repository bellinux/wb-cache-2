60|$|Scooping {{his hand}} into the same {{scientific}} <b>elbow-rest</b> as before, and backing {{it up with the}} inert strength of his arm, as skilfully as a Police Expert, and with an apparent repose quite unattainable by novices, Mr. Crisparkle conducts his pupil to the pleasant and orderly old room prepared for him. Arrived there, the young man throws himself into a chair, and, flinging his arms upon his reading-table, rests his head upon them with an air of wretched self-reproach.|$|E
60|$|In 1516, {{another and}} an {{important}} name appears on the accounts,--that of Jean Trupin, 'a simple workman at the wages of three sous a day,' but doubtless a good and spirited carver, whose true portrait it is without doubt, and by his own hand, that forms the <b>elbow-rest,</b> of the 85th stall (right hand, nearest apse), beneath which is cut his name JHAN TRUPIN, and again under the 92nd stall, with the added wish, 'Jan Trupin, God take care of thee' (Dieu te pourvoie).|$|E
50|$|In {{the trench}} warfare of World War I, {{the name was}} applied to a similar feature at the lip of a trench, which served mainly as an <b>elbow-rest</b> for riflemen.|$|E
5000|$|Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman {{forms are}} more conventional, {{and the new}} motives that belong to these periods are mostly floral. Busts and masks are the usual handle-plaques and spouts; heads and limbs of various animals are allotted certain {{decorative}} functions, as for instance the spirited mules' heads mentioned by Juvenal, which formed the <b>elbow-rests</b> of dining couches. These structural pieces are frequently inlaid with silver and niello. Bronze chairs and tables were commonly used in Hellenistic and Roman houses, and largely took the place of monumental vases that were popular in earlier days. Small household articles, such as lamps, when made of bronze are usually Roman, and a peculiarly Roman class of personal ornaments is a large bronze brooch inlaid with coloured enamels, a technique {{which seems to have}} had a Gaulish origin.|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study: To {{evaluate}} {{influence of}} work with computer on pupils health and ergonomical conditions at their workplaces. Material and methods: Data has been collected by questionnaire testing of 402 pupils at Kaunas and Kretinga secondary schools. Research {{data were analyzed using}} program SPSS 11. 0 for Windows. Results: Working with computer, 30. 3 % of pupils feel pain in eyes, 30. 1 % suffer from reduced vision. Pupils feel uncomfortable because of glare and flicker of display. Children who feel display flicker and discomfort for indirect glare more often complain for visual problems. Children often working with computer in the dark environment more often are feeling redness in eyes. Workplaces at home are equipped better than at school (p 0. 05). Children that have <b>elbow-rests</b> more often feel pain in back (p 0. 05). Conclusions: 1. 	Working with the computer, pupils suffer from vision problems and musculosceletal disorders. 2. 	Statistically reliable difference has been stated between frequency of indirect glare, flicker of the display and pains in the eyes, redness, tearful eyes and reduced vision. 3. 	Pain in musculosceletal system is rare felt by pupils who had properly equipped workplaces. 4. 	Children playing violent games more often had conflicts with their friends (p> 0. 05). Practical recommendations: Assuming the results for prophylaxis of health disturbances, children working with computer should have good work conditions, adjusted furniture, regular rest breaks. Parents and teachers control over computer use is also important. At least once a year children must visit the general practice pediatrician and ophthalmologist for examining their health...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} curiosities too: a {{chandelier}} with real goldfish in a bowl, a travelling enema kit and a ‘'voyeuse’', {{a chair with}} a padded <b>elbow-rest</b> upon which elegant ladies would kneel or sit whilst playing indoor games, {{so as not to}} crumple the arrangement of their dresses over wide panniers.|$|E
40|$|Full length {{shot of a}} {{group of}} four people around a table: a sitting woman in a light urban dress and a man in a suit. A young woman in a dark urban dress is sitting on the <b>elbow-rest</b> of the chair, {{embracing}} the man; and a young man is standing next to her, resting his hand on the shoulder of the middle-aged woman. Stoyan Rusev (1865 - 1938) - a Bulgarian writer and teacher - with his second wife Kostadinka, his daughter and his son...|$|E
40|$|A {{full length}} studio {{photograph}} of three {{young women in}} long urban dresses. The woman in the middle is sitting in an armchair; {{the woman on the}} right is seated next to her on the <b>elbow-rest,</b> holding her hand on the other woman's shoulder. On the left the third woman is standing, leaned on the backrest. A painted canvas backdrop is creating the illusion of the scene being set in a lounge. From the left to the right: probably Rayna Karastoyanova, Maria Teneva and Bogdana Ikonomova. Rayna Karastoyanova (1878 - unknown) was the wife of the photographer Bozhidar Dimitrov Karastoyanov. She became a photographer alike her husband. They worked together in a common studio, but there are almost no photographs personally signed by her...|$|E
