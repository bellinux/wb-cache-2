5|$|The turnpike {{continues}} east along I-70 {{and crosses}} Tecumseh Creek. The Topeka Service Area {{is located on}} the north side of the road east of here at mile 188. It is accessed by ramps on the right side of the highway in both directions. Just east of the service area, the turnpike enters Douglas County while passing over US-40 without an interchange. The route then curves to the southeast and runs roughly parallel to US-40. A series of curves takes the turnpike <b>farther</b> <b>east</b> as it reaches Exit 197 (Lecompton), a folded diamond interchange with the western terminus of K-10. After this, the highway continues <b>farther</b> <b>east</b> and enters the city of Lawrence, where it shares a diamond interchange with McDonald Drive at Exit 202 (West Lawrence). McDonald Drive leads to US-59 south of the turnpike. East of here, the highway bends east-northeasterly, crosses the Kansas River, and then intersects US-40 and US-59, which run concurrently, at Exit 204 (East Lawrence).|$|E
5|$|East of Porus' kingdom, {{near the}} Ganges River, were the Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the Gangaridai Empire (of the modern-day Bengal {{region of the}} Indian subcontinent). Fearing the {{prospect}} of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march <b>farther</b> <b>east.</b> This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Farther</b> <b>east</b> in Florida, high waves caused flooding, beach erosion, and {{the loss}} of seawalls {{previously}} damaged by Elena. The rough surf washed away a house on Captiva Island. The outskirts of Juan also spawned 15tornadoes along the Florida Panhandle, causing $1million in damage. The tornadoes injured six people, destroyed 19buildings, and damaged about 40others. One of the tornadoes struck Okaloosa Island and Fort Walton Beach, killing a dog and damaging two hotels along U.S. Route 98.|$|E

Just inside of Gardiner, the highway passes through Minnewaska State Park, a large state park in the Hudson Valley. US44 and NY55 join US9W for roughly a half-mile southward along the western bank of the Hudson River before {{separating}} at a trumpet interchange south of Highland. One mile east of US9W, US44 and NY55 cross the Hudson on the Mid-Hudson Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Vince {{developed}} into a hurricane <b>farther</b> <b>east</b> than any other known storm, at 18.9°W. The National Hurricane Center declared that Vince was the first tropical cyclone on record to have made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula. Historical documents, however, suggest that a possibly stronger tropical storm, the 1842 Spain hurricane, struck the Iberian Peninsula on 29 October 1842. Vince's record north was broken by Tropical Storm Grace in 2009.|$|E

Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows that route through residential areas.

5|$|I-87 {{is part of}} a major {{strategic}} corridor between New York City, {{the largest}} metropolitan area in the U.S., and Montreal, the second largest metropolitan area in Canada. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) considers the route important for commerce, as it connects with numerous highways in the region and serves approximately 80 million people along the Mid-Atlantic States, New England, and Quebec. Motorists can connect to multiple highways on I-87 to travel farther south along I-95 through the mid-Atlantic states, or through numerous other highways to travel <b>farther</b> <b>east</b> into New England.|$|E
5|$|In the Louisville {{hamlet of}} Louisville Corner (west of Massena), NY37 departs the St. Lawrence River and intersects {{the western end}} of NY131, a northerly bypass of Massena along the riverbank. <b>Farther</b> <b>east</b> in Massena, NY37 intersects NY37B, the former routing of NY37 through Massena, west of the village before {{crossing}} over the Grasse River and intersecting the northern termini of both NY56 (where NY37 widens into a four-lane divided highway) and NY420. NY37B later rejoins NY37 east of the village, as does NY131 directly north of the Massena International Airport.|$|E

In the city of Norwich, NY23 is entirely city-owned and maintained. <b>Farther</b> <b>east</b> {{in the city of}} Oneonta, the route is city-maintained from the western city line to James F. Lettis Highway. Finally, the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and its approaches are maintained by the New York State Bridge Authority (NYSBA).|$|E
5|$|Near the Lake Ontario shoreline, NY18F {{connects to}} the Fort Niagara spur of the Niagara Scenic State Parkway via a partial diamond interchange. Only {{westbound}} access is permitted at the location; access to the eastbound spur, and thus the parkway mainline, is provided via NY93 in Youngstown or by NY18 <b>farther</b> <b>east.</b> Past the exit, NY18F turns east and begins to parallel the lakeshore. The route also parallels the mainline Moses Parkway for a short distance before curving south to cross over the parkway and terminate at NY18 {{in the vicinity of}} Four Mile Creek State Park in Porter.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant (lieutenant general) in October 1799, Vukassovich {{took part}} in the 1800 Italian campaign. When Bonaparte invaded Italy via the Great Saint Bernard Pass, he {{commanded}} a division <b>farther</b> <b>east</b> in the area of Lake Maggiore and Lake Como. On 25 May, a cavalry patrol of Vukassovich's scouts briefly captured Bonaparte before themselves becoming prisoners when the French general's escort appeared. The sudden French offensive drove Vukassovich's outnumbered troops out of Milan. Pursued by Guillaume Duhesme's French corps, he retreated to Brescia and Cremona with his remaining 4,000 men, missing the Battle of Marengo.|$|E

5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much <b>farther</b> <b>east.</b> The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly <b>farther</b> <b>east</b> than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days <b>farther</b> <b>east</b> at Balmoral Castle.

In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E
