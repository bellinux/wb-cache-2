This name, alternatively Karra-weera, only referred to the lake section of the river, between Adelaide and North Adelaide. It was known as Karrundo-ingga at Hindmarsh, Witoingga near the reed beds, and Yertala everywhere when in flood, which has survived as Yatala in the naming of various places in Adelaide.|$|E

After processing through the STC, the bids were to be submitted <b>dually</b> to the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs and the ICG. 15 bids were received from 12 countries. The winning bid was the second bid of ASMAR, Chile's largest shipbuilding corporation. The contract for {{the construction}} of the new vessel was signed on 20 December 2006 by Björn, Árni M. Mathiesen, Minister of Finance, and Georg Kr. Lárusson, Director of the ICG, and Carlos Fanta de la Vega, Rear Admiral of the Chilean Navy and Director of the ASMAR Naval Shipyard. Construction commenced on 16 October 2007. The ship was launched on 29 April 2009 at a ceremony in the ASMAR Naval Shipyard in Talcahuano. The then-unnamed vessel received the official name Þór, or Thor, after the god Thor.|$|E

These companies are independently operated from their foreign parent companies and are registered in Mexico. These local companies function under Mexican law and retain a sizable portion of the revenue.

25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. <b>Dually</b> an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E
25|$|Edelsbrunner and Welzl (1986) first {{studied the}} problem of {{constructing}} all k-sets of an input point set, or <b>dually</b> of constructing the k-level of an arrangement. The k-level version of their algorithm {{can be viewed as}} a plane sweep algorithm that constructs the level in left-to-right order. Viewed in terms of k-sets of point sets, their algorithm maintains a dynamic convex hull for the points on each side of a separating line, repeatedly finds a bitangent of these two hulls, and moves each of the two points of tangency to the opposite hull. Chan (1999) surveys subsequent results on this problem, and shows that it can be solved in time proportional to Dey's O(nk1/3) bound on the complexity of the k-level.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{doctors who}} {{practice}} obstetrics include categorically specialized obstetricians, family practitioners and general practitioners whose training, skills and practices include obstetrics, {{and in some}} contexts general surgeons. These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions. Categorically specialized obstetricians are qualified surgeons, so they can undertake surgical procedures relating to childbirth. Some family practitioners or general practitioners also perform obstetrical surgery. Obstetrical procedures include cesarean sections, episiotomies, and assisted delivery. Categorical specialists in obstetrics are commonly <b>dually</b> trained in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), and may provide other medical and surgical gynecological care, and may incorporate more general, well-woman, primary care elements in their practices. Maternal-fetal medicine specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery.|$|E
25|$|Women were {{vital to}} the early Pentecostal movement. Believing that whoever {{received}} the Pentecostal experience had the responsibility to use it towards the preparation for Christ's second coming, Pentecostal women held that the baptism in the Holy Spirit gave them empowerment and justification to engage in activities traditionally denied to them. The first person at Parham's Bible college to receive Spirit baptism with the evidence of speaking in tongues was a woman, Agnes Ozman. Women such as Florence Crawford, Ida Robinson, and Aimee Semple McPherson founded new denominations, and many women served as pastors, co-pastors, and missionaries. Women wrote religious songs, edited Pentecostal papers, and taught and ran Bible schools. The unconventionally intense and emotional environment generated in Pentecostal meetings <b>dually</b> promoted, and was itself created by, other forms of participation such as personal testimony and spontaneous prayer and singing. Women did not shy away from engaging in this forum, {{and in the early}} movement the majority of converts and church-goers were female. Nevertheless, there was considerable ambiguity surrounding {{the role of women in}} the church. The subsiding of the early Pentecostal movement allowed a socially more conservative approach to women to settle in, and, as a result, female participation was channeled into more supportive and traditionally accepted roles. Auxiliary women's organizations were created to focus women's talents on more traditional activities. Women also became much more likely to be evangelists and missionaries than pastors. When they were pastors, they often co-pastored with their husbands.|$|E
500|$|... "Crack Music" [...] {{continues}} the avenue of socio-political commentary initiated within [...] "Heard 'Em Say." [...] However, two songs express polar opposite tones; where [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] was self-effacing and passive-aggressive, [...] "Crack Music" [...] is audacious and straightforward. In the song, West <b>dually</b> discusses the spread and devastating impact {{of crack cocaine}} in black communities and champions the sovereignty of music pioneered by black musicians, metaphorically equating their contrarily addictive power and influence on American society. On the sentimental [...] "Roses", Kanye gives a firsthand account of the hospitalization of his ailing grandmother within a melancholic poem to produce {{a critique of the}} healthcare system.|$|E

It is included on the follow-up release of Raymond v. Raymond, titled Versus. In Japan, the song was released <b>dually</b> with [...] "Never Say Never" [...] as a double A-side single. The song received positive reviews, with critics complimenting the track's dance feel, and the lyrical content.

500|$|... "Homecoming" [...] {{serves as}} a heartfelt tribute to West's {{hometown}} of Chicago, Illinois. Using an extended metaphor that personifies {{the city as a}} childhood sweetheart named 'Windy' (a reference to Chicago's nickname of the 'Windy City'), West rhymes about his love for Chicago and his guilt over leaving [...] "her" [...] to pursue his musical dream. The song's opening lines lyrically paraphrase [...] "I Used to Love H.E.R.", a similarly metaphoric hip-hop song made by West's close friend and labelmate Common, who later appeared in the single's music video. West dedicated [...] "Big Brother" [...] to Jay Z, whom he feels so close to that he sees him as a brother. Within the song, West <b>dually</b> details his love and admiration as well as his envy and antagonism towards Jay Z, metaphorically equating their relationship to that of a sibling rivalry. West also uses the song's chorus as a subsidiary dedication to his mentor No I.D., who first taught him how to produce music. Similar to its musicality, the songwriting characteristics of the album-closing track, [...] "Good Night" [...] alludes to West's next musical progression. The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother Donda West less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fiancée Alexis Phifer, the trace amounts of melancholy found scattered throughout Graduation would all but envelop West's next studio album, 808s & Heartbreak.|$|E

2500|$|This can {{be proven}} by {{comparing}} the restrictions on (undirected) Dynkin diagrams with the restrictions on Coxeter diagrams of finite groups: formally, the Coxeter graph {{can be obtained from}} the Dynkin diagram by discarding the direction of the edges, and replacing every double edge with an edge labelled 4 and every triple edge by an edge labelled 6. Also note that every finitely generated Coxeter group is an Automatic group. Dynkin diagrams have the additional restriction that the only permitted edge labels are 2, 3, 4, and 6, which yields the above.
