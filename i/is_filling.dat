5|$|Eclipsing {{variables}} are star systems that vary in brightness {{because of one}} star passing {{in front of the}} other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star <b>is</b> <b>filling</b> its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E

The yellow light of fear is being drained from their rings and replaced with the violet light of love. Queen Aga'po also claims that violet light <b>is</b> <b>filling</b> an emptiness in their hearts and replacing their capacity for creating fear. The delegate meeting ends poorly for the Oans, as the Zamarons refuse to stop their pursuit of the violet light.

25|$|The {{detrusor}} {{muscle is}} {{a layer of}} the urinary bladder wall made of smooth muscle fibers arranged in spiral, longitudinal, and circular bundles. Stretch receptors in the bladder signal the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor to contract the muscle when the bladder is extended. This encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra. The main receptor activated is the M3 receptor, although M2 receptors are also involved and whilst outnumbering the M3 receptors they are not so responsive. The main relaxant pathway is via the adenylyl cyclase cAMP pathway, activated by β2 adrenergic receptors. The detrusor muscle is unusually able to change its length. It can also contract {{for a long time}} whilst voiding, and it stays relaxed whilst the bladder <b>is</b> <b>filling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Double-vault UDDTs are {{alternatively}} called twin-vault, two-vault or two-chambered UDDTs. In double-vault UDDTs, the fecal material dehydrates in situ. The two above-ground vaults {{are used}} alternately. While one vault <b>is</b> <b>filling</b> up, the other (full) one stores the fecal material under dry conditions {{for at least}} six months. During this resting period, no fresh feces are allowed to enter the full vault. In order to switch from one vault to the other, the user interface can either be switched or both vaults can be equipped with fixed seats and a cover sufficient to prevent access to the full vault. When the second vault becomes full and at least 6 months have passed, the first vault is emptied with a shovel and then the user interface is moved over accordingly. The vaults are commonly sized so that one vault fills up in six to 12 months.|$|E

25|$|A water clock uses a flow {{of water}} to measure time. If {{viscosity}} is neglected, the physical principle required to study such clocks is Torricelli's law. There {{are two types of}} water clocks: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container. This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time. As the water leaves the container, an observer can see where the water is level with the lines and tell how much time has passed. An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water <b>is</b> <b>filling</b> up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and tell how much time has passed.|$|E
25|$|Only {{relatively}} small craft {{are capable of}} passing the harbor channel. A large natural sandspit, augmented by breakwaters, protects the harbor from the Pacific Ocean to the west. At its northern end, remains of a bridge that used to connect the shore with the sandspit can be seen. Morro Bay Harbor's channel silts up and must be dredged every three to four years. Previously, the Shark Inlet connected the back bay to the ocean. Some have proposed reopening it to slow the sedimentation that <b>is</b> <b>filling</b> up the bay. There has also been work on reducing erosion in the Chorro Creek watershed {{to reduce the amount}} of sediment coming into the bay to form bottom layers of bay mud. Chorro Creek is the bay's largest tributary. It forms an estuary in the back bay between Morro Bay and Los Osos. The second largest tributary, and the only other significant one, is Los Osos Creek, which empties into the far south end of the back bay.|$|E

Club member Kurt (Chris Colfer), who had seen her perform [...] "Conjunction Junction" [...] when she subbed for his English class, asks her to also take over Will's glee club rehearsals. Instead of assigning songs, Holly asks the club members {{what kind of music}} they would like to perform, and when Puck (Mark Salling) suggests [...] "Forget You", she sings the song and they all join in, except for Rachel (Lea Michele). Holly later wins her over by asking Rachel what she would like to sing that she hasn't been able to, and they perform a number from Chicago together. Holly bonds with Sue (Jane Lynch), who is the acting principal with Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) also out sick, and Sue fires the still-ailing Will, making Holly the full-time director of the glee club. When he recovers, Will confronts Holly at school, but she is unwilling to give up her new position. She later discovers she is in over her head when Mercedes (Amber Riley) gets in trouble, and Holly turns to Will for help. She reveals that she was once a more serious teacher like Will until a student punched her in the face, at which point she became far more free spirited. Holly ultimately returns to substitute teaching and Will is reinstated. He assigns the glee club to perform [...] "Singin' in the Rain" [...] on his return, but faced with their dismay at being given another old song, he asks for Holly's help to modernize it, and they all perform a mash-up of it with Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella".|$|E

500|$|Hard Target {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} on its initial release praising the film's action scenes but noting the poor story and Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting abilities. On the film review television show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert stated that Hard Target is [...] "not very smart and it's not very original, {{but it is}} well made on a technical level. The stunts are impressive... as an action picture, it's well made, but it never becomes more than competent action and I just can't recommend it for that". Gene Siskel also gave the film a thumbs down on the show stating that [...] "John Woo is a good filmmaker... Van Damme is pretty wooden... You notice the style in the film because {{there is not much}} substance". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, although Mr. Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable". In Variety, Emanuel Levy wrote that Hard Target was [...] "a briskly vigorous, occasionally brilliant actioner starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, hampered by a B-script with flat, standard characters, and subjected to repeated editing of the violent sequences to win an R rating, pic doesn't bear the unique vision on display in Woo's recent [...] "The Killer" [...] and [...] "Hard-Boiled." [...] Van Damme and the director's reputation should ensure initial commercial kick on the way to solid if not spectacular box office". Desson Thompson of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "When Van Damme isn't duking it out with the English language, scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer <b>is</b> <b>filling</b> Henriksen's mouth with villainous pseudo-profundities. Even in a second-rate action picture like this, and despite Henriksen's commendable efforts, they're painful to listen to... Woo's creative presence is practically stifled. There are some flashes of his deliriously wild style—a slow-motion moment here, a well-chosen freeze-frame there. He also introduces American audiences to his taste for unique motorcycle stunts and very, very loud car explosions. But these Wooisms are disappointingly minimal". Lance Henriksen received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in the film. In 1997, Woo looked back on Hard Target stating that it was [...] "in some ways, quite a troublesome movie to make, but I'm rather happy with the way the action scenes turned out". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E

2500|$|Finishing is {{the final}} step of the {{manufacturing}} process that gives wood surfaces desirable characteristics, including enhanced appearance and increased resistance to moisture and other environmental agents. Finishing can also make wood easier to clean and keep it sanitized, sealing pores that can be breeding grounds for bacteria. [...] Finishing can also influence other wood properties, for example tonal qualities of musical instruments and hardness of flooring. Patching wood requires skill, but when done properly {{it is possible to}} create a repair that is very difficult to see. An alternative to patching <b>is</b> <b>filling</b> (sometimes known as stopping). Numerous coloured fillers (putties and waxes) are produced commercially and are coloured to match different wood species. Successful filling of voids in wood requires the filler to precisely match the colour and grain pattern of the wood around the void, which is difficult to achieve in practice. Furthermore, filled voids do not behave like wood during subsequent finishing steps, and they age differently to wood. Hence, repairs to wood using fillers may noticeable. Therefore filling is best used with opaque finishes rather than semitransparent finishes, which allow the grain of the wood to be seen.|$|E
