There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling me to believe <b>in</b> <b>myself</b> and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|E
25|$|Prigent {{released}} his second album, Me 'zalc'h ennon ur fulenn aour (I keep <b>in</b> <b>myself</b> a golden spark), in 1997. He wrote all the lyrics {{except for the}} traditional song Ar rannoù that appears in the Barzaz Breiz, {{and most of the}} musics, using both traditional instruments and electronic sounds. The subjects of the lyrics are the classical topics of gwerz : injustice, disease, death. E trouz ar gêr, about the artificial aspects of living in a city, and An hentoù adkavet, about the revival of the Tro Breizh, are his first songs devoted to Brittany, its culture and its relation to nature.|$|E

25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel <b>in</b> <b>myself,</b> in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days, the {{students}} made ink for pens from elderberry juice, and pencils from burned wood; they asked local businesses for furniture. Bethune wrote later, [...] "I considered cash money as the smallest {{part of my}} resources. I had faith in a loving God, faith <b>in</b> <b>myself,</b> {{and a desire to}} serve." [...] The school received donations of money, equipment, and labor from local black churches. Within a year, Bethune was teaching more than 30 girls at the school.|$|E
500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe <b>in</b> <b>myself</b> when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E

She got the tattoo, which was documented on the reality show LA Ink, after breaking her collarbone in 2007. The tattoo is also related to her Christian beliefs.

500|$|Despite this, when Caracciola socialised {{with the}} upper Nazi echelons {{he did so}} merely as an [...] "accessory", not as an active member, and at no time was he {{a member of the}} Nazi Party. According to his autobiography, he turned down a request from the NSKK in 1942 to {{entertain}} German troops, as he [...] "could not find it <b>in</b> <b>myself</b> to cheer up young men so that they would believe in a victory I myself could not believe in". Caracciola lived in Switzerland from the early 1930s, and despite strict currency controls, his salary was paid in Swiss francs. During the war, he continued to receive a pension from Daimler-Benz, until the firm ceased his payments under pressure from the Nazi party in 1942.|$|E
500|$|The opening aria, [...] "" [...] (I am {{content with}} the fortune that my dear God bestows on me.), is slow and pensive, {{accompanied}} by all instruments, reminiscent of the slow movement of an oboe concerto. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted in 2000 the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, noted in the project diary that Bach, who possibly was not content with his situation in Leipzig, composed music portraying [...] "ambivalence and complexity". His music is [...] "dynamic and fluctuating", capturing [...] "wistful, resigned, elegiac" [...] moods. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the aria compares to Ich bin in mir vergnügt, BWV 204 (I am content <b>in</b> <b>myself)</b> which he describes as [...] "also a highly personal work for solo soprano with a similar theme, exploring comparable human emotions".|$|E

PewDiePie later uploaded a short video apologizing for the language he used during the live-stream, expressing [...] "I'm not going to make any excuses to why it did because there are no excuses for it.

Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith <b>in</b> <b>myself,</b> that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspiration for Marching Men came in {{part from}} the author's time as a laborer in Chicago between 1900 and 1906 (where he, like his protagonist, worked in a warehouse, went to night school, was robbed, and fell in love several times) and his service in the Spanish–American War which took place {{towards the end of the}} war and just after the {{armistice}} in 1898–99. Of the latter, Anderson wrote in his Memoirs about the time he had been marching and got a rock in his shoe. After separating from his fellow soldiers to remove it, he observed them and recalled [...] "I had become a giant.... I was, <b>in</b> <b>myself,</b> something huge, terrible and at the same time noble. I remember that I sat, for a long time, while the army passed, opening and closing my eyes". Combined with his later reading of works by Thomas Carlyle, Mark Twain, and possibly Jack London, Anderson had inspiration for Marching Men that was both experiential and literary.|$|E

500|$|Kapoor is {{also known}} for her {{assertive}} and moody nature, and her outspoken views and independence have been singled out for making major contributions to her career; they [...] "add to her superstar aura". In an early interview, she confessed to being an [...] "introvert, yet [...] extremely candid and blunt", reasoning: [...] "Total faith and complete belief <b>in</b> <b>myself</b> is my attitude towards life, films and virtually everything else. I am all about doing what I feel is right. It {{is not easy to}} pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions." [...] Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities, it [...] "makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [...] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it, not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is waiting around the corner." [...] Meanwhile, Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor's demeanour is an act; she is [...] "cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her".|$|E
