5|$|His {{success in}} Gruban v Booth allowed Hastings to switch his {{practice}} {{from the county}} courts to the High Court, and {{at the beginning of}} Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King's Counsel (KC).

5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> other, {{to see if he could}} capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. There was no evidence of Harnden's men being there yet.|$|E

During the tow towards Carnarvon, Western Australia, the lifeboat was swamped and partially sunk by rough seas, so two of Centaurs lifeboats were lowered to carry the Germans. On arrival in Carnarvon, the Germans were relocated to the number one cargo hold, where {{they were joined by}} another hundred Kormoran survivors collected by other ships, plus forty Australian Army guards, which were then transported by Centaur to Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been {{established}} Marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, {{and now he was}} facing open conflict with two different enemies. He therefore <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offense was not the private warfare in itself, {{but the fact that the}} earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed {{their enemy}} {{to have the}} {{battlefield}} of his choosing. Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew all along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until {{the last day of}} the battle, he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources. When he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster, he nevertheless had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army.|$|E
5|$|The {{events that}} would cost Cumanus his office began {{with the murder of}} one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been {{travelling}} through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem. A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> law into their own hands. Under the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm most of the others, but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted.|$|E
5|$|Up till now, the Muslim {{army had}} adopted a largely {{defensive}} strategy, but {{knowing that the}} Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All the cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total strength of this cavalry group was now about 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The {{rest of the day}} passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, Wadi-ur-Ruqqad at west, Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Harclay's most {{prominent}} achievement {{came with the}} Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. The battle {{was the culmination of}} an ongoing struggle between King Edward II and his most powerful earl, Thomas of Lancaster. The conflict stemmed from disagreement over the handling of the war with Scotland; Lancaster, and many others, found the king's war effort lacking. After failing to incite an insurrection against the king, Lancaster was in March 1322 fleeing northwards from the royal army. Meanwhile, Harclay, as sheriff of Cumberland, was ordered by the king to levy the forces of the northern counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, and move south. His orders were to meet up with the royal army, but while stopping at the town of Ripon in Yorkshire, he received intelligence that Lancaster would arrive at nearby Boroughbridge the next day. Harclay <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> initiative, and occupy the bridge that would prevent Lancaster's passage across the River Ure.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the Fronde insurrection {{broke out}} in Paris, {{prompted}} by high taxes, increased food prices and disease. The Parlement of Paris, the Regency government of Anne of Austria and rebellious noble factions fought for several years {{to take control of}} the city and wider power. On 26 August, during the period known as the First Fronde, Anne ordered the arrest of some of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris; violence flared as a result, and the 27 August became known as another Day of the Barricades. The governor of the Bastille loaded and readied his guns to fire on the HÃ´tel de Ville, controlled by the parliament, although the decision was eventually taken not to shoot. Barricades were erected across the city and the royal government fled in September, leaving a garrison of 22 men behind in the Bastille. On 11 January 1649, the Fronde <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Bastille, giving the task to Elbeuf, one of their leaders. Elbeuf's attack required only a token effort: five or six shots were fired at the Bastille, before it promptly surrendered on the 13 January. Pierre Broussel, one of the Fronde leaders, appointed his son as the governor and the Fronde retained it even after the ceasefire that March.|$|E
5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.|$|E

5|$|On 3 July 1945 Andersen {{killed two}} German {{prisoners of war}} with his Thompson submachine gun. Andersen had broken into German barracks in Vadheim in Sogn during a {{drinking}} binge, killing the German soldiers Herbert Neumann and Hermann Beckmann. He later claimed to have acted in rage over his wife's death. The Norwegian court system started working on Andersen's case, eventually reaching judge advocate Ivar Follestad. Andersen was defended by Reidar Skau, who was made Supreme Court Justice in 1945. Follestad deemed it necessary to prosecute Andersen, but wanted to pardon him after the verdict. After spending {{more than a year}} in the civilian and military court systems Andersen's murder case reached the top levels of the Royal Norwegian Navy, and on 5 August 1946 it was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> case to the Gulating Military Court of Appeal. Three months later Follestad made a decision of non-indictment, despite there being evidence to convict Andersen. In January 1947 the general jurisdiction chief, Thore Horve, also declared for a decision of non-indictment. Follestad and Horve were supported in this by Minister of Defence Jens Christian Hauge, and the decision was made final by royal resolution on 25 April 1947. This led to protests from, amongst others, leading Norwegian psychiatrist Johan Scharffenberg.|$|E
5|$|The action quickly {{revealed}} {{a breakdown in}} discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> lead himself, and the Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore {{the brunt of the}} fire of the entire squadron. The Ruby was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action {{at two in the morning}} on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.|$|E
5|$|Once Chrono Trigger was completed, {{the team}} resumed discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995. The team {{reviewed}} {{the option of}} continuing the 2D strategy, {{which would have been}} the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward the future of 3D gaming, and the radical new development models that these 3D consoles would require. The team <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware, but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered Sega's new Saturn console and the Microsoft Windows personal computer (PC). Their decision was influenced by two things: a tech demo based on Final Fantasy VI created using the new Softimage 3D software that impressed both staff and external developers, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version of the game, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral, {{even in the face of}} a lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster put too much of a strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It was later estimated that it would have required thirty 64DD discs to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and favorably impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of Final Fantasy VII in addition to all other planned game projects, onto Sony's PlayStation.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{possessed a}} {{numerical}} superiority {{of two to}} one, and their advanced post, commanded by Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, overlooked all parts of Frederick's camp. The French and Habsburg Imperial (Reichsarmee) troops consisted of 62 battalions (31,000 infantry), 84 squadrons (10,000) of cavalry, and 109 artillery, totaling some 4142,000 men, under Soubise's and Saxe-Hildburghausen's command. The Allies had {{taken the lead in}} the maneuvers of the previous days, and Hildburghausen <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive. He had some difficulty inducing Soubise to risk a battle, so the Allies did not begin to move from their campground until after eleven a.m. on 5 November. Soubise probably intended to engage as late in the day as possible, with the idea of gaining what advantages he could in a partial action before nightfall. Their plan called for the Allied army to march by Zeuchfeld, around Frederick's left, which no serious natural obstacle covered, and to deploy in battle array facing north, between Reichardtswerben on the right and PettstÃ¤dt on the left. Saxe-Hildburghausen's proposed battle and the more limited aim of Soubise appeared equally likely to succeed by taking this position, which threatened to cut Frederick off from a retreat to the towns on the Saale. The Allies could only attain this position by marching around the Prussian flank, which could put them in the tenuous position of marching across their enemies' front. Consequently, the Allies posted a sizable guard against the obvious risk of interference on their exposed flank.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E
