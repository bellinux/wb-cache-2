25|$|The {{superior}} planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all {{follow the}} same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a <b>driving</b> <b>gear,</b> a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E
2500|$|Conventional overhead, {{trolling}} or baitcasting type reels usually {{use one of}} {{two types}} of drags: star or lever. The most common and simplest mechanically is the star drag—so-called because the adjustor [...] wheel looks like a star with rounded points. Star drags work by screw action to increase or decrease {{the pressure on the}} washer stack which is usually located on the main <b>driving</b> <b>gear.</b> Reels with star drags generally have a separate lever which allows the reel to go into [...] "freespool" [...] by disengaging the spool from the drive train completely and allowing it to spin freely with little resistance. The freespool position is used for casting, letting line out and/or allowing live bait to move freely.|$|E
50|$|Transmission {{consists}} of a hydraulic torque converter coupled to a gearbox with one reverse and four forward <b>driving</b> <b>gears.</b> The AMX-10P utilises a torsion bar suspension, which supports five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear and idler near the front. These can be accessed from inside the hull through maintenance panels.|$|R

The design methodology of gaskets with the shell member {{with regard to the}} necessary life, of <b>driving</b> <b>gears</b> for them has been developed. The choice procedure of rational sizes of shell members has been developed; the new constructions of sealing joints with the shell member, the new constructions of <b>driving</b> <b>gears</b> for the valve gaskets with the shell member have been offered. The introduction efficiencies are the decrease of force to seal, the increase of sealing reliability, the reduction of dimensions and mass.

60|$|One hot afternoon, he lay under a mower in a sloo {{where the}} melted snow had run {{in spring and}} the wild grass now grew tall. It made good hay and the fierce sun had dried it well, so that he had only to cut and haul it home; but {{something}} had gone wrong with the machine, and after taking out the broken knife he dismantled the <b>driving</b> <b>gear.</b> When he crawled out, with a greasy cogwheel in his hand, he was soaked with perspiration and his overalls were stained by oil. The mosquitoes, that did not as a rule venture out in the strong wind and sun, had bitten him badly while he lay in the grass.|$|E

They were given locomotive numbers 4507 - 4535. This <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> enabled the water tank {{to be located}} below the boiler in the frame, {{so that there was}} more space on the gangways.|$|E

40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access. The {{internal}} combustion engine produces a fluctuating torque due to combustion as well as induced inertial imbalance in the reciprocating motion of pistons. When the clutch is engaged, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transmitted to the transmission. In the transmission the fixed <b>driving</b> <b>gears</b> (pinions) transfer the motion to the driven unselected gears (loose gears) through impacting teeth pairs in close proximity due to the compact nature of modern transmission systems. The driven gears in turn rotate freely on their bearings, as they are unselected (referred to as loose gears). As a result, the idle (loose) gears oscillate within their backlash limits, leading to impacts with the <b>driving</b> <b>gears.</b> The vibrations caused by these impacts are transferred through the transmission shafts and their support bearings to the transmission bell housing, and is mostly radiated as sound that resembles the noise produced when a marble rolls inside a metallic can. This sound is onomatopoeically referred to as rattle...|$|R
40|$|Conjugate tooth {{surfaces}} reduce kinematic errors. Method for {{generation of}} {{spiral bevel gears}} provides conjugated gear-tooth surfaces and improved bearing contact. Conjugated surfaces preferable because maintain constant gear ratios during tooth-contact cycles. Changing gear ratios of nonconjugated surfaces give rise to kinematical errors in transfer of motion from <b>driving</b> <b>gears</b> to driven gears. Errors major sources of noise in power transmissions. Computer program developed to simulate cutting and meshing processes for pinions and gears to minimize kinematical errors...|$|R

Number 03 193 was given a wine-red, streamlined, full covering and a 2′3 T 37 St tender, in order to replace the Class 05. 03 204 and 03 205 had <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> cover plates for experimental purposes.

50|$|The {{driving wheels}} of the S6 had the rather unusual {{diameter}} of 2,100 mm {{in order to keep}} the rpm down and to guarantee the smooth running of the <b>driving</b> <b>gear.</b> Originally a diameter of 2,200 mm had been planned, but in the end it was reduced by 100 mm. The heavy balancing masses of the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> were badly affected by weight savings. That resulted in serious jerkiness when running. A remedy was achieved by coupling the tender closer to the locomotive and thus raising the compression of the buffer springs.|$|E

50|$|Roy Fedden, Bristol's primary engine designer, became {{interested}} in the concept and by 1927 he had constructed a working two-cylinder V as a test bed, with the idea of developing it into a V-12. Problems cropped up on the design, notably the sleeves bursting during the power stroke and stripping their <b>driving</b> <b>gears.</b> A long series of tests and materials changes and improvements required six years and an estimated £2 million to cure. By 1933, the problems had been worked out and the Perseus {{went on to become the}} first sleeve valve aero-engine in the world, to be put into large quantity production.|$|R
