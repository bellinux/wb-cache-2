40|$|ABSTRACT The essay compares German and Irish media {{coverage}} of human genome research in the year 2000, using qualitative and quantitative frame analysis of a print media corpus. Drawing from a media-theoretical account of science communication, the study examines four analytic dimensions: (1) the influence of global and national sources of discourse; (2) the nature of elaboration on important themes; (3) the extent of societal participation in discourse production; (4) the cultural conditions in which the discourse resonates. The analysis shows that a global discursive package, emphasizing claims of scientific achievement and medical progress, dominates {{media coverage}} in both countries. However, German coverage is more extensive and elaborate, and includes {{a wider range of}} participants. Irish coverage more often incorporates the <b>global</b> <b>package</b> without further elaboration. These findings indicate that the <b>global</b> <b>package</b> is ’localized ’ differently due to national patterns of interests, German participation in human genome research, traditions of media coverage, and the domestic resonance of the issue...|$|E

50|$|For {{the period}} between 2011 and 2016, Brazil shows an {{estimated}} median growth of 6.2%, realizing a sales value of US$34 billion in 2016, leaving behind Canada and being on a level with France. The constant growth of the Brazilian packaging market is not a unique phenomenon. The <b>global</b> <b>packaging</b> market is on the rise, {{which is due to}} a combination of various factors like the growing urbanization, investments in the construction sector and the expansion of the health sector. The demand for environmentally friendly packaging types has also been increasing steadily since the 2000s and the resulting growth from innovation contributes to this trend. Additionally, the rapid growth of the so-called BRIC states {{over the course of the}} 2000s as well as the early post-crisis period plays a major role in the growth trend of the <b>global</b> <b>packaging</b> market. Despite the 2015 economic slowdowns - especially in China and Brazil - the highest growth rates for the 2011-2016 period can be observed in these states, with China, India, Brazil and Russia showing growth rates of 7.9%, 7.7%, 6.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The high growth rates in these countries can be explained by rising personal incomes, resulting in higher demand for a broad product range, which in turn creates growth for the packaging producers of these respective products. Despite its good CAGR, it was projected that due to the Brazilian recession the 2014 sales equaling US$35 billion would have decreased by 2.9% in 2016, to reach US$34 billion.|$|R

Whereas the previous government accepted the new voting system {{as a part of a}} <b>global</b> <b>package,</b> the new government considers that once the Constitutional Treaty is open for renegotiation, each and every member state has the right to place onto the agenda the elements it dislikes.

One of them is the ‘square root’ formula, which offers some sort of middle point between the Nice system and the Constitutional Treaty, but there are other possibilities. But, first and foremost, the European Council should allow the issue to be included in the IGC’s agenda. Not to do so would not only amount to repeating the mistakes made during the previous IGC negotiations but would open a question mark about the legitimacy of the EU’s treaty-making processes and threaten the satisfactory conclusion and ratification of the new Treaty...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{of carbon}} in the {{subsurface}} ocean {{are critical for}} understanding the mechanisms responsible for oceanic CO 2 uptake—the most important sink for fossil fuel CO 2 — and its sensitivity to climate change. Monitoring the ocean acidification and its possible impacts on ecosystems has recently arisen as an additional strong motivation for these efforts. National and regional research projects fund several important observational efforts, but for addressing what is really is a global problem, international coordination remains fundamental. Recognising this, the ocean carbon community has maintained a strong international collaboration, through IOCCP and GO-SHIP, {{and in the past}} WOCE-JGOFS and CLIVAR. Data synthesis has been an important end-product. Here we report on the ongoing international effort to synthesise ocean carbon data into one global product, GLODAPv 2. This effort builds upon the previous and ongoing global and regional syntheses GLODAP, CARINA and PACIFICA that are largely complementary. We will unite these products into one <b>global</b> <b>package.</b> Additionally we will gather, quality control and append all data not currently part of any existing product. The end result will be a collection of data from approximately 700 cruises, from the early 1970 s until the near present. These data will allow production of decadal distribution maps for the critical biogeochemical parameters. Ultimately, GLODAPv 2 will evolve into an international routine data synthesis project, releasing global quality controlled datasets on a semi regular schedule...|$|E
