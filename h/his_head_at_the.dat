5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 2017, Ellsbury hit {{his first}} career grand slam against the Baltimore Orioles in a 14-11 Yankees {{comeback}} win. It {{was also the}} 100th home run of his career. On May 24, Ellsbury made a superb catch at the center field wall, but also banged <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall, causing him to suffer a concussion. He {{was placed on the}} 7-day disabled list the next day. On June 10, Joe Girardi stated that Ellsbury had lost his job as the Yankees' starting center fielder to Aaron Hicks, who would continue to start even when Ellsbury is healthy. Ellsbury was activated from the disabled list on June 26 after missing 29 games, the same day that Hicks was placed on the 10-day disabled list with an oblique injury. With the rise of star rookie outfielder Clint Frazier, Ellsbury lost his job again and was relegated to the bench. On his 34th birthday on September 11, Ellsbury reached via catcher's interference for the 30th time in his career, which broke Pete Rose's career record of 29.|$|E

25|$|At {{the siege}} of Samarkand, Spitamenes used Bactrian horse archers in {{effective}} swarming attacks against a relief column sent by Alexander the Great. Bactrian horse archers surrounded various Macedonian phalanxes, staying {{out of range of}} their melee weapons, and fired arrows until they had no more. The archers would then withdraw to a supply point, but another swarm of horse archers would sometimes replace them, and sometimes attack elsewhere. The Bactrians eventually caused the phalanx to break formation, and destroyed it. Alexander recognized his forces could not directly combat horse archers, but that the horse archers needed resupply of provisions, horses, and arrows. Alexander split his forces into five columns and began building fortifications in the areas where the Bactrians had resupplied. Eventually, his anti-swarm tactics worked: cut off from resupply, the Bactrians had to meet the Macedonian phalanx, which were vastly superior in melee. Alexander made it priority to engage guerillas or other light mobile forces. Spitamenes was effective as long as his force were mobile, and he had adequate communications with mounted couriers. Once he was forced into direct battle with heavy forces, he literally lost <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Jaxartes River, Alexander once again faced swarming tactics from an army of Scythian horse archers. Alexander sent a unit of heavy cavalry ahead of his main line. As expected, the Scythian horsemen surrounded the detached cavalry. At the right moment, Alexander's cavalry reversed direction and pushed half of the Scythians straight into the main phalanx of Alexander's army, where they were slaughtered. Upon seeing this, the remaining half of the Scythian army retreated from the battle.|$|E

500|$|The meeting became confrontational when Krulak {{interrupted}} Phillips, {{asserting that}} American military advisers {{on the ground}} rejected the USOM officer's assessments. Phillips conceded that although the overall military situation had improved, {{this was not the}} case in the crucial delta areas. Phillips noted that the provincial military adviser in Long An Province adjacent to Saigon, had reported that the Viet Cong had overrun 200 Strategic Hamlets in the previous week, forcing the villagers to dismantle the settlement. McNamara shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> radically divergent reports. When Krulak derided Phillips, Assistant Secretary of State W. Averell Harriman could no longer restrain himself and called the general [...] "a damn fool". Phillips diplomatically took over from Harriman and asserted that it was a battle for hearts and minds rather than pure military metrics.|$|E

2500|$|The Fraumünster cathedral in Zurich, Switzerland, {{founded in}} 853, {{is known for}} its five large stained glass windows created by Chagall in 1967. Each window is [...] tall by [...] wide. Religion {{historian}} James H. Charlesworth notes that it is [...] "surprising how Christian symbols are featured in the works of an artist who comes from a strict and Orthodox Jewish background." [...] He surmises that Chagall, {{as a result of his}} Russian background, often used Russian icons in his paintings, with their interpretations of Christian symbols. He explains that his chosen themes were usually derived from biblical stories, and frequently portrayed the [...] "obedience and suffering of God's chosen people." [...] One of the panels depicts Moses receiving the Torah, with rays of light from <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> top of another panel is a depiction of Jesus' crucifixion.|$|E
2500|$|Gatorade {{has been}} the subject of {{substantial}} media attention and reference in popular culture situations, most of which are in relation to team or individual athletic sports. The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the Gatorade shower, originally called the [...] "Gatorade Dunk", where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler, sneak up behind the head coach, and pour the contents of the cooler (generally Gatorade and ice) over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of an American football game. This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when Harry Carson and Jim Burt, of the New York Giants, doused head coach Bill Parcells during the 1985 season. Burt's teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team's championship season of 1986–87. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports, including Canadian Football.|$|E
2500|$|Maradona {{was famous}} for his cunning personality. Inherent within his {{nickname}} [...] "El Pibe de Oro" [...] ("Golden Boy") {{is a sense of}} mischief, with [...] "pibe" [...] being an anti-establishment rogue, street smart and full of guile. Some critics view his controversial [...] "Hand of God" [...] goal at the 1986 World Cup as a clever maneuver, with one of the opposition players, Glenn Hoddle, admitting that Maradona had disguised it by flicking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as palming the ball. The goal itself has been viewed as an embodiment of the Buenos Aires shanty town Maradona was brought up in and its concept of viveza criolla — [...] "native cunning". Maradona used his hand in the 1990 World Cup, again without punishment, and this time on his own goal line, to prevent the Soviet Union from scoring. A number of publications have referred to Maradona as the Artful Dodger, the urchin pickpocket from Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{one second}} of each other, President Kennedy, Governor Connally, and Mrs. Kennedy all turned {{abruptly}} from looking to their left to looking to their right, between Zapruder film frames 155 and 169. Connally, like the President, was a World War II military veteran but unlike him, a longtime hunter. Connally {{testified that he}} immediately recognized {{the sound of a}} high-powered rifle, then he turned his head and torso rightward, attempting to see President Kennedy behind him. Governor Connally testified he could not see the President, so he then started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left). Connally also testified that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center, he was hit in his upper right back by a bullet he did not hear fired. The doctor who operated on Connally measured <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time he was hit as turned 27 degrees left of center. After Connally was hit he shouted, [...] "Oh, no, no, no.

2500|$|In {{the film}} Lone Survivor (2013), Luttrell was portrayed by actor Mark Wahlberg. Luttrell makes a {{significant}} cameo appearance (uncredited) {{in at least}} three scenes in the film and is present in other scenes, as well. He first appears as one of the SEALs, referred to as [...] "Frankie" [...] by Lt. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), lightheartedly hazing rookie SEAL Shane Patton (Alexander Ludwig) before the mission, jokingly giving Shane his first mission or [...] "op" [...] of cleaning the table, supplemented by knocking over a drink. His second appearance is during the presentation of the rules of engagement for Operation Red Wings where he can be seen shaking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rules governing return fire. [...] This scene is significant. [...] In his book, Lone Survivor, Marcus explains extensively how these rules created substantial risk for the forces in Afghanistan. His third appearance is later in the film as one of the 16 special operators aboard the doomed Chinook helicopter sent to rescue Luttrell and his team. The camera stops on him and several real-life SEALs just before the Taliban's rocket-propelled grenade comes through the open rear bay door and impacts the Chinook's interior, killing everyone aboard. [...] "I {{was on the other side}} of the mountain when those guys came to help me," [...] Luttrell says of his real-life experience, [...] "so getting to die on the helicopter in the movie was a very powerful moment for me." ...|$|E
