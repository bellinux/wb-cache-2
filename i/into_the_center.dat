5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required {{one of the two}} pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} disturbance on August26, noting that {{an area of}} convection had an associated circulation. With favorable conditions, the agency assessed a fair potential for development. On August27, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as tropical depression south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima, although the circulation was exposed from the convection. The next day, the JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 22W about 945km (565mi) northeast of Saipan, after the thunderstorms began wrapping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would become an increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to wrap in the storm after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> On March26, the JMA classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking the system as a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E
5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in the fortress {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E

5|$|In Fairport, NY250 follows South Main Street down a large {{hill that}} levels {{off at the}} {{southern}} edge of the village's business district. Here, NY250 intersects Church Street (NY31F) and passes by the First Baptist Church of Fairport, located on the northwestern corner of the junction. The route continues north <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the village, passing by several small businesses and Fairport Village Landing—the largest shopping plaza in the village—before crossing over the Erie Canal by way of a lift bridge and becoming North Main Street. Once {{on the north side of}} the canal, NY250 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester and West Shore Subdivisions at a single grade crossing ahead of High Street. At this point, the businesses give way to homes as the highway ascends a hill at the north end of the village and meets Whitney Road at the northern village line.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, tens of {{thousands}} of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around Cancún, the Riviera Maya, and Cozumel.

Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of Cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No alcohol was sold in Cancun for 36hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. Two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by Pemex. A German resident was electrocuted while on his roof in Playa del Carmen.|$|E

5|$|A {{subtropical}} ridge {{to the north}} of the cyclone resulted in it continuing generally westward. Deep convection continued to develop over the center of circulation, and the storm steadily strengthened as outflow improved throughout the circulation. By late on December 25, a rainband wrapped tightly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> and it intensified into a severe cyclonic storm as it approached the coast of Sri Lanka. The next day the cyclone developed an eye as it turned west-southwestward. On December 26, the cyclone made landfall on near Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. The JTWC assessed the cyclone as attaining peak winds of 75mph (120km/h). However, the IMD estimated the cyclone reached a maximum intensity of 105mph (165km/h), making it a very severe cyclonic storm. It weakened slightly over land and emerged into the Gulf of Mannar early on December 27 as a tropical storm. Initially, forecasters predicted it to slowly re-intensify; instead it weakened as its convection degraded in organization and intensity. After turning west-northwestward, the storm struck southern India near Kanyakumari on December 28 with winds of 45mph (70km/h), with minimal convection due to land interaction and increased wind shear. It rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land, and its remnants degenerated into a low pressure area after emerging into the eastern Arabian Sea early on December 29.|$|E
