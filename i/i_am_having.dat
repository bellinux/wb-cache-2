2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E

I have been wounded twice now, {{to say nothing of}} being stunned and taken prisoner; so you see <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> my share of bad luck, as well as good. Now at present you have never had as much as a scratch, and when your bad luck comes, it may come all in a lump." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> {{my little}} moment of comfort! These special {{business}} conversations after dinner are {{so bad for}} the digestion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah {{there again}} we are! That's just what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to <b>have</b> made him do; just where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to <b>have</b> {{worked with him}} and helped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We ought, indeed, Mary. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> thanking him, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{standing}} here watching the waves; and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing the same, in the cabin." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> a {{good time}} still. Somehow, though, it isn't as {{exciting}} {{as it used to}} be. I'm afraid I'm very changeable. I believe I must be homesick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look ye," [...] {{returned}} the cook, [...] "I have even waited for this good time sith that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so high. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a grey friar; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a king's archer; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a shipman, and sailed the salt seas; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in greenwood before this, forsooth! {{and shot the}} king's deer. What cometh of it? Naught! <b>I</b> <b>were</b> better to <b>have</b> bided in the cloister. John Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All.--By'r Lady! here they come." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dear Boy was my {{attempt at}} an {{autobiography}} about myself and how lucky <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to <b>have</b> Linda. <b>I</b> never realized how lucky <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to <b>have</b> her until I began writing the song.|$|R
5000|$|About this story, Knight wrote [...] "The Enemy" [...] {{is one of}} {{two stories}} that I wrote when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> some eye trouble and thought I might go blind...Just think, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born blind, <b>I</b> might have written a lot more like this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't {{forget that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> people to dinner to-night. That's all I ask. What {{have you done}} to him, Honora, to put him in such a humour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} did I {{do with that}} umbrella? I had it--no, I didn't. Must have dropped it, I suppose, when that silly ass tried to stop me. By Jove! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> luck!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{a foolish}} thing to say. People here are very kind, {{and you are}} seeing {{a great deal more}} of the world than you would ever see at home. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> a very good time. What do you say, Bell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may go on {{guessing}} that <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{since you}} <b>have</b> begun. But {{do you suppose}} that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> asked you {{to let me go}} and live with him?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Pretty' {{scarcely}} describes them, Barbara," [...] said Billy; [...] "and do {{you know}} that somehow <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> difficulty in imagining them on their knees giving up thanks to the Lord for their rescue--that was your recent idea of 'em, you will recall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{remember}} your words, Fan," [...] he said. [...] "You abused me at Kew Gardens, {{and you think}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> my revenge. You would remember me, you said, only to detest me. Am I less a monster now because I am your relation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You appear," [...] he said drily, [...] "to have discretion. Cultivate it! It {{is a great}} gift. I shall {{look for}} you at eleven o'clock in the morning. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> a large house party this week, and amongst them will be our friends." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} overworked," [...] Brooks answered. [...] "A week or two's holiday is all I require--and that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having.</b> As for the rest," [...] he answered, looking Lord Arranmore in the face, [...] "I am not discouraged. I am not even depressed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{first and}} last, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> a real, {{if not a}} {{particularly}} [...] sagacious, holiday, and {{can take care of}} myself. And next and last, [...] play, I beseech you, the tiny good Samaritan between me and [...] poor, plodding, blinded H. C.--even if he does eventually have to [...] go on to Jericho.|$|E
60|$|George says he {{does not}} think I need trouble myself on the subject. He thinks it is only my over-scrupulous nature that makes me fear <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> more than my due; and that, as a matter of fact, I don’t have half as much as I ought. But I expect he only says this to comfort me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Psha!" [...] said I, modestly, [...] "there is nothing, indeed, to tell. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in love, my dear boy--who <b>has</b> not?--and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> jilted--who <b>has</b> not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very imprudent, indeed. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{thinking}} of that now as I crossed the lawn, and found how dark it <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very imprudent; but I have escaped without much injury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Everything is arranged,' said Mrs. Brown-Smith. 'I, {{guilty and}} {{reckless}} that <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>have</b> only to sacrifice my character, {{and all my}} things. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to retain Methven, my maid. That concession I have won from his chivalry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> several short things type-"writered." [...] I {{will send}} them to you presently. I like the Century and Harper's, but I don't know that I have any {{business}} to object to the Cosmopolitan if they pay as good rates. I suppose a man ought to stick to one magazine, {{but that may be}} only superstition. What do you think? ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{all for the}} best; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>having</b> a heart-breaking {{time over}} DAVID. I have nearly all corrected.
