25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. I admire his ingenuity and address; but <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> his politics.|$|E
500|$|Further {{incidents}} came {{in subsequent}} years. During the 2006 World Championship, Maguire said [...] "I don't {{want to be}} a fat world champion", a reference to Murphy. After beating Murphy in the 2007 Welsh Open, Maguire said of the chalk incident, [...] "That put the icing on the cake, but we've always had a rivalry. <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> him and I think he dislikes me. I try hard to beat everyone, but it would have hurt more if I'd lost to him." [...] Murphy currently leads the head-to-head 12–10.|$|E

6000|$|Judging by the man's {{appearance}} {{it seemed}} impossible. I wondered {{what sort of}} complicated debauch had reduced him to that unspeakable condition. Captain Giles' benevolence was spoiled by a curious air of complacency which <b>I</b> <b>disliked.</b> <b>I</b> said with a little laugh: ...|$|R
500|$|Despite his {{relationships}} with the far right, Icke's New Age beliefs create a division between him and them, according to Barkun. Although Icke regards Christian patriots as the only Americans who understand the New World Order, he also told a Christian patriot group: [...] "I don't know which <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the one you want to replace it with". James Ward argues that Icke's underlying message is hopeful, and that therein lies his appeal: as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, [...] "If we want a world of love and peace, {{we have to be}} loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like." ...|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't know anybody in politics that <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> enough that I would recommend that he {{sit down with the}} mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E
500|$|Vermont Representative Frederick G. Fleetwood {{addressed}} the committee. O'Reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations, and Fleetwood {{stressed the importance}} in American history {{of the events that}} were being commemorated. Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. [...] For one thing, as Massachusetts' Robert M. Leach noted, President Calvin Coolidge was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' Morton D. Hull pointed out, the sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: [...] "I believe we have been going too fast, and I believe at some time we ought to quit it, but <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> quitting on these gentlemen representing the State of Vermont this morning." [...] Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, the magazine's {{photographs}} featured {{those by}} Gordon Parks. [...] "The camera is my weapon against the things <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> {{about the universe}} and how I show the beautiful things about the universe," [...] Parks recalled in 2000. [...] "I didn't care about Life magazine. I cared about the people," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Ishihara {{has often}} been {{critical}} of Japan's foreign policy as being non-assertive. Regarding Japan's relationship with the US, he stated that [...] "The country <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> most in terms of US–Japan ties is Japan, because it's a country that can't assert itself." [...] As part of the criticism, Ishihara published a book co-authored with then-Prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, titled [...] "No" [...] to ieru Ajia – tai Oubei e no hōsaku in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1816 or 1817, James Greenleaf made known {{to his wife}} his desire to return to Washington, D.C., to live full-time. Ann Greenleaf, however, was unwilling to do so. In an 1817 letter to her friend and trustee, William Tilghman, she wrote: [...] "It would be unkind of me to say to Mr. Greenleaf, that I never shall be {{reconciled}} to a residence in Washington, D.C., and I believe {{that he does not}} suspect that such are my sentiments, but I say to you my dear Sir unhesitatingly, that <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> Washington... I love retirement, particularly the retirement of Allentown." [...] Nonetheless, Ann accompanied her husband to the District of Columbia for short periods. They spent Christmas 1821 in the city, and during the winter of 1826 they rented a home (owned by William H. Crawford) on 14th Street NW just north of Thomas Circle. They also spent the summer of 1828 in the city, living at Washington House at 222 North Capitol Street. During the first two decades of the new century, Greenleaf continued to repair many of his personal relationships. By 1830, he had reconciled with most of his family. He spent Christmas 1830 at the Washington home of his brother-in-law, William Cranch. During this stay, he also reunited with Noah Webster {{for the first time in}} years.|$|E

60|$|Enthusiastically I {{went to work}} upon my book, and I {{found that}} talking about my travels to Walkirk helped me to write about them for the public. But a week had not passed when I came to the {{conclusion}} that writing was in no way so pleasant as talking. <b>I</b> <b>disliked</b> labor with the pen; <b>I</b> <b>disliked</b> long sitting at my desk. The composition of the matter was enough for me; some one else should put it on paper. I must have a secretary. I went immediately to Walkirk, who was at the inn, working upon some of my accounts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; not meaning you. <b>I</b> don't <b>dislike</b> you, as {{you know}} very well, though <b>I</b> do <b>dislike</b> {{the fact that you}} should run after these people. I was {{thinking}} of the Longestaffes then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Co-operation is {{difficult}} without community of feeling. I find {{myself to be}} too stubborn-hearted for the place.

As I have travelled up I have almost felt that I could not do it! I did not know before how much <b>I</b> might <b>dislike</b> a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No man {{is bound}} to give {{the reason for his}} dislikes," [...] Hunterleys replied. [...] "Of your wife I know nothing. Nobody does. I have every sympathy with her unfortunate condition, and that is all. You {{personally}} <b>I</b> <b>dislike.</b> <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> my wife to be seen with you, <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> having her name associated with yours in any manner whatsoever. <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> sitting with you here myself. I only hope that the five minutes' conversation which you have asked for will not be exceeded." ...|$|E

But I have not come into this corner to talk nonsense," [...] she went on. [...] "You must not think I always do, eh?" ...|$|E

60|$|This point, however, is not {{essential}} to my book. All I have to urge between these two boards is that <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> the big Whiteley shop, and that <b>I</b> <b>dislike</b> Socialism because it will (according to Socialists) be so like that shop. It is its fulfilment, not its reversal. I do not object to Socialism because it will revolutionize our commerce, but because it will leave it so horribly the same.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{look upon}} it as {{so very much}} right that I couldn't bear the idea of any other than sympathetic, respectful eyes resting on you. <b>I</b> <b>disliked</b> and mistrusted these fellows from the first. Didn't you understand?" ...|$|R
