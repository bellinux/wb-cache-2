40|$|AbstractEndometriosis is the {{presence}} of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus. It is common in women of childbearing age, and is frequently located in the pelvic cavity. Approximately 10 % of endometriosis cases occur in extrapelvic locations. However there are few reports of gastric wall endometriosis. Here, we report a rare case of endometriosis in postmenopausal woman. The patient presented with epigastric pain. The investigations included ultrasound (US) and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) where she was diagnosed with gastric wall neoplasm. She underwent surgery where the mass was excised. The histopathological <b>examination</b> surprisingly <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the diagnosis of gastric wall endometriosis...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of a 52-year-old woman, the first {{symptoms}} of phantosmia reported appeared to the woman as an increased sense of smell. She believed {{to have the ability to}} detect odors before other people, and with better accuracy. She later began to experience the typical symptoms of phantosmia and would smell things that she could recognize in the absence of any odor producing molecules. The reported smells were of perfumes, candles, and fruits, however the woman could not accurately identify what type of perfume or fruit she was smelling. Her phantosmia episodes would occur abruptly and would last from minutes to half an hour. A rhinologic <b>examination</b> <b>came</b> back <b>with</b> normal results. When her phantosmia symptoms began to dissipate, she began to complain of clumsiness, slowness, and problems with her left hand that would alternate between tremors and rigidity. A neurologic examination revealed symptoms of Parkinson's disease.|$|R

40|$|A histopathological {{examination}} {{consists of two}} distinct phases: observation and interpretation. As a rule, macro- and microscopical examination give strong diagnostic indicators and the diagnosis is made instantaneously: the two phases are strongly interwoven. Also, the clinical context often provides essential clues as to the final diagnosis. A request for a pathology <b>examination</b> must hence <b>come</b> <b>with</b> clinical informations and a specific question. Yet, the pathologist has {{to keep in mind}} that the interpretation of what he sees might follow too enthusiastically the proposed clinical diagnosis. It is hence preferable for the pathologist to take note of the clinical context only after the microscopic examination has been accomplishe...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAlthough {{very late}} stent {{thrombosis}} after drug-eluting stent implantation {{is a critical}} event, its cause has not been clarified. This is the first report of a case with very late stent thrombosis after drug-eluting stent implantation for which prior angioscopic image of the culprit lesion is available. A 54 -year-old Japanese male patient with stable angina who received implantation of sirolimus-eluting stent at the culprit lesion and 1 -year follow-up angiographic and angioscopic <b>examinations</b> <b>came</b> back <b>with</b> chest pain at rest at 2. 5 years after the stent implantation. Very late stent thrombosis was diagnosed by emergent angiographic and angioscopic examinations and was treated by zotarolimus-eluting stent. One-year angiographic and angioscopic follow-up examinations after zotarolimus-eluting stent were performed. Angioscopy revealed uncovered stent strut, yellow plaques, and thrombus at 1 -year follow-up after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation, and it confirmed the thrombotic occlusion inside the sirolimus-eluting stent {{at the time of}} emergent catheterization. This is a case of very late stent thrombosis in the drug-eluting stent where uncovered stent strut, yellow plaques, and thrombus had been detected by angioscopy 1. 5 years before the onset. Those thrombogenic sources might be the cause of stent thrombosis...|$|R

A garden lad standing {{on the top of the}} kitchen steps clipping Doctor Winkles' hedge saw him in this unfrequented corner, and found him and his occupation sufficiently inexplicable and interesting to watch him pretty closely.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, {{although}} the Van Herick offers {{a quick and}} simple alternative to gonioscopy <b>examinations,</b> it also <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> limitations to its results. Principally, it has been deduced that measurements performed at the nasal limbus tend to overestimate the angle width. Moreover, {{although the}} technique relies on the subjective assessment of the observed structures, {{it has been found}} that the results are not easily replicated and there was a high level of variability depending on the perception of the examiner. The technique also may be considered of inadequate scope, as it only provides an estimate of the anterior chamber angle (ACA) at the temporal limbus, in contrast with gonioscopy, which allows for a 360 degree view of the anterior chamber. Furthermore, the Van Herick technique {{has been found to be}} exceedingly sensitive to the positioning of the direct slit-lamp beam whereby a 10 degrees deviation from the perpendicular direction was found to be critical to the results and measurements.|$|R

40|$|Voiding urosonography (VUS) {{encompasses}} {{examination of}} the urinary tract with intravesical administration of US contrast agent (UCA) for diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The real breakthrough for US <b>examination</b> of VUR <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the availability of stabilized UCAs in the mid- 1990 s. This article presents {{a comprehensive review of}} various procedural aspects of VUS. Different US modalities are available for detecting the echogenic microbubbles: fundamental mode, colour Doppler US, harmonic imaging and dedicated contrast imaging with multiple display options. The reflux is graded (1 to 5) in a similar manner to the system used in voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The most commonly used UCA for VUS, Levovist, is galactose-based and contains air-filled microbubbles. The recommended concentration is 300  mg/ml at a dose of 5 – 10 %, or less than 5 %, of the bladder filling volume when using fundamental or harmonic imaging modes, respectively. There are preliminary reports of VUS using a second-generation UCA, SonoVue. Here the UCA volume is less than 1 % of the bladder filling volume. There is no specific contraindication to intravesical administration of UCA. The safety profile of intravesical Levovist is very high with no reports of side effects over a decade of use in VUS...|$|R
