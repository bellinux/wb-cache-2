40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the role of {{industry}} sub-sectors of agriculture and <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> processing in Bandar Lampung on the theory of the economic base. The data used were secondary data from various institutions which was analyzed by analytical tools of location quotient (LQ), and the multiplier effect. The research results showed that the manufacture as sub-sectors of agriculture and forestry in Bandar Lampung has a value of LQ > 1 in which average was 1. 3654 (Base). The role of the industry sub-sectors of agriculture and <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> processing in Bandar Lampung was in the economic base region. Any change in the average income of Rp 1, the subsector of agriculture and <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> processing could increase the total revenue of Rp 5. 90.

To achieve this research objective, firstly, the proportion of forestry ODA allocation by recipient continents was compared between Korea and OECD/DAC (The organization for Economic co–operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee) through OECD statistic data. Secondly, factors which may affect KFOA were analyzed. Distances, status of bilateral forestry cooperation, amount of <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> import & export, corruption index, forest area, forest conversion rate, GDP per capital, and income level of each 24 recipient country were selected as possible factors. Bilateral forest cooperation turned out the most determinant factor among the others in this study. Ninety percent of Korean forestry ODA amount from 2006 – 2011 was allocated to 4 countries with bilateral forestry cooperation which were Mongolia, China, Indonesia, and Philippine. And 98 %, 0. 4 % of Korean forestry ODA was given to Asia and Africa, respectively while OECD/DAC constantly increased forestry ODA for Africa by 26 % during 1999 – 2011.

The system-regeneration approach is used as a methodological tool, which is the combination of principles and analysis of the forest sector as a complicated social-economical system based on the methodology of the regeneration process. On the basis of objective economic laws and regulations, a political-economic analysis is carried out to find out the system interrelation of the quality of forest resource use and productivity of social labour in the forest sector.

30|$|It is not {{straightforward}} to solely {{consider the}} effects of discount rates {{for the management of}} natural resources, as there may be strong ecological, ethical and political pressures to conserve the resources (Heal 2000). However, a discount rate of 1 % is very low for a competitive industry, such as forestry (if the complicating aspects are neglected). In this context, stands that have a negative SEV at a discount rate of 5 % should not be considered as profitable forestry areas. However, large Japanese timber mills require immense amounts of harvested timber for processing to remain profitable. Failure to provide enough raw material to meet these mills’ operational demands would severely impair Japanese forestry and associated businesses. Therefore, if the mills are highly profitable, it may be worthwhile, from an economic perspective, to harvest forest stands with slightly negative SEV (via appropriate redistribution of profits) to maintain <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> supply chains. Another complicating factor is that according to current national forest management plans, more than 30 % of the total clear-cut area in Japan should no longer be maintained as planted forests (Forestry Agency 2014) but regenerated as natural stands, such as mixed hardwood forests. However, such stands should also be predominantly in areas with low profitability (and hence strongly negative SEV and poor fertility).|$|E

40|$|Saproxylic {{organisms are}} among the most {{threatened}} species in Europe and constitute a major conservation problem because they depend on the most important <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> - dead wood. Diversity of fungal and bryophyte communities occurring on dead beech trees was analyzed in five European countries (Slovenia, Hungary, The Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark) considering tree level species richness (TLSR), country level species richness (CLSR), frequency distributions of species, occurrence of threatened species and relations between TLSR and decay stage, tree size and countries. Altogether 1009 trees were inventoried in 19 beech dominated forest reserves. The number of fungi in the full dataset was approximately three times larger (456 versus 161 species) and the proportion of low frequent species was higher than among bryophytes. The species richness of bryophytes and fungi was significantly different among countries considering both TLSR and CLSR. In addition the diversity patterns deviated considerably between the two groups of organisms. Slovenian sites appeared to be biodiversity hotspots for bryophytes characterized by high TLSR and CLSR and a high fraction of threatened species. Hungarian sites had somewhat lower bryophyte diversity, while the Atlantic region had deteriorated assemblages. Fungal species richness was very high in Denmark, but the Hungarian and Slovenian sites were richer in threatened and low frequency species. Tree size was better able to explain variation in TLSR in both organism groups than decay stage. TLSR was found to vary significantly between countries but the difference was most considerable! in the case of bryophytes. The diversity patterns of both organism groups along the investigated geographical gradient appear to be influenced by both climatic and management related factors (forest history, dead wood availability and continuity, habitat fragmentation). There is no doubt that an increase in the abundance of dead wood in European beech forests will benefit diversity of saproxylic fungi and bryophytes, especially if a continuous presence of large diameter logs are secured within individual stands...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Innovations play an {{important}} role in multifunctional forestry due to changing demands for forest goods and services. The multifunctionality can be a result of a joint provision of several outputs from individual forest holding or specialized forest activities. The goal of this paper is to make a comparative analysis from data obtained in two surveys in 2002 and 2010 related to innovations in forest enterprises. The main focus was on ownership, size, and management strategy of forest. Materials and Methods: The paper presents the results of two surveys on innovation in the years 2002 and 2010 with more than 250 representatives - owners/managers of Slovak forest enterprises. The questionnaire in 2002 was sent out by regular mail in the random sample of 1072 forest owners and managers. The response rate was 25 % (in total 279 respondents). The response rate in 2010 was 37 %, and the number of valid responses was 254. The willingness of forest managers to implement innovation was evaluated in the context of different sizes of forest holdings, management strategies and property conditions. Log linear statistics models (Pearson Chi-square) were applied using the software Statistica for data analysis and Microsoft Excel to present the results. Results: This paper presents the development of innovations in order to reach the multifunctionality on the case of Slovakian <b>forestry.</b> <b>Product</b> innovations have doubled from 17 % in 2002 to 34 % in 2010. Large-sized holdings are significantly (p < 0. 01) more engaged in innovation and are offering new products. The highest overall innovation activity is revealed in the state-owned enterprises, intermediary in the municipal forests, and the lowest in the private holdings. Forest managers who realized the benefits of innovation were “profit increasing” oriented. Forest managers who did not realize the benefits of implementing innovations preferred conservative management goals - the capital maintenance. The innovative behaviour of managers depends significantly on forest managers’ goals and their strategy (p < 0. 05). The comparison between the two periods shows that innovation activity has increased from technological innovation to products and services. Wood still remains the main product of forest holdings, but compared to 2002, the importance of bio energy becomes visible. Conclusions: Results show that innovation activity has increased during the time. There was a shift towards innovation from 2002 to 2010 which is visible in the successful innovation cases...|$|E
40|$|Oleoresin is a <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> {{of special}} {{economic}} value. Its components {{are very important}} for industrial use. Oleoresin is produced by various coniferous trees around the world. In Greece, Allepo, Brutia and Black pine have been occasionally tapped, with Allepo pine being the most productive of the three species. Oleoresin yield varies widely among Allepo pine (Pinus halepensis) trees. While the average yield of Greek Aleppo pine is 2. 7 kg/year, there are individuals yielding more than 12 kg/year. The primary aim {{of the present study}} was to locate high yielding oleoresin trees in the areas of Cassandra (Chalkidiki) and Kirunthos (Euboia). In Chalkidiki 22 plus trees with average yield of about 18 kg/year were located, whereas in Euboia 11 plus trees were located yielding 24 kg/year. Moreover, in each region individuals yielding less than 2 kg/year were located (control trees). From the selected trees, oleoresin and cones were sampled in order to analyse the qualitative and quantitative composition of oleoresin and to identify the selected trees with isozyme markers. A GC-MS (Gas Chromatograph – Mass Spectrometer) was used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the oleoresin. All together 40 compounds were identified: 11 (35. 12 %) monoterpenes, 12 (1. 40 %) sesquiterpenes and 17 (63. 50 %) diterpenes. The main compounds are the following diterpenes, methyl abietate & abietic acid (39. 06 %), palustric acid (9. 47 %), isopimaric acid (5. 64 %), neoabietic acid (5. 14 %) and the monoterpene α-pinene (32. 93 %). The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, was performed to test for differences between the mean concentration of the compounds, indicated that 10 compounds differentiate plus from control trees, whereas 14 compounds differentiate Chalkidiki from Euboia trees. The step-wise discriminant analysis was also carried out for the same data and three compounds (γ-terpinene, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and dehydroabietic acid) were found to classify trees according to their grouping (plus and control trees in Chalkidiki and Euboia). The total correct classification result was 72. 5 %. Moreover, 47 significant correlations (r> 0. 80) among 21 compounds were found. Most of them were found among 12 sesquiterpenes. Isozyme analysis of endosperms was carried out using starch gel electrophoresis. Thirteen enzyme systems were tested. Eleven of them gave clear resolution results with 17 gene loci, 13 of which were polymorphic (P= 73. 53 %). Totally, 33 alleles were found, the mean allele number was A= 1. 853 and the mean effective number was #e= 1. 395. The mean observed heterozygosity (H o) was 0. 255, the mean expected heterozygosity (H e) was 0. 244, the genetic variability (DST) between the two populations was 0. 012 and GST was 0. 041. The selected trees were successfully identified with isozymes. From a total of 49 trees, 49 different genotypes were found using 13 polymorphic gene loci. Statistical significant differences in the frequencies of four gene loci (IDH-B, LAP, β-EST και ACP-B) were found between the two populations, Chalkidiki and Euboia. Moreover, allele β-EST- 1 was found at a very high frequency only within Chalkidiki trees. No statistical significant differences were found between the allele frequencies of plus and control trees which implies that there is no relation between the 13 gene loci assayed and oleoresin yield. Conclusively, it could be said that the results are quite encouraging for the “rebirth” of oleoresin tapping in Greece. Clonal tests should follow in order to specify which of the selected phenotypes are indeed the best genotypes. Moreover, progenies of the selected trees are expected to have higher oleoresin yield. Finally, selection of high yielding oleoresin trees from other Greek territories should follow in the future. ...|$|E
