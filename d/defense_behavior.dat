25|$|Male E. imperialis {{have been}} {{observed}} to occasionally form aggregations of territories considered to be leks. These aggregations typically occur at sites {{in which they can}} collect aromatic materials; however, females almost never approach these aggregations. It is also important to note that although leks are formed, they are only facultative for this species (the more suitable sites, the greater the number of habitable territories). Since these territories are aggregated, females have a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate with in the aggregation. Territorial behavior of male E. imperialis consists of two primary components: displaying on the perch and patrolling its territory. During display, the male ‘stands’ on the perch with its head pointed up, and touching the trunk of the tree with its mandibles closed. Only the fore and hind legs touch the tree trunk, in which the forelegs bend and are held besides the head, whereas the hind-legs are held straight away from the body. During its display, the male would also ‘hop’ on-and-off the tree, about 2cm from the perch, accompanied by a loud buzzing sound. Shortly after displaying, the male then engages in patrol behavior, flying an irregular elliptical path around its territory. This cycle of displaying and patrolling repeats continuously as long as the male remains in its territory and is undisturbed by intruding males. Male E. imperialis are considered to have two types of territories: ‘primary territories’ and ‘secondary territories’. In primary territories, they are almost always defended by males, and is the site for all male-male confrontations. In secondary territories, they are defended for only 1 to 2 hours a day. Secondary territories often serve as a transitional territory for males attempting to move into primary territories by challenging the resident males. Weather also plays a significant role in territorial <b>defense</b> <b>behavior,</b> such that in heavy rain, males would often abandon their territories {{for the rest of the}} day. On dark, overcast days, there is also little to no activity.|$|E

40|$|Predator-prey {{relationships}} between sympatric species allow {{the evolution of}} <b>defense</b> <b>behaviors,</b> such as honeybee colonies defending their nests against predatory wasps. We investigated the predator-prey relationship between the honeybee (Apis mellifera ligustica) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica) by evaluating the effectiveness of attack and <b>defense</b> <b>behaviors,</b> which have coevolved in these sympatric species, {{as well as the}} actual damage and disturbance caused to the colonies under attack. Attack and <b>defense</b> <b>behaviors</b> were recorded in front of the hive to observe attacks at the hive entrance (68 attacks in 279 h) and at ground level on isolated and weakened honeybees close to the hive (465 attacks in 32 h). We found that V. germanica attacked the hive entrance infrequently due to the low success rate of this strategy and instead preferred a specialized attack method targeting adult honeybees at ground level, demonstrating opportunistic scavenger behavior. Individual honeybees usually responded effectively to an attack by recruiting an average of two nestmates, causing the wasp to flee, whereas collective balling behavior was only observed on four occasions. V. germanica does not appear to disrupt the foraging activity of the colonies under attack. We found that agonistic events supported by other nestmates were typically the most intense ones, involving physical combat and prolonged attacks {{at the entrance to the}} hive. These observations support the hypothesis that A. mellifera ligustica can adapt its behavior to match the severity of the threat and the context of the attack...|$|R

50|$|It {{is crucial}} for B. occidentalis to {{maintain}} high levels of nectar for their colony.

This is thought to be a more passive defense than an active one, since the presence of the adults in this formation is in and of itself a deterrent to parasites and predators.

50|$|The <b>defense</b> <b>behavior</b> of {{daffodil}} cichlids {{has been}} shown to be linked to androgens, specifically the defense of their young. Dominant female breeders perform the most care and also display the highest levels of plasma testosterone compared to other individuals within the social group. Dominant male breeders provide a similar amount of care as the subordinate helpers, but breeding males also have the highest levels of 11-ketotestosterone, an important fish androgen. Breeders have higher levels of both androgens compared to helpers, but no matter what the sex or status of the fish, there is a weak but significant positive correlation between testosterone levels and the frequency of care. Androgens may promote defense of young, which contradicts the commonly reported trade-off between androgen levels and degree of parental care (androgen levels and degree of parental care are usually negatively correlated).|$|E
50|$|Ants {{are a major}} {{predator}} of {{the species}} M. genalis. When the ant of the species Ectatomma tuberculatum was exposed {{to the entrance of}} Megalopta genalis nest, a bee would try to guard the entrance with its abdomen, and the ant would usually retreat, as it was smaller in size than the bee. When the bee encountered larger ants, such as those of the genus Camponotus, they would bite and sting the ant, until they retreated. If this did not work, female worker bees would push out the ant with its abdomen. In contrast, with smaller ants of the genus Crematogaster they would bite and sting the ant until they died. While social colonies may be beneficial in this <b>defense</b> <b>behavior,</b> it is not necessary because of the initial guarding of the constricted entrance to the nest that a solitary female could do alone.|$|E

In the year of high predation risk, however, the rates of intrusion for aggressive gulls (4 %) and for non-aggressive gulls with an aggressive neighbor (37 %) were significantly lower than for non-aggressive gulls without an aggressive neighbor (76 %).

40|$|SummaryInnate <b>defense</b> <b>behaviors</b> (IDBs) {{evoked by}} {{threatening}} sensory stimuli {{are essential for}} animal survival. Although subcortical circuits are implicated in IDBs, it remains largely unclear whether sensory cortex modulates IDBs and what the underlying neural pathways are. Here, we show that optogenetic silencing of corticotectal projections from layer 5 (L 5) of the mouse primary visual cortex (V 1) to the superior colliculus (SC) significantly reduces an SC-dependent innate behavior (i. e., temporary suspension of locomotion upon a sudden flash of light as short as milliseconds). Surprisingly, optogenetic activation of SC-projecting neurons in V 1 or their axon terminals in SC sufficiently elicits the behavior, in contrast to other major L 5 corticofugal projections. Thus, via the same corticofugal projection, visual cortex not only modulates the light-induced arrest behavior, but also can directly drive the behavior. Our results suggest that sensory cortex may play a previously unrecognized role in the top-down initiation of sensory-motor behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Neonatal Intensive Care Units have {{experienced}} profound {{advances in technology}} and treatment modalities {{over the last two}} decades. Infants born at the edge of viability are now surviving despite prolonged hospitalizations. These infants born preterm are prone to a high degree of stress from life sustaining and routine interventions. Much focus has been directed toward addressing noxious environmental factors such as noise, light, and infectious disease; however, little has been done to examine the stress experienced by the professional caregiver who work in these environments. Environmental press theory, which focuses on the interplay between human beings and their surroundings, is explored as a way to provide insight into understanding and mitigating the stress experienced by health care providers working in the newborn intensive care. A proposal for a research study with a cross-over design was approved to study the effect of “four handed care” on infants’ physiologic responses (oxygenation, heart rate, and stress) and behavioral responses (state, stress and defense, self-regulatory and approach behaviors) to and recovery from endotracheal suctioning when compared to routine care. Results of this study demonstrated no significant differences were noted when heart rate (HR) or oxygen saturation (SpO 2) taken at baseline were compared to HR and SpO 2 obtained during and after suctioning while in the routine care condition. In the four-handed care condition, mean SpO 2 increased from pre-observation 95. 49 to during observation saturation 97. 75 (p = 0. 001). Salivary cortisol did not differ between groups at baseline or post-suctioning. There {{was no significant difference in}} behavior state between the two conditions at any time point.

There was no statistical difference in the number of monitor call-backs post-suctioning. In conclusion, four-handed care during suctioning was associated with a decrease in stress and <b>defense</b> <b>behaviors</b> and an increase in self-regulatory behaviors. These findings, while based on a small sample, provide modest evidence that the four-handed care intervention for suctioning should receive further testing.
