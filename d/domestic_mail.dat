25|$|The Army Postal Service (APS), {{functions}} as a government-operated military mail system in India. A primary feature of Army Postal Service systems is that normally they are subsidized to ensure that military mail posted between duty stations abroad and the home country (or vice versa) does not cost the sender any more than normal <b>domestic</b> <b>mail</b> traffic. In some cases, Indian military personnel in a combat zone may post letters and/or packages to the home country for free, while in others, senders located in a specific overseas area may send military mail to another military recipient, also located in the same overseas area, without charge.|$|E

There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and <b>domestic</b> <b>mail</b> from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E

5|$|The great {{influx of}} bullion from the California Gold Rush and other finds caused {{the price of}} silver {{relative}} to gold to increase starting in 1848, and silver coins were hoarded or exported for melting. In 1851, a bill for a three-cent piece in 75% silver and 25% copper was introduced in Congress by New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson, who wanted to lower postage rates from five to three cents. This percentage of silver was less than the normal 90% so that the coins would circulate {{at a time of}} hoarding. The copper large cent did not circulate in the Pacific Coast region or South due to prejudice against coins that did not contain precious metal, and some means of allowing the purchase of a postage stamp without the use of copper cents was necessary. Dickinson's bill passed on March 3, 1851, and in addition to authorizing the new three-cent silver, lowered rates for most <b>domestic</b> <b>mails.</b> By 1854, the imbalance had abated, and Congress increased the silver content of the three-cent piece to the standard 90% for silver coins, though its weight was reduced.|$|R
