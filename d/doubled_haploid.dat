40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate efficiency of anther cul-ture in the production of spontaneous <b>double</b> <b>haploids</b> from randomly selected heterozygous genotypes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Anthers of 20 F 1 wheat combinations were grown in vitro on a modified Potato- 2 medium. All of the examined genotypes have shown the ability to produce pollen calluses as well as to regenerate green plants. On average for the whole experiment material, 47. 2 cal-luses were produced per 100 cultured anthers. The green plant regeneration ranged from 0. 8 to 13. 4 green plants per spike, with an overall mean of 5. 8. From the total of 582 regene-rated green plants, 47. 9 % (279) were spontaneous <b>double</b> <b>haploids.</b> The final average yield from the study was 2. 8 <b>double</b> <b>haploids</b> per spike.

40|$|Anther {{culture is}} an {{important}} technique to generate <b>double</b> <b>haploid</b> plants. <b>Doubled</b> <b>haploids</b> would help to produce homozygous lines in single step which accelerates the breeding programmes.

For culture initiation it is necessary to select florets and anthers with appropriate developmental stage of microspore development. The optimal stage for pearl millet anther culture development {{has been found to be}} when the microspores are uninucleate with the nucleus in the center and when the spike is still enclosed in the flag leaf sheath. The growth of the donor plants and developmental stage of microspores have been important factors in the intiation of anther cultures. The present study aims to assess the effect of different factors such as growth hormones, media, pretreatments on the induction of androgenesis (division of microspores) and to develop a suitable protocol for producing embryoids of pearl millet in vitro using floret and anther culture...|$|R
50|$|The term “dihaploid” {{was coined}} by Bender to combine {{in one word}} the number of genome copies (diploid) and their origin (haploid).

25|$|Genetic {{maps are}} very {{important}} to understand the structure and organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also provide a framework for the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic mapping for species in which DHs are readily available. <b>Doubled</b> <b>haploid</b> populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations {{played a major role in}} facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species.|$|E
25|$|In {{backcross}} conversion, {{genes are}} introgressed from a donor cultivar or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated backcrossing. A {{problem in this}} procedure {{is being able to}} identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each backcross. The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted backcross conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and molecular marker provides the short cut. In the back cross generation one itself a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous <b>doubled</b> <b>haploid</b> genotype. Chen et al. (1994) used marker assisted backcross conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe rust resistant lines in barley.|$|E

40|$|Oilseed {{rape and}} other crop plants {{of the family}} Brassicaceae contain a unique defence system known as the glucosinolate–myrosinase system or the ‘mustard oil bomb’. The ‘mustard oil bomb’ which {{includes}} myrosinase and glucosinolates is triggered by abiotic and biotic stress, resulting {{in the formation of}} toxic products such as nitriles and isothiocyanates. Myrosinase is present in specialist cells known as ‘myrosin cells’ and can also be known as toxic mines. The myrosin cell idioblasts of Brassica napus were genetically reprogrammed to undergo controlled cell death (ablation) during seed development. These myrosin cell-free plants have been named MINELESS as they lack toxic mines. This has led to the production of oilseed rape with a significant reduction both in myrosinase levels and in the hydrolysis of glucosinolates. Even though the myrosinase activity in MINELESS was very low compared with the wild type, variation was observed. This variability was overcome by producing homozygous seeds. A microspore culture technique involving non-fertile haploid MINELESS plants was developed and these plants were treated with colchicine to produce <b>double</b> <b>haploid</b> MINELESS plants with full fertility. <b>Double</b> <b>haploid</b> MINELESS plants had significantly reduced myrosinase levels and glucosinolate hydrolysis products.

The characteristics of the pure <b>double</b> <b>haploid</b> MINELESS plant are described and its importance for future biochemical, agricultural, dietary, functional genomics, and plant defence studies is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Progress made {{around the}} in situ {{gynogenesis}} technique allows production {{in a great}} number of maize (Zea mays L.) doubled-haploid (DH) lines. <b>Doubled</b> <b>haploids</b> are now largely used in maize breeding. To optimize their use in breeding schemes, it is first required to know whether genetic variation expressed at the level of DH lines is the same as at the level of lines from self-fertilization. In several experiments, with evaluation for testcross performance, good agreement appears between variance expressed in selfed progenies and DH variance for grain yield. Recurrent selection (RS) for testcross performance using <b>doubled</b> <b>haploids</b> (DH-RS) can then be compared to the use of S n (S n T) plants (S 0, S 1, S 2, …). From a theoretical approach by numerical application, it was shown that, with the same selection intensity and without off-season nurseries, DH-RS in four years gives the highest genetic advance per year. With the use of off-season nurseries, the same investment in trials and the same rate of reduction of effective population size, to have the advantage of DH-RS the cycle length must be reduced to three years and for traits of low heritability. In an experiment comparing two cycles of RS-S 0 T selection in four years to one cycle of DH-RS (in three or four years), considering the expected gain per year with a DH-RS cycle in four years, there was an advantage to RS-S 0 T, whereas with a three-year cycle for the DH method both methods were expected to be equivalent. The observed genetic gains were similar for one DH-RS cycle and the two RS-S 0 T cycles in four years. In conclusion, there is not a greater advantage from using <b>doubled</b> <b>haploids</b> in RS. However, DH-RS has the advantage of simultaneously producing lines that are directly usable as parents of a hybrid. From a theoretical approach, it is shown that DH-RS {{is expected to be the}} best method at the level of genetic advance in variety development, even for medium heritabilities. Furthermore, the whole process appears to be less costly than conventional methods. Use of <b>doubled</b> <b>haploids</b> can thus be very efficient in maize breeding...|$|R
