The relationships between parental essentialist perceptions, gender ideology, fathers' role attitudes, and {{various forms of}} involvement <b>in</b> <b>child</b> care were examined. Two hundred and nine couples with 6 to 36 -month-old children completed extensive questionnaires.

5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane <b>in</b> <b>children</b> and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures <b>in</b> <b>children</b> in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E

The authors explore this decline in detail and document the heterogeneity across households in both levels of <b>child</b> labor and <b>in</b> {{the incidence of}} this decline <b>in</b> <b>child</b> labor. Theauthors find {{a strong correlation between}} living standards improvements and child labor so that much of the variation <b>in</b> declines <b>in</b> <b>child</b> labor can be explained by variation in living standards improvements. Ethnic minority children and the children of recent migrants appear to remain particularly vulnerable even by the late 1990 s. Children of all ethnicities in the Central Highlands appear to have missed many of the improvements in the 1990 s, while <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the rural Mekong and in Provincial Towns have experienced the largest declines <b>in</b> <b>child</b> labor. The results suggest embedding efforts against child labor within an overall antipoverty program. The authors find that the opening or closing of household enterprises seems to be associated with increases <b>in</b> <b>child</b> labor. So attention should be devoted to the activities of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the government's current program to stimulate nonfarm enterprises.

5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used <b>in</b> <b>children</b> are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity <b>in</b> <b>children</b> have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group.
