40|$|Introduction. The Health Centre of Novi Sad deals {{primarily}} with prevention, but also provides curative health care. This paper {{was aimed at}} investigating trends {{in the use of}} injection drugs in out-patients visiting this institution in the period from 2005 to 2009. Material and Methods. The use of injection drugs was calculated according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical/Defined <b>Daily</b> <b>Doses</b> methodology. The results were expressed as the number of defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> per 1000 inhabitants/day. Results and Discussion. The total use of injection drugs was 21. 2696 defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> / 1000 inhabitants/day in 2005, 31. 8427 defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> / 1000 inhabitants/day in 2006, 36. 0633 defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> / 1000 inhabitants/ day in 2007, 34. 4823 defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> / 1000 inhabitants/ day in 2008 and 26. 2189 defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> / 1000 inhabitants/ day in 2009. The drug with the highest number of defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> was hydroxocobolamin during all five years (accounting for about 90 % {{of the total number of}} defined <b>daily</b> <b>doses).</b> In the observed period, the use of low molecular weight heparins increased from 0. 0599 in 2005 to 0. 2705 in 2009. The use of anti-infective drugs decreased from 0. 6133 in 2005 to 0. 2634 in 2009. A change in the structure of use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was observed. Conclusion. The total use of injections in the observed period showed annual oscillations. The trend of use of low molecular weight heparins and the qualitative change in use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was in accordance with the trend and the use in developed countries, while the use of hydroxocobolamin and gentamicin increased. The promotion of oral medications and the reduced prescription of injection drugs are the possibilities to be taken into consideration, especially in the use of hydroxocobolamin...|$|R

40|$|Background: With rising {{reports of}} {{antimicrobial}} resistance in outpatient communities, surveillance of antimicrobial use is imperative for supporting stewardship programs. The primary {{objective of this}} article is to assess the levels of antimicrobial use in Canada over time. Methods: Canadian antimicrobial use data from 1995 to 2010 were acquired and assessed by four metrics: population-adjusted prescriptions, Defined <b>Daily</b> <b>Doses,</b> spending on antimicrobials (inflation-adjusted), and average Defined <b>Daily</b> <b>Doses</b> per prescription. Linear mixed models were built to assess significant differences among years and antimicrobial groups, and to account for repeated measurements over time. Measures were also compared to published reports from European countries. Results: Temporal trends in antimicrobial use in Canada vary by metric and antimicrobial grouping. Overall reductions were seen for inflation-adjusted spending, population-adjusted prescription rates and Defined <b>Daily</b> <b>Doses,</b> and increases were observed for the average number of Defined <b>Daily</b> <b>Doses</b> per prescription. The population-adjusted prescription and Defined <b>Daily</b> <b>Doses</b> values for 2009 were comparable to those reported by many European countries, while the averag...|$|R

This <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years.

5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

40|$|For {{a typical}} space-borne {{algorithm}} for {{the estimation of}} surface UV-B <b>daily</b> <b>doses,</b> the implications of a limited temporal sampling of cloud properties and of the neglect of three-dimensional radiative effects are addressed. By means of six synthetic diurnal cloud cycles, different temporal samplings of cloud properties have been investigated, while surface and atmospheric properties have been kept constant. The results have been compared with benchmark calculations of the <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> using a 15 min time step. The neglect of the horizontal photon transport imposes limitations to the estimation of <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> since it leads to statistical uncertainties up to 25 % and biases ranging from 3 % to 9 %.

About {{a third of the}} 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy - a <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, they could go back to an aromatase inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation.

In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years. PET (positron emission tomography) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).|$|E

Whether patients will prefer weekly <b>dosing</b> to <b>daily</b> <b>dosing</b> for a chronic condition such as osteoporosis has not been studied. The aim of this international study was to assess preference for the weekly or <b>daily</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen of alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods: This randomised open-label crossover study was conducted at 45 study sites in 19 countries. Four hundred and six postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were assigned randomly to treatment with either alendronate 70 mg once weekly for 4 weeks followed by alendronate 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks or vice versa. The main outcome was the responses of the participants to the Dosing Regimen Questionnaire administered {{at the end of the}} study. Results: Of the participants expressing a preference, 84 % preferred the once weekly dosing regimen with alendronate to the once <b>daily</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen. In addition, the once weekly regimen was considered by 87 % of the participants to be more convenient and was the regimen most of the participants (84 %) would be more willing to take for a long period of time (P< 0. 001 for each parameter). Conclusions: The majority of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis preferred the once weekly to the once <b>daily</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen of alendronate.
