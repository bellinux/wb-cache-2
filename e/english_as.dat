5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean <b>English</b> <b>as</b> well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates Japanese EFL teachers' {{perceptions}} of regional varieties of English, which are designated as either the Outer Circle or the Expanding Circle by Kachru (1985), {{and their potential}} place in EFL teaching in Japan. Participants were 36 teachers at junior high and elementary schools and 28 undergraduates in a TEFL certificate program. Data collection was completed {{with the use of}} two Likert-scale questionnaires: one involving a task in listening to various English varieties, and the other asking about beliefs about the English language in general and {{perceptions of}} nonnative/nonstandard <b>Englishes</b> <b>as</b> opposed to the two major varieties in ELT in Japan: American and British English. In addition, oral interviews were conducted with several participants and their assistant language teachers (ALTs). The findings suggested that in-service teachers showed more ambivalent attitudes toward nonnative varieties than student-teachers did; although the teachers acknowledged potential benefits of nonnative Englishes for the future use of EIL, they showed hesitation in regarding different <b>Englishes</b> <b>as</b> instructional models to be exposed to students. However, the study also showed participants' interest in introducing other <b>Englishes</b> <b>as</b> awareness-raising models. The possibility of inclusion of nonnative varieties was further discussed...|$|R
