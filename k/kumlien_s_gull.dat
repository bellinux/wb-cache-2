40|$|This {{winter was}} pretty much a rerun of last, {{although}} perhaps not as severe; I could have used last winter 2 ̆ 7 s Introduction again. If there was an overall theme, {{it would be the}} widespread occurrences of species that would not be expected to linger into late December and January. Several species of waterbirds, notably Blue-winged Teal, scoters, Ruddy Duck, Common Loon, and Homed and Red-necked Grebes were in this category. Large numbers of Western Grebes were still at Lake McConaughy in early January, and surprisingly late individuals of Black-crowned Night-Heron and Plegadis ibis were located. Mourning Doves were in good numbers in the southeast, and, among passerines, Hermit Thrushes were in good numbers, also. Late surprises among sparrows included Clay-colored, Chipping, and Field. Other daringly late passerines included two (!) Ruby-crowned Kinglets at Ogallala in February, and a Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler in December in Scotts Bluff Co. Things are happening with some woodpeckers; for the second consecutive winter, Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers were everywhere, and Pileateds continue to expand their range northward in the Missouri Valley.

40|$|The {{most obvious}} pattern this spring was early arrivals, {{especially}} among the shorebirds. Dunlin arrived record early, and 5 other species were close to record early dates. However, warblers, sparrows, and buntings were pushing early dates and Brown-headed Cowbird was early in numbers. Winter finches were scarce except for Pine Siskin, which was present in good numbers, although breeding evidence was nonexistent. Glossy Ibis continued in numbers as did easterly Lazuli Buntings.

40|$|Notable this Fall {{was very}} heavy {{coverage}} of the Panhandle during Sep-Oct, which yielded several outstanding records (all, of course, pending NOURC approval).

Philadelphia Vireo {{was found in the}} Panhandle for the 3 rd time. Important also were 3 records of Hammond 2 ̆ 7 s Flycatcher, the 3 rd- 6 th for the state, and likely a regular migrant, and 5 of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s vireo, previously known only by 2 specimens. Finally, from the Panhandle, 4 reports of Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher may be changing the status of this species there; there are still fewer than 10 such records. Just as significant were 2 surprising easterly records, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebe in Lancaster Co and a Plumbeous Vireo in Stanton Co. Rarities independent of location were a potential 1 st state record Eurasian Collared-Dove at Shelton; the NOURC will decide if this was (is!) a wild bird.

40|$|The {{traditional}} mid-summer and midwinter 2 ̆ 2 windows 2 ̆ 2 wherein migrants {{were rarely}} detected have closed markedly {{in the last}} few years. The midwinter window is closing; where it once was around 20 Dec- 20 Feb it is now more like 5 Jan-to Feb. Many waterfowl were found in midwinter this season, and migrants such as Bluewinged Teal and Sandhill Crane appeared very early this spring. Similarly early were Turkey Vulture and Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. In light of waterbirds lingering late in fall, markedly lower numbers of Western Grebes were a surprise. Exotics were widely-reported; one, Pink-footed Goose, could possibly be a vagrant wild bird, while Egyptian Geese are certainly escaped or released captives.

40|$|On 5 October, 1997, {{we joined}} Joel G. Jorgensen and John Sullivan for a pelagic trip on Lake McConaughy. A similar trip in late September 1996 yielded a Sabine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull,</b> {{but we were}} really hoping to see a jaeger. From 7 : 00 to 8 : 30 a. m. we {{gradually}} worked our way from the dam towards {{the western end of}} the lake. Besides moderate numbers of Franklin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and Ring-billed <b>Gulls,</b> there were few birds on the lake. At approximately 8 : 45 a. m. Dinsmore noticed that all of the gulls at the western end of the lake had suddenly taken flight. Less than a minute later, we simultaneously spotted a jaeger soaring directly overhead. The size, dark coloration, and prominent white flashes in the Wings identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird made a couple of attacks on Franklin Gulls and then flew east down the lake. We chased the jaeger for more than ten miles before losing it. We relocated the bird a short time later just above the dam. This time, the bird attacked a couple of Ring-billed Gulls before flying west up the lake. We again took chase, but lost the bird before reaching Lemoyne. The gull-like shape, generally brown coloration, and prominent white bases to the primaries identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird was smaller but longer-winged than a Ring-billed Gull and larger and slimmer than a Franklin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull.</b> The overall coloration was dark brown, except for some warmer rufous tones on the underparts. We saw no visible barring on the underparts. The bill was straight and slender, but the color pattern was not noted. The upperwing was dark brown except for white at the base of at least the outermost four primaries. The underwing was also dark except for a prominent white area on the undersides of the bases of the primaries. The rectrices were dark and the central feathers were slightly elongated with pointed tips. We all agreed on the identification as a juvenile Parasitic Jaeger. Careful size comparisons to Franklin and Ring-billed Gulls eliminated juvenile Pomarine Jaeger, which also generally shows more white color on both surfaces of the wing. Juvenile Long-tailed Jaeger was eliminated {{on the basis of the}} pattern of white on the wing and size and wing proportions. We further concluded the bird was an intermediate or dark morph individual based on the dark plumage and lack of a contrasting paler head or rump. This represents the second accepted record of a Parasitic Jaeger for Nebraska. The only other record is of a juvenile picked up alive in Sheridan County on 23 Aug 1968 which died the next day (specimen number UNSM ZM 12309) (Gates, Doris. 1969.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{amount of}} work reporters put into their reports is tremendous. Putting the {{information}} into a readable format which preserves it for future use is a challenge, but always interesting. Reporters can report on their own forms if preferred; some do now, often because of computerized record-keeping systems. I [Ross Silcock] enter the data into my computer, and so almost anything is fine, as long as I can read it. It {{is not necessary to}} list every species, although {{it is difficult to know}} whether your dates of arrival, high counts, etc. are significant until compared with the others submitted. Perhaps the best way to save time and work reporting is to plan your system so that it is simple to report when the time comes. NOTABLE EVENTS There are several highlights among the data presented below. A long list of rarities included Eurasian Wigeon, Oldsquaw, Gyrfalcon, King Rail, Snowy Plover, Red Knot, Ruff (first Nebraska record), Thayer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull,</b> Iceland Gull, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Cape May Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, Connecticut Warbler, MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler (specimen in Lancaster County), Hooded Warbler, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. American Bittern is doing well in the Sandhills, as is Black-crowned Night-Heron, and especially Black-necked stilt. White-faced Ibis was also numerous, although it is not resident. Trumpeter Swan is present in the Sandhills in good numbers also, with several breeding pairs noted. This year, Cinnamon Teal was also present in good numbers. That these species are doing well speaks for the good condition of Sandhills waterbird habitats...|$|R
40|$|One {{immature}} {{was observed}} at Sutherland Reservoir, Lincoln County, on 17 December (myself) and 19 December (myself and Dorothy J. Rosche), 1992. I saw this bird {{a few hours after}} Silcock and Dinsmore discovered it on 17 Dec. [See article on p. 88. ] It flew {{by the end of the}} pier at close distances (as close as 20 feet) for hours on both days of observation. It sometimes landed momentarily on small pieces of ice as it picked up morsels floating in the water. It was a small gull and much more dainty than the nearby Bonaparte 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gulls.</b> It had a very small, rounded head and a very short, stubby, blackish bill. I believe it was a first-year bird molting into second-year plumage. The obviously wedge-shaped tail possessed well-worn tips. The only thing left of the dark tail band was a dark spot or two. The dark wing band of the immature was reduced to a short, dark bar on the inner wing, more noticeable on one side of the bird than the other (and very visible when the bird perched). The dark black collar marking was just beginning to appear, a small, darkish line being the only thing visible on each side of the head at this time. The pointed wings were rather uniformly gray on both sides; the trailing edge of the wing was whitish. The bird remained until 3 January, 1993, when it was last seen at the inlet to the reservoir. I personally visited with some 18 people who travelled to observe the bird from New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, and Florida...|$|R
40|$|This was {{a pretty}} routine fall for the most part, {{although}} there were scattered early and late dates and high counts as in most seasons.

A surprising 15 gull species were reported, this without much help from L McConaughy! Also notable were the sea-ducks, scoters, and Long-tailed Duck, which were in good numbers. Tom Labedz, collections manager at the University of Nebraska State Museum, is an excellent source; he contributed greatly to discussions herein on Greater Prairie-Chicken and Fox Sparrow.

40|$|Overall, {{this winter}} season was pretty quiet. There were no major weather events, no major invasions Gust one minor incursion), and, with one big exception, no real rarities.

Most {{parts of the state}} are covered, except the southwest and north central, although many observers at least pass through those areas. A note about details on unusual observations. The new NOU Field Card, which can be ordered by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the NOU Librarian, Univ of Nebraska State Museum, Lincoln, NE 68588 - 0514, indicates species that need complete documentations, mostly casual and accidental species. However, we realize that information about early and late migration dates, and rarity in the west or east is not readily available, so in this summary we have indicated significant reports that were not accompanied by details on the sighting by using the phrase 2 ̆ 2 no details provided 2 ̆ 2 or something similar. We would very much appreciate it if observers of these reports could provide details of the sighting, including identification points and circumstances such as habitat, viewing conditions, etc. These reports are as important as those of rare birds, and {{it would be nice to}} have them substantiated. Of course sightings discussed in this report are always subject to acceptance by the NOU Records Committee; reports with asterisks denote those for which written documentation has been submitted to the NOU Records Committee. And now to the good stuff! This fall was interesting from many aspects. Several species of waterbirds, considered accidental or casual a few years ago, were well reported this year, including Red-throated Loon, Pacific Loon, Red-necked Grebe, Black Scoter, and Sabine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull.</b> A discussion is included about hummingbirds in w NE, several of which were noted early this fall (hummingbird mania?). Few Catharus thrushes were noted, no Veeries and only 2 Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Thrushes. Unprecedented numbers of Sage Thrashers were noted in Kimball Co, and excellent numbers of Palm and Blackburnian Warblers showed up, including the 3 rd fall record for the panhandle region for Blackburnian. Good information is being received about the ranges of Eastern and Spotted Towhees...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} essays, I {{have discussed}} fasting. 1 As one who occasionally engages in the practice, I noted that moderate fasting {{may be a}} good way for some people to stay trim and keep healthy. But fasting, like anything else, can be taken to extremes. One extreme and dangerous form of fasting, involving virtual self-starvation, is the strange illness known as anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that causes its victims to pursue an obsessive, exaggerated diet—a diet in which food is avoided to the point of emaciation and even death. Since the condition has only recently begun to receive popular attention in magazines and television, it is somewhat surprising to learn that anorexia {{has been the subject of}} serious research for more than a century. One of the first clinical observations of the disorder, in fact, was recorded almost 300 years ago. In 1689, English physician Richard Morton described a woman who inexplicably refused virtually all food, and who resembled “a skeleton only clad with skin. ”z (p. 5) However, the first real recognition of anorexia as a clinical entity occurred in the 1870 <b>s.</b> William <b>Gull,</b> an English physician, and Jean Lasegue, a French psychiatrist, made simultaneous observations of the disorder.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between Great Black-backed Gull (Larus marinus) diet selection and reproductive success, measured as chick growth and fledge rates, was undertaken on 2 colonies in the Northwest Atlantic; Gull Island, Newfoundland and the Gannet Islands, Labrador in 2000 and 2001. Habitat and nesting density proved {{not to be}} related to diet or reproductive success. Although statistically insignificant, Great Black-backed Gulls that mainly fed their chicks seabirds had in increased growth rates and decreased fledging rates. [...] Great Black-backed Gull diet was partially composed of seabird eggs, chicks, and adults.

40|$|New in this Seasonal Report, {{direct from}} the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (along with Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Snipe, Rock Pigeon, etc.), is the {{modified}} checklist order, featuring geese, swans, and ducks at the beginning, followed by gallinaceous birds, then resuming the familiar order with loons. Perhaps {{the most important}} use for these reports, {{in addition to their}} incorporation into the Southern Great Plains Region summary in North American Birds, is the noting of significant avian events in Nebraska. Some are of obvious importance, but the meaning of others is obscure, perhaps only to be revealed as subsequent reports show a trend, or events noted in Nebraska are corroborated by the same events noted in the other Southern Great Plains states, in Kansas and Oklahoma, or even on a national level. Such events discussed in this report include a good showing of scoters, hints of a recovery of the Gray Partridge population, a sighting of 7 + migrating Mississippi Kites, a Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker in Sowbelly Canyon, indications of declines in numbers of Black-billed Magpie, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee, westerly Carolina Wrens, rather low numbers of thrushes and warblers, westerly Rose-breasted Grosbeaks possibly breeding, good numbers of Purple Finches, no reports of Red Crossbills after 27 Sep, and few Pine Siskins. A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 ̆ 2 quirky, 2 ̆ 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an Orange Bishop (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney. Among significant early or late dates of occurrence were record late Caspian Terns, Panhandle Gray Catbird, and Bobolink (although the Boblink was unsubstantiated), second-latest Forster 2 ̆ 7 s Tern and Western Kingbird, and record early Northern (Red-Shafted) Flickers eastward. In-your-face numbers were the 321 Hooded Mergansers at L Yankton, 5 Yellow-crowned Night-Herons in the eastern Rainwater Basin, a fall record 247 Upland Sandpipers there also, an almost-record 283 Buff-breasted Sandpipers also in the eastern Rainwater Basin, 26, 000 Franklin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gulls</b> at L McConaughy, a record 14 Caspian Terns at Branched Oak L, 30 + Burrowing Owls at a Scotts Bluff County location, and a record 12 Brown Creepers at Arbor Day Farm.

40|$|On 20 September 2000, I {{arrived at}} Lake Minatare in Scotts Bluff County {{after the passage}} of a strong cold front the day before.

40|$|At least 626 {{southern}} {{right whale}} (Eubalaena australis) calves died at the Península Valdés calving ground, Argentina, between 2003 and 2014. Intense gull harassment {{may have contributed to}} these deaths. In the 1970 <b>s,</b> Kelp <b>Gulls</b> (Larus dominicanus) began feeding on skin and blubber pecked from the backs of living right whales at Valdés. The frequency of gull attacks has increased dramatically over the last three decades and mother-calf pairs are the primary targets. Pairs attacked by gulls spend less time nursing, resting and playing than pairs not under attack. In successive attacks, gulls open new lesions on the whales' backs or enlarge preexisting ones. Increased wounding could potentially lead to dehydration, impaired thermoregulation, and energy loss to wound healing. The presence, number and total area of gull-inflicted lesions were assessed using aerial survey photographs of living mother-calf pairs in 1974 - 2011 (n = 2680) and stranding photographs of dead calves (n = 192) in 2003 - 2011. The percentage of living mothers and calves with gull lesions increased from an average of 2 % in the 1970 s to 99 % in the 2000 s. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, mothers and calves had roughly equal numbers of lesions (one to five), but by the 2000 s, calves had more lesions (nine or more) covering a greater area of their backs compared to their mothers. Living mother-calf pairs and dead calves in Golfo Nuevo had more lesions than those in Golfo San José in the 2000 s. The number and area of lesions increased with calf age during the calving season. Intensified Kelp Gull harassment at Península Valdés could be compromising calf health and thereby contributing to the high average rate of calf mortality observed in recent years, but it cannot explain the large year-to-year variance in calf deaths since 2000...|$|R
40|$|Urban gull {{populations have}} {{increased}} {{dramatically in the}} last 40 years, leading to widespread concerns about potential nuisance to humans, but little accompanying research into their ecology. This study aimed to provide the first long-term estimates of apparent adult survival rates for urban Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Lesser Black-backed Gulls L. fuscus, based on colour ringing in Bristol, southwest England. Resightings of adult birds covering 18 years (1990 – 2007) were analysed using capture–mark–recapture methods, with candidate models testing for differences in survival and/or resighting rate through time and between the sexes. Both species showed high apparent annual survival rates (> 0. 90) in the early 1990 s that declined to < 0. 70 by 2007. Male survival rates were higher than female rates in Lesser Black-backed Gulls, and male resighting rates were higher in both species. In the early 1990 <b>s,</b> Bristol's urban <b>gulls</b> displayed similar adult survival rates to published estimates for rural colonies. Both species showed evidence of long-term declines in apparent survival, which may either reflect actual reductions in survival or increased permanent emigration from the Bristol colony. Anecdotal evidence supports the latter, linking emigration to urban redevelopment or human intervention...|$|R
40|$|Background: α- and β-tubulin are {{fundamental}} {{components of the}} eukaryotic cytoskeleton and cell division machinery. While overall tubulin expression is carefully controlled, most eukaryotes express multiple tubulin genes in specific regulatory or developmental contexts. The genomes of the human parasites Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major reveal that these unicellular kinetoplastids possess arrays of tandem-duplicated tubulin genes, but with differences in organisation. While L. major possesses monotypic α and β arrays in trans, an array of alternating α-and β tubulin genes occurs in T. brucei. Polycistronic transcription in these organisms makes the chromosomal arrangement of tubulin genes important with respect to gene expression. Results: We investigated the genomic architecture of tubulin tandem arrays among these parasites, establishing which character state is derived, and the timing of character transition. Tubulin loci in T. brucei and L. major were compared {{to examine the relationship}} between the two character states. Intergenic regions between tubulin genes were sequenced from several trypanosomatids and related, non-parasitic bodonids to identify the ancestral state. Evidence of alternating arrays was found among non-parasitic kinetoplastids and all Trypanosoma spp.;monotypic arrays were confirmed in all Leishmania spp. and close relatives. Conclusion: Alternating and monotypic tubulin arrays were found to be mutually exclusive through comparison of genome sequences. The presence of alternating gene arrays in non-parasitic kinetoplastids confirmed that separate, monotypic arrays are the derived state and evolved through genomic restructuring in the lineage leading to Leishmania. This fundamental reorganisation accounted for the dissimilar genomic architectures of T. brucei and L. major tubulin repertoires. Citation: Jackson, A. P. & Vaughan, <b>S.</b> & <b>Gull,</b> K.

40|$|Examinations {{were carried}} out {{during the period from}} January 2006 until March 2007 on a total of 449 samples of the cecum of {{broilers}} and the cecum and the colon of pigs. These samples included 251 samples originating from broilers and 198 samples of pig cecums and colons. All the listed samples were obtained by scraping the surface of these parts of the digestive system of broilers and pigs. At the site of sampling, the diluted material was sown on a medium (Karmali agar), in order to get individual colonies. After sowing, the bases were placed in anaerobic jars in which microaerophilic conditions were achieved using Campy Pak, BBL bags. On arrival at the laboratory, the jars containing the sown bases were placed in a thermostat, at a temperature of 42 oC for 48 hours for the purpose of incubation. Following incubation, the grown colonies were examined macroscopically, and then microscopic preparations were made from them, which were stained with 2 % carbol fuchsin after drying and fixation. Those isolates which were {{in the form of a}} comma, the letter <b>S,</b> or <b>gull's</b> wings in the microscopic preparations were considered Campylobacter species (Figures 1 and 2). The isolated thermophilic campylobacteria were identified using conventional and commercial biochemical tests API Campy, manufactured by Bio Mérieux, France. With the application of these microbiological methods, thermophilic Campylobacter species were isolated from 203 (80. 88 %) of the 251 samples of broiler cecums. Furthermore, thermophilic campylobacteria were isolated from 153 (77. 27 %) of the 198 samples from the cecum and colon of pigs taken within these investigations. The obtained results indicate that there is a somewhat greater prevalence of these bacteria among the broilers. However, such a high percentage of both broilers and pigs colonized by thermophilic Campylobacter species could pose a serious problem, in particular when it is known that infections of humans caused by the consumption of insufficiently thermally processed meat of broilers or pigs are not infrequent...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{failure of}} a number of {{fish-eating}} birds was observed on the Great Lakes in the mid- 1960 s to mid- 1970 <b>s.</b> The herring <b>gull</b> (Larus argentatus) has been used as the primary monitoring species. The low hatching success observed in this species on Lake Ontario in the mid- 1970 s was due to loss of eggs and failure of eggs to hatch. Egg exchange experiments demonstrated that this was due both to the incubation behavior of adults and to direct embryotoxic effects. Decrease of nest attentiveness was demonstrated using telemetered eggs, but attempts to reproduce the embryonic effects by injection of pollutant mixtures into eggs were not successful. Reproductive success improved rapidly during the late 1970 s and was normal {{by the end of the}} decade. Recent studies have focused on cytogenetic and biochemical changes and detailed analytical chemistry of residues. No changes in the rate of sister chromatid exchange over values determined in coastal colonies were observed. Elevation of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity, levels of highly carboxylated porphyrins, and changes of thyroid function have been found. The geographic pattern of these changes indicates that they are caused by xenobiotics, but it has not been possible to relate the changes to a specific chemical.
