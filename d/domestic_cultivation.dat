40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of <b>domestic</b> cannabis <b>cultivation</b> in the UK and examines {{its impact on the}} wider cannabis market. Cannabis growers were studied using both traditional and on-line ethnographic methods. Data was analysed both to produce a description of cannabis cultivation (and cannabis cultivators) in Britain and to analyse how domestic production of cannabis fits into our wider understanding of illegal drug markets. The thesis explores UK cannabis growing on a number of levels. Firstly it seeks to describe how cannabis is grown in Britain. Some is grown outside in natural conditions but most British cannabis is grown indoors with increasingly hi-tech cultivation methods being utilised. The method employed by an individual grower will depend on his opportunities, his intention for the crop and any ideological position which may influence his choice. We then explore who is involved in cannabis growing. At a basic level featuresdemographic and' ideological' - common to cannabis growers are considered. At a deeper level a typology of cannabis growers is offered based predominantly on motivation and ideology. The key point here is {{that a large number of}} cannabis growers seek no financial reward whatsoever for their involvement in what is essentially an act of drug trafficking. Others grow cannabis to make money, but are equally motivated by non-financial 'drivers'. Still others are mostly or entirely driven by financial considerations. These growers often display the same hall-marks as other organised crime outfits. Consumer concerns can be seen to influence the market with smaller independent 'social' and 'social/commercial' growers offering an ideo logical - ethical, even - alternative to larger scale organised crime outfits. Finally explanations for the recent surge in <b>domestic</b> cannabis <b>cultivation</b> are offered along with predictions for the future domestic production, not just of cannabis but other drugs as well...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} hemp {{cultivation}} {{is as old}} as the history of civilization. In North America, hemp was a crucial crop during the colonial period, and it continued to be produced right up to and through the Second World War. A combination of regulatory pressures and changing public perceptions around drug use led to the disappearance of <b>domestic</b> hemp <b>cultivation</b> in North America in the years following WW II. In 1998, Canada joined the large international community of hemp producers by permitting the production of industrial hemp, under a carefully monitored regulatory process. While the growth of the Canadian industrial hemp sector over the past decade has been uneven and at times fraught with challenges, as would be expected from a fledgling industry, there is considerable cause for optimism: The market for hemp seed materials for human health, nutrition, and personal care applications is strong and growing.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop a general purpose baler system that is appropriate for the <b>domestic</b> forage <b>cultivation</b> environment and operated by the medium size tractor for production of bale silage made of green forage crops, and to test its performance. Methods: In a first experiment, the time of formation per one bale and densities of bales that are produced from bale system, were measured. In a second experiment, power requirement was measured by a power measurement system manufactured during bale system work. Results: The power measurement system was constructed with strain-gage sensors to measure torque of a PTO axle and proximity sensor to measure rotating speed of a PTO axle. Thus, the power requirement was calculated by PTO torque and PTO rotating speed. For evaluation of bale quality, the samples of bales were analyzed for contents of moisture, ADF, NDF and TDN. Conclusions: If {{the results of this study}} will be utilized, the coefficient of utilization of agricultural machinery will be increased by the operation of a medium size tractor that is a major disseminated tractor in farm, and it will contribute tremendously to make a forage production base for livestock farms...|$|R

40|$|Background: Internet-mediated {{research}} methods are increasingly used to access hidden populations. The International Cannabis Cultivation Questionnaire (ICCQ) is an online survey designed to facilitate international comparisons into the relatively under-researched but increasingly significant phenomenon of <b>domestic</b> cannabis <b>cultivation.</b> The Global Cannabis Cultivation Research Consortium {{has used the}} ICCQ to survey over 6000 cannabis cultivators across 11 countries. In this paper, we describe and reflect upon our methodological approach, focusing on the digital and traditional recruitment methods used to access this hidden population and the challenges of working across multiple countries, cultures and languages. Methods: Descriptive statistics showing eligibility and completion rates and recruitment source by country of residence. Results: Over three quarters of eligible respondents who were presented with the survey {{were included in the}} final sample of n = 6528. English-speaking countries expended more effort to recruit participants than non-English-speaking countries. The most effective recruitment modes were cannabis websites/groups (33 %), Facebook (14 %) and news articles (11 %). While respondents recruited through news articles were older, growing practice variables were strikingly similar between these main recruitment modes. Conclusion: Through this process, we learnt that there are trade-offs between hosting multiple surveys in each country vs. using one integrated database. We also found that although perceived anonymity is routinely assumed to be a benefit of using digital research methodologies, there are significant limits to research participant anonymity in the current era of mass digital surveillance, especially when the target group is particularly concerned about evading law enforcement. Finally, we list a number of specific recommendations for future researchers utilising Internet-mediated approaches to researching hidden populations...|$|R

50|$|Marijuana {{was brought}} to Brazil by its African slaves, and with the eugenic positivist {{intellectual}} and political status quo of the Western civilization in the early 20th century, its use was deemed as a signal of decadence by its stigmatized use as a recreational drug of the poor, the rural people and the Afro-Brazilian. Its association with the counterculture and left-wing youths during the highly anti-Communist military dictatorship, initially a strong ally of the United States' government, fortified its negative perceptions both by the authorities and the masses. Nevertheless, since the neoliberal centre-right government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994-2002), position strengthened in the so-called Era Lula (2003-2010), individual marijuana use by adults started to have no major importance to police and government instances - though not, ironically (since the country has major crime problems with drug dealers), its <b>domestic</b> <b>cultivation</b> for own consumption.

40|$|New Zealand is {{examined}} {{as a case}} study for the application of complex system modelling to the practical understanding of biodiversity management and conservation. As the worldâs most isolated, ancient and diverse continental island group, New Zealand has ideal characteristics for this purpose. As a result of relatively recent human colonisation, the islands are now undergoing a dynamic shift with rapid regression of many native higher plant and animal species and rapid invasion of an almost equal number of equivalent exotic species. Around 90 % of native habitats have been modified by grazing by <b>domestic</b> animals or <b>cultivation.</b> Joint government and public conservation has resulted in a large conservation estate (29 % of land area) which has raised concerns that it may not be sustainable without substantial further efforts in the long term. We show that conservation investment is in fact large, relative to the past, but minimal with respect to the returns. We suggest the need for more explicit valuation of the feedback mechanisms that justify this effort in the long run (e. g. ecosystem services, tourism, genetic resources). We show trends in population, habitat degradation, and conservation, and explain these within the context of socio-economic indicators and strategies. A series of complex phenomena are identified as clues to understanding biodiversity, including lognormal distribution patterns of abundance, chaotic behaviour, co-evolution and diversification. 1...|$|R
40|$|This multiproxy study {{explores the}} palaeoenvironmental record of two cores, H 2 and H 7, from the Namaqualand Mudbelt {{representing}} an arid and highly variable landscape. As bulk organic radiocarbon ages previously proved problematic, with anomalous reversals, {{the primary objective}} was to improve chronology and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions through high resolution 813 C, 81 SN and pollen analysis, {{with the aid of}} principal component analysis. Bulk organic radiocarbon dating of the surface sediment had previously yielded older than expected ages. New 210 Pb analysis has established that these surface sediments are modem and radiocarbon ages are now recalibrated to yield an adjusted age of ÃÂ± 3 470 cal yr BP {{at the base of the}} more distal core, H 7. Pollen spectra correlate well with stable isotopes and include recent disturbance indicators in the Succulent Karoo, Grassland, Karoo expansion, stock farming, impoundment, saltmarsh degradation and increase in <b>domestic</b> cereal <b>cultivation.</b> The proximal and distal mudbelt sites are, however, isotopically distinct, with 813 C, inverse nitrogen and C/N ratios characterising H 2 as more terrestrial. The excursion towards C 3 -rich values at around 6 m depth in the proximal mudbelt suggests an increase in marine sources and C 3 vegetation, while associated pollen aridity indicators implicate reduced inland flooding. This is contrasted against more humid conditions at 420 cm. Stronger upwelling occurred in near-surface distal mudbelt sediment and an influx of the Buffels River sediment flooded the region at ÃÂ± 3470 yr BP, indicating cooler, less arid conditions. 813 C studies reveal the Lower Xobies palaeoflood deposit to be less C 4 -rich than expected, possibly due to sediment source, and is strikingly isotopically similar to the distal mudbelt. The palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the pollen assemblage, isotopes and chronology presents an improved understanding of the region represented in the mudbelt sediments. This corresponds well with established records of the last ÃÂ± 3 500 years and human induced land use change within the Orange River Catchment. Results also highlight the dynamics of the Orange River, which, combined with a highly variable climate, suggest that caution should be exercised to avoid over-interpreting the level at which environmental changes can meaningfully be reconstructed in arid landscapes, particularly those which are subject to sporadic and catastrophic flooding events...|$|R

40|$|This {{strategic}} analysis of Swedish agriculture â production systems and agricultural landscapes {{in a time}} of change â focuses on climate change, future availability of natural resources and economic regulation in a global food market. The background to the project was that the Faculty of Natural Resources and Agriculture of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences identified an urgent need to explore the implications and opportunities of coming changes for agricultural production systems, arable land use and farm landscape functions in Sweden. Another objective was to determine the research needed to ensure that we are equipped to adapt to the coming changes. The analysis was carried out in the form of three literature reviews (Climate Change and Agricultural Land Use in Sweden: A Literature Review, (Eckersten et al., 2008 a); Changes in the Global Natural Resource Base Relevant for Future Agriculture in Sweden â A Literature Review, (Johansson, 2008); and Economic Globalisation and Swedish Agriculture â Future Changes Affecting Swedish Agriculture from an Economic Perspective with Special Emphasis on Globalisation, (Holstein, 2008). It also comprised workshops and seminars and finally production of this synthesis report, which summarises the work done and suggests six research themes. Different IPCC emission scenarios describe pathways for those factors that are regarded as important for emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), such as demography and social, economic and technological development. The projected global temperature increase varies from a little less than 2 Â°C up to 3. 5 - 4. 0 Â°C {{by the end of this}} century. Shrinking glaciers and rising sea levels are some of the consequences of the temperature increase. This climate change will have considerable consequences for agriculture, ecosystem function and human health on a global scale. The conditions for food production in Sweden are projected to become more favourable in terms of potential productivity as a result of future climate change. However, despite more favourable average cropping conditions, there could be drawbacks in the form of more frequent extreme weather events and, for example, more severe crop pathogen attacks and increased risks of nutrient leaching. The temperature increase is predicted to be greater during winter than during summer. Furthermore, precipitation will probably increase and the precipitation pattern will change. The temperature increase may lead to an extension of the growing season by several months in southern Sweden. Swedish agriculture is currently dependent on high inputs of external resources. The situation at present is that agricultural demands are increasing with regard to the natural resource base, e. g. ecosystem services and fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels to sustain food production cannot continue indefinitely; agriculture world-wide must adopt mitigation strategies. One way is to search for self-sustaining, diversified, low-input, energy-efficient agricultural systems, using local renewable resources and ecosystem services. Another way to meet the challenges of future food supply and at the same time sustain life-support systems might be through intensive high-input agriculture on the 'best' land in order to save other areas for nature conservation. Swedish agriculture and food production are closely linked to the global food and feed market. Increased globalisation means that the profitability of Swedish farms is influenced to an increasing extent by actors on the global market. Conditions for Swedish agriculture in the past have been largely determined by political regulations, national and subsequently by CAP (Common Agricultural Policy in EU), but are gradually becoming more dependent on world market forces. Sweden has a comparative disadvantage in primary production compared with many other countries but the competitiveness of the Swedish food sector as a whole has increased during recent years due to increased exports of processed products. Another opportunity is to increase production of products with added value, e. g. organic products. However, the effects of globalisation on Swedish agriculture are hard to predict. Increased liberalisation will lead to increased competition, which will most probably lead to decreased production in Sweden. However, future changes in land productivity could potentially affect land use more than does the degree of liberalisation in trade. The conclusion that Swedish agriculture will decrease, at least in terms of land use, may very well turn out to be incorrect. This should be clear, not only from scenarios where climate change makes Swedish production more competitive but also from the latest developments on the world market where large increases in demand for agricultural products have been noted. This increase may have the consequence that land in less competitive countries will become sufficiently productive. Twelve climate scenarios for different regions in Sweden were developed within the FANAN project, from south-west SkÃ¥ne in the south to ÃvertorneÃ¥ in the north. Projections of future cropping systems under the new climatic conditions are described for three regions, south-west SkÃ¥ne, MÃ¤lardalen district and the coast region of VÃ¤sterbotten. There are diametrically opposed scenarios for future land use and appropriate design of agricultural production systems in the literature, which implies a need for a great variety of research. Research in adaptation as well as mitigation strategies will be important. Problems are interlinked and interdisciplinary research will probably be necessary to solve the complex problems concerning agriculture and the food supply of future populations. Six different strategic research themes are presented as a result of the FANAN project: 1. Future analyses of long-term sustainable land use, p. 54. 2. Sustainable production systems â crop and animal sciences, p. 55. Cooling crops â crop-soil interactions Crop breeding â perennial cereals <b>Domestic</b> animal production <b>Cultivation</b> techniques 3. Ecosystem services in production systems of the agricultural landscape, p. 59. 4. From words to action, p. 60. 5. Monitoring of agricultural production, p. 62. 6. Multidisciplinary research network, p. 62. Large research programmes rather than small disciplinary projects will promote the solution of future complex problems. It will be necessary to combine empirical research with modelling and synthesis work in order to generate good science that is relevant to the challenges in sustainable agricultural management. FANAN concludes that SLU has a central role to play in developing these sustainable strategies...|$|R

This study examines 50 cannabis farms detected by an English police force, and examines {{the characteristics of the}} 61 suspects associated with them. The study highlights a UK pattern in <b>domestic</b> <b>cultivation,</b> that is moving away from large scale commercial cultivation, at times co-ordinated by South East Asian organised crime groups, to increased cultivation within residential premises by British citizens. Offenders range from those who have no prior criminal history to those who are serious and persistent offenders. The ramifications for law enforcement agencies and policy formers are discussed...|$|E

Important data acquired from growth trials were growth timelines and yields. This information was used to generate interactive spreadsheets with which one can determine possible cost and profit in a variety of scenarios. The first portion of the experiment involved constructing a growth chamber, which can achieve and maintain stable environmental conditions. This portion was successful. Secondly, the numbers obtained from the experimental growth trials were used to determine future projections {{from the perspective of a}} small business start up. According to the data, investment in production is expected to be highly lucrative, with a projected net profit margin range of 300 - 2000...|$|E

Consumption of herbal medicines is widespread and increasing. Harvesting from the wild, {{the main source of}} raw material, is causing loss of genetic diversity and habitat destruction. <b>Domestic</b> <b>cultivation</b> is a viable alternative and offers the opportunity to overcome the problems that are inherent in herbal extracts: misidentification, genetic and phenotypic variability, extract variability and instability, toxic components and contaminants. The use of controlled environments can overcome cultivation difficulties and could be a means to manipulate phenotypic variation in bioactive compounds and toxins. Conventional plant-breeding methods can improve both agronomic and medicinal traits, and molecular marker assisted selection will be used increasingly. There has been significant progress in the use of tissue culture and genetic transformation to alter pathways for the biosynthesis of target metabolites. Obstacles to bringing {{medicinal plants}} into successful commercial cultivation include the difficulty of predicting which extracts will remain marketable and the likely market preference for what is seen as naturally sourced extracts.

40|$|The St. Croix site in Hants County, Nova Scotia, offers archaeologists {{a glimpse}} into life among Native {{communities}} during the Woodland Period. Within the modern community of St. Croix, a small clearing in an undisturbed forested area was excavated in 1990 and 1993 and found to be rich in cultural material dating to the full breadth of the Woodland Period. Field work in 2012 expanded on earlier work by extending the excavation {{to the end of}} the undisturbed forested area and into the larger St. Croix community. Areas affected by modern activities such as plowing were tested to determine the quality of the archaeological record after decades of <b>domestic</b> <b>cultivation.</b> Analyses of recovered ceramics, lithic artifacts and palaeoethnobotanical remains are comparable to previous work, revealing a site utilized throughout the Woodland Period. Currently known boundaries of the site within the undisturbed forest area are extended approximately 60 m north and areas once thought irrevocably destroyed are now archaeologically viable with the discovery of a thin undisturbed occupation layer. St. Croix continues to represent a place of great archaeological wealth and represents one of the most important Woodland Period sites in the province...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Domestic</b> <b>cultivation</b> of {{medicinal}} plants {{is an important}} strategy for protecting these species from over harvesting. Some species of {{medicinal plants}} have been brought into cultivation for more than hundreds years. Concerns about severe loss of genetic diversity and sustainable cultivation can potentially limit future use of these valuable plants. Genetic studies with comprehensive sampling of multiple medicinal species by molecular markers will allow for assessment and management of these species. Here we examine the population genetic consequences of cultivation and domestication in Scrophularia ningpoensis Hemsl. We used chloroplast DNA and genomic AFLP markers to clarify not only the effects of domestication on genetic diversity, but also determine the geographic origins of cultivars and their genetic divergence from native populations. These results will allow both better management of cultivated populations, but also provide insights for crop improvement. Results: Twenty-one cpDNA haplotypes of S. ningpoensis were identified. Wild populations contain all haplotypes, whereas only three haplotypes were found in cultivated populations with wild populations having twice the haplotype diversity of cultivated populations. Genetic differentiation between cultivated populations and wild populations was significant. Genomic AFLP markers revealed similar genetic diversity patterns. Furthermore, Structure analysis grouped all wild populations into two gene pools; two of which shared the same gene pool with cultivated S. ningpoensis. The result o...|$|E
