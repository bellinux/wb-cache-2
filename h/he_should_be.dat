5|$|At a {{drive-in}} restaurant, Vinnie and Crazy {{make out}} with their girls. When Roz spots a car that she thinks Boogaloo is in, Crazy is quick to drive off after it. Crazy ends up shooting two of the black gang members in an alley, much to Vinnie's shock. Solly investigates {{the death of the}} two black gang members. He questions Boogaloo, who tells him that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> looking for the Stompers.|$|E
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.|$|E

5|$|Lord Commander Mormont gives Jon Snow House Mormont's ancestral Valyrian steel sword Longclaw, {{which was}} {{originally}} meant {{for his son}} Ser Jorah before Jorah's exile, {{as a reward for}} saving his life from the undead ranger. Jon is upset, however, when Sam tells him about Robb's war against the Lannisters, feeling that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> there to help Robb.|$|E
5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{original}} death mask {{was created}} around 6 May, {{although it is}} not clear which doctor created it. In his will, he had asked to be buried {{on the banks of the}} Seine, but the British governor said <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> buried on Saint Helena, in the Valley of the Willows.|$|E

5|$|Sella confessed his doping to the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) {{and named}} {{teammate}} Matteo Priamo, also a stage winner in this Giro, as his supplier. Though Priamo never {{tested positive for}} anything, and though the Italian National Anti-Doping tribunal originally exonerated him, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled, upon appeal by CONI, that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> suspended for four years.|$|E
5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E

5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, then <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to feel it for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him {{to stay with her}} for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, a Florida {{judge ordered}} Jack to stop selling nude {{photographs}} of Runnels. Runnels filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous comments {{about her and}} requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him and that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> free to pass them on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E
5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> included in Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team {{and asked them to}} include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E

5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of the pitching staff, according to several writers. Nevertheless, he drew the ire of Phillies fans, who were tired of his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some suggested <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> traded to another team.|$|E
5|$|The group {{agrees that}} Randall is an {{imminent}} threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) believes <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds {{most of the}} group agree with Rick's decision, and attempts {{to change their minds}} by appealing to their humanity, civilization and morality. Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should he be able to convince the others to change their minds.|$|E
