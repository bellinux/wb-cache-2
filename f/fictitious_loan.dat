5000|$|The literal {{contract}} was, {{according to}} Gaius, a nomina transcripta, {{and capable of}} functioning in two ways. The first is a re in personam ("from thing to person"), and transformed a debt resulting from another contractual arrangement (sale, hire, for example). A <b>fictitious</b> <b>loan</b> would then be constructed from the creditor to the debtor, thereby charging the debtor with fulfilling that obligation whilst discharging the other. The alternative was in transferring a debt from person to another: a personam in personam. The debt would be entered {{under the name of}} the person to whom it was being transferred. [...] Gaius' account indicates that it was a previous obligation was required in the classical law, and Watson believes this can be conclusively shown for the last century of the Republic. However, it is possible that {{that was not the case}} originally. Appert was argued that the literal contract was created as an enforcement method for consensual contracts, before they became actionable in their own right.|$|E
5000|$|When Parliament {{was called}} in April 1376, known as the Good Parliament and led by Peter de la Mare, the members wanted to remove corrupt {{advisers}} from court. Latimer, Neville, London merchant Richard Lyons and Alice Perrers were accused, and the charges against Latimer were {{that he had been}} guilty of oppression in Brittany; had sold the castle of Saint-Sauveur to the enemy, and impeded the relief of BÃ©cherel in 1375; that he had taken bribes for the release of captured ships, and retained fines paid to the king, notably by Sir Robert Knolles, and the city of Bristol; and finally, that in association with Robert Lyons he had obtained money from the crown by the repayment of <b>fictitious</b> <b>loans.</b> Seconded by William of Wykeham, de la Mare sought to have Latimer immediately convicted, with the Commons acting on behalf of the king. They were unsuccessful and a trial took place. The charges were proven and he was removed from his positions in the royal household and on the council, fined and imprisoned. He was pardoned in October 1376 and with Lancaster's recovered influence he returned to favour.|$|R
