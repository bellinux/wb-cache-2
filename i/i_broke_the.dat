25|$|However, the Swedes {{began to}} resent the {{monopoly}} trading {{position of the}} Hansa (mostly German citizens) and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or Gustav <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he {{was regarded as a}} hero to the Swedish people. History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustave would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop and freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class. This was not the case in other countries of Europe like Poland were the peasantry was still bound by serfdom and a strong feudalistic land owning system.|$|E

Following a revolt against the Empire in Armenia in the late 530s and possibly motivated by the pleas of Ostrogothic ambassadors, King Khosrau <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Eternal Peace" [...] and invaded Roman territory in the spring of 540. He first sacked Beroea and then Antioch (allowing the garrison of 6,000 men to leave the city), besieged Daras, and then went on to attack the small but strategically significant satellite kingdom of Lazica near the Black Sea, exacting tribute from the towns he passed along his way. He forced Justinian I to pay him 5,000 pounds of gold, plus 500 pounds of gold more each year.|$|E

I got used to it, and continue to use the heavy end of lighter sticks – {{it gives me a}} solid impact, but with less 'dead weight' to sling around." ...|$|E
