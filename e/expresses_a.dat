5|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion.

Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
