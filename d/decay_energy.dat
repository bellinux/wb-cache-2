5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and {{it is highly unlikely}} that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV <b>decay</b> <b>energy),</b> with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV <b>decay</b> <b>energy).</b>|$|E
5|$|Francium-221 has a {{half-life}} of 4.8minutes. It is {{the ninth}} {{product of the}} neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-225. Francium-221 then decays into astatine-217 by alpha decay (6.457MeV <b>decay</b> <b>energy).</b>|$|E
5|$|The chief {{questions}} raised by Kulakov were that the claimed alpha <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed <b>decay</b> <b>energy,</b> {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{scientists}} at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory claimed the discovery of element 102, now called nobelium. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same curium target used with nitrogen-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> around (9±1)MeV and half-life around s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257Lr (alpha <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> 8.87MeV, half-life 0.6s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell {{far short of the}} strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103. Later, in 1960, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding 252Cf with 10B and 11B. The results of this experiment were not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Dubna, {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 1958 and 1960 aiming to synthesize element 102 as well. The first 1958 experiment bombarded plutonium-239 and -241 with oxygen-16 ions. Some alpha decays with energies just over 8.5MeV were observed, and they were assigned to 251,252,253102, although the team wrote that formation of isotopes from lead or bismuth impurities (which would not produce nobelium) could not be ruled out. While later 1958 experiments noted that new isotopes could be produced from mercury, thallium, lead, or bismuth impurities, the scientists still stood by their conclusion that element 102 could be produced from this reaction, mentioning a half-life of under 30seconds and a <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> of (8.8±0.5)MeV. Later 1960 experiments proved that these were background effects. 1967 experiments also lowered the <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> to (8.6±0.4)MeV, but both values are too high to possibly match those of 253No or 254No. The Dubna team later stated in 1970 and again in 1987 that these results were not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions. They claimed {{the production of the}} isotope 257103, and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element 102 that had a half-life of 15s and alpha <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> 8.2MeV. They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do not agree with those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|Eka-caesium was {{discovered}} in 1939 by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, when she purified a sample of actinium-227 which had been reported to have a <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> of 220keV.

Perey thought this decay activity might {{have been caused by}} a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be {{obtained}} from two sources: the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half-lives for isotones and the large gap in the alpha Q value for isotonic nuclei of hassium and darmstadtium. For spontaneous fission, it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the isotonic nuclei 268Sg, 270Hs and 272Ds. Since the isotopes 268Sg and 272Ds are not currently known, and fission of 270Hs has not been measured, this method cannot yet be used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. Good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs, 271Ds and 273Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> for the unknown nucleus 272Ds.|$|E
5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E

5|$|It was {{expected}} that the change in reaction would quintuple the probability of synthesizing unbinilium, as the yield of such reactions {{is strongly dependent on}} their asymmetry. Three correlated signals were observed on 18 May 2011 that matched the predicted alpha decay energies of 299Ubn and its daughter 295Og, as well as the experimentally known <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> of its granddaughter 291Lv: the decay chain could thus be interpreted as beginning from 299Ubn and undergoing four successive alpha decays to the spontaneously fissioning 283Cn, with the final alpha from 287Fl having been missed. However, the lifetimes of these possible decays differed from theoretical expectations, and the results could not be confirmed due to lack of beam time.|$|E
5|$|Radioisotopes of caesium {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} of copernicium {{have been}} synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products (except for 277Cn, {{which is not}} {{known to be a}} decay product), while the heavier isotopes are only known to be produced by decay of heavier nuclei. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 283Cn; the three heavier isotopes, 284Cn, 285Cn, and 286Cn, have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers. In 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og. These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form copernicium-281 nuclei, which were claimed to have undergone an alpha decay, emitting an alpha particle with <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> of 10.68MeV and half-life 0.90ms, but their claim was retracted in 2001.

However, later work has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than 259No (no heavier isotopes could have been produced in the Swedish experiments) with a half-life over 3minutes exist, and that the Swedish team's results are most likely from thorium-225, which has a half-life of 8minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium-213, which has a <b>decay</b> <b>energy</b> of 8.53612MeV.
