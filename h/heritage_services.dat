In April 2009, the Council's Director of Transport and Environment recommended that the petition be refused on the basis that a heritage operation would prejudice the reopening of the line and the costs entailed would divert funding away from core Council services.|$|E

These sites include cottages, caves, archaeological monuments, English mansions, forts, and monasteries. While in Ireland, a tourist would find {{it almost impossible to}} escape seeing The <b>Heritage</b> <b>Service</b> 2 ̆ 7 s logo, or seeing a <b>Heritage</b> <b>Service</b> 2 ̆ 7 trail 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 site 2 ̆ 7, or 2 ̆ 7 road 2 ̆ 7. What I propose to do with a Richter International Fellowship is to investigate Irish citizens 2 ̆ 7 views of their past to determine how it matches up or deviates with that advocated by The <b>Heritage</b> <b>Service.</b> I will take an ethnoarchaeological approach in order to holistically understand this problem; that is, I will investigate how archaeological material and landscapes are interpreted by looking at three different perspectives: an archaeological perspective, the local Irish 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, and Duchas, The <b>Heritage</b> <b>Service</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. I will then place these perspectives in a larger context by looking at the political and economic factors that force Duchas to construct a collective history. I believe that Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s history and identity is much more complex than how Duchas portrays it. Interviewing Irish citizens will give me the chance to hear a unique version of history, one of which is most likely separate from or indifferent to political and economic motives...|$|R
