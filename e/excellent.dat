5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them {{were still on the}} diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an <b>excellent</b> reduction and 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an <b>excellent</b> response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an <b>excellent</b> reduction and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had had an <b>excellent</b> response.|$|E

5|$|Because of its <b>excellent</b> thermal and {{chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its <b>excellent</b> dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E

5|$|On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, {{water quality}} scores {{can vary from}} 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for the Chetco River at RM 10.8 (RK 17.4) between 1998 and 2007 was 95 (<b>excellent)</b> {{in the summer and}} 90 in the fall, winter, and spring. These scores are {{comparable}} to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93.
