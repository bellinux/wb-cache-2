And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Didn't <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>out</b> {{to catch}} the thief?" [...] {{answered}} the youth, sharply. [...] "Let me go. If you weren't so dead slow, you'd be doing something, instead of standing there looking at the moon." [...] And on he went again, the officer shaking his fist after him, half {{of the opinion that}} Walter was trying to joke him.|$|R
6000|$|He {{smiled again}} and resumed his story. [...] "By the time I reached the old gate I was dusty as a stage-coach, and this old {{corduroy}} suit {{made me look}} as much like a tramp as anybody. As I came onto the old man he was waterin' a span o' horses at the well. Everything looked about the same, only a little older--he was pretty gray and some thinner--and <b>I</b> <b>calls</b> <b>out</b> kind o' meek-like: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,' <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out.</b> 'As bad as any marred child: you'd {{better be}} riding home, or else {{she will be}} sick, only to grieve us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I huddled {{on a few}} things, {{and struck}} a light, and went down stairs. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> through the door, 'Who's there?' And his voice answered, 'Let me in.' ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{my rifle}} under my knee, my rain coat rolled behind my saddle, my camera {{dangling}} handily, my rope coiled and lashed, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "Are we all set?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, when we {{had settled}} Africa, <b>I</b> would <b>call</b> <b>out</b> a crew of picked heroes, and sail away south for Asgard--I'd try that Red Sea this time--and see Odin face to face, or die searching for him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, you escape me not so," [...] {{said the}} page; [...] "if you deal not justly by me, <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>out</b> to Dame Bridget, or {{whatever}} your dame be called, and proclaim {{you for a}} cheat." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{immediately}} {{perceived that}} it was some school, but so little did I understand the import of David's remark that <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> jocularly, [...] "I hope he won't swish you, Oliver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't touch it! Don't move!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out.</b> [...] "Everybody clasp hands now. Here is {{a chance}} for a fine test. 'Wilbur,' can you put the cone back on the table?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was going}} to leave the door open behind him, but <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "I wish you'd shut me in, Alderling," [...] and after a hesitation, he came back and closed the door.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> didn’t <b>call</b> <b>out</b> after her. <b>I</b> {{felt sure}} that she would return. I went up slowly {{to the first floor}} and met her coming down again, this time {{carrying}} a lighted candle. She had managed to make herself presentable in an extraordinarily short time.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> nearly <b>called</b> <b>out</b> in my joy and my amazement. He was {{speaking}} in his natural voice--a little weak, perhaps, {{but the very}} voice I knew. There was a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in silent amazement {{looking down at his}} companion.|$|R
60|$|The third boat {{pulled up}} {{alongside}} {{the second and}} its crews joined in the conference. Taking advantage of the lull in the battle, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> to the survivors {{to return to their}} shore.|$|E
6000|$|Hurrying {{out into}} the yard, I saw my mother {{standing}} {{a few yards from}} the door, her sweet face distorted, the tears streaming down her cheeks. [...] "What is it, mother?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{will talk}} more after supper," [...] he said. [...] "My sister is, I see, ready with it. Indeed it is long past our usual hour, {{and we were just}} sitting down when <b>I</b> was <b>called</b> <b>out</b> by what purported to be an {{important}} message from the Club." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{matter is}} growing alarming,' {{reasoned}} Mr. Pickwick with himself. 'I can't allow {{things to go}} on in this way. By the self-possession of that lady, {{it is clear to}} me that I must have come into the wrong room. If <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>out</b> she'll alarm the house; but if I remain here the consequences will be still more frightful.' Mr. Pickwick, it is quite unnecessary to say, {{was one of the most}} modest and delicate-minded of mortals. The very idea of exhibiting his nightcap to a lady overpowered him, but he had tied those confounded strings in a knot, and, do what he would, he couldn't get it off. The disclosure must be made. There was only one other way of doing it. He shrunk behind the curtains, and <b>called</b> <b>out</b> very loudly-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> to Mr. Enderton not to {{make trouble}} by {{disturbing}} {{the contents of the}} jar; and even Miss Lucille, who was intensely amused at the scene, could be heard joining her voice to the general clamor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{only your}} guest, sir,' <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out,</b> desirous to spare him {{the humiliation of}} exposing his cowardice further. 'I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare. I'm sorry I {{disturbed}} you.' ...|$|E
60|$|To this {{proposition}} the gentleman agreed, and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> {{for the others}} to begin slinging the baskets up, counting on lending a hand to take them over the rail; but I {{was not allowed to}} abandon my job of oyster-opener.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{can tell}} you what," [...] said the Colonel, in fond {{enjoyment}} of their young ladyishness, [...] "your mother wa'n't ashamed to sit with me on a trestle when <b>I</b> <b>called</b> her <b>out</b> {{to look at the}} first coat of my paint that I ever tried on a house." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was no time}} to think; {{my great}} fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann. Just then <b>I</b> heard her <b>calling</b> <b>out</b> to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Stephen Tidey, of course, sir," [...] the {{confidential}} clerk agreed. [...] "Most suitable thing, sir, and I'm {{sure his}} father would accept it as a high compliment.

60|$|When I {{saw that}} the two of them were rushing him, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> to attract their {{attention}} to the fact that they had more than a single man to cope with. They paused at the sound of my voice and looked about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the other}} day, when I had been dozing, <b>I</b> caught myself <b>calling</b> <b>out</b> {{that he was}} {{whistling}} 'Johnny Cope' so loud {{that he would be}} heard in the shop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care what}} it sounded like," [...] said the other. [...] "I didn't say it. It {{was the last}} thing <b>I</b> should 'ave <b>called</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to be saved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fanny, Fanny," [...] <b>I</b> <b>called</b> to her <b>out</b> of my swoon, [...] "Ah, Fanny. Holy Dying, Holy Dying! Sauve qui peut!" [...] With empty, {{shocking}} face, {{she started}} back, appalled, like a wounded snake.|$|R
