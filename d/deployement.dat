At least 21 rebels were killed and others were wounded in the attack. On 14 April, the rebel siege of the bases had been broken with government troops securing two strategic hilltops, {{on both sides of the}} highway, between which half a dozen supply trucks passed to reach the bases. The number of rebel fighters dead or missing in the Army offensive had risen to 50. On 15 April, rebels attempted a counter-attack, although their front was reported to had been weakened in recent weeks due to infighting and the deployment of forces to other battles. Clashes continued into the night at the village of Babuleen as rebels made attempts to stop the Army from consolidating their gains. An opposition activist claimed that shouts of people from Babuleen were heard on a wireless communication device, calling for rebel fighters to help them, after government forces took control over the town. Rebel fatalities in the two-day government offensive had reportedly reached 100-107. SOHR claimed that if the government is able to hold this gain, they could reopen the whole road to Aleppo and it would have major strategical implication. Rebels attempted a counter attack on 15 April, but their front was weakened due to infighting and <b>deployement</b> of fighters elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMapping the Internet {{generally}} {{consists in}} sampling the network from a limited set of sources by using traceroute-like probes. This methodology, {{akin to the}} merging of different spanning trees {{to a set of}} destination, has been argued to introduce uncontrolled sampling biases that might produce statistical properties of the sampled graph which sharply differ from the original ones. In this paper, we explore these biases and provide a statistical analysis of their origin. We derive an analytical approximation for the probability of edge and vertex detection that exploits the role of the number of sources and targets and allows us to relate the global topological properties of the underlying network with the statistical accuracy of the sampled graph. In particular, we find that the edge and vertex detection probability depends on the betweenness centrality of each element. This allows us to show that shortest path routed sampling provides a better characterization of underlying graphs with broad distributions of connectivity. We complement the analytical discussion with a throughout numerical investigation of simulated mapping strategies in network models with different topologies. We show that sampled graphs provide a fair qualitative characterization of the statistical properties of the original networks in a fair range of different strategies and exploration parameters. Moreover, we characterize the level of redundancy and completeness of the exploration process {{as a function of the}} topological properties of the network. Finally, we study numerically how the fraction of vertices and edges discovered in the sampled graph depends on the particular <b>deployements</b> of probing sources. The results might hint the steps toward more efficient mapping strategies...|$|R

It was established that {{the motion of the}} wake vortices is often sensitive to small changes in either wing span loading or model attitude. Landing gear <b>deployement</b> was found to cause a far-field reformation of vorticity behind a model configuration which dissipated concentrated vorticity in the near-field wake.

One important question when considering {{a move to}} the cloud is whether {{it makes sense for}} ‘my ’ application to migrate to the cloud. This question is challenging to answer due to following reasons. Although many potential benefits of migrating to the cloud can be enumerated, some benefits may not apply to ‘my ’ application. Also, there can be multiple ways in which an application might make use of the facilities offered by cloud providers. Answering these questions requires an in-depth understanding of the cost implications of all the possible choices specific to ‘my ’ circumstances.

Using benchmarks representing two different applications (TPC-W and TPC-E) we investigate the evolution of costs for different deployment choices.

40|$|Purpose Prior {{research}} {{emphasizes that}} organizational founders {{have a good}} deal of influence in organizational development and, where ICTs are involved, a generic strategy is usually deployed by managers {{in order to deal with}} any resistance that might occur. Cognisant of this, we investigated the role played by a Managing Director of an SME consultancy in an ICT project associated with organizational development. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an ethnography of a ICT related change management initiative which, theoretically, takes into account though from the social shaping of technology – speifically the idea that technologies in their broadest sense are subject to ongoing work beyond the design stage. Findings We argue that Markus’ Interaction Theory of resistance still has relevance today and we extend it by emphasizing the problem of homogenizing users and downplaying their ability to appropriate resistance strategies in situ. Research limitations/implications Our study is based upon one group of individual’s experiences. Further case studies of resistance success are required which further highlight how such this is achieved and why. Practical implications Those engaged with organisational development projects need to be better educated as to the reasons for resistance, particularly positive ones, and the methods by which this might take place. Originality/value This study conceptualises strategies for ‘overcoming’ resistance as managerial technologies.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] develop a dynamic {{model in which}} Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) servicemembers incur a random amount of combat stress during each month of <b>deployement,</b> develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if their cumulative stress exceeds a servicemember-specific threshold, and then develop symptoms of PTSD after an additional time lag. Using Department of Defense deployment data and Mental Health Advisory Team PTSD data to calibrate the model, we predict [...] because of the long time lags {{and the fact that}} some surveyed servicemembers expeerience additional combat after being surveyed [...] the fraction of Amry soldiers and Marines who eventually suffer from PTSD will be approximately twice as large as in the raw survey data. We cannot put a confidence interval around this estimate, but there is considerable uncertainty (perhaps plus/minus 30 %). The estimate PTSD rate translates into approximately 300, 000 PTSD cases among all Army soldiers and Marines in OIF, with approximately 20, 000 new cases each year the war is prolonged. The heterogeneity of threshold levels among servicemembers suggests that although multiple deployments raise an individual's risk of PTSD, in aggregate, multiple deployments lower the total number of PTSD by approximately 30 % relative to a hypothetical case in which the war was fought with many more servicemembers (i. e., a draft) deploying only once. The time lag dynamics suggest that, in aggregate, reserve servicemembers show symptoms aproximately 1 - 2 years before active servicemembers and predict that greater than 75 % of OIF servicemembers who self-reported symptoms during their second deployment were exposed to the PTSD-generating stress during their first deployment.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{position}} of nodes in a WSN is crucial in most wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. The gathered information needs to be associated with a particular location in a specific time instant in order to appropiately control de surveillance area. Moreover, WSNs may be used for tracking certain objects in monitoring applications, which also requires the incorporation of location information of the sensor nodes into the tracking algorithms. These requisites make localizacion and tracking two of the most important tasks of WSN. Despite of the large research efforts that have been made in this field, considerable technical challenges continue existing in subjects areas like data processing or communications. This thesis is mainly concerned with some of these technical problems. Specifically, we study three different challenges: sensor deployment, model independent localization and sensor selection. The first part of the work is focused on the task of sensor <b>deployement.</b> This is considered critical since it affects cost, detection, and localization accuracy of a WSN. There have been significant research efforts on deploying sensors from different points of view, e. g. connectivity or target detection. However, in the context of target localization, we believe it is more convenient to deploy the sensors in views of obtaining the best estimation possible on the target positioning. Therefore, in this work we suggest an analysis of the deployment {{from the standpoint of the}} error in {{the position}} estimation. To this end, we suggest the application of the modified Cram´er-Rao bound (MCRB) in a sensor network to perform a prior analysis of the system operation in the localization task. This analysis provides knowledge about the system behavior without a complete deployment. It also provides essential information to select fundamental parameters properly, like the number of sensors. To do so, a complete formulation of the modified information matrix (MFIM) and MCRB is developed for the most common measurement models, such as received signal strength (RSS), time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA). In addition, this formulation is extended for heterogeneous models that combine different measurement models. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of the proposed analysis and point out the similarity between MCRB and CRB. Secondly, we address the problem of target localization which encompasses many of the challenging issues which commonly arise in WSN. Consequently, many localization algorithms have been proposed in the literature each one oriented towards solving these issues. Nevertheless, it have seen tahta the localization performance of above methods usually relies heavily on the availability of accurate knowledge regarding the observation model. When errors in the measurement model are present, their target localization accuracy is degraded significantly. To overcome this problem, we proposed a novel localization algorithm to be used in applications where the measurement model is not accurate or incomplete. The independence of the algorithm from the model provides robustness and versatility. In order to do so, we apply radial basis functions (RBFs) interpolation to evaluate the measurement function in the entire surveillance area, and estimate the target position. In addition, we also propose the application of LASSO regression to compute the weigths of the RBFs and improve the generalization of the interpolated function. Simulation results have demonstrated the good performance of the proposed algorithm in the localization of single or multiples targets. Finally, we study the sensor selection problem. In order to prolong the network lifetime, sensors alternate their state between active and idle. The decision of which sensor should be activated is based on a variety of factors depending on the algorithm or the sensor application. Therefore, here we investigate the centralized selection of sensors in target-tracking applications over huge networks where a large number of randomly placed sensors are available for taking measurements. Specifically, we focus on the application of optimization algorithms for the selection of sensors using a variant of the CRB, the Posterior CRB (PCRB), as the performance-based optimization criteria. This bound provides the performance limit on the mean square error (MSE) for any unbiased estimator of a random parameter, and is iteratively computed by a particle filter (in our case, by a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter). In this work we analyze, and compare, three optimization algorithms: a genetic algorithm (GA), the particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a new discrete-variant of the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. In addition, we propose a local-search versions of the previous optimization algorithms that provide a significant reduction of the computation time. Lastly, simulation results demonstrate the utility of these optmization algorithm to solve a sensor selection problem and point out the reduction of the computation time when local search is applied.

Recientes avances en electrónica y en comunicaciones inalámbricas han permitido de desarrollo de sensores de bajo coste, baja potencia y multiples funciones, de reducido tamaño y con capacidades de comunicación a cortas distancias. Estos sensores, desplegados en gran número y unidos a través de comunicaciones inalámbricas, proporcionan grandes oportunidades en aplicaciones como la monitorización y el control de casas, ciudades o el medio ambiente.
