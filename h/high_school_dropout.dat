50|$|<b>High</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> {{are less}} likely to be active labor force {{participants}} and are more likely to be unemployed than their more educated counterparts. The current unemployment rate for <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> is about 56 percent greater than that for <b>high</b> <b>school</b> completers. Lifetime earnings for this group are estimated to be $260,000 less than those for <b>high</b> <b>school</b> graduates. Female <b>dropouts</b> are much more likely to become single mothers and consequently be more likely to have an income under the poverty threshold or live on welfare. <b>High</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> make up 68 percent of the nation’s prison population. Nearly 37% of dropouts live in poor/near poor families. Additionally, <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> have a life expectancy that is 3-5 years shorter than <b>high</b> <b>school</b> graduates.|$|R

Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcé.|$|E

3000|$|... 29 The {{implication}} that relative wage effects are proportional to relative supply shifts suggests {{that one should}} be skeptical when evaluating the empirical evidence reported in the literature. After all, {{it is easy to}} manipulate results by defining skill groups in ways that either accentuate the relative supply shift or that mask it. This point was first illustrated in Borjas et al. (1997). Their simulations show that the wage effect of immigration in the United States is much greater when one compares <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> {{to the rest of the}} workforce than when one compares <b>high</b> <b>school</b> “equivalents” to the rest of the workforce. The difference arises because “high school equivalents” typically include both <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> and <b>high</b> <b>school</b> graduates. Although there has been a substantial influx of foreign-born <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts,</b> their numerical importance is obviously very different if the competing group consists only of native <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> or if it also includes the millions of native <b>high</b> <b>school</b> graduates.|$|R
