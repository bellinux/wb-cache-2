5|$|In {{the planned}} {{offensive}} on the Sangro, C Squadron was {{to follow the}} 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03:00. Although its tanks reached the river, they bogged down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi. Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was {{to make contact with}} the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. In the morning, the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop was held up by shelling south of Elici.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} attacks had been {{successful}} and as Allied commanders began {{to believe that}} a breakthrough was possible further attacks were made at Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire. Both attacks were ultimately doomed to failure, with heavy casualties, as the attacks foundered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> as the battle petered out, it was decided {{that it was time for}} the Australians to be withdrawn from the line. This was completed by 14 November 1917. Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres, they had suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E

5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide paused {{briefly in the}} Eocene. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the {{resulting}} broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains. Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant. Oxidation of the iron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> silt turned the soil into hematite, giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up-to- -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos. Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide-rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{across the}} Jordan River {{was completed by}} the evening of 2 April leaving bridgeheads at Ghoraniye and Makhadet Hajlah. The infantry and mounted forces had marched and fought almost continuously <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> rain for ten days and had suffered almost as much in both the advance and retreat. Shea's force had expended 587,338 rounds of small-arms ammunition (SAA), brought back four field guns, 700 prisoners including 20 officers and 595 other ranks along with 10 machine guns two automatic rifles, 207 rifles and 248,000 rounds of SAA. The German and Ottoman forces abandoned two travelling field cookers, 26 motor lorries, five motor cars and many horse-drawn wagons on the Amman road and an Ottoman aircraft was captured on the Hejaz railway.|$|E
25|$|At 18:00 two RAAF UH-1B Iroquois piloted by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley arrived over D Company's {{location}} {{with the}} ammunition resupply, and guided by red smoke thrown by the infantry, they {{hovered in the}} heavy rain just above the rubber trees near a small clearing. Because {{they were to be}} dropped from some height, the wooden outer crates—which were still banded with metal straps—were wrapped in blankets for the wounded. Aboard the helicopters the 6 RAR Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One George Chinn, and the officer commanding Administration Company, Major Owen O'Brien, pushed the crates out to the soldiers waiting below, many of whom were now very low on ammunition. The boxes landed in the centre of the position and the RAAF pilots were later praised for their skill and daring. Riley was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Dohle was mentioned in despatches (MiD). Yet, without tools to cut the straps, the infantry had to smash the crates open using machetes or the butts of their rifles to get to the inner metal boxes. Under heavy fire Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, the Company Sergeant Major, and Sergeant Neill Rankin, the 12 Platoon sergeant, began to distribute the ammunition. However, while the machine-gun rounds were pre-loaded in belts, the rifle rounds were still in bandoliers, complicating Kirby's job and forcing the soldiers to reload their own magazines as they struggled to keep the ammunition clean <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> rain. The resupply retrieved the situation for D Company. Prior to its arrival they had been down to their last 100 rounds, but with it complete the Australians resumed firing, forcing the Viet Cong back for a third time.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{both the}} on-set and post-production sound was poorly recorded. Anderegg wrote that this, {{in combination with}} Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long shots or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. [...] "In effect," [...] Anderegg writes, [...] "Welles generates a constant tension between what we see and what we hear, a tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action." [...] During the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence Welles used a complex and layered soundtrack that included the sounds of swords and armor clanking, soldiers grunting and screaming, bones breaking, boots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> the film's musical score {{to add to the}} chaos of the scene.|$|E

The airstrip proved a perfect defensive location, offering a wide, clear field of fire, while at its end, thick mud served to prevent the movement of Japanese tanks. Around dawn the advancing Japanese troops reached the airstrip and, {{under the cover of}} field artillery and mortars, they launched an attack. Although the Australians did not know it, the tanks that were supporting the attack became stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> were subsequently abandoned; they would later be discovered by an Australian patrol on 29 August.

500|$|Immediately to {{the north}} of the Canadian Corps, the {{supporting}} attack by XVIII Corps involved one brigade each from the British 63rd and 58th divisions. The British 188th Brigade, 63rd Division quickly captured Varlet Farm and Banff House. The centre of the attack was held up on the road between Bray Farm and the village of Wallemolen and dug-in near Source Trench. As dark fell, Banff House was abandoned and the line reformed at Berks House, leaving Banff House and Source Trench the only part of the first objective not captured. Further north, the 58th Division took three pillboxes at Cameron House, before being stopped at Spider crossroads by German machine-gun fire and exhaustion due to the muddy conditions.

In concert with a company from 2/43rd, five tanks struck out from Pabu on 2 December. The tanks were kept in reserve at this stage and one broke down early in the advance. Together, the force penetrated close to the Lakes, but a Japanese force moved to cut off their rear, forcing them back. A second company from the 2/43rd, also with tank support, was then thrown forward to conduct a move to flank towards the larger of the two water features, approaching from the south. [...] The Japanese were positioned in strength in a heavily wooded area and began firing on the Australians with machine guns, which pinned them down until two tanks came up and destroyed the Japanese position, firing from point blank range.
