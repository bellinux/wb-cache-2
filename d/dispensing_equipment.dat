40|$|Diabetes is a {{major health}} care {{challenge}} in India [1]. Majority of diabetics depend on primary care settings {{for the management of}} their condition. Management of diabetes could be challenging for primary care provider owing to its co morbidities. Present exploratory study assessed the availability of resources at the primary health care facilities in Odisha, for managing diabetes as well as explored primary care physicians challenges and constraints in managing this condition. Methods Thirty primary care centres in Odisha (ten from urban, semi urban and rural each) were randomly selected. Evaluation of facilities provided at their level was assessed by a modified version of PCET(Primary Care Evaluation Tool) [2] and descriptive statistics was com-puted. Additionally two Focus Group Discussion with 12 physicians of the study group was done using The-matic framework approach. Results It was found that majority of centres attend to more than 5000 patient population (28 out of 30). Though all of them attended to diabetic patients in their practice area, none had special diabetics clinics. Majority (28 out of 30) made use of clinical guidelines in their practice. However with their record keeping system most of them were unable to generate a list of diabetics in their practice area (21 out of 30). Availability of IEC material was quite low (3 out of 30). None of the centres had physiotherapist or nutritionist but majority (28 out of 30) had a pharmacist who only <b>dispensed</b> medicines. <b>Equipments</b> for basic tests like blood sugar estimation were available in 5 centres.

As a result of detection, research and the analysis of several thermal factors restricting heat-transmitting ability of evaporating-condensing type?s systems derived regularities and dependencies which define the values of the maximum heat fluxes as functions of design parameters, regime characteristics of processes, thermophysical properties of the environments, between which heat exchange is carried out and intermediate heat-carrier. Methods of improving of heat-transportation ability of evaporating-condensing systems, which based on creation of an effective capillary-arterial system and separation of the channels for passing of steam and condensate flows are researched and analyzed. The problem of optimization of parameters of capillary structure heat-transmitting element (HE) ECT {{from the point of view}} of minimization of its thermal resistance is set and decided. On the basis of regularities analysis of heat exchange processes are received dependences for determination of optimal ratio of the lengths of zone of evaporation and condensation HE of trumpet packet of heat-exchanging system, at which the system has minimal thermal resistance of heat transfer. The basic provisions of the methodology for thermal calculation of passive systems of heatsink ECT in relation to typical thermal schemes of heat transfer are received.

Some parts and components have been replaced and reorganized to reduce the size of the dispenser. The choice of a steep motor, which makes the rotation when a dosage is performed, is the largest contribution to shrink the size of the equipment. Also the new designed circuit board makes it possible to reduce the size of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment.</b> A LCD is used to show the current dose time. The LCD is a part of a LCD module.

40|$|Presented on October 24, 2012 from 4 - 5 pm in room G 011 of the Molecular Science and Engineering Building. Runtime: 63 : 32 minutesThe {{long-range}} {{goal of the}} Yager laboratory is to decentralize medical {{testing for}} improved health, improved quality of life, and reduction {{in the cost of}} healthcare in the developed and developing worlds. Our approach has been to apply microfluidics to biosensors for point-of-care medical diagnostics. To reduce the cost and complexity of the tests our work {{in the last three years}} has focused on expanding the capabilities of paper-based diagnostics. Wicking is a robust method for moving fluids that can be the basis of much more sophisticated chemical processing than has been employed in today’s lateral flow tests. Two-dimensional paper networks (2 DPNs) can perform complex chemical processes, but we keep the paper structures as simple as possible to minimize manufacturing costs. We are involved in two primary ongoing “demonstration projects”; both will develop 2 DPN-based diagnostics, and both are small sample-to-result disposable devices that will convert pathogen counts on a nasal swab to intensity of colored spots. Key features are that they will require almost no activity on the part of the end-user after inserting the swab, and they will <b>dispense</b> with support <b>equipment</b> except a camera-equipped smart phone if quantitative detection instruments is needed. One device will perform chemical signal amplification to provide a more sensitive and multiplexed immunoassay for influenza. Collaborators are designing protein-binding molecules superior to antibodies for incorporation into the 2 DPN. The other project incorporates isothermal nucleic acid amplification into the fully-disposable format, allowing detection of a few copies of specific nucleic acid sequences; our initial analytes are DNA from methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) or RNA from influenza. The devices will incorporate all functions, including swab elution, analyte isolation, amplification, and visible detection, and provide disposable heaters to support the amplification...|$|R
40|$|H{sub 2 }Gen, {{with the}} support of the Department of Energy, {{successfully}} designed, built and field-tested two steam methane reformers with 578 kg/day capacity, which has now become a standard commercial product serving customers in the specialty metals and PV manufacturing businesses. We demonstrated that this reformer/PSA system, when combined with compression, storage and <b>dispensing</b> (CSD) <b>equipment</b> could produce hydrogen that is already cost-competitive with gasoline per mile driven in a conventional (non-hybrid) vehicle. We further showed that mass producing this 578 kg/day system in quantities of just 100 units would reduce hydrogen cost per mile approximately 13 % below the cost of untaxed gasoline per mile used in a hybrid electric vehicle. If mass produced in quantities of 500 units, hydrogen cost per mile in a FCEV would be 20 % below the cost of untaxed gasoline in an HEV in the 2015 - 2020 time period using EIA fuel cost projections for natural gas and untaxed gasoline, and 45 % below the cost of untaxed gasoline in a conventional car. This 20 % to 45 % reduction in fuel cost per mile would accrue even though hydrogen from this 578 kg/day system would cost approximately $ 4. 14 /kg, well above the DOE hydrogen cost targets of $ 2. 50 /kg by 2010 and $ 2. 00 /kg by 2015. We also estimated the cost of a larger, 1, 500 kg/day SMR/PSA fueling system based on engineering cost scaling factors derived from the two H{sub 2 }Gen products, a commercial 115 kg/day system and the 578 kg/day system developed under this DOE contract. This proposed system could support 200 to 250 cars per day, similar to a medium gasoline station. We estimate that the cost per mile from this larger 1, 500 kg/day hydrogen fueling system would be 26 % to 40 % below the cost per mile of untaxed gasoline in an HEV and ICV respectively, even without any mass production cost reductions. In quantities of 500 units, we are projecting per mile cost reductions between 45 % (vs. HEVs) and 62 % (vs ICVs), with hydrogen costing approximately $ 2. 87 /kg, still above the DOE's 2010 $ 2. 50 /kg target. We also began laboratory testing of reforming ethanol, which we showed is currently the least expensive approach to making renewable hydrogen. Extended testing of neat ethanol in micro-reactors was successful, and we also were able to reform E- 85 acquired from a local fueling station for 2, 700 hours, although some modifications were required to handle the 15 % gasoline present in E- 85. We began initial tests of a catalyst-coated wall reformer tube that showed some promise in reducing the propensity to coke with E- 85. These coated-wall tests ran for 350 hours. Additional resources would be required to commercialize an ethanol reformer operating on E- 85, but there is no market for such a product at this time, so this ethanol reformer project was moth-balled pending future government or industry support. The two main objectives of this project were: (1) to design, build and test a steam methane reformer and pressure swing adsorption system that, if scaled up and mass produced, could potentially meet the DOE 2015 cost and efficiency targets for on-site distributed hydrogen generation, and (2) to demonstrate the efficacy of a low-cost renewable hydrogen generation system based on reforming ethanol to hydrogen at the fueling station...|$|R
