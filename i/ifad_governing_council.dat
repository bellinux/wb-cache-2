Therefore, a framework of integrated thinking and comprehensive measures {{have to be taken}} up to stimulate and promote the development and application of the arts, sciences and techniques of engineering, agriculture, economics, ecological and social sciences in managing water and land resources for irrigation, drainage, flood management for achieving sustainable irrigated agriculture as enshrined in the ICID mission. Global food security and water scarcity problems have to be considered and handled at local, national and international levels. Recent initiatives by some leading international institutions are very encouraging. Last December, the World Bank and OECD organized a workshop in Bogor, Indonesia with the theme ‘Sustainable water management for food security: An international policy dialogue on progressing water policy reform in agriculture’, with a focus on Indonesia. I attended the workshop and made a presentation on the ‘Reforms for Agricultural Water Management in China’. The 35 th session of <b>IFAD’s</b> <b>Governing</b> <b>Council</b> with the them...|$|R
5000|$|At the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in {{his role}} as {{director}} of the Agricultural Development Strategy, he helped develop a new strategic vision focused on pro-poor staple crops and small-holder farmers. The Guardian named him the most powerful figure in global agriculture, since under his leadership the Gates Foundation prioritized agriculture at the same level as its global health efforts, increasing annual payout to $400 million per year from $250 million per year. [...] Dryden's ability to reach out to critics like Pat Mooney and Grist, to explain the Gates Foundation's approach was as crucial as his strategic vision and management experience to reorient the agriculture program. Under his leadership, the Gates Foundation began an intensive engagement to bring the international food and agriculture system in service of increasing small-holder farmer productivity - refer, Bill Gates' Address to <b>IFAD's</b> <b>Governing</b> <b>Council</b> - to achieve the global hunger and poverty goals, as listed in the Millennium Declaration. These efforts helped reform and rejuvenate global institutions, like the CGIAR (which underwent significant reforms and doubled its budget), and the Gates Foundation developed strong partnerships with FAO under its new leader Jose Graziano da Silva, WFP under its new leader Ertharin Cousin, and IFAD under Kanayo Nwanze. The Gates Foundation also made some of its most innovative grants, like Digital Green, One Acre Fund, during Dryden's directorship- he continues this work in his new capacity as Imperial College Fellow to promote digital technologies to improve African food systems by better linking small-holders in the value chain. This work builds on the convening led by Kofi Annan and AU Chair Zuma in Addis Ababa.|$|R
