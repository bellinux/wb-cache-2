5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins {{her in the}} shower, the two have sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him {{to use it as}} his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique percussion cap pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E

Picasso replied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> vast, because he would fill it, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> severe, because as a Spaniard he liked sadness. When another art dealer Sam Katz paid him a visit, Picasso proudly proclaimed, [...] "Cézanne painted these mountains and now I own them." ...|$|R

25|$|There {{are four}} small walls to climb, {{but they may}} all be outflanked {{on the right side}} if the {{conditions}} are good. From the Western summit the flank seems nearly as forbidding as the wall itself, but at a close distance <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> difficult and no equipment should be necessary. However, on poor conditions, the Talus may be very loose and great caution is advised. On days with fresh snow, like the last picture, equipment will probably be necessary on all routes.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> {{much to say}} that, {{from the end of}} 1759 to the end of 1761, the unshakable {{firmness}} of the Russian Empress was the one constraining political force which held together the heterogeneous, incessantly jarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination. From the Russian point of view Elizabeth's greatness as a stateswoman consists in her steady appreciation of Russian interests, and her determination to promote them at all hazards. She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbors for the future, and {{that the only way to}} bring this about was to reduce him to the rank of a Prince-Elector.|$|E

25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E

500|$|Capuano {{considered}} {{running for}} Governor of Massachusetts in 2014. On January 21, 2013, former Mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts {{and member of}} the Massachusetts Governor's Council Michael Albano endorsed Capuano to run, posting on his Facebook page: [...] "while the Congressman has not made a decision to compete for the [...] nomination [...] at this time, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> early to make the case and encourage his candidacy." [...] When asked in February 2013 whether he might run for governor, Capuano responded: [...] "Part of me thinks that some of the more interesting, more important fights {{over the next several years}} might be conducted at statehouses around the country and not necessarily on Capitol Hill." [...] In a statement in September 2013, Capuano announced he would not run for governor, and would instead focus on running for re-election to Congress. His decision was attributed to his loss against Martha Coakley in the Democratic primary for Senate, virtually closing any possibility for running for higher office.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Ryan (Neil Patrick Harris), {{a former}} McKinley High glee club member, arrives as an auditor {{from the school}} board. He speaks to the glee club, asking {{everyone}} to write their biggest dream {{on a piece of}} paper. He then takes Artie's (Kevin McHale) paper and tosses it into the trash, making a point that their dreams will never come true. Having failed to realize his own dreams, he intends to cut the glee club. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) convinces him that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> late to pursue his dreams and sings [...] "Piano Man" [...] with him. They both audition for the role of Jean Valjean in the local production of Les Misérables, singing [...] "Dream On" [...] as a duet. Bryan decides not to cut the glee club, and even presents them with new costumes and sheet music, but changes his mind when cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) announces that Will landed the lead role.

500|$|The {{slotted line}} works by {{sampling}} the electric field inside {{the transmission line}} with the probe. [...] For accuracy, {{it is important that}} the probe disturbs the field as little as possible. [...] For this reason the probe diameter and slot width are kept small (usually around [...] ) and the probe is inserted in no further than necessary. [...] It is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place the slot at a position where the current in the waveguide walls is parallel to the slot. [...] The current will then not be disturbed by the presence of the slot as long as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> wide. [...] For the dominant mode this is on the centre-line of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some other modes it may need to be off-centre. [...] This is not an issue for the co-axial line because this operates in the TEM (transverse electromagnetic) mode and hence the current is everywhere parallel to the slot. [...] The slot may be tapered at its ends to avoid discontinuities causing reflections.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{prefers to}} work from a plot rather than from a full script, a result of Ann Nocenti's dense Longshot scripts, though he has worked from a full script, as with his work on Three Dimensional Alien Worlds for Pacific Comics and The Authority. Though he says he prefers group books because they more easily allow him to hide his [...] "bad layout skills", he is {{nonetheless}} comfortable with solo character books. He begins drawing thumbnail layouts from the story he is given, either {{at home or in}} a public place. The thumbnails range in size from 2inches x 3inches to half the size of the printed comic book. He or an assistant will then enlarge the thumbnails and trace them onto illustration board with a non-photo blue pencil, sometimes using a Prismacolor light blue pencil, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> waxy, and erases easily. When working on the final illustration board, he does so on a large drawing board when in his basement studio, and a lapboard when sitting on his living room couch. After tracing the thumbnails, he will then clarify details with another light blue pencil, and finalize the details with a Number 2 pencil. He drew the first three chapters of [...] "Jonni Future" [...] at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, [...] "The Garden of the Sklin", at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. For a large poster image with a multitude of characters, he will go over the figure outlines with a marker in order to emphasize them. He will use photographic reference when appropriate, as when he draws things that he is not accustomed to.|$|E
