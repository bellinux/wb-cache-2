5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises {{spurred on by}} civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> chancellor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Fox network into doing clip shows to save money.

Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E

The two remaining wagons will be preserved and displayed at the Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it would cost about NOK50 million {{to keep them in}} operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting the wagons for 22 million NOK each year, even though they were not in operation.

The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E

5|$|Lampugnano, {{unfortunately}} for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} the gradual decline in the {{development}} of Sicily's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, {{to the detriment of the}} abandoned estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife, Sicily had declined to the point of no return long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were kept at bay from Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and Sicily was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first taxes, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E

5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with the Dutch. The villages saw that it was in their {{interest}} to maintain good relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced {{conversions}} in the Crown of Aragon happened during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the conversions <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine {{the validity of the}} conversions. The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the conversions, putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a choice when confronted by the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the conversions happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|E
5|$|Verdugo, {{having been}} <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Union of Arras – {{formed by the}} Dutch provinces loyal to Spanish King Philip II, who wanted the foreign troops out the Netherlands – to hand over his {{regiment}} to his brother-in-law Charles von Mansfeld, recruited a regiment of 2,000 Walloon arquebusiers {{and made his way}} to Friesland. While mustering his infantry in the village of Kerpen, Verdugo learned that the Dutch rebels were leving a company of German reiters – a type of armoured cavalry armed with pistols – in Cologne under a rittmeister called Adam von Langen. As he lacked cavalry or pikemen and it was reported by Spanish agents that von Langen was angry because he had been paid by the Dutch with false coins, Verdugo managed to convince the rittmeister to escort his arquebusiers to Groningen. Passing through Bredevoort and Coevorden, Verdugo and his regiment reached Groningen. There, Verdugo was met with a mutiny, which he ended by distributing 40,000 escudos amongst the mutineers, disbanding an undisciplined German regiment and giving license to two companies of men-at-arms to join Farnese's army in Hainault. With the loyal troops, meanwhile, he took two Dutch forts, one {{at the mouth of the}} Emden and another near Groningen.|$|E
