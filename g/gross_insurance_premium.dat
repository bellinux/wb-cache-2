40|$|AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE. GOOD DRIVER PREMIUMS. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Requires {{motor vehicle}} {{insurers}} to base insurance premiums primarily upon driving record of applicant. Requires insurance be sold to, and 25 % reduction in premiums for, drivers with good driving records as specified. Requires proof of financial responsibility upon vehicle registration. Creates consumer information system and provides for insurance company funding for increased {{investigation and prosecution}} of fraudulent insurance claims. Suspends driving privilege of persons under 21 involved in, among other offenses, alcohol or controlled substance related driving offenses. Requires insurers to exercise good faith and fair dealing in claims settlements. Contains other provisions. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The effect of this measure on General Fund revenues from <b>gross</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> taxes currently paid by insurance companies is unknown, since information is unavailable {{on the amount of}} insurance premiums paid by good drivers. Adoption of this measure would increase the administrative costs for the Department of Insurance approximately $ 2 million annually, payable from the Insurance Fund, and the Department of Motor Vehicles approximately $ 6 to $ 8 million annually, payable from the State Transportation Fund.

40|$|FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY EVIDENCE. REPEAL OF LAW. INITIATIVE STATUTE. This {{initiative}} repeals the 2 ̆ 2 ROBBINS MC ALISTER FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT. 2 ̆ 2 The Robbins-McAlister Financial Responsibility Act requires each {{motor vehicle}} driver to have, and under specified conditions produce, evidence of financial {{responsibility for the}} vehicle, meaning proof of liability insurance, a surety bond, self insurance or other specified means of financial responsibility, meeting certain requirements. The act also contains other provisions. This initiative declares automobile insurance is to be no longer mandatory and that a person 2 ̆ 7 s drivers license shall never be suspended for any cause except unsafe driving. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Annual <b>gross</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> tax revenues could be reduced by about 2 million. This fiscal effect may vary significantly, up or down, depending {{on the cost of}} insurance coverage for financial responsibility and motorists 2 ̆ 7 reaction to the repeal. Department of Motor Vehicles would have a net revenue loss of about 1 million, accruing to the State Transportation Fund 2 ̆ 7 s Motor Vehicle Account.

Adoption of this measure would result in an initial appropriation of $ 10 million from the Insurance Fund, with $ 8 million to the Department of Insurance and $ 2 million to the Department of Justice for administrative costs. Thereafter, administrative costs for the Department of Insurance would increase approximately $ 7 million annually and $ 2 million annually for the Department of Justice, payable from the Insurance Fund.

40|$|Natural hazards are {{the main}} threat for forest all over theworld. Some of these {{disturbances}} may be insured suchas fire and/or storm in some European countries. However, forest insurance has trouble to spread in particularbecause {{of the existence of}} some brakes such as the forest <b>insurance</b> <b>premium,</b> often considered as too highcompared to the profitability of the forest investment. In this context, we propose an actuarial insurancemodel to insure multiple natural hazards (windthrow, fire, insect outbreak) in forests that determine theinsurance premium in different senarios. In particular, the scenarios differ in terms of the link between thehazards, either they are mutually independent or dependent, {{and in terms of the}} parametric solutions to theactuarial problem, either a discrete time period approach or a continuous one. We propose an application ofthe actuarial model to a silver fir (Abies Alba Mill.) stand in the Slovak Paradise region (Slovakia).

The same report reveals that demand for cyber insurance is expected to double by 2020.

For example, a 2015 study of 350 companies from 11 countries revealed the average cost of a data breach is $ 3.8 million [3]. While data breaches take the headlines, there are a multitude of other risks ranging from cyber extortion to unintended virus propagation, many of which can be covered by a range of new cyber insurance policies [4].|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by a problem concerning the monotonicity of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> {{with respect to their}} loading parameter: the larger the parameter, the larger the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is expected to be. This property, usually called loading monotonicity, is satisfied by premiums that appear in the literature. The increased interest in constructing new <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> has raised a question as to what weight functions would produce loading-monotonic premiums. In this paper we demonstrate a decisive role of log-supermodularity in answering this question. As a consequence, we establish - at a stroke - the loading monotonicity of a number of well-known <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and offer a host of further weight functions, and consequently of premiums, thus illustrating the power of the herein suggested methodology for constructing loading-monotonic <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} risk management and monitoring costs on insurer’s monitoring activities and investigates the relationship between risk management and monitoring activities and setting {{the level of the}} <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> The main results of this article are as follows. First, a firm always undertakes risk management when the risk management cost is low. Second, when the insurer can spontaneously choose the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm decreases, and risk management activities will not be promoted, because the cost of the accident can be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> In contrast, when the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is exogenously decided, the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm increases and risk management activities will be promoted, because the cost of accidents cannot be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> These results have the following implications for policy making. First, the results imply that policy should be designed to lower risk management costs by offering a platform for firms to exchange useful information with each other and/or reduce taxes for investments that lower risk management costs. Second, the results imply that both heavy <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> regulation and the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> deregulation to realize a fierce competitive insurance market are desirable for promoting risk management activities...|$|R

5000|$|Where {{the life}} {{insurance}} is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held {{outside of the}} superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible.

These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> This means that no additional deductible contributions {{can be made for}} the funding of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions.
