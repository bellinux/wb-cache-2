5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (<b>dracunculiasis).</b> However, his main interest was Tropical sprue. But {{he was unable to}} determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925.|$|E
5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include rabies, and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause leishmaniasis in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with Dracunculus medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause <b>dracunculiasis</b> in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading coenurosis in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E

Though not as common, other regularly treated diseases include <b>dracunculiasis,</b> dysentery, river blindness or onchocerciasis, several kinds of pneumonia, dehydration, venereal diseases, and poliomyelitis.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole (MNZ), marketed {{under the}} brand name Flagyl among others, is an {{antibiotic}} and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for <b>dracunculiasis,</b> giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is the drug of choice for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile colitis. Metronidazole is available by mouth, as a cream, and intravenously.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dracunculiasis,</b> {{also called}} Guinea-worm disease (GWD), is an {{infection}} by the Guinea worm. A person becomes infected when they drink water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae. Initially {{there are no}} symptoms. About one year later, the person develops a painful burning feeling as the female worm forms a blister in the skin, usually on a lower limb. The worm then emerges from the skin {{over the course of}} a few weeks. During this time, it may be difficult to walk or work. It is very uncommon for the disease to cause death.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015 {{there were}} 22 {{reported}} cases of the disease while in 2016 there were 25. This is down from an estimated 3.5 million cases in 1986. In 2016 the disease occurred in three countries, all in Africa, down from 20 countries in the 1980s. It will likely be the first parasitic disease to be globally eradicated. Guinea worm disease has been known since ancient times. It is mentioned in the Egyptian medical Ebers Papyrus, dating from 1550BC. The name <b>dracunculiasis</b> {{is derived from the}} Latin [...] "affliction with little dragons", while the name [...] "guinea worm" [...] appeared after Europeans saw the disease on the Guinea coast of West Africa in the 17th century. Other Dracunculus species are known to infect various mammals, but do not appear to infect humans. <b>Dracunculiasis</b> is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Because dogs may also become infected, the eradication program is monitoring and treating dogs as well.|$|E
