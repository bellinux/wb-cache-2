50|$|Two vocal subordinationists were Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia. Of these, Eusebius of Caesarea {{was more}} {{moderate}} in his subordinationist views. Although not as extreme as the Arians {{in his definition}} of who Jesus is, he disagreed with the Modalists in equating Jesus with his Father in authority or person but he was flexible concerning ousia (substance). The Trinitarians also opposed Modalism, but insisted on the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> and the Father by nature (though they generally allowed that the Son was relationally subordinate to the Father ast to his authority). For the reasons of him being moderate in the religious and political spectrum of beliefs, Constantine I turned to Eusebius of Caesarea {{to try to make}} peace between the Arians and the Trinitarians at Nicaea I.|$|E
50|$|The {{attempt to}} trace his {{genealogy}} back to Eleazar, <b>the</b> third <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Aaron, {{as opposed to}} Abiathar, his contemporary and colleague, who {{was regarded as a}} descendant of Eli and considered a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Ithamar, was first made by the Chronicler (I Chronicles 5:30-34 V. vi. 4-8; comp. 6:35-38 V. 6:50-53), thus assuring <b>the</b> preeminence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zadokites over <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> Eli. In <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> his career he was associated with Abiathar (2 Samuel 20:25) and with his son (ib. 8:17; I Chron. 24:3, 6, 31). The hypothesis has accordingly been advanced that Zadok officiated in the Tabernacle at Gibeon (I Chron. 16:39; comp. I Kings 3:4), while <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> Eli were stationed as high priests at Jerusalem or, more probably, at Shiloh (compare Keil on I Kings 1:8) Such a division of functions is very doubtful, however; and it is more plausible to suppose that Zadok gradually won <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rank with <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> Eli by his good fortune in gaining <b>the</b> favor <b>of</b> David.|$|R
40|$|In the New Testament and in {{the early}} church fathers’ writings, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> is {{understood}} to be ontologically equal to the Father and subordinate to him. Whether understood as ingenerate-generate, sender-sent, commanded-obedient, subordination shows the distinction between <b>the</b> Father and <b>Son.</b> As seen in church history, minimizing these distinctions can lead to modalism and pressing them too far leads to Arianism. In the Bible, obedience or subordination does not mean ontologically inferior. Rather, obedience results from faith and love. Although some fathers connected obedience to Christ’s humanity, they were doing so while rejecting the Arian argument that the Son’s obedience meant he was ontologically inferior. They affirmed <b>the</b> voluntary obedience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> as an expression of his love for the Father and rejected any sense of coercion or determinism. <b>The</b> doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eternal generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> from <b>the</b> Father’s ousia held together <b>the</b> <b>equality</b> and subordination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> to <b>the</b> Father. Beginning with Christ’s atoning work rather than metaphysics, P. T. Forsyth and Jürgen Moltmann believe that the Son’s obedience is crucial for the atonement to be <b>the</b> free act <b>of</b> grace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sovereign God. Because <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> Son’s obedience must be divine, and thus eternal. Otherwise, the obedience would be from Christ’s humanity, and humanity would contribute in inappropriate ways to the atonement. They also believe that subordination, obedience, humility, and servanthood complete <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> divine love. <b>The</b> unity provided by the same divine love is expressed according to <b>the</b> particularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Person. In the Trinitarian relationship, the Son’s eternal obedience is his free response to the Father. Here subordination is not oppression, but perfect love freely given to the perfect Lover. This fuller conception of divine love that a proper emphasis on obedience affords has great potential to help Trinitarain theology contribute to <b>the</b> elimination <b>of</b> oppression and <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> human relationships and to do so {{in a manner consistent with}} the biblical witness...|$|R
