40|$|A micromachined {{gyroscope}} {{in which}} a <b>high-speed</b> <b>spinning</b> rotor is suspended electrostatically in a vacuum cavity usually functions as a dual-axis angular rate sensor. An inherent coupling error between the two sensing axes exists owing to the angular motion of the spinning rotor being controlled by a torque-rebalance loop. In this paper, a decoupling compensation method is proposed and investigated experimentally based on an electrostatically suspended micromachined gyroscope. In order to eliminate the negative spring effect inherent in the gyroscope dynamics, a stiffness compensation scheme was utilized in design of the decoupled rebalance loop to ensure loop stability and increase suspension stiffness. The experimental results show an overall stiffness increase of 30. 3 % after compensation. A decoupling method comprised of inner- and outer-loop decoupling compensators is proposed to minimize the cross-axis coupling error. The inner-loop decoupling compensator aims to attenuate the angular position coupling. The experimental frequency response shows a position coupling attenuation by 14. 36 dB at 1 Hz. Moreover, the cross-axis coupling between the two angular rate output signals can be attenuated theoretically from − 56. 2 dB down to − 102 dB by further appending the outer-loop decoupling compensator.

Development of effective countermeasures for use against infrared (IR) missiles is hindered by the difficulty inherent in testing tactical missiles.

This thesis describes an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) compact enough to be mounted on board a 4. 5 inch missile.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{spinning}} of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibres at high speeds, {{and the effects of}} the spinning parameters on the fibre properties. Polyethylene fibres with strengths up to 7. 2 GPa can be produced in a gel-spinning and hot-drawing procedure. In this procedure the polyethylene is dissolved in paraffin oil, {{in order to reduce the}} number of intermolecular entanglements which is necessary in order to obtain high draw ratios and tensile properties, and subsequently a fibre is spun from this solution, which is extracted and hot-drawn. The hot-drawing process, in which the molecules are aligned in the fibre direction, however, is a time consuming procedure, and the question arose whether it would be possible to apply the recently developed <b>high-speed</b> <b>spinning</b> technique on the elastic polyethylene solutions. In this process the spinline is stretched to very high ratios and at very high rates, and a fully oriented and crystalline fibre is obtained in a one step procedure. The aim of this thesis is to gain insight in the rheological phenomena that occur when solutions of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene are exposed to elongational flow fields, and to use this insight to obtain strong fibres at high speeds in a one step process. This research led to the production of fibres with strengths up to 2. 8 GPa, Young’s moduli up to 70 GPa and elongations at break of 5. 5 % at 2250 m/min. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of magic angle sample spinning (MAS) NMR to uniformly aligned biomembrane samples is demonstrated {{as a new}} general approach toward structural studies of membrane proteins, peptides, and lipids. The spectral linewidth from a multilamellar lipid dispersion is dominated, {{in the case of}} protons, by the dipolar coupling. For low-gamma or dilute spins, however, the chemical shift anisotropy dominates the spectral linewidth, which is reduced by the two-dimensional order in a uniformly aligned lipid membrane. The remaining line broadening, which is due to orientational defects ("mosaic spread") can be easily removed at low spinning speeds. This orientational order in the sample also allows the anisotropic intermolecular motions of membrane components (such as rotational diffusion, tauc = 10 (- 10) s) for averaging dipolar interactions to be utilized, e. g., by placing the membrane normal parallel to the rotor axis. The dramatic resolution improvement for protons which are achieved in a lipid sample at only 220 Hz spinning speed in a 9. 4 T field is slightly better than any data published to date using ultra-high fields (up to 17. 6 T) and <b>high-speed</b> <b>spinning</b> (14 kHz). Additionally, the analysis of spinning sidebands provides valuable orientational information. We present the first 1 H, 31 P, and 13 C MAS spectra of uniformly aligned dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers. Also, 1 H resolution enhancement for the aromatic region of the M 13 coat protein reconstituted into DMPC bilayers is presented.

Zunyite contains Si 5 O 16 pentamers and harkerite contains AlSi 4 (O,OH) (16) pentamers. These pentameric groups are unique because their T-O-Si angles are almost 180 degrees. Chemical analysis of the zunyite sample shows that it has excess Al: the A-Si ratio is 2. 9, compared with the ideal of 2. 6. <b>High-speed</b> <b>spinning</b> Al- 27 MAS NMR spectra (11 - 13 kHz) showed two more signals than the spectra obtained by Kunwar et al. (1984). The signal with delta(iso) = 46. 8 +/- 0. 5 ppm represents the excess Al, which enters the central Si 1 site of the Si 5 O 16 pentamer. This assumption is confirmed {{by the fact that}} delta(iso) of Al in the AlSi 4 (O,OH) (16) pentamer in harkerite is 44 +/- 1 ppm. Additional proof comes from comparing the electrostatic energy and the quadrupole interaction of Al in either a Si 1 or Si 2 configuration. The Al site in the pentamers of zunyite and harkerite can be considered as a q(4) (4 Si) site. In this case, Al-O-Si angles are correlated with the Al- 27 chemical shift (Lippmaa et al., 1986). This correlation holds well for the Al- 27 data for harkerite. The value for zunyite indicates that the structure adapts to the incorporation of Al in the Si 1 site by a narrowing of the A 1 -O-Si angle to 171 +/- 2. 5 degrees.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{focuses on}} the {{theoretical}} analysis, design, fabrication and characterization of a small Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid damper. It can be potentially applied to a horizontal axis, front-loading washing machine. In such washing machines, although washing cycle is slow, spin cycle is much faster. During acceleration from washing cycle to spin cycle, the tub passes through its resonant speed requiring relatively high damping. On the other hand, high damping results in increased force transmission to the housing and noise at <b>high-speed</b> <b>spin</b> cycle. Controllability of the MR fluid damper allows adjustment of damping requirements for different cycles and helps to reduce the noise at high speed spin cycle while limiting the tub motion at resonance.
