5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds</b> to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds,</b> and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds.</b> This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds</b> form between guanine and cytosine. As <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds</b> are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E

5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds,</b> whereas cytosine and guanine form three <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds.</b> The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds,</b> and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds</b> with two neighboring molecules instead of one.

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds</b> to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonds</b> to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> on the amide group {{vibrational}} spectra {{has traditionally been}} rationalized by invoking a resonance model where <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> impacts the amide functional group by stabilizing its [- O-C=NH +] structure over the [O=C-NH] structure. However, Triggs and Valentini's UV-Raman study of solvation and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> effects on e-caprolactum, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), and N-methylacetamide (NMA) (Triggs, N. E.; Valentini, J. J. J. Phys.

In this study, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) calculations to {{examine the impact of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> on the C=O and N-H functional groups of NMA, which is typically used as a simple model of the peptide bond. Our calculations indicate that, as expected, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> frequency dependence of the AmI vibration predominantly derives from the C=O group, whereas the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> frequency dependence of the AmII vibration primarily derives from N-H <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding.</b> In contrast, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> dependence of the conformation-sensitive AmIII band derives equally from both C=O and N-H groups and thus, is equally responsive to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> at the C=O or N-H site.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Quantification of {{backbone}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond</b> energies {{in protein}} folding has remained elusive despite extensive theoretical and experimental investigations {{over the past}} 70 years. This is due to difficulties in experimental mutagenesis study {{as well as the}} lack of quantitatively reliable methods in theoretical calculation. Recent advance in experiment has enabled accurate measurement of site-specific backbone <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond</b> energy in protein. In the present work, we developed an accurate and practical polarizable method to study site-specific <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond</b> energies in the PIN WW domain. Excellent quantitative agreement between our calculated <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> energy and recent experimental measurement is obtained. The direct comparison between theory and experiment helps uncover the microscopic mechanism of experimentally observed context dependent <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond</b> contribution to protein stability in beta-sheet. In particular, our study reveals two effects that act in a cooperative manner to impact the strength of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond.</b> One is the dynamic stability of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond</b> determined by nearby solvent molecules, and the other is the polarization state of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond</b> influenced by local electrostatic environment. The polar character of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bond</b> results in strong coupling between hydrophobic and polarization interactions in a cooperative manner. This nonadditive character in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bonding</b> should help us better understand the microscopic mechanism in protein folding.
