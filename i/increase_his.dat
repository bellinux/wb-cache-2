Anna left with the children and moved to Paris where van Meegeren visited his children from time to time. He now dedicated himself to portraiture and began producing forgeries to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> income.|$|E
5|$|Circumstances would, however, <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> fortune even further. Beauchamp's son Henry, who {{had married}} the younger Richard's sister Cecily, died in 1446. When Henry's {{daughter}} Anne died in 1449, Richard also found himself jure uxoris Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E

5|$|Many voters {{decried the}} bill as a self-serving attempt by Goebel to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> {{political}} power, {{and the election}} board remained a controversial issue until its abolition in a special session of the legislature in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, while the ship is visiting the planet Ligon II to retrieve a vaccine, crewman Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) is abducted by the leader of the Ligonians. The race abide by a strict code of honor, and their leader seeks to use Yar as a pawn to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> own personal power.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an in-game clock and day-night system {{that affects the}} townsfolk {{and some of the}} creatures in the field (namely, the Minku - creatures from whom Musashi can obtain berries to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> overall health stat), as well as forcing the player to pay attention to Musashi's fatigue rating that goes up over time with lack of sleep, which as the name implies will have a deteriorating effect on his combative ability.|$|E

At present the pilots, though talented, performed more as individuals. After flying {{for the first time}} with them Bloomfield promised to have him allocated to a position of Flight Commander. He formally took command of B flight on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, subtitled , was {{released}} by Wildstorm in 2009. Jason escapes {{from the bottom of}} Crystal Lake to resume his hunt for Ash, but is captured by the U.S. government. Freddy helps him escape and appoints him the general of his Deadite army, using the Necronomicon to heal his accumulated injuries and decomposition; it removes his natural deformities in the process. At the climax of the story, Jason battles his nemesis Tommy Jarvis and his great-niece Stephanie Kimble; Stephanie impales him before Tommy decapitates him with a shard of glass. Jason's soul is then absorbed by Freddy, who uses it to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> own power.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Webber's third-place finish allowed him to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> lead in the World Drivers' Championship. Alonso's victory allowed him to move up into second place, eleven points behind Webber. Hamilton's retirement meant that he slipped to third place, nine points behind Alonso. Vettel's second-place finish resulted in him moving into fourth place ahead of Button. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull's strong finish allowed them to draw further ahead of McLaren who were now twenty-four points behind. Ferrari remained in third on 319 points, forty points behind McLaren. Mercedes increased their points advantage over Renault to thirty-five with four races remaining in the season.|$|E
50|$|Philip Dunne {{held the}} Ludlow {{constituency}} {{seat in the}} 2010 general election with a notable swing from the Liberal Democrats, giving Dunne a 52.8 per cent share of the vote and a new, strengthened majority of 9,749.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, {{supported}} by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> political influence on the island.|$|E

5|$|As the 1880 {{elections}} approached, Randall had two goals: to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> {{control of}} the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, {{as well as to}} wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.|$|E

5|$|Belgium gained its {{independence}} from the United Netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral parliamentary democracy. A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the approval of a government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters {{in his capacity as}} Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would {{lie at the heart of}} the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold I, accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi was {{transported to}} {{hospital}} with severe head injuries, and {{was moved to}} his native France in November. He remained there until his death more than nine months later on 17 July 2015, when he was mourned by the motor sport community. Bianchi's accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person panel {{in which it was}} determined there was no single cause that prompted the crash. The victory allowed Hamilton to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> lead in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points over Rosberg, who was 63 points in front of Daniel Ricciardo. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, and Williams remained ahead of Ferrari in the battle for third place with four races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{attended}} Lafayette High School in Lexington, {{where he}} was a seventeen-time letterman in various sports. During one summer, his father expressed disappointment that he had decided to spend the summer selling vacuum cleaners instead of working on a road construction crew {{with the rest of his}} football teammates. Motivated by his father's disapproval, Brown averaged $1,000 in monthly commissions from vacuum cleaner sales. After high school, Brown matriculated to the University of Kentucky, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957 and a law degree in 1960. While in law school, he made as much as $25,000 a year selling Encyclopædia Britannica sets, and employed a sales crew made up of classmates to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> profits.|$|E
5|$|During Edward's reign, Stigand was an {{influential}} advisor at court {{and used his}} position to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> own wealth {{as well as that}} of his friends and family. Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in Domesday Book, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1958, nearing his 37th birthday, Lindwall stepped up his bid to reclaim his Test place. He {{committed}} him to an intense fitness program that included a 5km daily run followed by vigorous exercises to <b>increase</b> <b>his</b> abdominal and back strength. He set up equipment in his garage. Lindwall was determined to add to his Test tally of 212 wickets, which was just four behind the Australian record of Clarrie Grimmett. He was unmoved by a 6000-pound offer from an English newspaper to cover the 1958–59 Ashes series as a journalist, instead wanting {{to play in the}} series.|$|E
