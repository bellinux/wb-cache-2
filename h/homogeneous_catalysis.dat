In 2010, palladium-catalysed organic reactions were recognised by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Palladium is also a versatile metal for <b>homogeneous</b> <b>catalysis,</b> used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations.

5|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} research {{investigations of the}} rhodocene system {{was to understand the}} nature of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled by the desire to explore and apply the metal–metal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.|$|E

2500|$|In organic synthesis, {{transfer}} hydrogenation {{is useful}} for the asymmetric reduction of polar unsaturated substrates, such as ketones, aldehydes, and imines.

2500|$|Coordinated ligands display {{reactivity}} {{distinct from}} the free ligands. [...] For example, the acidity of the ammonia ligands in 3+ is elevated relative to NH3 itself. [...] Alkenes bound to metal cations are reactive toward nucleophiles whereas alkenes normally are not. [...] The large and industrially important area of catalysis hinges {{on the ability of}} metals to modify the reactivity of organic ligands. [...] <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>catalysis</b> occurs in solution and heterogeneous catalysis occurs when gaseous or dissolved substrates interact with surfaces of solids. [...] Traditionally <b>homogeneous</b> <b>catalysis</b> is considered part of organometallic chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis is discussed in the context of surface science, a subfield of solid state chemistry. [...] But the basic inorganic chemical principles are the same. [...] Transition metals, almost uniquely, react with small molecules such as CO, H2, O2, and C2H4. [...] The industrial significance of these feedstocks drives the active area of catalysis. [...] Ligands can also undergo ligand transfer reactions such as transmetalation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} cone angle is of {{practical}} importance in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>catalysis</b> because {{the size of}} the ligand affects the reactivity of the attached metal center.

40|$|The {{basic concept}} is the intuition that, whether <b>homogeneous</b> or heterogeneous, <b>catalysis</b> is {{primarily}} a process controlled by a molecular phenomenon since it implies the catalyzed transformation of molecules into other molecules. It follows that {{on the surface of}} metals or metal oxides, sulfi des, carbides, nitrides usually involved as heterogeneous catalysts, the relevant surface species and the mecha-nism of their mutual reactions must be of molecular character, as occurs in <b>homogeneous</b> or enzymatic <b>catalysis.</b> This was the basic assumption developed in the early 1960 s by Bond [1] and Ugo and Carr à [2] in a rather preliminary way to support the so- called “ molecular approach to heterogeneous catalysis. ” To establish the validity of this “ intuition ” it was fi rst necessary to evidence clear relationships between the two areas of <b>homogeneous</b> and heterogeneous <b>catalysis,</b> which are a priori very distinct from one another.
