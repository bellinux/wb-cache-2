50|$|A flitch beam (or <b>flitched</b> <b>beam)</b> is a {{compound}} beam {{used in the}} construction of houses, decks, and other primarily wood-frame structures. Typically, the flitch beam is made up of a steel plate sandwiched between two wood beams, the three layers being held together with bolts. In that common form it is sometimes referenced as a steel flitch beam. Further alternating layers of wood and steel can be used to produce an even stronger beam. The metal plate(s) within the beam are known as flitch plates.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>flitch</b> <b>beam</b> is {{a simple}} form of {{composite}} construction sometimes used in North American light frame construction. [...] This occurs when a steel plate is sandwiched between two wood joists and bolted together. A <b>flitch</b> <b>beam</b> can typically support heavier loads over a longer span than an all-wood beam of the same cross section.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>flitch</b> <b>beams</b> are {{significantly}} stronger than wood alone they require less depth than a wood-only beam {{of the same}} strength, are much lighter than a steel beam of the same size, and can still be nailed {{to the rest of}} a wooden structure. <b>Flitch</b> <b>beams</b> can also be created from existing in-situ joists or beams permitting easier renovations.|$|R
50|$|Engineered lumber is cut to {{length and}} {{installed}} similar to sawn lumber; the flitch requires shop fabrication and/or field bolting. This coupled with a much increased self weight of the beam (11.4 lb for engineered wood vs. 25.2 lb for a <b>flitch</b> <b>beam)</b> decreases {{the viability of the}} system.|$|R
50|$|Historically beams were squared timbers but {{are also}} metal, stone, or {{combinations}} of wood and metal such as a <b>flitch</b> <b>beam.</b> Beams can carry vertical gravitational forces but are primarily used to carry horizontal loads (e.g., loads due to an earthquake or wind or in tension to resist rafter thrust as a tie beam or (usually) compression as a collar beam). The loads carried by a beam are transferred to columns, walls, or girders, which then transfer the force to adjacent structural compression members and eventually to ground. In light frame construction, joists may rest on beams.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Supreme Court {{has defined}} [...] "composition of matter" [...] to mean [...] "all {{compositions}} {{of two or}} more substances and all composite articles, whether they be the results of chemical union, or of mechanical mixture, or whether they be gases, fluids, powders or solids." [...] That definition is problematic, however, because composite articles can be articles of manufacture—as {{in the case of a}} piece of plywood, a concrete sidewalk, a road, a fibreglass bathtub, a (kitchen) countertop, or a <b>flitch</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the high}} cost of labor, use of this type of beam has greatly declined. The advent of {{high-strength}} engineered lumber which uses modern adhesives and lower cost wood fibers has rendered this system largely obsolete. For example, compare the capacity of 2 beams spanning 18 feet: the allowable strength of a 3½ʺ × 11¼ʺ laminated veneer lumber (LVL) member has a tabulated allowable applied load of 398 plf (pounds per linear foot); compare this to a 2 × 12 <b>flitch</b> <b>beam</b> constructed of ½ʺ steel plate with two laminations of #2 SPF with an allowable applied load of 386 plf.|$|R
40|$|House Mitchell (2005), Newlands, Cape Town. Fagan's {{knowledge}} of boat {{building and the}} compromises {{that need to be}} reached between weight and durability versus speed has {{played a significant role in}} his material choices. He often employs the <b>flitch</b> <b>beam</b> where larger spans would make the size of timber uneconomical and bulky, as at House Mitchell (2005). Here he combines timber with plate steel to form rafters. He also employs cross beams to limit the size of rafters. The positions of these cross beams also help to define and demarcate spaces. 'Machine' type technologies, allied with those of yacht building, can be seen in the detailing of column junctions. Fagan exploits the possibilities of large glass planes to form bigger openings that were not possible in the past. 10 digital colour photos of House Mitchell, taken by Arthur Barker using a Canon EOS 400 D digital camera, October 2009.

40|$|Timber {{platform}} frame {{has evolved}} as an efficient method of construction for domestic dwellings and is experiencing continual {{growth in the}} UK due to it lending itself to off-site modem methods of construction (MMC), being environmentally efficient and exhibiting structural robustness. The challenge faced by the industry in the UK is to continue the evolutionary process such that the future demands of off-site MMC and regulatory changes are met. By conducting {{a study of the}} development of timber platform frame construction and reviewing the current and future requirements of the domestic dwelling construction market the challenges for the industry were highlighted. The business drivers of a timber platform frame manufacturer were considered and in conjunction with the information from the review an agenda of research programmes was derived. The objective of the research, although primarily from a structural timber engineering perspective, was to address the challenges faced by the industry employing a holistic approach with a view to implementing applied research. The UK procurement process for domestic dwelling construction is such that building layout is determined by architectural requirements. Building layout can have an adverse effect on structural stability and result in an inefficient system. A design review was conducted to determine the influencing factors which impinge upon system stability as a result of which recommendations for improvements were made. From the investigation the transfer of shear from a wall diaphragm to the foundation was deemed critical. Therefore, an experimental study was carried out which has resulted in an optimised specification. Further to this mathematical modelling techniques were used to demonstrate the impact that architectural layout has on stability, quantifying the financial penalty of inefficient layout and making recommendations to improve current designs. One of major priorities of the UK Government is to reduce climate change by implementing a low carbon economy with sustainable production and consumption; all with duty of care towards natural resources. Improvements to the Building Regulations (2006), in conjunction with other requirements, will result in wall U-values in domestic dwellings to be between 0. 27 to 0. 30 W/m 2 K. To determine an efficient method of meeting the new regulations an all encompassing research programme was conducted with the primary function being to develop a sustainable method of achieving thermal efficiency. Another method of wall construction is Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) and this option was reviewed. Initial work by Kermani (2005) on the structural performance of SIPs was extended to examine their racking characterisitcs with comparative studies to European and British structural codes of practice carried out. One of the key industry drivers which the review highlighted was the need for the implementation of lean technologies. The fabrication of <b>flitch</b> <b>beams</b> (timber-steel-timber sandwich configuration), used in cases of onerous load span conditions and limited depth of section, was improved through the implementation of a shot fired dowel connection method. To optimise the method of fabrication and achieve implementation an extensive laboratory study was carried out the results of which are compared to European structural codes of practice with recommendations made for design. The implementation of off-site MMC methods results in a change in associated risk during construction from minor consequence and high risk to major consequence and low risk. The crane erect method of timber platform frame construction optimises on-site performance in terms of both time and cost and reduces the requirement of working at height, which on average causes almost one fatality every week. The biggest health and safety risk associated with the crane erect method is failure of the roof system when being lifted into position. Using an analytical model, verified by full scale laboratory testing, a range of lifting conditions were researched and a best practice lifting procedure was developed which allows the safe lifting of standard roof systems used in domestic dwelling construction.
