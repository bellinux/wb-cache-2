Hernán Cortés brought 16 horses of Andalusian, Barb, and Arabian ancestry to Mexico in 1519.

5|$|To {{qualify for}} {{recognition}} by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs {{to be sent to}} the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the <b>Foundation</b> <b>Stock</b> Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or <b>foundation</b> <b>stock</b> service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.|$|E

5|$|The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a {{breed of}} dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was {{developed}} in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century.

One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its <b>Foundation</b> <b>Stock</b> Service, the first step to full recognition.|$|E
5|$|However, {{interest}} in the Cleveland Bay was waning, due to increased mechanisation, and the Great Depression of the early 1930s reduced exports by almost a third. There was a brief revival of {{interest in}} the late 1930s in the United States when they became popular as <b>foundation</b> <b>stock</b> for hunters. The decline continued, quickening after the Second World War; in 1960 the War Office stopped offering premiums on stallions, and many breeders discontinued breeding. By 1962, only four purebred stallions were present in the UK. Queen Elizabeth II saved the breed by purchasing Mulgrave Supreme, a stallion that was about to be sold to a buyer in the United States. The stallion was bred to pure- and part-bred mares, and within 15years there were 36purebred stallions in the UK. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, used the breed for many years in international driving competitions. In the late 1960s and 1970s, {{interest in the}} breed increased, and part-bred Cleveland Bays were in demand for use as riding horses, especially for use as hunters and jumpers. In 1964, a Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred cross competed in show jumping in the Tokyo Olympics. Another half-bred Cleveland Bay competed for the British Olympic team in show jumping at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, while a third was a reserve mount for the Canadian show jumping team at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In the late 1960s and '70s, horses continued to be exported to many countries. Japan, the United States and Australia have continued to import the horses from England, and in New Zealand crosses between Cleveland Bays and native mares were in demand on cattle and sheep stations.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{condition}} of the rabbit, designated premature or early senescence, {{was one of the}} inherited disease complexes which occurred in a breeding colony maintained in this laboratory for studies on constitutional problems (1). The senile appearance of many individuals was striking, a rabbit 1 or 2 years of age resembling a much older rabbit in such respects as an irregular unkempt coat, dry scurfy or scaly skin areas, and an increasingly poor nutritional state. The basis of the condition was a degeneration of greater or less degree and distribution. In a considerable proportion of cases, a progressive general deterioration developed that was rapidly progressive in character and fatal within a year or so while in other rabbits it was comparatively mild. The pathologic findings, particularly those in the cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine systems, were impressive features.

25|$|Basenjis {{share many}} unique traits with pariah dog types.

Both dingoes and Basenji lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait {{is the result of}} selecting against dogs that frequently bark—in the traditional Central African context—because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the Basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original <b>foundation</b> <b>stock</b> came from the old growth forest regions of the Congo Basin, where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense old-growth forest vegetation).|$|E

25|$|Yellowstone is {{the only}} place in the lower 48 states where a {{population}} of wild American bison has persisted since prehistoric times, although fewer than 50 native bison remained there in 1902. Fearing extinction, the park imported 21 bison from two privately owned herds, as <b>foundation</b> <b>stock</b> for a bison ranching project that spanned 50 years at the Lamar Buffalo Ranch in Yellowstone's Lamar Valley. Activities there included irrigation, hay-feeding, roundups, culling, and predator control, to artificially ensure herd survival. By the 1920s, some intermingling of the introduced and wild bison had begun. With protection from poaching, the native and transplanted populations increased. In 1936, bison were transplanted to historic habitats in the Firehole River and Hayden Valley. In 2003, the entire population numbered 1,477. Bison were trapped and herds periodically reduced until 1967, when only 397 bison were counted parkwide. All bison herd reduction activities were phased out after 1966, again allowing natural ecological processes to determine bison numbers and distribution. Presently, the park's bison population is estimated at about 4,000.|$|E
25|$|After trying {{pointers}} and Airedales, crossing with collies gave van Rooyen {{the best}} lion hunters, {{as his son}} Cornelis Jr. tells us.

Modern Rhodesian ridgeback breeders speak {{of some of their}} ridgebacks being too 'mastiffy' though it is uncertain what extent, if any, of actual mastiff heredity may have entered, as from the boerboels and their descendants prevalent in these territories.

They became the <b>foundation</b> <b>stock</b> of a kennel which developed dogs over the next 35 years with the ability to bay lions: that is, a pack of 4-6 Rhodesian ridgebacks holds lions at bay while the hunter makes the kill, though an individual Rhodesian ridgeback is no match for an adult lion in a fight. These dogs were used to hunt not only lions but also other game, including wild pigs and baboons, and they can kill a baboon independently of a human hunter's collaboration.|$|E
