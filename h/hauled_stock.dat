5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie {{stock was}} {{converted}} into electric multiple units. Some Dreadnought carriages were used with electric motor cars, although two-thirds remained in use as locomotive <b>hauled</b> <b>stock</b> on the extension line.|$|E
25|$|GBRf are {{planning}} to use re-engined Class 73/9 locomotives to haul the Caledonian Sleeper. They {{will be used for}} the non-electrified sections of the route, running from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, Inverness and Fort William. The first Class 73/9 <b>hauled</b> <b>stock</b> movement for the Caledonian Sleeper contract came when 73966 worked 5B26, the lowland sleeper empties from Edinburgh Waverley to Polmadie.|$|E
25|$|As older trains became {{obsolete}} in the 1970s, the Class 80 slam-door diesel-electric {{multiple unit}} was introduced. BREL built these units between 1974 and 1977 to British Rail's Mk 2B design with some trailer cars rebuilt from <b>hauled</b> <b>stock.</b> The power cars were powered by an English Electric 4SRKT engine, nicknamed 'Thumpers' {{due to their}} characteristic sound, and had two English Electric 538 traction motors. These entered service on the suburban lines around Belfast, becoming a stalwart on the whole network. They remained in service until 2012, latterly primarily on the Larne-Belfast line and the Coleraine-Portrush Line. In the early 1980s, NIR purchased one of the prototype LEV Railbuses built to test the railbus concept. This was intended for the Coleraine-Portrush branch, but was withdrawn due to the capacity constraints of a single car. A plan was mooted to use it on the Lisburn-Antrim line {{to prevent it from}} being closed. This proposal failed, again because of the limited capacity.|$|E

2500|$|Two special Park Royal trailer {{vehicles}} for {{service on the}} isolated Waterford and Tramore Railway were built in 1955. These vehicles, like the railcars they worked with, had high-density seating arrangements. One of them was, additionally, fitted out as a driving trailer, with a guard's compartment at the non-cab end and a large area set aside for prams. Two further driving trailers, known as [...] "mules," [...] were converted from 1953-built <b>hauled</b> <b>stock</b> but were used only briefly, working {{as part of the}} Westport portion of a Dublin–Galway/Westport train.|$|E
2500|$|When the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee {{was selling}} surplus {{assets in the}} early 1960s, the Isle of Man Railway {{were looking for a}} cheap {{alternative}} to their ageing steam locomotive fleet and purchased these two railcars. [...] They had already been allocated fleet numbers which were retained by the new owners but it was only when the ex-contractors' engine No. 18 Ailsa was officially numbered in 2005 that the fleet had ever been in correct sequence. [...] These railcars {{have been the subject of}} much controversy in the late 1990s when their over-budget rebuild was brought to a halt by incoming management and since this time no work has been done on them. [...] The preservationist group Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association have campaigned for their completion, especially in conjunction with a potential commuter train services between Port Erin, Castletown and Douglas, which would extend the service that is laid on annually by the railway in connection with the T.T.. [...] The TT Commuter service is currently run using a steam locomotive and <b>hauled</b> <b>stock,</b> which leads to high operating costs. [...] A shift in management attitude could see their return to service in the future, but for the time being, they remain in store at Douglas station awaiting completion and return to service.|$|E
5000|$|Ex-Metropolitan Railway <b>hauled</b> <b>stock</b> {{retained}} {{their original}} numbers {{as they did}} not conflict {{with any of the}} numbers allocated to the multiple unit stock; they were all numbered between 41 and 510 (511-519 were later allocated to cars converted from multiple unit to <b>hauled</b> <b>stock).</b>|$|E

5000|$|... 'Intercity' units, {{which were}} more {{substantially}} constructed, and shared many features with contemporary <b>hauled</b> coaching <b>stock.</b> They were built for express services on important secondary routes on the Scottish, North Eastern and Western Regions.|$|R
50|$|ScotRail ordered 55 three-carriage Class 170 Turbostars {{to replace}} {{locomotive}} <b>hauled</b> <b>stock</b> and 40 three-carriage Class 334 Junipers to replace Class 303s.|$|E
50|$|In February 1994 {{the first}} of 15 two-carriage Endeavour railcars was delivered. These {{replaced}} Class 620/720 railcars, Class 900 railcars and locomotive <b>hauled</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E

50|$|At {{this time}} the Mersey Railway was {{disposing}} of locomotive <b>hauled</b> <b>stock,</b> and some of this was bought in as replacements; down to 1907, thirteen four wheelers were obtained second-hand from the Mersey Railway.|$|E

50|$|In February 1990 {{the long-standing}} Holiday Coast XPT was axed {{as part of}} a restructure of CountryLink {{services}}. With the other XPT services struggling to keep up with weekend demand, in June 1990 a service to Grafton was reinstated. It ran on Fridays only to Grafton and Sundays only to Sydney but during school holidays ran daily. It was formed of locomotive <b>hauled</b> HUB/RUB <b>stock</b> with the headcode NL35/NL36.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the DMUs, locomotive-hauled coaches supplemented services. The introduction of the 22000 Class units on InterCity services allowed the 2800 Class and 29000 Class units to be cascaded to Commuter services, which allowed the locomotive <b>hauled</b> <b>stock</b> to be fully phased out by 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{streamlined}} three-car {{train was}} a single articulated unit; the two outer coaches were each 64 ft long and rested on a centre coach that was 52 ft long. The articulation was an idea that had been already taken up by Sir William Stanier for some locomotive <b>hauled</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On 25 August 1956, {{locomotive}} No. 61846 was <b>hauling</b> {{an empty}} <b>stock</b> train which ran away and crashed through the buffers at [...] station, Yorkshire. The accident {{was due to}} the failure to connect the brake pipe between the train and locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Moor Street is {{currently}} served by local trains the lines through Shirley and Henley-in-Arden to Stratford-upon-Avon and to Leamington via Solihull, and Chiltern Clubman services to London Marylebone. Chiltern also operate {{a limited number}} of weekday services from Marylebone terminating at Moor Street formed of class 67 locomotives and <b>hauled</b> coaching <b>stock.</b> On summer Sundays it is used by steam locomotives running tourist specials between Snow Hill and Stratford upon Avon and trains between Snow Hill and Tyseley for Vintage Trains.|$|R
50|$|Increasing traffic {{by other}} companies, {{including}} goods traffic, {{led to the}} line between King's Cross and Moorgate being widened to four tracks in 1868; the route was called the 'City Widened Lines'. Suburban services from the Midland Railway ran via Kentish Town and the Great Northern Railway ran via King's Cross. British Rail services to Moorgate were initially steam-operated before being converted to Cravens-built diesel multiple units and British Rail Class 31 locomotives class <b>hauling</b> non-corridor <b>stock</b> which remained in operation until the mid-1970s.|$|R
50|$|All were {{delivered}} between January 1921 and January 1922 numbered 2112 to 2211. One further first class carriage was delivered as 2212 by the Eveleigh Carriage Workshops in January 1923. All initially entered service as locomotive <b>hauled</b> <b>stock</b> with eight seats fitted {{in what would}} later become the driver's cabin.|$|E
50|$|Fourteen two-carriage {{sets were}} ordered in April 1992 to replace Class 620/720 railcars, DEB set railcars and {{locomotive}} <b>hauled</b> <b>stock,</b> {{with the first}} entering service in March 1994. In November 1994 one further two-carriage set was ordered. All {{are scheduled to be}} replaced in the early 2020s by the NSW TrainLink Regional Train Project.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{many of the}} {{surviving}} First Generation units were reaching {{the end of their}} design life, leading to spiralling maintenance costs, poor reliability and a poor public image for the railway.
