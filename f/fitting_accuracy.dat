40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{investigate}} the <b>fitting</b> <b>accuracy</b> of Co-Cr dental bridges, manufactured by three technologies, with the newly developed method using CAD software. The four-part dental bridges of Co-Cr alloys were produced by conventional casting of wax models, casting with 3 D printed patterns and selective laser melting. The marginal and internal fit of dental bridges was studied out by two methods – silicone replica test and CAD software. As the silicone replica test characterizes with comparatively low accuracy, a new methodology for investigating the <b>fitting</b> <b>accuracy</b> of dental bridges was developed based on the SolidWorks CAD software.

40|$|Tofu {{shows the}} {{following}} compression behavior. First, the behavior is non-linear; subsequently, the behavior becomes elastic/linear, followed by yielding and fracture. A linear behavior {{indicates that there}} is no fracture, but further increase of compression can cause yielding or fracture.

With this in mind, this paper presented a grasping condition of controlling the amount of compression so that the compression behavior can be linear. This condition is applied to the previously proposed fluid fingertip that utilizes a rubber bag filled with a viscoelastic fluid and having a rigid layer inside the fluid. In addition, this paper presents a methodology for checking whether the grasping condition is held, based on our previously developed phase change detection method of comparing the <b>fitting</b> <b>accuracies</b> of different approximation models.

Modeling land use change has attracted considerable attention. Currently, empirical estimation models using statistical techniques are one of mostly used spatial models to simulate land use pattern and its changes.

40|$|A NARX {{neural network}} is adapted for {{cylinder}} pressure trace reconstruction on a multicylinder engine. Following a systematic study {{to establish the}} required NARX input information (using measured pressure traces and simulated crank kinematics), two fully recurrent training algorithms are developed and applied to real engine data. These include a back-propagation-through-time algorithm (BPTT) and an extended Kalman filter (EKF). For multi-cylinder engines, two cases are examined, both assuming crank kinematics is obtained from a single shaft-encoder fitted at the forward end of the crankshaft. In one case, a NARX model is constructed to provide an inverse relationship between the kinematics at the encoder location and the pressure trace in an arbitrary cylinder. In the second case, by transforming the kinematics (to emulate a local encoder), a different NARX model is constructed to relate the kinematics at the crank location of a particular cylinder to the corresponding pressure trace. The accuracy and efficiency of both NARX models is examined for application to a three-cylinder in-line DISI engine (in which pressure traces are measured on all cylinders).

40|$|In this study, we {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} process leading to fracture in tofu grasping by deformable fingertips {{filled with a}} fluid. In our previous papers [1, 2], we developed deformable fingertips using a rubber bag filled with a viscoelastic fluid, and presented a strategy for delicate tofu grasping without any advance knowledge about fracture. However, the predication point was close to fracture, and the prediction was then still a gamble. In order to realize fracture prediction at an earlier stage, we examined the process leading to fracture when pushing tofu by the deformable fingertips. The stiffness of the fingertips can be controlled with {{the pressure of the}} fluid inside the fingertips. The pushing force and fluid pressure were examined for different levels of stiffness of the fingertips. The main findings and contributions are as follows. 1) The convergence of the ratio of the contact force to fluid pressure gives an indication of dent occurrence. This convergence could be seen when fingertip rubber bag was not filled (low stiffness). 2) It was easier for a dent to occur when the fingertip rubber bag was not filled than when it was filled (high stiffness). 3) Changes in the rate of increase of the fluid pressure as the tofu was pushed were repeatedly observed. We defined this as a phase change and present a method for detecting such changes. The phase change points were detected by comparing the <b>fitting</b> <b>accuracies</b> of different approximation models. 4) The last and second to the last phase changes before fracture were detected by detecting the first phase change (after the convergence of the rate of the contact force to fluid pressure if the fingertip bag was not completely filled). The detected points can be regarded as alert points indicating a fracture risk that is not close to the fracture point. © 2015 IEEE.
