40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between tail lesions, cold carcass weight and viscera condemnations in an Irish abattoir. The following data were collected at the evisceration point from every 3 rd pig slaughtered over 7 days: farm identification, sex, tail lesion score, viscera inspection outcome and cold carcass weight. Tail lesions were scored according to a 5 point scale. Disease lesions responsible for lung (pleurisy, pneumonia and abscess), heart (pericarditis) and liver (ascariasis) condemnation were recorded based on the decision of the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspector.</b> Data on 3, 143 pigs from 61 batches were available. The relationship between disease lesions, tail lesion score and cold carcass weight was studied at individual carcass level, whereas the relationship between disease lesions and tail lesion score was studied at both carcass and batch level. Tail lesions (score ≥ 1) were found in 72 % of the study population, with 2. 3 % affected by severe tail lesions (scores ≥ 3). Pleurisy (13. 7 %) followed by pneumonia (10. 4 %) showed the highest prevalence, whereas the prevalence of ascariasis showed the greatest variation between batches (0 to 75 %). Tail lesion score, pleurisy, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis were associated with reductions in carcass cold weight (P ≤ 0. 05) ranging from 3 to 6. 6 kg. Tail lesion score was associated with condemnations for pleurisy, pneumonia and pleuropneumonia (P ≤ 0. 05) at a batch level. <b>Veterinary</b> <b>inspector</b> shift was associated with condemnations for pneumonia, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis (P ≤ 0. 05) at a carcass level and with pneumonia at a batch level. Sex was not associated with viscera condemnations but males were more likely to be affected by tail lesions. The relationship between overall tail lesion score and the lung diseases at batch level supports the relationship between poor health and poor welfare of pigs on farms. The inclusion of tail lesion scores at post mortem meat inspection should be considered as a health and welfare diagnostic tool...|$|R

Several hypotheses and propositions are put to the test within a mixed-method research design based on data from research on Dutch <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors.</b> The results show that in order to clarify the meaning and behavioural consequences of PSM and professionalism in the context of dilemmas it is useful to combine our understanding of these two concepts with insights from identity theory.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe aspects of case study herds investigated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF) in which animal welfare incidents occurred and to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be monitored to enhance the Early Warning System (EWS). Despite an EWS being in place for a number of years, animal welfare incidents continue to occur. Questionnaires regarding welfare incidents were sent to Superintending <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Inspectors</b> (SVIs), resulting in 18 herds being chosen as case study herds, 12 of which had a clearly defined welfare incident date. For each study herd, data on six potential KPIs were extracted from DAFF databases. The KPIs for those herds with a clearly defined welfare incident date were studied for a consecutive four year window, with the fourth year being the 'incident year', when the welfare incident was disclosed. For study herds without a clearly defined welfare incident date, the KPIs were determined on a yearly basis between 2001 and 2009. Results We found that the late registration of calves, the use of on-farm burial as a method of carcase disposal, an increasing number of moves to knackeries over time and records of animals moved to 'herd unknown' were notable on the case farms. Conclusion Four KPIs were prominent on the case study farms and warrant further investigation in control herds to determine their potential to provide a framework for refining current systems of early warning and prevention. </p...|$|R

This situation was complicated by reports of idiopathic oral ulcers that closely resembled FMD ongross appearance which {{at that time}} were referred to as ovine mouth and gum obscure disease. Methods: A field and abattoir study was carried out to determine the frequency, appearance and significance of oraland digital lesions in sheep in Ireland. A total of 3, 263 sheep were examined in 22 flocks, including 1, 969 lambs and 1, 294 adults. A further 2, 403 animals were examined by abattoir inspections. Animals bearing lesions of interest were identified, samples of the lesions were taken and subsequently examined by bacteriology, electron microscopy, serology, immunohistochemistry and histopathology. Results: Forty four oral and 20 digital lesions were identified and characterised. Oral lesions were recorded mostfrequently in lambs, where {{the most common cause}} was orf virus infection. The majority of the oral lesions recorded in the adults was idiopathic and consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic oral ulceration. A variety of digital lesions was observed, consistent with scald, foot-rot and contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD). All of the animals with lesions were seronegative to FMD virus (FMDV).
