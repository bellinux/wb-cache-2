40|$|A hybridized society, Kuwait meshes Islamic {{ideologies}} {{with western}} culture. Linguistically, English exists across both foreign language and second language nomenclatures {{in the country}} due to globalization and internationalization which has seen increasing use of English in Kuwait. Originally consisting of listening, speaking, reading and writing, the first grade English curriculum in Kuwait was narrowed in 2002 to focus only {{on the development of}} oral English skills, and to exclude writing. Since that time, both Kuwaiti teachers and parents have expressed dissatisfaction with this curriculum on the basis that this model disadvantages their children. In first grade however, the teaching of pre-writing has remained as part of the curriculum. This research analyses the parameters of English pre-writing and writing instruction in <b>first</b> grade in <b>Kuwaiti</b> classrooms, investigates <b>first</b> grade English pre-writing and writing teaching, and gathers insights from parents, teachers and students regarding the appropriateness of the current curriculum. Through interviews and classroom observations, and an analysis of curriculum documents, this case study found that the relationship between oral and written language is more complex than suggested by either the Kuwaiti curriculum reform, or international literature concerning the delayed teaching of writing. Intended curriculum integration across Kuwait subjects is also far more complex than first believed, due to a developmental mismatch between English pre-writing skills and Arabic language capabilities. Findings suggest an alternative approach to teaching writing may be more appropriate and more effective for first Grade students in the current Kuwait curriculum context. They contribute also to an emerging interest in the second and foreign language fields in the teaching of writing to young learners...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vitamin D {{homeostasis}} {{may play}} a critical role in glucose metabolism. Little is known on vitamin D deficiency and its association with diabetes in countries of the Arabia Gulf where the population is experiencing a rapid increase in the incidence of diabetes. Methods In a cross-sectional study of 960 adults enrolled in the first National Nutrition Survey of the State of Kuwait (NNSSK), we examined vitamin D status in association with the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes. Vitamin D status was measured by serum levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D). Prevalences of diabetes and prediabetes were determined based on fasting glucose and HbA 1 C levels. Results The median level of serum 25 (OH) D in Kuwaiti adults was 13. 8  ng/ml. Approximately 56  % of the Kuwaiti adults had vitamin D inadequacy (25 (OH) D[*]=[*] 12 – 19. 9  ng/ml), and 27  % had vitamin D deficiency (25 (OH) D[*]<[*] 12  ng/ml). The prevalences of prediabetes and diabetes were 40 and 27  %, respectively. Vitamin D inadequacy (OR[*]=[*] 1. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 0 – 2. 9) and deficiency (OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 3. 3) was each associated with about two-fold increased odds of prediabetes compared to sufficient vitamin D status (25 (OH) D ≥ 20  ng/ml). Vitamin D inadequacy (OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 2 – 3. 7) and deficiency (OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 3. 9) were also associated with two-fold increased odds of diabetes. Conclusions Data from <b>Kuwaiti’s</b> <b>first</b> national nutritional survey suggests a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Kuwaiti adults. Associations of low vitamin D status and high prevalence of diabetes point to the need of continuous monitoring of vitamin D status and further evaluating potential health consequences in this high-risk population...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{examined}} {{the efficacy of}} combining behavioural and academic interventions and their effect on off-task behaviour and educational outcome. Studies also established relationships between behavioural/attention problems and educational achievement in an Arabic- speaking Kuwaiti population. In the <b>first</b> Study, 181 <b>Kuwaiti</b> children in mainstream schools from grades 4 - 7 were tested on measures of literacy and assessed using The Attention Hyperactivity questionnaire in Arabic (AHQA) and an Arabic version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A second Study was conducted to develop the methods and procedures used in subsequent studies. Study 3 aimed {{to determine whether the}} interventions used were beneficial for children in a mainstream school group setting and focused on improvements in spelling scores produced by typical teaching methods paired with a behavioural intervention. Children from the 5 th grade were assigned to three different treatment conditions: Positive Self-Statements (PSS), Relaxation Technique (RT), and PPS combined with RT. The interventions were applied for the first 5 - 7 minutes of each normal English lesson, twice weekly for three weeks. Children in the 4 th grade were used as baseline with the only similarity being the pre- and post-spelling task. Study 4 tested the usefulness of combining behavioural and educational interventions on students with learning disabilities (LD) and behavioural difficulties. Three groups of children from grades 4 - 9 were chosen and were randomly assigned to two intervention groups (PSS and RT with MSL, PSS and RT with copying) and one baseline. Overall, the findings indicated that by combining behavioural and educational interventions, positive effects on both off-task behaviour and educational outcome could be achieved, especially with LD children under conditions of individual tutoring. A key finding was that relaxation techniques showed particularly successful effects and may provide a simple strategy for support in many classroom contexts.

40|$|This is a {{prospective}} {{study of a}} cohort sample of injured <b>Kuwaiti</b> <b>First</b> Gulf War survivors designed to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity due to combat and exposures to traumatic events. The study included two main phases. The first phase conducted in 1998, and in 2003 the second phase was executed. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the contribution of combat physical injury to the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prevalence rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety and other psychological morbidity, and predictors of chronic PTSD. The first assessment was in 1998 and the second assessment in 2003 that involved biological investigations. Beside the clinical interview and the physical examination of the site of injury, multiple psychological scales and questionnaires were used. Based on DSM-IV criteria of PTSD, after the second assessment the population of this study were classified to: Chronic PTSD(have PTSD at both assessments), Delayed PTSD (have PTSD only on the second assessment), Recovered (have PTSD only in the first assessment), and Never PTSD (have no PTSD in both assessments). The biological assessment include: blood investigations, BMI, and visual analogue. The data of the study were analyzed based on the four PTSD subgroups. In the first chapter an introduction to the First Gulf War was presented followed by the second chapter that discussed literature review. The third chapter tackled the methods used in this study. The fourth to the sixth chapters discussed {{the results of this study}} regarding prevalence of Chronic PTSD, Cortisol and PTSD and Thyroid hormones and PTSD respectively. The last chapter presented the limitations and strengths of the study. There were three main hypotheses. First: combat injured survivors with chronic PTSD have cluster of symptoms severity similar to delayed PTSD after 13 years of the trauma and the prevalence of chronic PTSD is constant over time. Second: low cortisol levels observed in chronic PTSD are constant with chronicity, normalize with recovery, unrelated to degree of disability, and are influenced by comorbid disorders. Third: there is minor role for thyroid hormones in chronic PTSD. All of registered Kuwaiti combat injured survivors at the Social Development Office in Kuwait, were approached to voluntary participate in this study. Of 234 individuals 212 participate in the first stage, and out of these 123 participate in the second stage with the addition of 33 new cases that were not examined in 1998 but were registered in SDO after 1998. An informed consent was taken from the participants at both phases. The participants were assessed using General Health Questionnaire, Trauma Questionnaire, Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Symptom Checklist- 90 Revised, and Life Event Scale. Questionnaires and scales applied in the first stage were applied in the second stage with the addition of Impact of Event Scale, Composite International Diagnostic Interview and Scale of Gulf War Syndrome. Biochemical assessment comprised cortisol level, thyroxine (fT 4), free triiodothyronine (fT 3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The blood samples were taken before starting the interview. Physical assessment involved measurements of: pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist-hip circumference, body mass index and visual analogue before and after the interview. Data entry program using Statistical Package for Social Scientists was used to enter data and analysis. The prevalence rate of delayed onset PTSD (14. 6 %), chronic PTSD (15. 4) recovered from PTSD (22. 8 %) and never had PTSD (47. 2 %). With chronic PTSD there are higher cluster of PTSD symptoms severity, not related to severity of physical injury, has more prevalence of PTSD associated symptoms, higher comorbid psychiatric disorders. Intrusions, avoidance and arousal are PTSD cluster of symptoms more predictive of future development of PTSD after the injury. There was a low baseline cortisol level with chronic PTSD, and it was significantly lower in participants with delayed PTSD. Furthermore trauma itself rather than PTSD diagnosis may have an impact on cortisol level. Other psychiatric comorbidity has an enhancing effect on cortisol level. The levels of thyroid hormones were within the normal range. The trend of thyroid function in delayed and chronic PTSD is lower fT 3, and TSH and higher fT 4 levels, with higher fT 3 levels in delayed PTSD compared to chronic PTSD. It was found that the higher severity of trauma score with PTSD the higher fT 3 mean values. Thesis (Ph. D.) - University of Adelaide, School of Medicine, 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{earnings}} management around listing {{phenomenon has}} been widely discussed in the literature—with conflicting results. However, research surrounding this issue is underdeveloped {{in relation to the}} Kuwaiti capital market. Motivated by the lack of research on this issue and the unique combination of listing requirements in the Kuwaiti setting, this study <b>first</b> examines how <b>Kuwaiti</b> Closed Shareholding Companies (KSCCs) manage their pre-listing earnings. Second, it explores whether auditors with a high reputation restrict opportunistic earnings management. Third, it examines the occurrence of earnings management behaviour around the first lockup expiration period. Finally, it seeks to explore the association between pre-listing year earnings management and subsequent firm performance. The sample firms used in this study (68 KSCCs) consists of all KSCCs listing on the KSE from 1997 through to 2007 excluding banks and regulated industries. Five hypotheses were developed to address the study objectives and research sub-questions. For hypotheses testing purposes, the sample was, on occasion, split into different groups and study periods. Testing these hypotheses involve comparing the pre-listing, listing and post-listing year earnings management. Earnings management and auditor reputation, profit requirement change and lockup restrictions are also examined; and the association between earnings management and post-listing performance is investigated. Aggregate accruals are used to estimate earnings management. Six cross-sectional models were chosen for this study to estimate discretionary accruals: three models are based on total accruals and three models are based on current accruals. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results. With respect to the pre-listing year earnings management, there is some evidence to support the existence of opportunistic earnings management exercised by KSCC issuers in the pre-listing financial year when using current accruals models. However, a significant result was not found when models based on total accruals were used. The examination of the lockup restriction—mandated by law in the Kuwaiti market—has an interesting implication. This research finds that KSCCs issuers opportunistically advanced total accruals in an attempt to improve earnings during the first lockup expiration period. Additionally, firms which listed after the lockup restrictions were imposed exhibited a significant level of post-listing earnings management compared to firms that listed before the lockup restrictions were imposed. As a result, evidence exists that KSCC issuers used current accruals to manage pre-listing earnings to be able to list on the KSE. Meanwhile, they used total accruals to manage post-listing year earnings to gain wealth from selling the highest portion of their restricted shares at the highest price possible. Results obtained from testing post-listing stock and accounting performance are inconsistent. Results from testing the stock return performance using BHARs and CARs for all KSCCs sample firms support the managerial opportunism explanation and the existence of a negative association between DCA in the pre-listing year and post-listing stock performance. In contrast, testing accounting performance shows insignificant results. Results from testing the accounting performance using ROA reveals that KSCCs sample firms exhibit a significant subsequent decline in the adjusted-median ROA and in the raw-median ROA in the second post-year period, but not in the other years. However, when the sample firms are split into groups based on their levels of DCA, result suggests no significant differences observed in the adjusted-median ROA and in the raw-median ROA between groups. The findings make a number of contributions to the international earnings management literature, Kuwaiti financial market‘s policy and practice, and <b>Kuwaiti</b> investors. <b>First,</b> this research provides the first known empirical evidence based on the analysis of earnings management behaviour related to close shareholding companies around listing, which represent 90 % of companies listed on the KSE in the emerging market, Kuwait. Second, the evolution of the listing requirements imposed by the KSE on the KSCCs in Kuwait between the years 1984 to 2010 for both the official market and the parallel market are documented. Third, the study results are important to investors for improving their decision-making processes and indicate that caution should be exercised when investing in newly-issued firms. Fourth, examination of the lockup restrictions highlight the agency conflict that exists between the agent (KSCCs issuers) and principal (investors) around lockups and alerts Kuwaiti regulators to consider reviewing listing requirements and possibly reassess them in light of these results. Finally, the results also indicate that investors should not interpret the use of high reputation auditors as an indication of reliable financial statements. ...|$|R
