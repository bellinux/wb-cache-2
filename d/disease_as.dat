5|$|A Braxy-like disease {{originated}} in the Beverley-York region in 1915. Over the next 15 years it spread across most of the state's farming districts. Flock losses generally were around 5% though there were reported cases of 30% loss. In 1918 Professor Dakin of the University of Western Australia identified the <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> a toxaemia of bacterial origin {{but was unable to}} establish the source.|$|E
5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is more common than any other lung <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, the Croatian {{government}} was seeking information on 1,997 persons missing since the war. As of 2009, {{there were more}} than 52,000 persons in Croatia registered as disabled due to their participation in the war. This figure includes not only those disabled physically due to wounds or injuries sustained but also persons whose health deteriorated due to their involvement in the war, including diagnoses of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular <b>disease,</b> <b>as</b> well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In 2010, the number of war-related PTSD-diagnosed persons was 32,000.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, kitsunetsuki {{was noted}} as a <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> {{early as the}} Heian period and {{remained}} a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th century. Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki. The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations {{that members of the}} Aum Shinrikyo cult had been possessed.|$|E

5|$|Malaria was endemic in the marshlands {{of eastern}} Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army {{suffered}} greatly from the disease; he estimated during the surrender {{that half of}} his army was unable to fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members {{had grown up with}} malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to the <b>disease.</b> <b>As</b> malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Mutation {{analysis}} of the ATP7B gene, {{as well as other}} genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.|$|E
5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's <b>disease,</b> <b>as</b> well as other dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E

5|$|Prominent {{families}} {{throughout the}} world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease. For example, several relatives of Henry VIII survived the disease but were scarred by it. These include his sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland, his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, and his two daughters: Mary I of England in 1527 and Elizabeth I of England in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, contracted the <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> a child but had no visible scarring.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> a synucleiopathy (due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) to {{distinguish it from}} other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein. Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.|$|E

5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a {{lower than normal}} blood clotting factor {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the <b>disease</b> <b>as</b> well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E
5|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} {{costs of the}} Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and <b>disease,</b> <b>as</b> gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.|$|E
