25|$|The {{return to}} {{democracy}} allowed Peruvians {{to choose among}} strongly left, strongly conservative, or middle-of-the-road parties. They chose Belaúnde and his party as the middle road, but it led nowhere. The Belaúnde government tried to return the economy to a more open system by reducing barriers to imports, implementing financial reforms intended to foster private markets, and reversing the statist orientation of the Velasco system. But the new approach {{never had a chance}} to <b>get</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> because of a series of macroeconomic problems. On one side, the government was rightly concerned about continuing inflation but made the mistake of focusing the explanation on monetary growth arising from the export surplus it inherited at the start. That position made it seem undesirable to continue trying to promote exports and desirable to raise domestic spending and imports. On the other side, President Belaúnde's personal and political objectives included using public investment actively to develop the interior of the country and to answer evident needs for improved infrastructure. Seeing the export surplus as the key macroeconomic source of imbalance, the government decided to eliminate it by removing import restrictions, slowing nominal devaluation to allow the real exchange rate to appreciate, and increasing government investment spending.|$|E
500|$|The communists further alienated many Poles by persecuting the Catholic Church. The PAX Association {{created in}} 1947 {{and led by}} the former prewar far-right activist Bolesław Piasecki, {{attempted}} to divide the Catholic movement and promote a communist rule-friendly, collaborationist church. The PAX did not <b>get</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> in molding the Catholic public opinion, but published numerous books and officially approved daily Catholic press. In 1953 the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński was placed under house arrest, even though before he {{had been willing to}} make compromises with the government. In the early 1950s, the war against religion by the secret police led to the arrest and torture of hundreds of Polish religious personalities, culminating in the Stalinist show trial of the Kraków Curia. The Office of the Council of Ministers (government) produced a list of regime-approved bishops. [...] See also: Polish anti-religious campaign.|$|E
500|$|Following its 1983 release, {{the game}} was ported to various Japanese {{personal}} computers. A Famicom port was then released in 1985 {{and was the first}} adventure game to be released on that platform. The Famicom version was also the first collaboration between Yuuji Horii and Koichi Nakamura of Chunsoft, before Dragon Quest. The Famicom version was programmed by Nakamura, who was 19 years old at the time. This version of Portopia changed the interface, adopting the command menu system that Horii created for the 1984 adventure game [...] Due to frustration with text-based entry, admitting he was never able to <b>get</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> in adventure games because of it, Horii created a command menu system for Hokkaido, which was later used in the Famicom version of Portopia. Horii also noted that, for the Famicom versions of both Portopia and Hokkaido, he wanted to make them appealing to a more mature audience, beyond the Famicom's typical younger audience. He was also playing Wizardry at the time, inspiring him to include a 3D dungeon maze in the Famicom version of Portopia. The game was never released in the Western world, largely due to its mature content, involving themes such as murder, suicide, fraud, bankruptcy, interrogation beatings, drug dealings, and a strip club. The lack of a Western release prompted ROM hacking group DvD Translations to develop an unofficial translation of the Famicom version.|$|E

[...] He took several steps before being struck and knocked down by ATS gunfire. Gray was hit five times: in the eye, neck, chest and twice in the groin. Even with these injuries, he struggled fiercely against police, breaking free of plastic handcuffs before being re-handcuffed, while berating police for not having killed him.

2500|$|Reg Whitaker, a {{professor}} of Political Science at York University in Toronto, gave a review at the Intelligence Forum about the book: [...] "The Mitrokhin Archive arrives from a cache under a Russian dacha floor, courtesy of the British intelligence community itself, and its chosen historian, Chris Andrew. The provenance of this archive is itself {{a matter of some}} controversy." [...] After questioning and discussing the source of the book he adds that [...] "the hand of British intelligence is evident, and Andrew clearly has a 'special relationship' with SIS." [...] Then, Reg Whitaker goes on to talk about the British Media when it comes to spies and says that [...] "ever since Burgess and Maclean made their run to Moscow in 1951, the British have treated espionage as a branch of pornography", adding that [...] "it is doubtful that many readers enticed by the advance publicity will actually <b>get</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> into this voluminous tome of close to 1000 name and date filled pages. A gripping read it ain't.","is remarkably restrained and reasonable in its handling of Westerners targeted by the KGB as agents or sources.

2500|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of the Ottawa Nationals of the World Hockey Association (WHA), the team had discussions with Ballard about {{locating}} the team in Toronto, but the talks did not <b>get</b> <b>very</b> <b>far.</b> [...] The team was a flop at the box office, averaging about 3,000 fans a game, and in March 1973—just {{before the end of the}} season—the City of Ottawa demanded payment of $100,000 to guarantee the club dates at the Ottawa Civic Centre. The team decided to leave Ottawa and played their home playoff games at Maple Leaf Gardens, attracting crowds of 5,000 and 4,000 in two games before being eliminated by the New England Whalers. At the end of the season, the team moved to Toronto permanently, and was sold to John F. Bassett, son of former Leafs owner John Bassett. [...] They were renamed the Toronto Toros in June 1973. [...] Bassett wanted the team to play at a renovated CNE Coliseum, while Bill Ballard—Harold's son, who was running the Gardens while his father served a prison sentence—wanted the team at the Gardens and opposed the plan to upgrade the Coliseum. The Toros ended up at Varsity Arena for the 1973–74 season. [...] The following season, the Toros moved to the Gardens after negotiating a lease with Bill. However, by the time the team played their first game at the Gardens, Harold had been released from prison and regained control of the company. Ballard was a virulent opponent of the WHA; he never forgave the upstart league for decimating the Leafs' roster in the early 1970s. He made the Toros' lease terms at the Gardens as onerous as possible. The Toros' lease called for them to pay $15,000 per game. However, much to Bassett's outrage, the arena was dim for their first game. [...] It was then that Ballard demanded $3,500 for use of the lights. Ballard also denied the Toros access to the Leafs' locker room, forcing them to build their own at a cost of $55,000. He also removed the cushions from the home bench for Toros' games. [...] Following two seasons of declining attendance and onerous lease terms at the Gardens, Bassett moved the club to Birmingham, Alabama, where they were renamed the Birmingham Bulls for the 1976–77 season.|$|E

50|$|Steep slopes {{encourage}} rapid soil loss by {{erosion and}} allow less rainfall {{to enter the}} soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from <b>getting</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{government}} programs were described {{only in terms}} of their budgets. It is easy to measure the amount of money spent on a program, but this is a poor indicator of mission success.

The production of outputs is a better indicator that something was delivered to customers, but it is still possible that the output did not really meet the customer's needs, was not used, etc. Therefore, the focus on results or outcomes has become a mantra in government and not-for-profit programs.|$|R
