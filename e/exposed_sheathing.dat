50|$|The Foster Farm Barn {{is located}} on the {{property}} currently known as Winterberry Farm, in northern Belgrade, {{on the east side of}} Augusta Road (Maine State Route 27), just south of its junction with Point and Guptil Roads. It is set back from the road, behind the farmstand used for public sales, and north of the c. 1900 farmhouse. It is a two-story timber-frame structure with a gambrel roof. It is about 70 x 41 ft in size, and exhibits construction techniques common to the period after the American Civil War. It also includes features that were considered modern in the early 20th century for dairy farming purposes, including concrete manure troughs, ventilation slats in the walls, and specialized ducting to facilitate the movement of air to ventilators in the roof. The lower level of the barn is finished in original wooden shingles, while the upper levels of the walls are unfinished, with <b>exposed</b> <b>sheathing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Unvented roof {{strategies}} {{with open}} cell and closed cell spray polyurethane foam insulation sprayed to {{the underside of}} roof sheathing have been used since the mid- 1990 's to provide durable and efficient building enclosures. However, there have been isolated moisture related incidents reported anecdotally that raise potential concerns about the overall hygrothermal performance of these systems. The incidents related to rainwater leakage and condensation concerns. Condensation concerns have been extensively studied by others and are not further discussed in this report. This project involved hygrothermal modeling {{of a range of}} rainwater leakage and field evaluations of in-service residential roofs using spray foam insulation. All of the roof assemblies modeled exhibited drying capacity to handle minor rainwater leakage. All field evaluation locations of in-service residential roofs had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. Explorations of eleven in-service roof systems were completed. The exploration involved taking a sample of spray foam from the underside of the roof <b>sheathing,</b> <b>exposing</b> the <b>sheathing,</b> then taking a moisture content reading. All locations had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. One full-roof failure was reviewed, as an industry partner was involved with replacing structurally failed roof sheathing. In this case the manufacturer's investigation report concluded that the spray foam was installed on wet OSB based on the observation that the spray foam did not adhere well to the substrate and the pore structure of the closed cell spray foam at the ccSPF/OSB interface was indicative of a wet substrate...|$|R
30|$|Abbasi and Komatsu [1] {{adopted a}} {{proteomics}} approach to identify proteins that increase in abundance in leaf sheathes, roots, and leaf blades of 2 -week-old rice seedlings subjected to salt stress. In leaf <b>sheathes</b> <b>exposed</b> to NaCl, eight proteins consistently showed significant changes. Of these eight proteins, three remain unidentified, {{but the other}} five were identified as photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex protein, two fructose bisphosphate aldolases, oxygen-evolving enhancer protein (OEE) 2, and SOD. The study also revealed that increased expression of SOD is a common response to cold, drought, salt, and ABA stresses in the leaf sheath. This shows that the accumulation of SOD in response to salt, drought, or cold stresses has a general role in protecting against stress conditions. Under salt stress, enhanced expression of OEE 2, aldolase, and photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex protein was detected in the leaf sheathes and leaf blades. SOD {{and one of the}} unidentified proteins were also detected in salt-stressed leaf sheathes and roots. Another unidentified protein was expressed in leaf sheathes, but was below the limits of detection in leaf blades and roots.|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} in water potential between an enclosed nontranspiring leaf and an adjacent exposed transpiring leaf, and the transpiration rate of a similarly exposed leaf, {{were used to}} calculate the change in hydraulic resistance of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L. ] Moench) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) leaves throughout the day and at various rates of transpiration. Since cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) leaves enclosed in aluminum foil alone had enclosed leaf water potentials about 0. 06 megapascals lower than similar leaves enclosed in a polyethylene bag shielded with aluminum foil, the sorghum and sunflower leaves were enclosed in polyethylene bags shielded with aluminum foil. Enclosing the exposed leaf in a plastic sheath just prior to excision led to the water potential measured by the pressure chamber technique being 0. 3 to 0. 4 megapascals higher at rapid transpiration rates than in <b>exposed</b> leaves not <b>sheathed</b> just prior to excision. This error, previously shown to arise from rapid water loss after excision, led to an overestimation of the leaf hydraulic resistance in both species. Correction of the error reduced the resistance by 40 to 90 % in irrigated sorghum and by about 40 % in irrigated and unirrigated sunflower. After correction, the hydraulic resistances were still flow-dependent, but the dependency was markedly reduced in sorghum...|$|R
500|$|The Avery Homestead is {{a two-story}} Colonial-style house that is {{believed}} to have been originally constructed around 1696. The main block of the house is built in the double cube of the Georgian style. It is unknown if the house originally began as a one-room one-story house with the original structure having been on the current east-end of the main block. The expansion and alteration of houses in this way was common in Ledyard and tool markings and different fenestration patterns are supporting evidence for this theory. The strongest evidence is the pitsaw marks found on the chimney girts in the hall and parlor, <b>exposed</b> framing and <b>sheathing</b> has markings consistent with a water-powered up-and-down saw. It is certain that the house had achieved its two-story and two-room appearance by 1726 due to its parlor being used as a meeting room for church services. Further evidence in the construction of the fireplace flues which indicates that the main block of the house was completed prior to the American Revolution. Around 1780, the main house was extended by [...] in the rear during a two-story addition that gives the house a slight saltbox appearance. This changes were made while under the ownership of Theophilus Avery. Around 1870, under the ownership Theophilus Avery's grandson, also Theophilus Avery, the original kitchen ell was removed from the building and became a separate building to the east of the house. The new and present ell that was constructed served as an open shed until 1965 when it was converted to a shop and office.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the findings {{and implications of}} a 10 -year research program, carried out at the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, to develop kinetics-based service-life models for untreated and fire-retardant- (FR) treated plywood roof <b>sheathing</b> <b>exposed</b> to elevated in-service temperatures. This program was initiated because some FR-treated sheathing products were experiencing significant thermal degrade {{and needed to be}} replaced. This 10 -year research program systematically identified the cause of the degradation and has resulted in new acceptance and performance standards and revisions to U. S. building codes. The strength loss was cumulatively related to FR chemistry, thermal exposure during pretreatment, treatment, and post-treatment processing, and in-service exposure. Quantitatively, a kinetics-based approach could be used to predict strength loss of plywood based on its time [...] temperature exposure history. The research program then developed models to assess current condition, predict future hazard based on past service life, and predict residual serviceability of untreated and FR-treated plywood used as structural roof sheathing. Findings for each of these subjects are briefly described in this report. Results of research programs like this one can be used to extend the service life of wood by providing engineers with an estimate of residual serviceability and thereby avoiding premature removal. Many of the approaches in these kinetics-based servicelife models for plywood roof sheathing are directly applicable to the development of predictive durability models for wood and wood composite roof and wall sheathing that has been exposed to moisture and has eventually decayed. When those models are developed, they will help building code officials, [...] ...|$|R
