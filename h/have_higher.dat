5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less {{abundant in the}} crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It {{is significantly}} more abundant in the oceans, resulting from long-term leaching. There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions.

5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E

5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E
