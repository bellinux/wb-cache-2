50|$|For {{the first}} step, the dianion from malonic acid <b>half-ester</b> is formed by {{treatment}} with butyllithium. Acylation of the anion with benzoyl chloride proceeds at the carbanion, {{which is more}} nucleophilic (because of the higher charge density). This tricarbonyl compound decarboxylates on acidification to the β-ketoester. Condensation with guanidine leads to the pyrimidone. NBS mediated bromination then gives bropirimine.|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} of the following four new N-chloramine compounds was evaluated: two chlorinated simple amino acids, a chlorinated <b>half-ester</b> of succinic acid, and a chlorinated <b>half-ester</b> of glutaric acid. For comparison, the known bactericidal agents 3 -chloro- 4, 4 -dimethyl- 2 -oxazolidinone and chlorhexidine were evaluated by the same procedure. The contact germicidal efficiency screen {{was used to examine}} the in vitro bactericidal {{activity of}} all six compounds in the absence and presence of 5 % horse serum or 5 % Triton X- 100. The four new compounds were found to have greater germicidal activity than the other compounds tested and to exhibit low toxicity and skin irritation values. The in vivo bactericidal activity was evaluated in two studies. In the occlusion test, three of the four new compounds plus chlorhexidine diacetate were tested. The N-chloramines were significantly superior to chlorhexidine in preventing the expansion of the normal flora under occlusion. In the scrub test, a gloved-hand wash method was used to compare the antimicrobial effect of a 1 % solution of the chlorinated <b>half-ester</b> of succinic acid in triacetin with that of a commercial germicidal hand wash containing 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate. The two preparations exhibited essentially the same hand-degerming activity...|$|E

The key step implicates an intramolecular cyclization to a cyclopentenyl cation, {{according to an}} electrocyclic π 2 s[*]+[*] π 2 a conrotatory process, published in a recent paper (from the corresponding diacids). We have investigated the thermal behavior of the corresponding <b>half-esters</b> since; if the cyclization obeys to the proposed mechanism, the diacids, <b>half-esters</b> must also cyclize in a similar manner.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Poly(tetramethy 1 ene oxide) (PTHF) oligomers, Mn = 650 - 2000, {{have been}} capped with ph-thalate ester (2) and with phthalic <b>half-ester</b> (3). Properties {{of the latter}} are {{strongly}} influenced by hydrogen-bonding association of carboxylic acid termini. DSC revealed new, high-temperature transitions in the carboxyl-terminated oligomers (3) which decreased in temperature as PTHF molecular weight increased. Ester-terminated oligomers 2 have the rheological properties of simple liquids. Oligomers 3 exhibit melt viscosities and dynamic moduli which decrease sharply a t the highest DSC transition temperature but nevertheless exceed those of 2 over the entire range studied. These carboxyl-terminated oligomers exhibit elasticity-dominated responses to small strains with a linear viscoelastic region and good recovery to large strain amplitude oscillatory shear. All observations are consistent with formation of large crystalline aggregates of carboxyl-terminated chain ends below the high-temperature DSC transition.

40|$|Abstract. The glyceryl <b>half-ester</b> of clccenylsuccinic acid (G 10 SA) closes tree stomata when sprayed {{directly}} {{upon the}} undersides of leaves. Regression analysis of streamfiow from two small watersheds at Cowccta {{showed that a}} 12 % reduction in transpiration might, be detected as {{a significant increase in}} streamfiow. Two sprays of 50 pounds of GilOSA in water applied to 30 acres of one watershed from a helicopter produced little deposit on the undersides of leaves and no clear evidence of stomatal closure. Observed increases in streamfiow were statistically insignificant. Nearly all the water plants absorb from the soil passes through the stomata or pores in the leaves. Stomatal resistance is a natural in-hibitor of transpiration, partially dependent on stomatal opening. The artificial closure of stomata should decrease transpiration and in-crease water percolating through the soil to streams or groundwater. A harmless spray tha...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} the {{bactericidal}} action of soaps {{have been made by}} numerous observers. Among them the most recent include those by Tilley and Schaffer, Walker, Eggerth, and Schaffer and Tilley. In general, such action increases with the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid up to a maximum which depends upon factors such as the hydrogen ion concentration, the nature of the test organism, and the solubility of the soap, but is usually highest in those soaps containing 12 or 14 carbon atoms. In the present paper are presented data on the bacteriostatic action of a somewhat related class of substances, the sodium alkyl sulfates, some of which (Drene, Duponol, S. L. S., etc.) have come into widespread use as detergents during the past few years. Soaps and alkyl sulfates are alike in that an alkyl chain is common to both and is the active principle, but it will be recalled that whereas soap is a combination of fatty acid and an alkali, the alkyl sulfates are <b>half-esters</b> of sulfuric acid. The following formulae are descriptive: Soap: R-COONa Alkyl sulfate: NaR 0 o 2 S 02 Both are excellent surface tension depressants, but the alkyl sulfates give clear solutions, while the soaps, in general, cause a pronounced doudiness. The inhibitive rather than the germicidal powers were examined, in part because the latter are relatively weak, and partly because the former powers are more easily determined, but chiefly because {{from the standpoint of the}} physiology of bacteria bacteriostasis is probably quite as important as is the actual death of the cell. The following alkyl sulfates were induded in this study, all as the sodium salts: 2 ethyl 10 decyl 4 butyl 12 laury...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{artesunate}} and its metabolite dihydroartemisinin against the cerebral cysts of Toxoplasma gondii was studied. In vitro experiments were {{performed with the}} THP- 1 cell line and showed an inhibition of parasite growth of approximately 70 % with 0. 1 – 0. 5 g/ml of dihydroartemisinin for 96 hr. However, with artesunate, dihy-droartemisinin, or a combination (50 : 50) of them, the number of tachyzoites decreased approximately 40 – 50 % and they appeared motionless. Fifty-eight to 72 hr after washing of the tachyzoites and THP- 1 cells in culture, parasitized cells reappeared. In vivo, the 50 : 50 artesunate-dihydroartemisinin combination produced a decrease in cerebral cysts of approximately 40 % after only 5 days of treatment. However, transplantations into naı̈ve mice using brains of treated mice gave positive results. Artemisinin, a peroxide-containing sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the herb Artemisia annua, {{has been found to}} possess potent antimalarial activity and low toxicity both in animals and humans. 1, 2 Artesunate (a water soluble <b>half-ester</b> succinate derivative) and artemether (a methyl ether deriv-ative) are the only 2 derivatives of artemisinin that have been licensed in Thailand for treatment of Plasmodium falciparu...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{intramolecular}} Diels-Alder (IMDA) {{reaction in}} target synthesis has prompted investigation into methods of controlling the stereochemistry of this versatile cycloaddition. Linking the diene and dienophile via an ester-tether is a synthetically facile method of generating a range of precursors for the IMDA reaction and allows rapid access to the hydroisobenzofuranone skeleton. This bicyclic[4. 3. 0]nonane ring system is common to many natural products, including spongians and several novel steroids. Many of the previous examples of ester-tethered IMDA reactions exhibited a lack of stereoselectivity or were performed on racemic mixtures of starting materials. This thesis describes the synthesis of chiral dienols and tetraenols in enantiomerically pure form from monosaccharides. The esters derived from these alcohols possessed a sterically demanding substituent in the ester tether, {{and the influence of}} this bulky dioxolane substituent upon the stereochemical outcome of the IMDA reaction was the subject of this study. The purpose of these investigations was to gain information on stereocontrol in the ester-tethered IMDA reaction and, thus, provide a foundation for the tandem IMDA (TIMDA) reaction. A chiral dienol was synthesised in an enantiomerically pure form from D-glucose and used to prepare Z-methyl, E-methyl and propynoate esters with a dioxolane substituent on the ester tether. The IMDA reactions of these substrates were studied and found to exhibit high levels of diastereoselectivity. In particular, the IMDA reaction of the Z-methyl ester had both extremely high exo/endo selectivity (86 : 14) and complete π-diastereofacial selectivity. The IMDA reaction of the E-methyl ester was less selective. The diastereoselectivities of the IMDA reactions were explained by the minimised A 1. 3 -strain in the favoured transition state. It has been long contended in the literature that the IMDA reactions of maleate half-esters (carboxylic acids) produced endo adducts whereas the corresponding Z-methyl esters (of the maleate half-esters) produced exo adducts. Comparison of the IMDA reaction of the Z-methyl ester described above with that of its maleate <b>half-ester,</b> disputed this theory. The IMDA reactions of the acid and of the methyl ester exhibited the same diastereoselectivity, with the same ratio of exo:endo adduct in each case. This result prompted an investigation into previous research in this area. It was discovered that the previously made assumptions as to the mechanism of reaction between dienols and maleic anhydride (MA) were suspect. With the purpose of studying the differences in diastereoselectivity and relative rate caused by altering one of two adjacent stereocentres, the results of the model study on the chiral dienol were extended to two diastereomeric tetraenol systems. Both diastereomeric tetraene substrates were synthesised from monosaccharide starting materials; D-glucose and D-galactose. The D-glucose-derived esters were found to undergo IMDA reactions with higher levels of diastereoselectivity than those of the D-galactose-derived esters. In the case of the IMDA reactions of the D-galactose-derived esters, all four of the possible diastereoisomers were produced. In addition to the decreased diastereoselectivity, an increase in the rate of IMDA reaction of the D-galactose-derived substrates was observed when compared to the D-glucose-derived esters. Notably, as with the dienol series, the D-glucose-derived Z-methyl ester exhibited extremely high levels of diastereoselectivity. A disconnection analysis of the cyclopentano perhydroanthrene skeleton of the steroids reveals that a TEMDA reaction would be an elegant method of synthesis. Towards this end, and utilising the information garnered from the model studies on dienol and tetraenol-derived substrates, the ester-tethered TIMDA reaction was investigated. A range of TIMDA precursors, in which a bis-diene (tetraene moiety) and bis-dienophile were linked via an ester tether, were assembled and TIMDA reactions of these substrates were attempted. The most promising area of investigation proved to be a diketone intermediate and future work remains to be performed in this area...|$|E
