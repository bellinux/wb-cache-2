We examined small mammal response to timber harvest in stands 8 - 10 years following <b>group-selection,</b> two-story, and clearcut harvest, how provision of new downed wood influenced small mammals in <b>group-selection</b> and clearcut stands, and use of downed wood by Townsend's chipmunks (Tamias townsendii) in <b>group-selection</b> stands. Densities of adult and reproductive female deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) were greatest in harvested stands, whereas other measures for deer mice and Townsend's chipmunks (e. g., densities of male deer mice and male chipmunks), and densities of Oregon voles (Microtus oregoni) and Pacific shrews (Sorex pacificus) were similar among all stand conditions. Density of vagrant shrews (Sorex vagrans) was greatest in clearcut stands and decreased with decreasing harvest intensity. Although limited data precluded statistical analysis, abundances of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and western red-backed voles (Clethrionomys californicus) were similar between unharvested control stands and <b>group-selection</b> stands. Within two years following augmentation of downed wood, we did not detect any response of small mammal populations to the downed wood. Our results suggest that small mammal populations can benefit from alternative silvicultural treatments that retain overstory trees and that stands with areas of closed-canopy forest can provide habitat for species that are more abundant in intact and mature forest conditions (e. g., northern flying squirrels). In our study of use of wood by Townsend's chipmunks, the model indicating disproportionate use of paths with downed wood by Townsend's chipmunk was 22. 6 {{times more likely than}} the null model, and a chipmunk was 3. 0 times more likely to select locations with downed wood at average wood densities (paths with 26...|$|E

Silvicultural treatments generally open the canopy but may not restore shade-intolerant species. We determined crossover-point irradiance (CPI) (light at which the height growth rank of pairs of species changes) for seedlings in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest and used these to interpret light environments produced by fuels-reduction thinning and group selection with reserved large trees. Nine of 21 species pairs had well-defined CPIs. The CPI {{of the most common}} shade-tolerant and intolerant species (white fir (Abies concolor (Gordon & Glendl.) Lindl. ex Hildebr.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson)) was 22. 5 mol m^(- 2) day^(- 1) or 41 % of full sun. Median understory irradiance increased from 9. 2 mol m^(- 2) day^(- 1) (17 % full sun) in pretreatment forest to 13 mol m^(- 2 day^(- 1) (24 % full sun) in lightly and 15. 5 mol m^(- 2) day^(- 1) (28 % full sun) in moderately thinned stands and 37 mol m^(- 2) day^(- 1) (67 % full sun) in <b>group-selection</b> openings.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how past human disturbance has altered forest plant communities within three ecological land type phases (wet-mesic bottomlands, mesic slopes and dry-mesic slopes) in southern Indiana. Specific objectives were to (1) summarize how past land use has changed the land cover of the Charles C. Deam Wilderness in southern Indiana between 1939 and 1990, (2) determine how past disturbance (agriculture, clearcutting, <b>group-selection</b> harvest, and single-tree selection harvest) has altered herbaceous and woody vegetation in Platanus/Asarum wet-mesic bottomlands, (3) determine how silvicultural practices (clearcutting, <b>group-selection</b> harvest, and single-tree selection harvest) have altered herbaceous and woody vegetation on Fagus-Acer saccharum/Arisaema mesic slopes and Quercus alba-Acer sarccharum/Parthenocissus dry-mesic slopes, and (4) determine how silvicultural practices have influenced the volume of down deadwood. In 1939 land cover of the Charles C. Deam Wilderness was 33 % agriculture/old-fields and 26 % open/grazed forest. Closed canopy forest comprised only 41 % of the total land area. By 1974, 78 % of the Wilderness was closed canopy forest and by 1990 closed canopy forest comprised 86 % of the landscape. This increase in closed canopy forest has drastically decreased forest fragmentation in the landscape. While closed canopy forest now dominates Hoosier National Forest, abandoned agricultural areas in wet-mesic bottomlands still exhibit highly disturbed understory plant communities with large components of exotic and disturbance species. In comparison, silvicultural practices have not altered understory species composition and diversity to the degree that past agriculture has. Past agricultural use, clearcutting, and <b>group-selection</b> harvest have created overstories dominated by Liriodendron tulipifera and other early successional species, while single-tree selection harvesting has accelerated succession towards dominance by Acer saccharum and reduced overstory species richness. Down deadwood volume was greatest in recent silvicultural openings and old-growth but declined in older openings and was lowest in 80 - 100 year-old stands. Overall, the results of this study suggest that large-scale disturbance is needed to maintain the structure and diversity of southern Indiana forests. ...|$|E

We examined effects of group selection silviculture on percolation (presence of continuously forested routes across a landscape) in Sierra Nevada East-side pine forest in northern California, USA. Four * 250 ha project areas were analyzed at three map resolutions in three ways: analyzing forest cover maps for percolation {{before and after}} <b>group-selection</b> treatment, placing simulated group openings in forest cover maps until fragmentation occurred, and com-paring project areas to neutral maps that varied in forest cover and self-adjacency. Two project areas were fragmented (i. e., did not percolate) prior to treatment, one resisted fragmentation, and the other became fragmented by treatment when analyzed at 30 m cell resolution. Median simulated openings required to create fragmentation agreed well with the actual number. There was a well-defined transition between percolating and non-percolating neutral maps; increased aggregation of forest lowered the critical value at which forests percolated. A logistic model based on these maps predicted percolation behavior of the project areas effectively, but alternative generating algorithms gave slightly different predictions. A graph of this model provides a straightforward way to visualize how close a landscape is to fragmentation based on its forest cover and aggregation.

We compared abundance of resident birds among three alternative silvicultural treatments (modified clearcut, two-story, small-patch <b>group-selection)</b> and unharvested controls during winter. Total bird abundance was highest in small-patch stands and lowest in modified clearcuts during winter. Species richness was highest in smallpatch stands and lowest in control and clearcut stands. Two species (Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa)) were most abundant in control stands and small-patch stands. Spotted towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) were more abundant in two-story stands; dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) were more abundant in harvested stands than control stands. The small-patch <b>group-selection</b> treatment retained structural and compositional complexity of vegetation and provided habitat for more individuals than two-story or modified clearcut treatments. However, two-story and modified clearcut treatments with components of mature and old-growth forests (snags, logs, large trees) provided habitat for several bird species during winter.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 In the Pacific Northwest, a {{transition}} has begun that is shifting many practices in forest management. Traditionally, harvesting and regeneration {{has been done}} through clearcutting which removes all trees in the area being cut and plants an entirely new stand. Clearcutting is often the most efficient method for harvesting forests since implementation and other costs are kept to a minimum, while yields and revenues are maximized by removing all of the timber. Now, however, ecosystem and aesthetic concerns are directing forest management away from clearcutting, which usually impairs both, and toward other methods that are less damaging to the environment. Many of these alternative systems can be classified under the heading New Forestry. " Typically, their applications involve leaving live trees on the site after a cutting, thereby creating a more diversified stand than would a clearcut. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the timber volumes and financial yields between New Forestry techniques and clearcutting. Two alternative systems of management were designed to represent variations on the New Forestry theme. The first was a two-story technique where the stand would consist of two distinct size classes, and all harvests would leave a few trees scattered throughout the site. The second alternative method was a <b>group-selection</b> system that would consist of multiple entries removing small patches of a stand at a time. It was determined that managing two-story stands would reduce volume yields by 3 % to 29 % and financial yields by 6 % to 15 % depending on the number of live trees left after harvest. <b>Group-selection</b> stands reduced average annual volume yields by 6 % or 10 % and financial yields by 33 % or 45 % depending on the number of entries in a rotation. A financial analysis with price premiums for larger logs was also performed, but the yields did not experience much of a change...|$|E

40|$|What is group {{selection}}? Group {{selection is}} {{the process by which}} variable groups, in a population of groups, compete and are differentially represented future generations. Heritable traits that increase the survival and reproductive success of groups will increase in frequency in the population of groups. Like any type of selection (natural, artificial, sexual, or otherwise) we need three components for selection to operate: heritability, variation, and differential survival or reproductive success. Heritability requires a system of information transmission; early theories of <b>group-selection,</b> such as that of V. C. Wynn-Edwards (1986), assumed genetic inheritance. Traits that increase group fitness are transmitted to new group members via genetic reproduction of members. Many of the social insects transmit group-beneficial traits genetically. Argentine ants, a species that forms massive super-colonies, are currently invading North America, Asia, and Europe due to heritable willingness to cooperate with super-colony co-members and fight foreign super-colonies and the colonies of other species of ants (Pedersen et al. 2006).

Ovenbirds nesting in undisturbed reference forest produce fewer male offspring per brood (proportion male =  30 %) while logging with progressively greater forest disturbance, shifted the offspring sex ratio towards males (proportion male: moderate =  50 %, heavy =  70 %).

To do so, they subscribe to the DDS topic where any message or context update is disseminated (e.g., those sent by mobiles and forwarded by the corresponding Gateway), and they map each node {{to one or more}} groups according to an application-specific group membership processing logic. This group membership information is then shared with all Gateways in the SDDL core network using a specific DDS Topic for control, to which all Gateways subscribe so they can update their cached mobile node’s membership information.

40|$|The {{effects of}} harvest-created canopy gaps in {{bottomland}} hardwood forests on arthropod abundance and, hence, the foraging ecology of birds are poorly understood. I predicted that arthropod abundance would be high near edges of <b>group-selection</b> harvest gaps and {{lower in the}} surrounding forest, and that male Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) foraging near gaps would find more prey per unit time than those foraging in the surrounding forest. In fact, arthropod abundance was greater > 100 m from a gap edge than at 0 - 30 m or 30 - 100 m from an edge, due to their abundance on switchcane (Arundinaria gigantea); arthropods {{did not differ in}} abundance among distances from gaps on oaks (Quercus spp.) or red maple (Acer rubrum). Similarly, Hooded Warbler foraging attack rates were not higher near gap edges: when foraging for fledglings, attack rate did not differ among distances from gaps, but when foraging for themselves, attack rates actually were lower 0 - 30 m from gap edges than 30 - 100 m or > 100 m from a gap edge. Foraging attack rate was positively associated with arthropod abundance. Hooded Warblers apparently encountered fewer prey and presumably foraged less efficiently where arthropods were least abundant, i. e., near gaps. That attack rates among birds foraging for fledglings were not affected by distance from gap (and hence arthropod abundance) suggests that prey availability may not be limiting at any location across the forest, despite the depressing effects of gaps on arthropod abundance...|$|E

Gaps were 2 - to 3 -year-old <b>group-selection</b> timber harvest openings of three sizes (0. 13, 0. 26, 0. 50 ha). Our study was conducted from spring through fall, encompassing four bird-use periods (spring migration, breeding, post-breeding, and fall migration), in 2002 and 2003. We used mist netting and simultaneously recorded microclimate variables to {{determine the influence of}} microclimate on bird habitat use.

We evaluated the effects of alternate, structure-based silvicultural systems on red-backed salamander populations at two research sites in northwestern Vermont. Treatments included two uneven-aged approaches (single-tree selection and <b>group-selection)</b> and one unconventional approach, termed ‘‘structural complexity enhancement’’ (SCE), that promotes development of late-successional structure, including elevated levels of coarse woody debris (CWD). Treatments were applied to 2 ha units and were replicated two to four times depending on treatment. We surveyed red-backed salamanders with a natural cover search method of transects nested within vegetation plots 1 year after logging. Abundance estimates corrected for detection probability were calculated from survey data with a binomial mixture model. Abundance estimates differed between study areas and were influenced by forest structural characteristics.

We found no difference in abundance {{as a response to}} treatment as a whole, suggesting that all of the uneven-aged silvicultural systems evaluated can maintain salamander populations after harvest. However, abundance was tied to specific structural habitat attributes associated with study plots within treatments. The most parsimonious model of habitat covariates included site, relative density of overstory trees, and density of more-decayed and less-decayed downed CWD.

40|$|Group {{foraging}} {{has been}} proposed {{to be the most}} efficient manner with which to exploit habitats with renewing patches as individuals in groups are less likely to revisit patches that have already been exploited recently by others. However, to avoid a <b>group-selection</b> argument, it is necessary to compare the success of solitary and group foraging tactics when each competes with the other. We used a genetic algorithm approach to examine {{the costs and benefits of}} exploiting renewing resources in a spatially and temporally explicit habitat, thus controlling the time course of resource renewal and including the time cost of traveling between patches, which may be a significant factor for group foragers that deplete patches more quickly. Results indicate that group foragers fare more poorly than an equivalent number of solitary foragers in the same habitat unless the rate of resource renewal is very low. The low revisitation rate by group foragers allows resources to replenish more fully, thus maintaining the resource level across the habitat at a higher level. In contrast, solitary foragers, who revisit previously exploited patches more often, maintain the same resources at a lower level. Nevertheless, a pure population of group foragers can be readily invaded by solitary foragers even when the rate of renewal is at low levels. We conclude that while group foraging may be an efficient tactic to exploit renewing resources, it is not a stable strategy under the circumstances examined in this model.

The free parameters of the <b>group-selection</b> algorithms were tuned to obtain similar catalogs of groups. The author also proposed a third catalog of groups defined as {{a combination of the}} two. Each catalog contains almost 500 groups. In agreement with previous works on earlier catalogs, we find that groups can be described as collapsing systems. Their sampled size is in general considerably larger than their expected virialized region. We compute the virial masses and correct them by taking into account the young dynamical status of these groups. We estimate corrected group masses, M, for two reference cosmological models, a flat one with a matter density parameter Ω 0 = 1 and an open one with Ω 0 = 0. 2. For each of the three catalogs we calculate the mass function. We find that the amplitude of the mass function is not very sensitive to the choice of the groupidentification algorithm. The number density of groups with M> 9 × 10 12 h − 1 M⊙, which is the adopted limit of sample completeness, ranges in the interval 1. 3 – 1. 9 × 10 − 3 h 3 Mpc − 3 for Ω 0 = 1, and it i...|$|E
40|$|Dead wood in {{forests of}} Serbia hasn`t been studied so far, {{although}} {{it is an important}} component of forest eco-systems. Th is paper presents results of investigating volume, biomass, and carbon stock bound in the dead wood of beech high forests. Th e sample includes eleven pure beech stands selected in six forest regions. Th ey are all un-even-aged stands that have been managed for the last several decades, mostly under selection or <b>group-selection.</b> Th eir site class is I/II–III/IV. Th e altitude ranges from 400 to 1380 m. One stand belongs to submontane (Fagetum moesiacae submontanum B. Jov. 1967) and ten to montane (Fagetum moesiacae montanum B. Jov. 1953) beech forests. A systematic sample was used to determine the presence, quantity, diameter structure of volume, and state of dead wood considering its degree of decomposition both in standing and lying position. Sample plots of 500 m 2, at a distance of 100 x 100 m were used as elements of the sample. Altogether 242 sample plots were established. Th e volume of aboveground dead wood was determined by applying familiar dendrometric methods, while the dry biomass was calculated {{on the basis of its}} volume and wood density at diff erent degrees of decomposition. Th e biomass of belowground dead wood i. e. roots of stumps and snags was obtained directly using the relevant regression equations. Th e quantity of the carbon bound in dead wood was calculated by multiplying dry biomass of dead wood by 0. 5 coeffi cient. A simple and a stratifi ed sample were used for the purposes of estimating the av-erage and total volume, biomass, and carbon stock of dead wood. It was concluded that the average abovegroun...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the position and density of a secondary road network in the <b>group-selection</b> management system. The research was conducted in the economic unit Prosara in the north west of the Republic of Srpska. The network of skid roads in the analyzed sections was recorded using the GPS devices Garmin GPS 60 and Garmin Map 62 st, and the analysis software package used was ESRI ArcInfo 10. 1. Adhering to the general guidelines, the slope of skid roads was analyzed within six predefined intervals: 0 - 12 %, 12 - 16 %, 16 - 20 %, 20 - 30 %, 30 - 40 % and over 40 %. Relative openness with a secondary road network was determined for a maximum distance between the skid roads of 130 m and it ranged from 82. 62 % to 96. 37 %. Such openness was classified as very good and excellent. Together with all factors related to stand and terrain characteristics, it appears that in all the compartments, the density of the secondary network of skid roads is adequate for the application of a skidder with a winch, without extending above the maximum length of the winch rope. Out of the total length of analyzed skid roads, 24 % is within an appropriate slope interval for a planned conversion to truck roads, whereas 37 % is the maximum slope from the ecological point of view. The average terrain slope for the whole analyzed area is 26. 4 %. Such moderately sloping terrain is suitable for the construction of skid roads with low investment and small environmental impact. Due to their specific configuration, the main skid roads were designed along the ridge, while the secondary and tertiary skid roads most often separated from them at the maximum slope, forming an irregular fish bone shape...|$|E
40|$|The stand {{dynamics}} {{and production of}} two one-acre plots of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L) in Connecticut have been followed {{for more than six}} decades. Data were recorded for all individual trees. One plot (Saltonstall) was established in 1924 after the removal of a hardwood overstory. This stand had a nearly pure, almost fully closed understory of hemlock that was subjected to partial cuttings in 1936, 1954, and 1956. The stand was lost to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in 1993. The other plot (Perry) was established in 1931 in a nearly pure hemlock stand that had arisen on an abandoned pasture around 1850. This plot had a crop-tree release cutting in 1931 and has not been infested with hemlock woolly adelgid. Both plots developed a rotated sigmoid diameter distribution, characteristic of uneven-aged forests, after sixty years of management. The 1936 attempt at <b>group-selection</b> cutting in the Saltonstall plot did not maintain the reverse J-shaped diameter distribution that had initially existed. The stand was essentially even-aged and the diameter distribution shifted to a broad bell-shaped form and then to a rotated sigmoid curve when a new age class grew large enough {{to be included in the}} tally. The thinning of the Perry plot also turned the initial bell-shaped diameter-distribution curve to the rotated sigmoid form for the same reason. Annual periodic increment (including harvested volumes) was 52 and 50 cubic feet/acre for the Saltonstall and Perry plot, respectively. Annual basal area growth decreased from over 3 ft 2 /acre to approximately 2 ft 2 /acre on both plots over sixty years. These findings indicate that hemlock is capable of rapid growth with stand management. Implications for managing hemlock forests are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Differences between {{related species}} are usually {{explained}} as separate adaptations produced by individual selection. I discuss {{in this paper}} how related species, which differ in many respects, may evolve {{by a combination of}} individual selection, self-organization, and <b>group-selection,</b> requiring an evolutionary adaptation of only a single trait. In line with the supposed evolution of despotic species of macaques, we take as a starting point an ancestral species that is egalitarian and mildly aggressive. We suppose it to live in an environment with abundant food and we put the case that, if food becomes scarce and more clumped, natural selection {{at the level of the}} individual will favor individuals with a more intense aggression (implying, for instance, biting and fierce fighting). Using an individual-centered model, called DomWorld, I show what happens when the intensity of aggression increases. In DomWorld, group life is represented by artificial individuals that live in a homogeneous world. Individuals are extremely simple: all they do is flock together and, upon meeting one another, they may perform dominance interactions in which the effects of winning and losing are self-reinforcing. When the intensity of aggression in the model is increased, a complex feedback between the hierarchy and spatial structure results; via self-organization, this feedback causes the egalitarian society to change into a despotic one. The many differences between the two types of artificial society closely correspond to those between despotic and egalitarian macaques in the real world. Given that, in the model, the organization changes as side effect of the change of one single trait proper to an egalitarian society, in the real world a despotic society may also have a-risen as a side effect of the mutation of a single trait of an egalitarian species. If groups with different intensities of aggression evolve in this way, they will also have different gradients of hierarchy. When food is scarce, groups with the steepest hierarchy may have the best chance to survive, because at least a small number of individuals in such a group may succeed in producing offspring, whereas in egalitarian societies every individual is at risk of being insufficiently fed to reproduce. Therefore, intrademic group selection (selection within an interbreeding group) may have contributed to the evolution of despotic societie...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether <b>group-selection</b> provides {{habitat of}} similar quality for early-successional shrubland-nesting birds as does clearcutting. There {{was no difference}} in avian reproductive success between clearcuts and groupcuts, indicating that clearcuts and groupcuts provide habitat of similar quality for early-successional shrubland-nesting birds. ^ We studied Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvanica) nesting in 29 patches of regenerating northern hardwoods forest 0. 15 – 0. 69 ha in area to determine whether the ecology of this species is affected by patch size or shape. Chestnut-sided Warbler density was higher, and pairs initiated nesting later in smaller patches, yet patch size was unrelated to fledging success or nest predation rates and patch area. Territory density, nest initiation dates, fledging success and nest predation rates were unrelated to patch shape. ^ We compared nest predation rates between groupcut and clearcut borders (0 – 5 m from edges) and forest interior areas (45 – 50 m from edges) using artificial shrub nests baited with Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs. The probability of a nest being depredated was higher in edge areas than forest interior areas (P = 0. 02) and was independent of nest concealment, nest height, or whether the nest was adjacent to a clearcut or a groupcut (P = 0. 18). ^ We compared survival rates of used natural nests baited with House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) eggs with survival rates of active bird nests at the same sites. Survival rates of artificial nests (27. 7 %) were significantly lower than nest survival rates of natural nests (58. 6 %). We suggest that lack of parental defense is a contributing factor responsible for higher predation rates on artificial nests, and {{is likely to be a}} potential confounding factor in future nest predation experiments using artificial nests. ^ We studied patterns of plumage variation in the Chestnut-sided Warbler to determine if plumage brightness was related to reproductive performance. There were no relationships between plumage brightness and reproductive success of either male or female Chestnut-sided Warblers. Adult males and females were brighter than subadult males and females, however, adult and subadult males and females fledged as many young as adult males and females. Thus, delayed plumage maturation in the Chestnut-sided Warbler is not associated with decreased reproductive output in subadult birds. We suggest that the duller plumage of subadult Chestnut-sided Warblers is more likely a reliable indicator of subordinate status, and that delayed plumage maturation serves in this species to reduce aggression from adult birds. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} three catalogs of nearby loose groups {{compiled}} by A. M. Garcia. She identified {{groups in a}} magnitude-limited redshift galaxy catalog, which covers about ~ 2 / 3 of sky within cz= 5500 km s- 1, using two methods, a percolation method and a hierarchical method. The free parameters of the <b>group-selection</b> algorithms were tuned to obtain similar catalogs of groups. The author also proposed a third catalog of groups, defined as {{a combination of the}} two. Each catalog contains almost 500 groups. In agreement with previous works on earlier catalogs, we find that groups can be described as collapsing systems. Their sampled size is in general considerably larger than their expected virialized region. We compute the virial masses and correct them by taking into account the young dynamical status of these groups. We estimate corrected group masses, M, for two reference cosmological models, a flat one with a matter density parameter Ω 0 = 1 and an open one with Ω 0 = 0. 2. We calculate the mass function {{for each of the three}} catalogs. We find that the amplitude of the mass function is not very sensitive to the choice of the group-identification algorithm. The number density of groups with M> 9 × 1012 h- 1 Msolar, which is the adopted limit of sample completeness, ranges in the interval 1. 3 - 1. 9 × 10 - 3 h 3 Mpc- 3 for Ω 0 = 1, and it is about a factor of 15 % lower for Ω 0 = 0. 2. The mass functions of the hierarchical and combined catalogs have essentially the same shape, while the mass function of the percolation catalog shows a flattening toward large masses. However, the difference decreases if we do not consider the most massive groups, for which reliable results come from galaxy cluster studies. After having estimated the mass contained within the central, presumably virialized, regions of groups by adopting a reduction in mass of ~ 30 %- 40 %, we make a comparison with the results from the virial analysis of nearby rich clusters. All three group mass functions turn out to be a smooth extrapolation of the cluster mass function at M< 4 × 1014 h- 1 Msolar, which is the completeness limit of the cluster sample. The resulting optical virial mass function of galaxy systems, which extends over 2 orders of magnitude, is fitted to a Schechter expression with a slope of ~ 1. 5 and a characteristic mass of M*~ 3 × 1014 h- 1 Msolar. We also verify that our group mass function agrees reasonably well with the Press-Schechter predictions of models which at large masses describe the virial mass function of clusters...|$|E
