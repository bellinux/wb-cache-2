GAMA Energy is a joint venture between the Turkish GAMA Holding and the US firm General <b>Electric</b> <b>Energy</b> Financial Services. Diwaco is responsible to build the project over a 4-year period and to operate it for another 25 years. At the end of the concession period the ownership will transfer to the Jordanian government. Diwaco will retain any profits and will bear the risk of losing its equity. Construction is undertaken by GAMA Power Systems, another subsidiary of GAMA Holding, under a turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contract with Diwaco. Operation will be undertaken by Disi Amman Operation Maintenance LLC, a fully owned subsidiary of the French water company Suez Environnement, under a separate operating contract with Diwaco.|$|E

5000|$|Electrical {{energy is}} the energy newly derived from <b>electric</b> {{potential}} <b>energy</b> or kinetic energy. When loosely {{used to describe}} energy absorbed or delivered by an electrical circuit (for example, one provided by an electric power utility) [...] "electrical energy" [...] talks about energy which has been converted from <b>electric</b> potential <b>energy.</b> This energy is supplied by the combination of electric current and electric potential that is delivered by the circuit. At the point that this <b>electric</b> potential <b>energy</b> has been converted to another type of energy, it ceases to be <b>electric</b> potential <b>energy.</b> Thus, all electrical energy is potential energy before it is delivered to the end-use. Once converted from potential energy, electrical energy can always be called another type of energy (heat, light, motion, etc.).|$|R

25|$|As {{commercial}} use of <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> {{spread in the}} 1880s, it became increasingly important that an <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> meter, similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers {{for the cost of}} energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. - Previous optical {{observations}} {{have shown}} that the first order struc-tural phase transitions of some ferroelectric (e. g. KD PO) or piezoelectric 2 4. (e. 9. quartz) crystals present some similarity with martensltic transforma-tions: two phases with different lattice parameters coexist over a small tem-perature range and the low temperature phase can be twinned; (this twinning corresponds to alternate shears and electric polarization in the case of KD 2 P 0). In contrast with martensites both elastic and electric properties are important in determining the morphology of the heterophase structure. In particular the habit plane separating the two phases is no longer a plane without long range strains when <b>electric</b> <b>energies</b> are not negligible. In this case one has to determine the configuration for which the sum of the elastic and <b>electric</b> <b>energies</b> is minimum: this can be done for an inclusion of the new phase in an infinite matrix of the parent phase by extending Khachaturyan's theory {{to take into account the}} electric and piezeoelectric properties.
