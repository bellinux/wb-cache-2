500|$|Rodin's {{talent for}} surface {{modeling}} {{allowed him to}} let {{every part of the}} body speak for the whole. The male's passion in The Thinker is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands. Speaking of The Thinker, Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: [...] "What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Archie Hahn {{became a}} major star, and Fitzpatrick was {{credited}} with inventing his unusual running style. [...] Shortly before the 1904 Olympics, a Wisconsin sports writer described the Fitzpatrick-invented style this way:"Hahn has a new style of running. Nobody at Michigan understands the style, except that Keene Fitzpatrick invented it, and that Hahn steps differently than ever before. Even to see Hahn's new stride is not to analyze how he manages to lift his feet so high in front. The new stride suggests that {{he is trying to}} climb a hill. The little man has toughened <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> in his body and trained it to be a spring." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{knew it was}} dangerous, and she stopped. He was {{gathered}} together, <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> ready.|$|E
60|$|He fell back, and {{a strange}} {{expression}} stole upon his features; not of pain or suffering, but an indescribable fixing of <b>every</b> line and <b>muscle.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What price tobacco?" [...] was Mr. Mellaire's greeting, when I came on deck this morning, {{bruised and}} weary, aching in <b>every</b> bone and <b>muscle</b> from sixty hours of being tossed about.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hinchcliffe, <b>every</b> {{nerve and}} <b>muscle</b> braced, talked {{only to the}} engineer, and that professionally. I {{recalled}} the time when I, too, had enjoyed the rack on which he voluntarily extended himself.|$|R
60|$|The bored languor of {{his face}} had {{abruptly}} vanished. <b>Every</b> <b>muscle</b> was alert; his gray eyes glittered.|$|E
60|$|Batard growled {{deep down}} in his throat, the hair {{bristled}} along his neck, and <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> went tense and expectant.|$|E
60|$|<b>Every</b> <b>muscle</b> in Mr. Buffin's body stiffened. He {{gripped his}} stick and waited. The road was deserted. In another moment....|$|E
50|$|Like <b>every</b> pelvic-area <b>muscle,</b> the gluteus maximus muscle {{originates}} {{from the}} pelvis; nonetheless, {{it is the}} sole pelvic muscle not inserted to the trochanter (head of the femur), and is approximately aligned to the femur and the fascia lata (the deep fascia of the thigh); the tissues of the gluteus maximus muscle cover only the rear, lateral face of the trochanter, and there form a bursa (purse) that faces {{the interior of the}} thigh.|$|R
50|$|Together they {{exercise}} <b>every</b> major <b>muscle</b> in {{the body}} and take no more than 20 minutes to complete. The relative ease of the 17 moves (11 standing and six floor exercises) engage all the organs and muscles of the body together in harmony rather than separating out one part of the body from another. This produces a more efficient way of staying fit and healthy by increasing and balancing the chi energy.|$|R
5|$|In {{rare cases}} where {{none of the}} oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a <b>muscle)</b> <b>every</b> few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|R
60|$|McTurk's lank frame {{stiffened}} in <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> and {{his eyelids}} dropped half over his eyes. That last was a war-signal.|$|E
60|$|Then the dog {{crouched}} for a spring, and Jet, <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> {{strained to}} its utmost tension, stood {{ready to receive}} him.|$|E
60|$|A plains Indian, under similar circumstances, {{would have}} {{strained}} <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> till his bones cracked, before permitting himself to show effort or excitement.|$|E
6000|$|A {{stronger}} and more graphic eulogium is given by Dr. Percy. [...] "The conversation of Johnson," [...] says he, [...] "is strong and clear, and may be compared to an antique statue, where <b>every</b> vein and <b>muscle</b> is distinct and clear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon it won't be {{impossible}} to launch the little craft, after all. By bringing the hawser on to the winch, shiftin' the ballast aft, an' heavin' down with <b>every</b> ounce of <b>muscle</b> we've got, somethin' oughter {{be done at the}} next tide." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} lame and sore and weak, and as full {{consciousness}} returned {{he felt the}} sharp torture of many cruel wounds and the dull aching of <b>every</b> bone and <b>muscle</b> in his body {{as a result of}} the hideous beating he had received.|$|R
6000|$|... “This {{sound was}} to Davidson like a {{galvanic}} shock to a corpse. He started in <b>every</b> <b>muscle.</b> ‘Laughing Anne,’ {{he said in}} an awe-struck voice.|$|E
60|$|And {{the horse}} really did strain <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> until, two minutes later, the wagon {{was out of}} the hollow and up on the ridge of a little hill.|$|E
60|$|He {{lay there}} waiting, listening, wrought {{up to the}} intensest pitch of fierce passion. Every nerve was alert, every tendon strung, and <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> {{strained}} ready for the leap.|$|E
60|$|The first ball {{to come in}} was too high, and {{the second}} too low, so Fred let them go by. Then, however, came a {{straight}} ball just where he wanted it, and Fred swung at it with <b>every</b> ounce of <b>muscle</b> in his body.|$|R
5000|$|Myofibroblasts usually stain for the {{intermediate}} filament vimentin {{which is a}} general mesenchymal marker and [...] "alpha smooth muscle actin" [...] (human gene = ACTA2) and for palladin, which is a cytoskeletal actin scaffold protein. They are positive for other smooth markers like intermediate filament type desmin in some tissues, but may be negative for desmin in some others. Similar heterogeneous positivity may exist for almost <b>every</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> marker except probably a few which are positive only in contractile smooth muscles like metavinculin and smoothelin.|$|R
60|$|Severely as Malchus {{had trained}} himself in every exercise, {{he found it}} at first {{difficult}} to support the fatigues of such a life; but <b>every</b> day his <b>muscles</b> hardened, {{and by the end}} of the campaign he was able to keep on foot as long as the hardest of his men.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no reply}} to this last fusillade, and he {{continued}} the flight, straining <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> to outdistance the enemy in case an attempt {{should be made to}} follow him.|$|E
60|$|St. Genis {{listened to}} it all with lips held tightly pressed together, firm {{determination}} causing <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> in his body to grow taut and firm with the earnestness of his resolve.|$|E
60|$|Neal had dug {{his hands}} into the sand, {{straining}} <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> to prevent being pulled into the stream; but despite all efforts the monster was rapidly getting the best of him.|$|E
50|$|<b>Every</b> weekend, admire <b>muscle</b> {{and classic}} {{cars and trucks}} {{throughout}} Old Town. At night, line the sidewalk to watch these beautiful cars drive down Old Town’s brick-layered Main Street for the Friday Nite Muscle Car Cruise and Saturday Nite Classic Car Cruise (the longest running weekly car show and cruise in America).|$|R
60|$|Mr. Butler, meanwhile, having doffed his bath-robe, {{stretched}} himself, {{and with}} leisurely nonchalance {{put on a}} second pair of gloves, was filling in the time with a little shadow boxing. He moved rhythmically to and fro, now ducking his head, now striking out with his muffled hands, and a sickening realization of the man's animal power swept over Sally and turned her cold. Swathed in his bath-robe, Bugs Butler had conveyed an atmosphere of dangerousness: in the boxing-tights which showed up <b>every</b> rippling <b>muscle,</b> he was horrible and sinister, a machine built for destruction, a human panther.|$|R
6000|$|Bostil himself {{took the}} {{covering}} off his favorite. Sage King was on edge. He stood out strikingly {{in contrast with}} the other horses. His sage-gray body was as sleek and shiny as satin. He had been trained to the hour. He tossed his head as he champed the bit, and <b>every</b> moment his <b>muscles</b> rippled under his fine skin. Proud, mettlesome, beautiful! ...|$|R
60|$|Kenton {{kept his}} word, {{so far as}} setting a rapid pace was concerned. Never before nor since have I {{strained}} <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> and nerve for so many hours on a stretch.|$|E
6000|$|Reaching the top, she put {{him into}} a gallop. With the wind furiously assailing her face and throat, <b>every</b> <b>muscle</b> crisped; and all her blood tingling--this was a very ecstasy of motion! ...|$|E
60|$|It was all over. The worst had happened. Nothing {{could save}} me. I still {{crouched}} in the corner, but I was tense in <b>every</b> <b>muscle,</b> like a wild cat about to spring.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Vincy is a musician?" [...] said Lydgate, {{following}} {{her with his}} eyes. (<b>Every</b> nerve and <b>muscle</b> in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness {{that she was being}} looked at. She was by nature an actress of parts that entered into her physique: she even acted her own character, and so well, that she did not know it to be precisely her own.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What engineer, {{wishing to}} {{regulate}} {{the composition of the}} internal environment of the body on which the function of <b>every</b> bone, gland, <b>muscle,</b> and nerve depends, would devise a scheme that operated by throwing the whole thing out 16 times a day and rely on grabbing from it, as it fell to earth, only those precious elements which he wanted to keep?" ...|$|R
60|$|One evening, {{when the}} field was about half done, Ellis went home more than usually tired. It had been a very hot day. <b>Every</b> bone and <b>muscle</b> in him ached. He {{wondered}} dismally if he would ever {{get to the end}} of that wretched elderberry field. When he reached home Jacob Green from Westdale was there. Jacob lost no time in announcing his errand.|$|R
