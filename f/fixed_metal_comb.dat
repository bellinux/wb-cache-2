50|$|Grooming a dog {{before it}} is bathed is {{important}} as it frees up and removes dead undercoat and matting, and allows proper penetration of water and shampoo to the skin. This {{can be done by}} using a slicker brush all over its body, especially on its legs, and the places where knotting occurs frequently. Groomers sometimes use a <b>metal</b> <b>comb</b> when combing for the second time, paying more attention to the toes and between the toes. <b>Metal</b> <b>combs</b> can be helpful in the areas of the dog's body that are common spots for knots. Brushing and combing the tail is also important as it is a commonly missed area.|$|R

50|$|A {{music box}} or musical box is an {{automatic}} musical instrument that produces sounds {{by the use}} of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or lamellae) of a steel comb.

2500|$|Electronic louse combs {{use a small}} {{electrical}} charge to kill lice. The metal teeth of the comb have alternating positively and negatively charged tines, which are powered by a small battery. When the comb is used on dry hair, lice make contact with multiple tines of the fine-toothed comb, thereby closing the circuit and receiving an {{electrical charge}}. A non-peer-reviewed letter has been published in a dermatology journal claiming effectiveness based on personal experience (total of 6 uses). For those with long or fine hair, the <b>metal</b> long tooth <b>combs</b> seem to snag and pull hair. <b>Metal</b> <b>combs</b> may be better for thick hair, while plastic short-tooth combs are best used for treating long and fine hair.|$|R

40|$|Background: Fine tooth lice combs {{fall into}} two classes based on the {{material}} from which their teeth are made: plastic or <b>metal.</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>combs</b> are further divided into those that are made from a flat sheet of metal, and hence have rectangular teeth, and those that have cylindrical teeth embedded in a plastic base. Methods: The efficacy of two fine tooth combs [Lice Meister <b>comb</b> (<b>metal)</b> and Lady Jayne comb (plastic) ] in removing head lice (Pediculus humanus var. capitis) and their eggs from the hair of children was evaluated after treatment with a viscous head lice product (Lice Blaster; Emerald Forest Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd, Currumbin, Qld, Australia).

40|$|Abstract The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the treatment need of fixed bridges according to the distribution of pontics in dentition in different age groups, and to investigate the primary and late complications and survival of the conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>metal</b> ceramic prostheses, as well as patients' satisfaction with the prosthetic treatment. The whole material consisted of the patients treated with <b>fixed</b> <b>metal</b> ceramic prostheses by undergraduate students at the Institute of Dentistry during the years 1984 - 1996. There were altogether 772 patients, 460 women (60 %) and 312 men (40 %). Their mean age was 47 years (23 - 81 years). Altogether 944 single metal ceramic crowns and 543 fixed bridges (1374 abutments and 807 pontics) were prepared. It can be concluded that the fixed bridges are most often prepared to replace upper first premolars and lower first molars also in the future. The most usual primary complications related to fixed bridges occurred during preprosthetic endodontic treatment of abutment teeth and during the preparation of the root canals. Previous restoration of the prepared tooth does not have any marked effect on the prognosis of single crowns with dowels, although anatomically complicated upper lateral incisors and upper first premolars need special attention in the treatment planning. Patients were satisfied with aesthetics and function of the <b>fixed</b> <b>metal</b> ceramic prostheses. Late complications found in clinical examinations were few, and the survival rate for the <b>fixed</b> <b>metal</b> ceramic bridge prostheses was calculated to be 84 % after 10 years, long fixed bridges having a lower survival than the shorter ones. The treatment need for conventional fixed bridges seems to be highest among patients over 50 years of age in the future. Age does not influence the longevity of the fixed prostheses, but basic circumstances of the mouth, especially low secretion of saliva affected by diseases and/or medications and high scores of lactobacilli and streptococcus mutans of the saliva seem to decrease the survival...|$|R
