5|$|After Yoh and {{his friends}} {{overcome}} the ten Patch Tribe members, Hao is awakened as the new Shaman King. He defeats Yoh and all his friends and absorbs their souls. Inside the Great Spirit, Yoh, Ren, Horohoro, Lyserg, and Chocolove battle against Hao using the five legendary spirits: the Spirit of Earth, the Spirit of Thunder, the Spirit of Rain, the Spirit of Fire, and the Spirit of Wind. When former associates of Yoh {{and his friends}} begin appearing in the Great Spirit, it is revealed that the Great Spirit granted Hao's wish for someone to bring back his mother's spirit. With Anna's help, Hao's mother is brought to the Great Spirit. Hao's mother tells him that, {{in order to be}} saved, he must <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> humans for murdering her. Hao decides to postpone his plan to eradicate humans and to observe how Yoh and his friends will change the world.|$|E
5|$|Early {{concepts}} {{were very}} different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> minor inconsistency.|$|E

5|$|Heliade {{was aware}} of the often {{negative}} response to his work: in a poem dedicated to the memory of Friedrich Schiller, he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed Te iartă să faci răul, iar binele nici mort—"They <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> evil committed against them, but never the good"). A noted author of satire, he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments. As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: conservatives who mimicked liberalism were the subject of his Areopagiul bestielor ("The Areopagus of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the left wing of liberalism, most notably C. A. Rosetti and his supporters. During and after his exile, his conflicts with Cezar Bolliac and Ion Ghica also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended to downplay his contributions to the Wallachian Revolution of 1848.|$|E
5|$|When the {{battered}} fleet returned to Venice, {{news of the}} defeat spread throughout the city to mixed reactions. Though some were willing to <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> defeat considering the circumstances, many others needed someone {{to blame for the}} loss that was considerable not only in human and material terms, but also symbolically. The people of Venice had been humiliated by an upstart nation with practically no naval experience. Though Guiscard would die the next year and the Norman threat would quickly disappear, a scapegoat was needed at that moment. A faction of influential Venetians, possibly led by Vitale Faliero based on later writings, led a popular revolt to depose Selvo, and in December 1084 they succeeded. Selvo apparently did not make a great effort to defend himself and was sent off to a monastery. He died three years later in 1087, and was buried in the loggiato of St. Mark's Basilica.|$|E
25|$|In general practice, {{after one}} confesses to one's spiritual father, the parish priest (who {{may or may}} not have heard the {{confession}} but canonically should have) covers the head of the person with his Epitrachelion (stole) and reads the prayers of repentance, asking God to <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> transgressions of the individual.|$|E

25|$|Williams demanded loyalty {{from those}} around him. He could not <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> fickle {{nature of the}} fans— booing a player for booting a ground ball, then turning around and roaring {{approval}} of the same player for hitting a home run.

25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} Abimelech first sent Phicol, {{the captain of}} his host, but {{he was unable to}} pacify Isaac. Then Abimelech sent his friend Ahuzzath, but Isaac still {{remained}} unpacified. When Abimelech then went himself, Isaac allowed himself to be appeased. Hence, the Sages taught that one need not ask another's forgiveness more than three times. If the other does not <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> third time, then the other becomes the wrongdoer.|$|E

25|$|In general practice, {{after one}} confesses to one's spiritual guide, the parish priest (who {{may or may}} not have heard the confession) covers the head of the person with his Epitrachelion (Stole) and reads the Prayer of Absolution, asking God to <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> {{transgression}} of the individual (the specific prayer differs between Greek and Slavic use). It is not uncommon for a person to confess his sins to his spiritual guide on a regular basis but only seek out the priest to read the prayer before receiving Holy Communion.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} forms of {{forgiveness}} interventions. One common adaptation used by researchers is where patients are forced to confront the entity preventing them from forgiving by using introspective techniques and expressing this to the therapist. Another popular forgiveness intervention is getting individual to try and see things from the offender's point of view. The end goal for this adaptation is getting the individual to perhaps understand the reasoning behind the offender's actions. If {{they are able to}} do this then {{they might be able to}} <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> offender more easily.|$|E
25|$|An indulgence {{does not}} <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> guilt of sin, {{nor does it}} provide release from the eternal {{punishment}} associated with unforgiven mortal sins. The Catholic Church teaches that indulgences relieve only the temporal punishment resulting from the effect of sin (the effect of rejecting God the source of good), and {{that a person is}} still required to have his grave sins absolved, ordinarily through the sacrament of Confession, to receive salvation. Similarly, an indulgence is not a permit to commit sin, a pardon of future sin, nor a guarantee of salvation for oneself or for another. Ordinarily, forgiveness of mortal sins is obtained through Confession (i.e., penance or reconciliation).|$|E

Corazon Aquino and Benigno Aquino III <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> 14 soldiers but oppose their appeals for clemency or parole (which Secretary Raul Gonzáles submitted to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2004). Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita states that the Bureau of Pardons and Parole had recommended a grant of executive clemency.|$|E
25|$|Tywin Lannister calls {{a meeting}} of the Small Council. He demands {{knowledge}} of Jaime's location, which the spymaster, Lord Varys, is unable to provide. Tywin then announces plans to have Lord Petyr Baelish wed Lysa Arryn to deprive Robb Stark of more allies in the war. Tywin names his son Tyrion as Baelish's replacement as Master of Coin (treasurer), despite Tyrion's pointing out his lack of expertise. Later, while retrieving the ledgers for his new appointment, Lord Baelish advises Tyrion on the job. Tyrion then rewards his virgin squire Podrick Payne with the services of three prostitutes for saving his life in the Battle of the Blackwater; Tyrion is later surprised to discover that they refuse payment due to Podrick's skill in lovemaking. While going over the books, Tyrion discovers that as treasurer Baelish has borrowed millions in gold from Tywin, as well as tens of millions from the Iron Bank of Braavos. A debt to Tywin is a problem since, regardless of his familial relationship with the king, Tyrion fears he will not <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> debt despite the crown's dire straits. However, he is more worried about the Iron Bank, since if they are not paid back in due time they may very well begin funding the Crown's enemies.|$|E
25|$|Abraham's {{personality}} and character {{is one of}} the most in-depth in the whole Quran, and Abraham is specifically mentioned as being a kind and compassionate man. Abraham's father is understood by Muslims to have been a wicked, ignorant and idolatrous man who ignored all of his son's advice. The relationship between Abraham and his father, who in the Quran is named Azar, is central to Abraham's story as Muslims understand it to establish a large part of Abraham's personality. The Quran mentions that Abraham's father threatened to stone his son to death if he did not cease in preaching to the people. Despite this, the Qur'an states that Abraham in his later years prayed to God to <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> sins of all his descendants and his parents. Muslims have frequently cited Abraham's character as an example of how kind one must be towards people, and especially one's own parents. A similar example of Abraham's compassionate nature is demonstrated when Abraham began to pray for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah after hearing of God's plan through the angel Gabriel for them. Although the angel Gabriel told Abraham that God's plan was the final word, and therefore Abraham's prayers would be of no effect, the Quran nonetheless reinforces Abraham's kind nature through this particular event.|$|E

25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to <b>forgive</b> <b>the</b> debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
