5|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>irritation</b> can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or {{submerged}} in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b>|$|E

5|$|San Diego and its backcountry {{suffer from}} {{periodic}} wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego {{was the site}} of the Cedar Fire, called the largest wildfire in California over the past century. The fire burned , killed 15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes. In addition to damage caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma, respiratory problems, <b>eye</b> <b>irritation,</b> and smoke inhalation; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week. Wildfires four years later destroyed some areas, particularly within the communities of Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Santa Fe, and Ramona.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

Nitrates and phosphates found in fertilizers and sewage wastes causes eutrophication, which is harmful to other species in the environment.

50|$|Experts and specialists on {{environmental}} science and chemistry {{were invited to}} present at the seminar.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the application of paint might cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritations,</b> headaches, dizziness and skin allergy etc. Continued inhalation may even cause damage to central nervous system. Therefore, ingredients of paint should be labeled clearly. It is also recommended to use water-based paint which has a lower percentage of VOCs.|$|R

50|$|It is {{very common}} for Shih Tzus to develop eye {{problems}} at any age, {{and even more so}} once they are older. Most veterinarians will recommend eye drops to assist with any <b>eye</b> <b>irritations.</b> Some dogs have allergies which causes excess discharge around the eye. Older Shih Tzu's are known to develop cataracts which can be corrected with surgery. If not treated, the dog may become blind in the eye that has the cataract. The distinctive large eyes can easily be scratched which may cause an ulcer. The dog will normally have the injured eye closed or half closed and may have excessive tears.|$|R
25|$|The initial {{effects of}} {{exposure}} were coughing, severe <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> {{and a feeling of}} suffocation, burning in the respiratory tract, blepharospasm, breathlessness, stomach pains and vomiting.

Bedding material should be provided especially in cold and wet weather for the outdoor rabbit. A recommended practise is to place the straw on top of a layer of the hardwood shavings in the sleeping compartment, in order to ensure warmth and insulation for an outdoor Belgian Hare. The rabbit home should be cleaned out weekly and any old food removed. If it is necessary to wash the home then only use a cleaner specifically designed for cleaning rabbit hutches.|$|R

25|$|The protests were {{at their}} most violent in the capital Saigon, where pro-Buddhist {{students}} rioted, using bicycle chains and sticks as weapons, vandalised cars, threw rocks and shouted anti-American slogans. Street battles erupted between Kỳ's loyalist police and troops, as the dissidents fought tear gas with rocks, homemade spears, glass bottles and sometimes a hand grenade. The police frequently lost the ascendancy to the rioters, who dispersed them and forced them to flee. At one stage, the military mayor of Saigon went onto the streets in attempt {{to try to convince}} the rioters to stop, but he was pelted with projectiles as well. Often the protesters wore makeshift masks made of plastic bags and threw tear gas canisters back at the police and military, and regardless of who was on the receiving end, this often necessitated momentary retreats due to <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> Some 300 Buddhists staged a sit-down protest at the national radio station in capital before the police used clubs to disperse them. The riots were repeated in the Central Highlands towns of Da Lat, Pleiku and Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
25|$|Before {{touching}} the contact lens or the eye, {{it is important}} to wash hands thoroughly with soap and rinse well. Soaps containing moisturizers or allergens should be avoided as these can cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> Drying of hands using towels or tissues prior to handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation upon insertion. Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, prior to handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, prior to opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A 'gritty' or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation upon insertion.|$|E
