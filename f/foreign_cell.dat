50|$|Using {{the concept}} of self, Burnet {{introduced}} a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components (autoimmunity) and by extension the idea of immune tolerance. He proposed thatif in embryonic life expendable cells from a genetically distinct race are implanted and established, no antibody response should develop against the <b>foreign</b> <b>cell</b> antigen when the animal takes on independent existence.Burnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E

40|$|Runting was {{produced}} by homologous spleen or lymph node cell suspensions, but not by isologous spleen or homologous liver or kidney cell suspensions. The incidence of runting (a) varied with the particular strain combination employed, (b) increased with increased dose of <b>foreign</b> <b>cells,</b> and (c) decreased as the time interval between birth and inoculation with <b>foreign</b> <b>cells</b> was increased. A focal, coagulative necrotic, liver lesion was described in runted mice. It was found that viable cells were required to produce the runting syndrome. Frozen-thawed cells, homogenized cells, and the cell-free supernatant of ground spleen suspensions failed to produce runting. Runted mice {{were found to have}} an anemia of variable degree, and white blood cell counts ranging from marked leukopenia to severe leucocytosis. Mice receiving isologous spleen or homologous liver or kidney showed normal red and white blood cell counts. Isologous spleen cells, given to newborn mice within 30 minutes following injection of homologous spleen cells, conferred significant protection against the runting syndrome. Isologous spleen injected 1 day after the injection of homologous spleen failed to protect. Newborn mice which had received homologous spleen cells were protected from becoming runted by treatment with "anti-cell donor strain" serum. The offspring of mothers which had been immunized against the spleen cell donor's strain failed to become runted when treated with homologous spleen cells. The data are regarded as compatible with the concept, presented by previous workers, that runting is the result of an immunological reaction of <b>foreign</b> <b>cells</b> against a tolerant host...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Artificial {{immune systems}} have been {{considered}} one of the most promising nature-inspired technique used for novelty detection systems, optimization, identification, etc. One of the main tools of these systems is the Negative-Selection Algorithm that is based on the natural self-nonself discrimination which has made possible the body distinguish any <b>foreign</b> <b>cell</b> from the body’s self cell. In this work, it is used the Negative-Selection Algorithm to perform functional testing of analog-to-digital converter. In this way, the evaluation of the converter is performed by a set of immune-based detectors which can detect faulty output responses. Using the immune-based detector set, experimental results have been shown the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

Peter Medawar would go {{one step further}} and propose that the immune system becomes tolerant to cancer cells due to the similarities that exist with normal healthy cells.

These experiments set the initial groundwork for {{what would become the}} concept of acquired immunological tolerance.

A hypothesis was proposed comparing the H- 2 Db antigen on a congenic cell to a hapten on a nonimmunogenic carrier which fails to induce T-cell helper function responsible for the switch from IgM to IgG secretion in B cells. Data presented here confirmed this hypothesis. 5 R mice rendered tolerant to the relevant non-H- 2 antigens were unable to mount the anti-H- 2 Db IgG response in a noncongenic immunization.
