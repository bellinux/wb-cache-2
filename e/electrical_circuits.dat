It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits,</b> Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} of electromagnetic components and systems by <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> models is indispensable {{for a wide}} range of applications: In the field of EMC, <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> models are ideally suited for the detection of EMC coupling paths, which are very difficult to track for 3 D geometries. In the field of numerical optimization techniques, <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> models offer short simulation times and allow the coupling of the electromagnetic domain to other physical domains. In the field of power electronics, <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> models describe energy dissipation due to parasitic electromagnetic interactions. The construction of an equivalent <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> model is in general cumbersome and less formalized than a description in terms of electromagnetic fields. No general and reliable technique for the automated construction of equivalent <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> models exists. The aim of this thesis is the development of a technique that allows a fully automated construction of equivalent <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> models from 3 D geometry information. Instead of constructing the circuit directly from geometry data, our approach consists of reducing a field-theoretical model to an equivalent <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> model. In this way, we exploit the generality of the field-theoretical approach, which can be applied {{for a wide range}} of geometries using state-of-the-art simulation techniques. The electromagnetic effects having the largest impact in the frequency range of interest are then used for the construction of the <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> model. The circuit elements can be seen as condensed representations of these field-theoretical processes. The reduction process allows a very direct assessment of the accuracy of the <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> model...|$|R

Figure  5 c shows the I-V {{characteristic of the}} MEGS-based <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit.</b> The characteristic is not perfectly linear, which presumably arises due to contact barrier at the interface of the thin sheets and Au electrodes.

Then the steplike current kept the constant value for a long recording time {{until the end of}} detection. As the response of the RGOS-based <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> to the analytes was almost instantaneous, the response was super sensitive and the response time was just a few seconds.|$|R
