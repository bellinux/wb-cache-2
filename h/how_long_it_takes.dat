For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E

25|$|Instead, {{typically}} a dedicated machine tool is used. It has {{four to eight}} spindles and usually a rotary table. The cycle time {{for this type of}} setup is determined by the longest individual operation, which in this situation is determined by <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to plunge and retract the tool through the bore. Throughput can be increased by completing two workpieces on each cycle; this is achieved by having two identical stations for each tool size so that two workpieces can be operated on concurrently.|$|E

25|$|Depending on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the fielding team {{to recover}} the ball, the batsmen may run more than once. Each {{completed}} run increments the scores of both the team and the striker. The team's total score in the innings is the aggregate of all its batsmen's individual scores plus any extras. To complete a run, both batsmen must ground their bats behind the popping crease {{at the other end}} of the pitch. Attempting a run carries a risk factor because either batsman can be run out, and thereby dismissed, if the fielding side can break the wicket with the ball before the batsman has completed the run.|$|E
25|$|The {{bystander}} {{effect was}} first {{demonstrated in the}} laboratory by John M. Darley and Bibb Latané in 1968 after they {{became interested in the}} topic following the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most replicable effects in social psychology. In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is staged and researchers measure <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the participants to intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin. For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress. 70 percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when there were other people in the room only 40 percent offered help.|$|E
500|$|Radar systems {{measure the}} {{distance}} to a target {{by the time it}} takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: {{the distance to}} the target is half the round-trip transit time multiplied by the speed of light. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about [...] (...) in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. The Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, radar astronomy and the Deep Space Network determine distances to the Moon, planets and spacecraft, respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.|$|E

500|$|Many {{different}} kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for electrical conductivity and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, radionuclides, and various molecular species. [...] For {{the results of these}} tests to be useful in the reconstruction of palaeoenvironments, {{there has to be a}} way to determine the relationship between depth and age of the ice. [...] The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible. [...] An alternative is to model the ice accumulation and flow to predict <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> a given snowfall to reach a particular depth. [...] Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth's orbital parameters.|$|E
500|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the Pacific {{electric}} ray produces powerful electric shocks for attack and defense. Its paired electric organs are derived from muscle and comprise approximately 15% of its total weight, consisting of many thousands of jelly-filled [...] "electric plates" [...] stacked hundreds-high into vertical hexagonal columns. These columns function essentially like [...] batteries connected in parallel; a large adult ray can generate some 45 volts of electricity with a power output of one kilowatt, due to low internal resistance. The electric organs discharge direct current in pulses, each lasting 4–5ms. When attacking prey, {{in the first few}} moments the ray normally produces pulses at a rate of 150–200 per second, slowing down over time. Over a thousand pulses may be produced in all, depending on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the prey to be subdued. The pulse rate increases with water temperature.|$|E
500|$|Dessau {{considered}} the episode [...] "genius", {{and described the}} twist ending as [...] "genuinely unexpected". In The Observer, Mike Bradley called [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] a [...] "priceless silent farce", but, in the newspaper's sister publication The Guardian, Luke Holland was more critical. He said the episode was [...] "an almost wordless half-hour of physical comedy", and that [...] "it plays out like a French farce, its comedic strokes far broader" [...] than those of [...] "Sardines". [...] "If you find two men silently mime-arguing about <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to have a poo funny", he continued, [...] "you're on sturdy ground here". Later, a review by Phelim O'Neill of the Inside No. 9 series 1 boxset published on theguardian.com described [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "engaging, tense, funny, frightening– and accessibly experimental". The episode was compared negatively to the later instalment [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] in an Irish Daily Mail review—"A Quiet Night In" [...] was called [...] "patchy"—but was compared positively to [...] "Last Gasp" [...] by Rebecca McQuillan of The Herald, who said that [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] was [...] "something close to comedy genius". An anonymous review in the South African newspaper The Saturday Star picked out [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as the strongest episode of the first series.|$|E

500|$|Carbon is {{distributed}} throughout the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the oceans; these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir, and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir. [...] The different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store, and in <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the [...] generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them. [...] This affects the ratio of [...] to [...] in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir. The atmosphere, which is where [...] is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the [...] it contains mixes in less than seven years. The ratio of [...] to [...] in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of [...] to , it indicates that the carbon is older and hence {{that some of the}} [...] has decayed. The ocean surface is an example: it contains 2.4% of the carbon in the exchange reservoir, but there is only about 95% as much [...] as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere. The time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years, but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir. Water in the deep ocean takes about 1,000 years to circulate back through surface waters, and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water, with depleted , and water recently at the surface, with [...] in equilibrium with the atmosphere.|$|E
