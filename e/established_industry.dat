5|$|The Roksan Xerxes {{transcription}} turntable (often shortened to Xerxes) is {{a record}} player named after the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London-based Roksan Audio. Designed by Roksan co-founder, Touraj Moghaddam, the Xerxes is a belt-driven turntable that has a solid plinth. Launched in 1985, the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the <b>established</b> <b>industry</b> leader, the Linn Sondek LP12. Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference turntable.|$|E

In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime.

25|$|Innovators of step-in systems {{produced}} prototypes {{and designed}} proprietary step-in boot and binding systems {{with the goal}} of improving the performance of snowboard boots and bindings, and as a result, the mid-90s saw an explosion of step-in binding and boot development. New companies, Switch and Device, were built on new step-in binding technology. Existing companies Shimano, K2 and Emery were also quick to market with new step-in technology. Meanwhile, early market leaders Burton and Sims were noticeably absent from the step-in market. Sims was the first <b>established</b> <b>industry</b> leader to market with a step-in binding. Sims licensed a step-in system called DNR which was produced by the established ski-binding company Marker. Marker never improved the product which was eventually discontinued. Sims never re-entered the step-in market.|$|E

500|$|In time, the fan community's {{requests}} {{shifted from}} specific demands to no demand at all, wanting only their interest {{to be recognized}} by Nintendo. The Starmen.net community launched several campaigns to bring attention to the series. In their 2007 [...] "The EB Siege" [...] project to have Mother 3 receive an official North American localization, community members sent letters and made phone calls to Nintendo. They ultimately created a full-color, 270-page art book, The EarthBound Anthology, to send to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of their interest. They also hoped the volume would mobilize <b>established</b> <b>industry</b> professionals to take up their cause {{in advance of the}} 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Shacknews wrote that the [...] "folk history" [...] was more of a proposal than a collection of fan art—"the greatest gaming love letter ever created". Wired Chris Kohler used the Anthology's occasion to explain how Nintendo's upper management has heard the fan community. The Anthology additionally received mention in Nintendo Power. Upon [...] "little" [...] response from Nintendo, they decided to localize the game themselves. Starmen.net co-founder Tomato led the project, and the complete fan translation was finished in October 2008. They then printed a [...] "professional quality strategy guide" [...] through Fangamer, a site that spun off from Starmen.net.|$|E

2500|$|There {{had always}} been lead mining in and around Wirksworth. This is {{limestone}} country and the fissures characteristic of limestone contained rich deposits of minerals, and especially of galena: lead ore. The Romans mined there and left inscribed [...] "pigs", or ingots, of smelted lead as evidence. In the 9th century Repton Abbey owned mines at Wirksworth and when the abbey was destroyed by Danish troops in 874 they were taken by their Mercian puppet king Ceolwulf. They remained in royal hands after the Norman conquest of England and paid royalties to the Crown for centuries afterwards. Lead mining and smelting was an <b>established</b> <b>industry</b> in 1086, when the mines at Wirksworth and Bakewell were recorded in the Domesday Book.|$|E

40|$|<b>Established</b> <b>industries,</b> which {{constitute}} by far {{the largest}} share of the manufacturing and service sectors in most developed economies, are on balance reasonably innovative. They engage in frequent changes in both product and process technologies which, although perhaps less spectacular (in a literal sense) than some of the innovations in newer industries, contribute substantially to their own productivity and competitiveness and to better macroeconomic performance. Through innovation, <b>established</b> <b>industries</b> not only benefit themselves but, in their role as consumers of new products and new ideas, they are also significant contributors to the growth of high-technology industries.
