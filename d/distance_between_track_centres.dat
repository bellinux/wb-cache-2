40|$|The thesis {{provides}} methodologies {{for determining}} railway structure gauge and <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>track</b> <b>centres.</b> The first part provides information about reference profile, which is base for determining structure gauge.

The second part is based on Slovenian standard SIST EN 15273 - 3 : 2013. It describes methods for determining structure gauge including all presented widenings (additional overthrows, quasi static effect and random transverse phenomena). In accordance with same standard there are presented methods for determining <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>track</b> <b>centres.</b> The last part of the thesis discusses differences between standard and UIC code 505 - 4 OR.

40|$|The {{introductory}} part of {{the thesis}} describes the development of bridges {{and the emergence of}} steel bridges in Slovenia. It discusses the proportion of steel bridges in Slovenia, their type of construction, static system and type of intersection. The second {{part of the}} thesis discusses the requirements given in the rules on the substructure of bridging structures and provides a detailed overview of individual elements (track, clear profile, ground plan geometry, <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>track</b> <b>centres,</b> sleepers, jointed track, switch, insulation joint, load testing, signs on constructions). As for the third part, it contains a summary of Eurocode 3, the process of designing a steel construction as well as loads and load cases. It also points to the significance of structural details for the construction's life span. Moreover, it touches on the issues of steel bridges – corrosion, descriptions and types of corrosion, preparation of steel surfaces for anti-corrosion protection, and approaches to tackling corrosion. The majority of steel railway bridges in Slovenia are over 80 years old and in a very bad condition in terms of the level of corrosion. The situation is a result of infrequent maintenance of the anti-corrosion protection and even neglect of this aspect of maintenance. To this end, the final part of the thesis discusses how corrosion causes fatigue and decreases pylon thickness, and outlines the methods for determining the loss of material due to corrosion. Considering the fact {{that the majority of the}} bridges have already exceeded their envisaged life span and that their maintenance was rather poor, it is clear that they are worn out and in need of thorough renovation...|$|E

50|$|A {{decision}} {{had to be}} made about how far apart the rails of the double track should be. It was decided to make the space <b>between</b> the separate <b>tracks</b> the same as the track gauge itself, so that {{it would be possible to}} operate trains with unusually wide loads up the middle during quiet times (there is no evidence of this having occurred). In later years, it was decided that the tracks were too close together, restricting the width of the trains, so the gap <b>between</b> <b>tracks</b> (<b>track</b> <b>centres)</b> was widened. The narrowness of this gap contributed to the first fatality, that of William Huskisson, and also made it dangerous to do maintenance work on one track while trains are operating on the other.|$|R

30|$|Currently, many FPGAs support LVDS interfaces, and {{by being}} {{properly}} allocated on the platform, {{they can provide}} data communication at a high transmission rate by using their transceivers. However, some platforms available in the market were not designed to accommodate the LVDS FPGA pin resources in their communication lines, thus preventing the LVDS transceiver use and therefore hindering the implementation of communication channels with high performance. Other factors such as <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>tracks,</b> resistance, and capacitance balance are important {{and need to be}} observed by this type of platform manufacturers. Data transmission performed without these resources can lead to errors in data transfer when the transmission rate is high, as {{there is no guarantee that}} data integrity is maintained. This is because of all FPGA I/O (Input/Output) pins that are generally subject to physical interference. Due to this possible low performance in data transmission, systems using these resources will have to reduce their logic module speed to suit the channel and thereby reduce the incidence of communication error.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of fine (~ 0. 54 μm) tungsten carbide particles effect on structural and mechanical properties of laser cladded Inconel 625 -WC composite. Three powder mixtures with different Inconel 625 – WC weight ratio (10, 20 and 30 weight % of WC) were prepared. Coatings were made using following process parameters: laser beam diameter ø ≈ 500 μm, powder feeder rotation speed – 7 m/min, scanning velocity – 10 m/min, laser power – 220 W changed to 320 W, <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>tracks</b> – 1 mm changed to 0. 8 mm. Microstructure and hardness were investigated. Coatings produced by laser cladding were crack and pore free, chemically and structurally homogenous. High cooling rate during cladding process resulted in fine microstructure of material. Hardness improved with addition of WC from 396. 3 ± 10. 5 HV for pure Inconel 625, to 469. 9 ± 24. 9 HV for 30 weight % of WC.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a clustering-based approach {{to decrease the}} computational cost of data association in multi-target tracking. This is achieved by clustering the sensor tracks using approximate distance functions, thereby decreasing the number of possible associations {{and the need to}} calculate expensive statistical <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>tracks.</b> The studied tracking problem includes passive and active sensors with built-in filters. Statistical and non-statistical distance functions were designed to account for the characteristics of the different combinations of sensors. The computational cost and accuracy of these distance functions were evaluated and compared. Analysis is done in a simulated environment with randomly positioned targets and sensors. Simulations show that there are approximate distances with a cost of calculation ten times cheaper than the true statistical distance, with only minor drops in accuracy. Spectral clustering is used on these distances to divide complex association problems into sub-problems. This algorithm is evaluated on a large number of random scenarios. The mean size of the largest sub-problem is 40 % of the original, and the mean number of errors in the clustering is 5 %...|$|R
