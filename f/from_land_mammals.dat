Their current decline is due to predation from stoats (Mustela ermine), rats (Rattus spp.), and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) [...] which target eggs and nestlings. One population was reduced by 85% in 2001 due to predator irruption after a beech mast (a season of high production by southern beech). Deer and possums also contribute to C. malherbi decline through forest destruction.|$|E

50|$|The film {{primarily}} {{takes place}} aboard the Japanese factory whaling vessel, the Nisshin Maru, in the Sea of Japan, {{as it makes}} its annual journey to Antarctica. Two storylines occur simultaneously on the vessel: one on deck and one beneath. The narrative on deck involves the process of casting a 25-ton petroleum jelly sculpture (one of Barney’s signature materials), which rivals the scale of a whale. Below deck, the two main characters participate as guests in a tea ceremony, where they are formally engaged after arriving on the ship as strangers. As the film progresses, the guests go through an emotional and physical transformation slowly transfiguring <b>from</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> into sea mammals, as they fall in love. The petroleum jelly sculpture simultaneously passes through changing states, from warm to cool, and from the architectural back to the primordial. The dual narratives, the sculptural and the romantic, come to reflect one another until the climactic point at which they become completely mutual.|$|E
40|$|Cetaceans descend <b>from</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals.</b> Consequently, their hearing {{apparatus}} basically {{consists of}} the same anatomical components. Whales, as land mammals, feature an outer, middle and inner ear. However, these structures show strong evolutionary adaptations to underwater hearing. In addition, other morphological elements, such as the mandibles and the associated acoustic fat, have acquired an acoustical function in the propagation of sound waves to the middle ear. The original function of other structures such as {{the external auditory canal}} is therefore questioned. How cetaceans hear is not yet fully understood. However, it is essential to clarify this in order {{to assess the impact of}} anthropogenic underwater sound, since high-energy underwater sound may lead to physical trauma and hearing loss, physiological stress and behavioral changes. In this study, the external ear canal of a white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) and a common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are described and compared based on histological cross sections. These external ear canals seemed rudimentary, with a small to absent lumen. However, the blood supply, well-developed muscles, active glands and numerous nerve fibres could indicate some functionality. Moreover, the presence of numerous structures with a morphological similarity to lamellar corpuscles also could advert to a functional structure. Although the function of these potential mechanoreceptors is not known, they could play a part in pressure perception in these diving mammals...|$|E

Therefore, the Pakicetus and Basilosaurus data suggest a close genetic relationship between cetaceans and ungulates. An approach based on molecular genetics {{was used in this}} study to test the morphological hypothesis. The results show a greater sequence similarity - and thus a lower genetic distance - between cetaceans and ungulates than between cetaceans and other mammals. -from AuthorSCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The background to the Icelandic and Greenlandic sites under investigation is outlined and prior work on the Norse economies of the two islands is discussed. The importance of fat in the diet {{and the use of}} levels of bone marrow and grease exploitation as an indicator of subsistence stress are explained. The methodology for establishing levels of bone fat exploitation is outlined. This methodology involves the detailed study of fragmentation levels of different types of bone, study of bone fracture types and many other taphonomic indicators. The results of the study are described and discussed. On Greenland, the Norse inhabitants exploited almost all available fat <b>from</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> bones, leaving only the ribs. lt is argued that this indicates a severe level of subsistence stress amongst the Greenlanders that is most likely related to a seasonal dearth in resources. On lceland, whilst a certain amount of bone marrow is almost certainly exploited, the settlers appear to almost totally ignore the potential to exploit bone grease. This is likely to be indicative of a much more healthy subsistence economy than on Greenland. These results are discussed in relation to differing climate, availability of good soil, fishing practices and seasonal rounds...|$|R

40|$|Whales are mammals {{which have}} become entirely aquatic, though {{there is every reason}} to believe that they have been derived <b>from</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals.</b> As in the case of the {{specialized}} ichthyosaurian reptiles, the aquatic environment has imposed upon whales a fish-like form; the head passes imperceptibly into the trunk without a constricted neck; the anterior limbs or flippers have lost all externa 1 semblance to the typical marnmalian fore-limb; and the hind limbs have disappeared, though internal skeletal vestiges still persist. A dorsal fin is generally present, but does not contain skeletal supports as in the ease of fishes. The well-developed caudal fin has no skeleton, and differs from the vertical tail of fishes in being prolonged laterally into fleshy horizontal expansions, the flukes. The nostrils (blowhole, single or double) are situated high upon the vertex of the head. The eyes are small, the external part of the ear is almost non-existent and has no pinna. Teeth are generally present at some stage in the life history, but in whalebone whales the teeth disappear before the end of foetal life. The blubber, which is characteristic of whales, is a thick subcutaneous tissue containing fat, and is impregnated with oil. The hairy covering, which is present in all mammals, is reduced to a few isolated hairs in the region of the mouth, and the body is naked and shiny. This group includes the largest animals which have ever lived...|$|E

An approach based on molecular genetics {{was used in this}} study to test the morphological hypothesis. Liver samples of two Delphinoidea species were obtained from animals caught in a Peruvian gillnet fishery. 32 P- or 35 S-labeled single copy nuclear genomes (scn-DNA) of the two cetacean species were hybridized each with unlabeled total DNA of various cetaceans, ungulates and other mammals including primates, rodents, lagomorphs and carnivores. The Tmedian (Tm) and Tmode of all melting curves, used as a measure of the DNA-DNA hybrids stability, clearly show a greater sequence similarity — and thus a lower genetic distance — between cetaceans and ungulates than between cetaceans and other mammals...|$|R
