25|$|They {{were first}} {{developed}} by WACA curator John Maley {{for use in}} the World Series Cricket matches, set up in the 1970s by Australian businessman Kerry Packer. <b>Drop-in</b> pitches became necessary for the World Series as they had to play in dual purpose venues operating outside of the cricket establishment. Along with other revolutions during the series including the white ball, floodlights, helmets, and coloured clothing, <b>drop-in</b> pitches were designed to also make games more interesting. They would start off bowler friendly seaming and spinning with uneven bounce for the first two days of a game. After that they became extremely easy for batting meaning high targets were chaseable on the fourth and fifth days, although there would still be something in the pitch for the bowlers.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundFew {{longitudinal}} studies of disaster cohorts have assessed both non-response bias in prevalence estimates of health outcomes {{and in the}} estimates of associations between health outcomes and disaster exposures. We examined the factors associated with non-response and the possible non-response bias in prevalence estimates and association estimates in a longitudinal study of World Trade Center (WTC) terrorist attack survivors. MethodsIn 200322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 04, 71, 434 enrollees completed the WTC Health Registry wave 1 health survey. This study is limited to 67, 670 adults who were eligible for both wave 2 and wave 3 surveys in 200622 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 07 and 201122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 12. We first compared the characteristics between wave 3 participants (wave 3 <b>drop-ins</b> and three-wave participants) and non-participants (wave 3 drop-outs and wave 1 only participants). We then examined potential non-response bias in prevalence estimates and in exposure-outcome association estimates by comparing one-time non-participants (wave 3 <b>drop-ins</b> and drop-outs) at the two follow-up surveys with three-wave participants. ResultsCompared to wave 3 participants, non-participants were younger, {{more likely to be}} male, non-White, non-self enrolled, non-rescue or recovery worker, have lower household income, and less than post-graduate education. Enrollees 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 wave 1 health status had little association with their wave 3 participation. None of the disaster exposure measures measured at wave 1 was associated with wave 3 non-participation. Wave 3 drop-outs and <b>drop-ins</b> (those who participated in only one of the two follow-up surveys) reported somewhat poorer health outcomes than the three-wave participants. For example, compared to three-wave participants, wave 3 drop-outs had a 1. 4 times higher odds of reporting poor or fair health at wave 2 (95...|$|R
