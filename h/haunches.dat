5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the <b>haunches</b> of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with {{a balance of}} roundness and forward movement. Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways {{movement of}} the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians {{are known for their}} agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced collection and turns on the <b>haunches.</b> A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and Anglo-Arabian horses while moving at the trot. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically found in this breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the <b>haunches</b> of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E

These <b>haunch</b> elements were connected to the beams and columns by using two partially prestressed external rods along with two anchors, which were directly fastened to the beams and columns. The shear strength and ductility capacity of the retrofitted joints were significantly improved, and the failure mode was changed to flexural hinging in the beam.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyse seismic {{behaviors}} of the <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer floor, carried out the pseudo static testing, which were subjected to vertical loads and horizontal cyclic loads, respectively on two specimens, including the framed short-leg shear wall <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer plane framework and the same dimension unhaunched beam-shaped transfer frame. The test shows that: 1) <b>Haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer structure can apparently improve the shear-bearing-capacity of the abutment section and reduce the beam dimension effectively, and {{it is easier to}} implement the aseismatic design principles, including “strong column and weak beam, strong shearing and weak bend”; 2) if the design is reasonable, <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer structure can get better seismic behavior...|$|R

Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races. The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their <b>haunches</b> with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it.

25|$|A masonry dome {{produces}} thrusts {{down and}} outward. They are thought of {{in terms of}} two kinds of forces at right angles from one another. Meridional forces (like the meridians, or lines of longitude, on a globe) are compressive only, and increase towards the base, while hoop forces (like the lines of latitude on a globe) are in compression {{at the top and}} tension at the base, with the transition in a hemispherical dome occurring at an angle of 51.8 degrees from the top. The thrusts generated by a dome are directly proportional to the weight of its materials. Grounded hemispherical domes generate significant horizontal thrusts at their <b>haunches.</b>|$|E
40|$|One of the {{structural}} options for beam spans beyond 15 m is the <b>haunched</b> beam. By developing continuity at the supports, beam moments and deflections are reduced and {{this can lead to}} overall economy by enabling the use of shallower and lighter beam. This paper investigates the behavior of steel-concrete composite <b>haunch</b> connections. Experiments are carried out to study the moment-rotation characteristics of the connections and ultimate moment capacity of the composite sections. Design implications related to composite <b>haunched</b> beams are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his <b>haunches</b> on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E

The leg joints were well-defined, the pasterns short and the feet tough. However, records also noted that the legs had [...] "serious faults of position," [...] not further defined.

[...] At this stage Edwards was either encouraged or forced to try again with extra money being provided to cover his losses for the earlier attempts.|$|E

Historically, most Poitou donkeys were used to breed large mules, but in recent years, they have found an increasing number of uses. Breed enthusiasts use them for agricultural work, driving and riding.|$|E
