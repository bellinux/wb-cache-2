However, work continued until 1941 on the development of Reeves Road (a street that has now disappeared as it has been incorporated as the entrance to St. Peter's College), the building of stone walls, and the very significant soil transfer from the netball courts to level the playing fields was accomplished largely by workers on the Government Relief scheme following the Great Depression. These workers worked on the project for three years and finished it on 1 November 1941. The school grounds consisted of three different levels, i.e. the netball court level (from 2010, the site of the school gymnasium), the old tennis court level (now filled in under the playing field level) and the playing field level (called the [...] "St Peter's College oval").

The proposed device is essentially composed by an atomization stage followed by a separation one. The former atomizes and ionizes ash components allowing the second stage to perform separation of the desired metals by means of an electromagnetic field. Power dissipation represents one of the major issues of such devices due to the high power required to perform species separation. In this paper the major power sources and losses are also identified...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} burning {{of a small}} mass {{fraction}} of carbon in a neutron star ocean is thermally unstable at low accumulated masses when the ocean contains <b>heavy</b> <b>ashes</b> from the hydrogen burning rapid proton (rp) process. The key to early unstable ignition is the low thermal conductivity of a heavy element ocean. The instability requires accretion rates in excess of one-tenth the Eddington limit when the carbon mass fraction is 0. 1 or less. The unstable flashes release 10 ^{ 42 } to 10 ^{ 43 } ergs over hours to days, and are likely {{the cause of the}} recently discovered large Type I X-ray bursts (so-called ``superbursts'') from six Galactic low mass X-ray binaries. In addition to explaining the energetics, recurrence times, and durations of the superbursts, these mixed carbon/heavy element flashes have an accretion rate dependence of unstable burning similar to that observed. Though the instability is present at accretion rates near Eddington, there is less contrast with the accretion luminosity there, explaining why most detections are made at accretion rates between 0. 1 and 0. 3 Eddington. Future comparisons of time dependent calculations with observations will provide new insights into the rp process. Comment: Submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters (6 pages, 3 figures...|$|R

40|$|Material accreted onto {{a neutron}} star can stably burn in steady state only when the {{accretion}} rate is high (typically super-Eddington) or if a large flux from the neutron star crust permeates the outer atmosphere. For such situations we have analyzed the stability of nonradial oscillations, finding one unstable mode for pure helium accretion. This is a shallow surface wave which resides in the helium atmosphere above the <b>heavier</b> <b>ashes</b> of the ocean. It is excited by {{the increase in the}} nuclear reaction rate during the oscillations, and it grows on the timescale of a second. For a slowly rotating star, this mode has a frequency of approximately 20 - 30 Hz (for l= 1), and we calculate the full spectrum that a rapidly rotating (>> 30 Hz) neutron star would support. The short period X-ray binary 4 U 1820 [...] 30 is accreting helium rich material and is the system most likely to show this unstable mode,especially when it is not exhibiting X-ray bursts. Our discovery of an unstable mode in a thermally stable atmosphere shows that nonradial perturbations have a different stability criterion than the spherically symmetric thermal perturbations that generate type I X-ray bursts.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} and compared {{the characteristics of}} bottom and fly ashes from three municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs) in Taiwan.

The particle size distribution, morphology, mineralogical and chemical composition, and leaching behavior of <b>heavy</b> metals of <b>ash</b> samples were evaluated. The results revealed that three types of incineration processes have different characteristic for ashes due to transportation and mixing system inside furnace. Particle size distribution indicated that 28. 5 % of MSWI-B bottom ash has lower than 180 mu m and 61. 2 % of MSWI-A fly ash has larger than the 250 mu m. The leaching concentration of Pb exceeded the regulatory level set by the Taiwan EPA in fly ashes from MSWI-B and MSWI-C, and thus must be considered hazardous wastes. Specifically, the leaching concentration of heavy metals of fly ashes from MSWI-A (fluidized bed incinerator) was {{lower than that of}} the others, and was corresponded to the regulatory levels. Therefore, a fluidized bed incineration process appears a potential of handling <b>heavy</b> metals for <b>ashes.</b> The result was also provided the valuable information for incinerator design and operation.
