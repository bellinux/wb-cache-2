5000|$|The Banbury mixer is a {{brand of}} {{internal}} <b>batch</b> <b>mixer,</b> named for inventor Fernley H. Banbury. The [...] "Banbury" [...] trademark is owned by Farrel Corporation. Internal <b>batch</b> <b>mixers</b> such as the Banbury mixer are used for mixing or compounding rubber and plastics. The original design dates back to 1916. The mixer consists of two rotating spiral-shaped blades encased in segments of cylindrical housings. These intersect so as to leave a ridge between the blades.

Its invention resulted in major labor and capital savings in the tire industry, doing away with the initial step of roller-milling rubber.

Based on the finite element method, the sol–gel reaction process of preparation PP/TiO 2 nanocomposites in an internal <b>batch</b> <b>mixer</b> with Haake rotors was simulated with user defined functions (UDFs) of Polyflow software.

Moreover, the effects of rotor speed ratio, temperature rise by viscous heating, and precursor concentration on the overall conversion rates in the mixer were discussed, respectively. Especially, the effect of chaotic strength by different speed ratios on the part and overall reaction rate within the mixer were carried out. It is found that the chaotic mixing intensity and average conversion rate increase gradually with the increase of the speed ratios in the mixer.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of this research is}} the development of a new, industrially relevant device and process wherein useful structures, such as submicron filaments, evolve directly within a major phase melt that can be subsequently extruded to form fibers or parts with internal reinforcements and enhanced physical properties. Chaotic mixing of thermoplastics has been used recently to produce, in small quantities within <b>batch</b> <b>mixers,</b> polymer blends with either interconnected fibrillar or lamellar microstructures. The novel microstructures evolved directly in the melt from initially coarse minor phase bodies due to the recursive stretching and folding characteristics that typify chaotic responses.

40|$|As for all materials, the {{performance}} of concrete is determined by its microstruc-ture. Its microstructure is determined by its composition, its curing conditions, and also by the mixing method and mixer con-ditions used to process the concrete.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that mechanochemistry can be carried out continuously and on large scale through the use of twin-screw extrusion (TSE). TSE has successfully been applied to the synthesis of co-crystals, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), metal complexes and organic condensation reactions. However, whilst TSE provides a route for mechanochemical synthesis to be developed into a continuous, high volume manufacturing process, little is currently understood about how to best optimise the various process parameters involved. Herein, we investigate the use of a <b>batch</b> <b>mixer</b> that has been previously used in polymer processing, to optimise mechanochemical reactions performed by extrusion.

Homogeneous CBT/epoxy and CBT/isocyanate blends were obtained by melt blending in a lab-scale <b>batch</b> <b>mixer</b> by applying low temperatures and short processing times.
