40|$|In 2007, A. I. Aptekarev and his {{collaborators}} discovered a sequence of rational approximations to Euler's constant γ defined by a linear recurrence. In this paper, we generalize this result and present an explicit construction of rational approximations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> (b) -ψ(a+ 1), a, b∈ Q, b> 0, a>- 1, where ψ defines the logarithmic derivative of the Euler gamma function. We prove exact formulas for denominators and numerators of the approximations in terms of hypergeometric sums. As a consequence, we get rational approximations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> π/ 2 ±γ. We compare the results obtained with those of T. Rivoal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> γ+(b) and prove denominators conjectures proposed by Rivoal for denominators of rational approximations for γ+(b) and common denominators of simultaneous approximations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> γ and ζ(2) -γ^ 2.
