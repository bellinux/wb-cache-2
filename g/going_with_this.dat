The Parliament questioned Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes, the governor, and had him tried as a coward by a court-martial, and condemned to die, but suspended the execution also, as the king did the governor of Reading. I have often heard Prince Rupert say, they did Colonel Fiennes wrong in that affair; and that if the colonel would have summoned him, he would have demanded a passport of the Parliament, and have come up and convinced the court that Colonel Fiennes had not misbehaved himself, {{and that he had}} not a sufficient garrison to defend a city of that extent; having not above 1200 men in the town, excepting some of Waller's runaways, most of whom were unfit for service, and without arms; and that the citizens in general being disaffected to him, and ready on the first occasion to open the gates to the king's forces, it was impossible for him to have kept the city.

50|$|One of {{the newest}} and most {{effective}} ways to resolve the vanishing gradient problem is with residual neural networks (ResNets - {{not to be confused}} with recurrent neural networks). It was noted prior to ResNets that a deeper network would actually have higher training error than the shallow network. This intuitively can be understood as data disappearing through too many layers of the network, meaning output from a shallow layer was diminished through the greater number of layers in the deeper network, yielding a worse result. <b>Going</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> intuitive hypothesis, Microsoft research found that splitting a deep network into e.g., three layer chunks and passing the input into each chunk straight through to the next chunk (along with the residual—output of the chunk minus the input to the chunk that is reintroduced) helped eliminate much of this disappearing signal problem. No extra parameters or changes to the learning algorithm were needed. ResNets yielded lower training error (and test error) than their shallower counterparts simply by reintroducing outputs from shallower layers in the network to compensate for the vanishing data.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics with some praising the filmmaking and acting while others criticized the storytelling.

[...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times stated that [...] "the dialogue is clumsy and the suspense is nil" [...] and gave his reason for this by explaining that Carol is a [...] "young woman who may or may not be crazy. This gives the director license to be bizarre without having to justify anything." [...] Variety magazine noted in its review that the [...] "performances are strong all around, particularly by Leigh and Vaccaro." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post noted that the storytelling is [...] "haute macabre and hopelessly silly" [...] but, at the same time, admits that [...] "Leigh is a marvel." [...] In spite of the generally agreed upon consensus that the story of the film was flawed, it still managed to win the Best Film award at 1989's Festival de Cine de Sitges.|$|E

In 1813 he took part in the principal military operations in that country, and in the following year returned with his battalion to London. Here {{he became one of the}} dandies of the town, and was among the very few officers who were admitted at Almack's, where he remembered the first introduction of quadrilles and waltzes in place of the old reels and country dances. Wanting money to equip himself for his further services abroad, he obtained an advance of £200 from his agents, Cox & Greenwood, and <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> money to a gambling-house in St. James's Square, he won £600, with which he purchased horses and other necessaries. Sir Thomas Picton then took him out to Flanders as an honorary aide-de-camp but finding no employment for him, he was advised to join the 3rd battalion of his regiment and was subsequently present at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. He entered Paris on 25 June 1815, and on 28 June became a lieutenant and later a captain in his regiment. From this period until 24 October 1821 he continued with his regiment in England, and then retired from the army.|$|E
5000|$|Riding on {{the success}} of the {{previous}} year's ceremony which garnered its highest viewership figures in over a decade, the Academy rehired producers Neil Meron and Craig Zadan for the third consecutive year. “Their showmanship has elevated the show to new heights and we are excited to keep the momentum <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> creative partnership,” said AMPAS president Cheryl Boone Isaacs in a press release announcing the selection. In October 2014, actor Neil Patrick Harris, who previously hosted four Tony Awards ceremonies between 2009 and 2013 and two Primetime Emmy Awards telecasts in 2009 and 2013, was chosen as host of the 2015 gala. Meron and Zadan explained their decision to hire the television and theatre star saying, [...] "We are thrilled to have Neil host the Oscars. We have known him his entire adult life, and we have watched him explode as a great performer in feature films, television and stage. To work with him on the Oscars is the perfect storm, all of his resources and talent coming together on a global stage." [...] Harris expressed that it was truly an honor and a thrill to be asked to host Academy Awards commenting, [...] "I grew up watching the Oscars and was always in such awe of some of the greats who hosted the show. To be asked to {{follow in the footsteps of}} Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, Ellen DeGeneres, and everyone else who had the great fortune of hosting is a bucket list dream come true." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{monologue}} {{began with}} a short time lapse of Craig coming out to start show through the last 10 years, starting {{on his first day}} (January 3, 2005) to his last. Craig thanked his comedic partner Josh Robert Thompson, the viewers, the crew, and explained: Over the years, <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> show out and around, or going and doing stand-up with Josh, I've come into contact {{with a lot of people}} who are viewers of this show, and although I said my goodbyes to the crew, the people who made this show are you. You came to a show that, let's be honest, was a bit of a fixer-upper. It kind of stayed that way, but what I hope we've done ... maybe art is a very grand word, but I think what we managed to do here is make something that wasn't here before. So in that sense maybe it is a piece of art, it didn't exist and now it does. What we've done here, it doesn't go away because I stopped doing it, we stop doing this and we start doing something else ... maybe ... later, or maybe I go away and this is it! But I think what was more overwhelming than anything else in the experience of doing this show was making a connection with a country which I became a part of, which is astonishing to me. Even in the course of this show I became an American, officially and particularly for my friends at the IRS, I am now a fully-fledged American. However, what I can't be is a member of a club, which I didn't really ask to join, I wanted to do this show ... and now we've done this show, and if you will indulge me in whatever I'm doing now and come to whatever I do next I'd be very grateful, because my kids are still young.|$|E

Phronetic organizational research effectively provides answers to the following four value-rational questions, for specific problematics in management and organization studies: 1.
