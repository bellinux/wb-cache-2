A Family Fund {{was set up}} to provide assistance to families with children who had congenital conditions, while new benefits were introduced benefiting hundreds of thousands of disabled persons whose disabilities had been caused neither by war nor by industrial injury. An Attendance Allowance was introduced for those needing care at home, together with Invalidity Benefit for the long-term sick, while a higher Child Allowance was made available where <b>invalidity</b> <b>allowance</b> was paid. Widow's Benefits were introduced for those aged between forty and fifty years of age, improved subsidies for slum clearance were made available, while Rent Allowances were introduced for private tenants. In April 1971, the right to education was given to all children with Down's syndrome for the first time.|$|E

These findings mean that eligibility for an old-age benefit generates a strong push out from the labour market.|$|E

In a multicentre, prospective study, patients with chronic CH (n 27), with episodic CH in the active (n 26) and outside the active period (n 22), migraine patients (n 24) and healthy controls (n 31) were included. Epidemiological data, the German version of the Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) and a screening for psychiatric complaints were applied. About 25 % of chronic CH patients in our study received <b>invalidity</b> <b>allowance</b> due to CH. HDI scores (total and subscales emotion and function) indicated a severe headache-specific disability (one-way ANOVA: P< 0. 01). Patients with chronic and active episodic CH were significantly more affected than patients with inactive CH and migraine. Healthy volunteers were significantly less affected than all headache patients. Symptoms suggestive of psychiatric co-morbidity were found predominantly in chronic CH: depressive symptoms (56 %), signs of agoraphobia (33 %) and suicidal tendencies (25 %) were frequently reported. Patients with chronic and active episodic CH were severely impaired in non-economic and economic domains such as disability, working life and psychiatric complaints. Remarkably, psychiatric co-morbidity was highest in chronic CH. Thus, especially chronic CH warrants special medical and further supportive care...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the coordinated {{rehabilitation}}. Coordinated rehabilitation is a coherent process of medical, educational, vocational and social rehabilitation, whose main objective is to minimalize the consequences, based on the individual's disability. Successful rehabilitation consists in ensuring early, continuous and coordinated efforts of the fastest and widest participation of persons with disabilities in the usual activities of life. The theoretical part consists of six basic chapters. The first one {{is devoted to the}} International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, which is followed by the subchapter dealing with disabilities and consequently mental disabilities. I have focused on people with mental disabilities, as an organization where research was conducted, providing services to these people. The second chapter contains information about coordinated rehabilitation. The remaining chapters deal with the individual components of a coordinated rehabilitation, which are medical, educational, vocational and social rehabilitation. The aims of this thesis is to determine how the system of coordinated rehabilitation is used in the Institute of social care Domečky. A partial aim is to determine the importance of a system of coordinated rehabilitation for clients of the Institute of social care Domečky. There are two research questions in the connection with the thesis aims. The main research question is: How are the individual components of a coordinated rehabilitation applied in the Institute of social care Domečky? The particular research question finds positives provides system of coordinated rehabilitation for clients of the Institute of social care Domečky. Qualitative research was chosen for the practical section of the thesis. I have used the questioning method and the technique of the semi-controlled dialoque, Results were evaluated using the method of make the clusters. The selected group consisted of 11 employees of the Institute of social care Domečky. The respondents have been chosen intentionally, according to the criterion of willingness to participate in research. The results are divided into two sections according to the research questions. The first section {{deals with the}} way the use of individual components of the coordinated rehabilitation in the Institute of social care Domečky. These results are also divided by the individual components of coordinated rehabilitation for greater clarity. The first part contains the identification of the respondents. Following parts: medical rehabilitation, educational rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation and social rehabilitation. The second part of results includes the subjective opinions of the respondents on the benefits of coordinated rehabilitation and its benefit to the clients of the organization. The research has shown ignorance of the concept of coordinated rehabilitation. Within medical rehabilitation it was found that health care is provided by nurses and practical doctor. The organization also works with hospitals and polyclinics, which are next to the organization. The research, which is devoted to educational rehabilitation, results divided terminology used in special education. Vocational rehabilitation can be used by clients within a job in the kitchen and the laundry in the organization or employment in the civic association Pferda which offer a job in a cafe, a cleaning company and a bakery. Within the social rehabilitation it was described the relationship of key worker and client and the creation of individual planning. It was clarified the issue of social security benefits when clients receive <b>invalidity</b> pensions, care <b>allowance,</b> alternatively child benefit. From the perspective of respondents the benefit of coordinated rehabilitation is in complex care for clients that is devoted them...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) is a {{syndrome}} {{with many}} speculations about etiology, {{risk factors and}} pathomechanism, but few scientifically consolidated findings. Therefore living conditions and living factors of persons with self-reported MCS (sMCS) in comparison to a control group of the same anthroposphere were systematically investigated. Research methods: In a case-control study patients with sMCS were investigated in comparison to a not MCS affected control group of the same anthroposphere. The sMCS group was characterized using the modified MCS-questionnaire from Hüppe et al. concerning symptom inducing substances. The data about living conditions and living factors was collected by a posted questionnaire all participants filled in personally. The dependence of questionnaire-obtained living conditions and living factors on sMCS and controls were analyzed with Pearson’s chi²-, Fisher’s exact- and Mann-Whitney-U-test. Results: The sMCS group consists of 59 persons concerned (14 men, 45 women, mean age: 48. 4 ± 9. 4 years), the control group of 40 persons (14 men, 26 women, mean age: 43. 9 ± 9. 0 years). The modified MCS-questionnaire from Hüppe et al. differentiated between the sMCS and control group with 91. 8 % sensitivity and 83. 9 % specifity. The observed differences in living conditions and living factors between cases and controls regarded mainly nutrition (e. g., more special nutrition habit of sMCS-affected persons), social area (e. g., more <b>invalidity</b> <b>allowance</b> of sMCS-affected persons), odorous annoyance (e. g., lesser use of universal cleaners by sMCS-affected persons) and dental prothesis (e. g., fewer amalgam fillings in sMCS-affected persons). Altogether, compared to the control group the sMCS-affected persons had worse social conditions and lower exposures, esp. to odorous factors. Conclusion: Exposures which might possibly be causative for MCS could not be observed. Even if an exogenous cause of MCS should not exist, a special susceptibility could still be a possible etiologic factor. Under this suspicion further investigations should focus on genetics and polymorphisms of the metabolism of foreign substances. The low exposures of the sMCS-affected persons {{seem to be a}} result of avoidance behavior of sMCS-affected persons. The low exposure to odorous factors fits in the hypothesis that the olfactory systems might be involved in the pathogenesis and/or pathophysiology of MCS...|$|E
