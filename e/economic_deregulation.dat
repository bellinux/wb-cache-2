25|$|The Government {{sector has}} long been a {{mainstay}} of the economy, which has typically risen and fallen with it. Traditionally, its central location meant it was the location of many head offices of various sectors – particularly finance, technology and heavy industry – many of which have since relocated to Auckland following <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> and privatisation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> in {{the mid-1980s}} led to {{dramatic}} changes to Auckland's economy and many companies relocated their head offices from Wellington to Auckland. The region was now the nerve centre of the national economy. Auckland also benefited from a surge in tourism, which brought 75per cent of New Zealand's international visitors through its airport. In 2004, Auckland's port handled 43 per cent of the country's container trade.|$|E

50|$|While the ordoliberal idea of {{a social}} market {{is similar to that}} of the third-way social {{democracy}} advocated by the likes of the New Labour government (especially during the Premiership of Tony Blair), there are a few key differences. Whilst they both adhere to the idea of providing a moderate stance between socialism and capitalism, the Ordoliberal social market model often combines private enterprise with government regulation to establish fair competition (although German network industries are known to have been deregulated), whereas advocates of the third-way social democracy model have been known to oversee multiple <b>economic</b> <b>deregulations.</b> The third way social democracy model has also foreseen a clash of ideas regarding the welfare state's establishment, in comparison to the ordoliberal's {{idea of a}} social market model being open to the benefits of social welfare.|$|R
25|$|The Right {{has gone}} through five {{distinct}} historical stages: (I) the reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religion; (II) the moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government; (III) the radical right favored a romantic and aggressive nationalism; (IV) the extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism; and (V) the neo-liberal right sought to combine a market economy and <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> with the traditional Right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.|$|E
25|$|Within the Liberal Democrats, the {{two main}} ideological strands are social liberals and the {{classical}} liberals, the latter supporting economic liberalism. The principal {{difference between the two}} is that the classical liberals tend to support greater choice and competition and aim to increase social mobility through <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> and creation of opportunity, whereas the social liberals were more commonly associated with directly aiming to increase equality of outcome through state intervention. Correspondingly, classical liberals tended to favour cutting taxes for the poorest in order to increase opportunity, contrasting with social liberals, who would rather see higher spending on public services and the disadvantaged in order to reduce income inequality.|$|E
25|$|While {{leaders of}} America's two most {{influential}} political parties generally favored <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, {{there was less}} agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance {{in the years following}} the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules {{based on the idea that}} such regulation interfered with free enterprise, increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.|$|E

500|$|Entering the {{presidency}} in 1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed [...] "Reaganomics", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation,</b> and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned {{on the notion that}} it was [...] "Morning in America", winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire", and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to [...] "tear down this wall!". He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback, by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev, which culminated in the INF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reunified the following year, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have linked the ascent of neoliberal, free market ideology {{in the late}} 1970s to mass incarceration. Sociologist Loïc Wacquant postulates the expansive prison system has become a political institution designed {{to deal with an}} urban crisis created by welfare state retrenchment and <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation,</b> and that this [...] "overgrown and intrusive penal state" [...] is [...] "deeply injurious to the ideals of democratic citizenship." [...] Academic and activist Angela Davis argues that prisons in the U.S. have [...] "become venues of profit as well as punishment;" [...] as mass incarceration has increased, the prison system has become more about economic factors than criminality. Professor of Law at Columbia University Bernard Harcourt contends that neoliberalism holds the state as incompetent when it comes to economic regulation but proficient at policing and punishing, and that this paradox has resulted in the expansion of penal confinement. According to The Routledge Handbook of Poverty in the United States, [...] "neoliberal social and economic policy has more deeply embedded the carceral state within the lives of the poor, transforming {{what it means to be}} poor in America." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tax {{cuts and}} <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> {{and the arrival}} of EU funds spurred several years of {{uninterrupted}} economic growth, which increased Cavaco Silva's popularity. He was hampered, however, by heading a minority government. On most issues, his Social Democrats could rely on the 22 votes of the Social and Democratic Center Party (CDS), but the two parties' combined 110 votes fell 16 short of a parliamentary majority. [...] The Socialists and Communists held 57 and 38 seats respectively; Cavaco Silva could govern if the 45 members of the PRD, who held the balance of power, abstained, as they frequently did. In 1987, however, the PRD withdrew its tacit support, and a parliamentary vote of no confidence forced President Mário Soares to call an early election. The results of the election stunned even the most optimistic of Cavaco Silva's supporters. His Social Democrat party captured 50.2 {{percent of the popular vote}} and 148 of the 250 seats in the legislature. Far behind were the Socialists, with only 60 seats, and the Communists, with 31. The CDS and the PRD were virtually wiped out, left with only four and seven seats, respectively. [...] This was the first time since the 1974 revolution that a single party had won an outright majority in the national parliament.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{the state}} of {{telephony}} markets paved the way for significant regulatory and legislative reforms in the telecommunications sector in the 1990 s. In Canada, the 1993 Telecommunications Act was enacted to promote the emergence of competitors in a market that had until then been dominated by regional monopolies. This paper examines the Canadian telecommunications regulatory framework and analyzes the regulatory privileges given to new entrants at the expense of former telecommunications monopolies. Such regulations, which were meant to induce competition, ended up hurting consumers and distorting the market process. This paper also shows how the Canadian government recently eliminated many of those regulations by seizing control of the policy agenda from the telecommunications regulator. <b>Economic</b> regulation <b>Deregulation</b> Wireline telephony Unbundling VoIP Forbearance CRTC...|$|R
