500|$|The duet aria, [...] "" [...] (Take me from {{myself and}} give me to You!), again for soprano and alto, is in triple time. The tune of Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> go of my Jesus) is {{interwoven}} in the texture as a cantus firmus of the upper strings in unison. The movement is a [...] "love duet" [...] characterized by [...] "antiphonal avowals of commitment" [...] to God rather than a carnal desire. The musicologist Julian Mincham compares its presentation to Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. The movement begins with sparse scoring and becomes more richly textured as it progresses, adding the chorale tune.|$|E

"Nay [...] <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> thee go, until thou hast {{compassion}} on my friends; 300 soldiers armed in mail, and 400 unequipped, - they defended me on {{the fields}} of Hadaick and Boath from every foe.

2500|$|On 27 January 2011, Mohammed ElBaradei {{returned}} to Egypt amid ongoing turmoil.

There were numerous individual public displays of affection and respect for soldiers manning positions on the streets. He urged the US to end the [...] "life support to the dictator" [...] and that [...] "It is better for President Obama not to appear that he is the last one to say to President Mubarak, 'It's time for you to go.'" ...|$|E
