Allen emerged as the starter in July, but he was sidelined a month later with a knee injury. While Allen returned quickly from the injury, he was replaced by Walcott as starter and {{was moved to the}} reserve list for a short time. He was reactivated after Walcott was injured with turf toe, but Remi Trudel was started at safety in place of Allen.|$|E

5|$|By the 1951 season, Motley {{started to}} feel the {{physical}} effects of his hard-hitting, up-the-middle running style. He suffered a knee injury <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp,</b> and he was getting older; {{by the time the}} season was in full swing, he was 31. Motley only ran for 273 yards and one touchdown that year, an uncharacteristically low total. Despite Motley's troubles, the Browns made the championship game again after winning the American Conference with an 11–1 record. Cleveland, however, lost the title game to the Rams, 24–17. Motley had just five carries and 23 yards.|$|E

5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that he be traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL signed Alston in 2006. <b>In</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp,</b> he {{competed with}} several other import {{receivers}} for a roster spot, including former Denver Broncos player Chris Cole. The coaching staff also evaluated him along with Tony Tompkins and Toby Zeigler to return kicks. Alston solidified his spot on the roster by leading the team in preseason catches. Alston remained on the roster into the regular season. After Eskimos wide receiver Trevor Gaylor dropped a pass near the Eskimos sideline during Week 1, the Eskimos coaching staff removed Gaylor from the starting lineup. Alston started his first game in the CFL the following week against the Calgary Stampeders. He suffered an ankle injury during his first start, but he quickly recovered to catch three passes for 76 yards two weeks later against the BC Lions. In August, Gaylor reclaimed his starting position from Alston after Alston dropped a long pass {{in a game against}} the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Alston finished the regular season with seven games played, recording 23 catches for 261 yards and a single two-point conversion. Although the Eskimos had considered him as a potential kick returner <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp,</b> he returned only one kickoff along with three punts.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{faced the}} {{possibility}} of becoming {{a free agent after}} the 2007 season, but he resigned with the Roughriders by February 2008. Adams was challenged by Brent Curvey and Ronald Flemons <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp,</b> but he won the starting role for the 2008 season. Playing in 14 games, he made 11 tackles and two fumble recoveries. Adams missed a regular season game in July to visit his mother, who was undergoing cancer surgery, and he also spent time on the injured list due to a finger injury and sprained ankle. The Roughriders made the playoffs, but lost to the BC Lions 33–12 in the West Semi-Final.|$|E
5|$|After the Chiefs {{acquired}} quarterback Matt Cassel {{from the}} New England Patriots, Croyle entered training camp competing against Tyler Thigpen for a roster spot as backup quarterback. The first depth chart <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp</b> listed Croyle {{as the second}} quarterback ahead of Thigpen. Croyle entered the Chiefs' first preseason game of 2009 (against the Houston Texans) as the second quarterback and finished as the team's leading passer (12-of-18 for 145 yards) and looked poised throughout the evening to post a 91.2 quarterback rating. The Chiefs {{would go on to}} lose the game 16–10. After quarterback Matt Cassel was injured on August 29 against the Seattle Seahawks, Croyle started the final game of the preseason against the St. Louis Rams.|$|E

Centre Daymond Langkow remained sidelined following a neck injury suffered the previous season, while Ryan Stone (knee) was also out. Matt Stajan suffered a shoulder separation, David Moss also suffered {{a shoulder injury}} and Ales Kotalik was lost to a knee injury. As {{a result of the}} injuries, the Flames signed centre Brendan Morrison to a contract; Morrison had been <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp</b> with the Canucks before being released. Rookie defenceman T. J. Brodie proved the surprise player of training camp. Expected to start the year with the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), Brodie impressed the Flames' coaching staff and earned a position on the team to begin the NHL season.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Falcons signed Alston {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the 2003 season and allocated him to the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe.

The impact from the puck broke his nose and he mised 19 games. In 63 games, Salo recorded 25 points, his lowest output since his 2001–02 season with the Senators. Despite this, he still led all Canucks defencemen in scoring, as all the team's blueliners also suffered injuries over the season.|$|E

5|$|Allen was {{eligible}} for the 2001 NFL Draft but went undrafted. He was later {{signed as a free}} agent to the Kansas City Chiefs, who released him prior to the start of the 2001 regular season. After being waived by the Chiefs, Allen intended to leave football behind, but he accepted a spot on the practice squad of the Atlanta Falcons in January 2002. Later that month, the Chiefs signed Allen to a three-year contract. During the offseason, Allen was sent to play for the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe to gain experience.

He also led the Browns to only three first downs during the first half, and as a result Phipps took over at quarterback; the Browns {{went on to win the}} game, 15-7. Nelsen recovered from the injury the following week and turn back over for the Browns at quarterback; Gault did not play another snap that season. Entering the 1971 season, Gault modified his throwing style after discussion with new head coach Nick Skorich, and was throwing better <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp</b> as a result. After training camp ended, however, he was placed on the practice squad, where he remained throughout the season.|$|E

He also spent time with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, but did not see any playing time with them. He later noted that he was unable to adjust to the game of Canadian football, as he was unable to throw a spiral due to the football being shorter and fatter.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>training</b> <b>camp,</b> Allen {{competed with}} Wes Lysack and Eric Fraser for the {{starting}} safety position. Lysack and Fraser {{were considered to}} be stronger players than Allen physically, but Allen was both quicker and possessed greater ability in coverage. Allen started the first preseason game at safety but also spent significant time on the field as a cornerback, his previous position. After making the regular season roster, Allen spent the month of July moving on and off the roster but playing in no games. Allen made his CFL debut on July 31, 2010 in a 23–20 win against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, in which he played off the bench.
