This configuration fills the shape of the existing site as well as accommodating the natural west to east slope. The Skylit Bowl is situated on the <b>high</b> <b>spot</b> of the site to allow connection to the existing storm sewer system. The rim of the bowls is 7-10 feet above the Trenches, creating a sizeable mound.|$|E
500|$|Occlusal trauma often {{occurs when}} a newly placed dental {{restoration}} is built too [...] "high", concentrating the biting forces on one tooth. Height differences measuring less than a millimeter can cause pain. Dentists, therefore, routinely check that any new restoration is {{in harmony with the}} bite and forces are distributed correctly over many teeth using articulating paper. If the <b>high</b> <b>spot</b> is quickly eliminated, the pain disappears and there is no permanent harm. Over-tightening of braces can cause periodontal pain and, occasionally, a periodontal abscess.|$|E

500|$|According to McCartney, Sutcliffe was a [...] "typical art student", {{with bad}} skin and pimples, but his {{reputation}} grew after he began wearing tight trousers and dark Ray-Ban sunglasses. Sutcliffe's <b>high</b> <b>spot</b> was singing [...] "Love Me Tender", which drew more applause {{than when the}} other Beatles sang, increasing the friction between himself and McCartney. Lennon also started to criticise Sutcliffe; making jokes about Sutcliffe's size and playing.

McCartney and Best were deported for attempted arson at the Bambi Kino, which left Lennon and Sutcliffe in Hamburg. Lennon took a train home, but as Sutcliffe had a cold he stayed in Hamburg. Sutcliffe later borrowed money from his girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, in order to fly back to Liverpool on Friday, 20 January 1961, although he returned to Hamburg in March 1961, with the other Beatles.|$|E
500|$|The {{community}} of Hochheim in DeWitt County observed around [...] of precipitation {{over the course}} of one day, though much of it fell in four to six hours. Three people from injured near Hochheim after their car was swept off the road. The lower Guadalupe River crested at [...] at Cuero, its second largest height on record. A number of residents evacuated from the city as the river began to rise. Flooding there damaged 40homes and 4businesses. Near Thomaston, a 72-year-old man was swept away by flood waters, but he survived and was found after four days. More than 2,000head of cattle drowned, while crops such as hay and pecans experienced extensive losses. Damage in the county reached $2.4million, including $1.4million to property and $1.2million to agriculture. In Gonzales County, the town of Cheapside observed [...] of rain in a 24-hour period. All creeks exceeded their banks and the Guadalupe and San Marcos rivers rose sharply; the former crested at a near-record height. Close to 200people were rescued from their homes, vehicles, or isolated <b>high</b> <b>spot.</b> In the city of Gonzales, water from the rapidly swelling Tinsley Creek damaged approximately 30homes and mobile homes and washed away dozens of cars. About 50homes and mobile homes in Waelder were flooded after multiple branches the Baldrige Creek overflowed their banks. Several other dwellings in and around Leesville suffered water damage after the O'Neil Creek reached its highest level since at least 1936. Portions of several highways in the county were inundated, including U.S. routes 90 and 90A; Texas Highway 97; and Interstate 10 near Waelder. Agriculture also suffered severely, with hundreds of cattle lost. Damage in the county was estimated at over $5million.|$|E

50|$|Engineer's blue, Prussian blue in an oily base, is the {{traditional}} material used for spotting metal surfaces such as surface plates and bearings for hand scraping.

The toolmaker then scrapes, stones, or otherwise removes the marked <b>high</b> <b>spots.</b> Prussian blue is preferable because it will not abrade the extremely precise reference surfaces as many ground pigments may.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} PDR {{techniques}} utilize metal rods and body picks to push out the dents from {{the underside of}} the body panel. Glue and specially designed tabs may be used to pull out the dents from the outside of the panel. Fine tuning the repair often involves tapping down the repair to remove small <b>high</b> <b>spots.</b> Quality technicians can blend <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> to match the texture of the paint called orange peel. Pushing too hard can create <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> that cause the clear coat to split or crack. Experienced technicians can avoid cracking or chipping with the use of heat, although a re-painted surface most likely will crack. When damage is so great that body filler is necessary, a PDR technician may [...] "push to paint", resolving most of the damage before minor filling, sanding, and painting, thereby saving time and cost.|$|R
