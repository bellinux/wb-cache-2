For a creative task, I predict and find that a cash incentive paid in the near future and a non-cash incentive paid in the distant future are most effective. The results of my study should benefit theory and practice by identifying the most effective combination of incentive type and payoff timing for a given task type...|$|R

This field was at first called <b>economic</b> <b>psychology</b> or business psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or psychotechnology. An important early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924–1932. With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist Elton Mayo, Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} boundedly {{rational}} agents in evolutionary game theory {{has succeeded in}} producing clear results when traditional methodology was failing. However the majority of such papers have obtained their results when this bounded rationality itself vanishes. This paper considers whether such results are actually a good reflection of a population whose bounded rationality is small, but non-vanishing. We also look at a heterogenous population who play a co-ordination game but have conflicting interests, and investigate the stability of an equilibria where two strategies co-exist together. Firstly, I find that results using the standard vanishing noise approach can {{be very different from}} those obtained when noise is small but persistent. Secondly, when the results differ it is the non-vanishing noise approach which selects the co-existence equilibria. As recent <b>economic</b> and <b>psychology</b> studies highlight the irrationality of their human subjects, this paper seeks to further demonstrate that the literature needs to concentrate more on the analysis of truly noisy populations.

(W.E.B. DuBois also posed this question in his seminal work, Black Reconstruction (1935), as he saw a failure of labor in creating connections across racial lines.)

We present a selective overview of the literature on the relationship between consumption and well-being, exploring the ways in which informal arguments from social science might be linked to formal models of economic behavior.

5000|$|Since the {{development}} of public administration, scholars have assumed that people make decisions rationally. By rationality, Herbert A. Simon (1976) means ”a style of behaviour that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints” (P. 405).Max Weber, {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, suggested distinguishing two types of economic rationality: formal rationality and substantive rationality. The [...] "formal rationality of economic action" [...] referred to [...] "the extent of quantitative calculation or accounting which is technically possible and [...] [...] [...] actually applied." [...] "Substantive rationality" [...] referred to the degree to which economic action serves [...] "ultimate values no matter what they may be." [...] (Weber, The Theory of Social and Economic Organization, Parsons, ed., 1947, pp. 184-186) Weber noted that [...] "the requirements of formal and of substantive rationality are always in principle in conflict." [...] (Ibid., p. 212) Decades later, Simon used a similar terminology to distinct two meanings of [...] "rationality", which have developed separately in <b>economic</b> and <b>psychology.</b> He defined substantive rationality, stemming from the concept of rationality within economics, as behavior that [...] "is appropriate to the achievement of given goals within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints". Procedural rationality, based in psychology, refers to behavior that [...] "is the outcome of appropriate deliberation".|$|R
