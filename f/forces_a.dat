5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese <b>forces</b> <b>a</b> reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Pasir Panjang, Bukit Chandu was {{the last}} bastion of the 1st and 2nd Battalion Malay Regiment who, {{together}} with the 2nd Loyals Regiment, defended the western and southern parts of Singapore from 8–14 February 1942. Despite running low on ammunition and food, the Malay Regiments put up strong resistance, inflicting a heavy toll on the Japanese invaders. Outnumbered, the defenders were finally overrun and massacred by reinforced Japanese <b>forces.</b> <b>A</b> Malay officer, Second Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi, was captured alive and tortured by the Japanese, before being executed. The story of his heroism became well known throughout Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid <b>forces.</b> <b>A</b> garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E

Jevđević collaborated with the Italians and later the Germans in actions against the Yugoslav Partisans. Although Jevđević recognised the authority of Mihailović, who was aware of and approved of his collaboration with Axis <b>forces,</b> <b>a</b> number of factors effectively rendered him independent of Mihailović's command, except when he worked closely with Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin, Mihailović's designated commander in Dalmatia, Herzegovina, western Bosnia and southwestern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|General Archibald Wavell—the {{commander-in-chief}} of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell {{intended to}} create advantageous conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's <b>forces.</b> <b>A</b> secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although {{only as far as}} supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E

By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging up to and including the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E

From 1189 to 1191, Acre was besieged by the Crusaders, and despite initial Muslim successes, it fell to Richard's <b>forces.</b> <b>A</b> massacre of 2,700 Muslim inhabitants ensued, and the Crusaders then planned to take Ascalon in the south.|$|E
