50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{producing}} <b>hand-blown</b> window <b>glass</b> included: broad sheet, blown plate, crown glass and cylinder blown sheet. These methods of manufacture lasted {{at least until}} the end of the 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled plate, machine drawn cylinder sheet, flat drawn sheet, single and twin ground polished plate, and float glass.|$|R
5000|$|Cylinder {{blown sheet}} {{is a type}} of <b>hand-blown</b> window <b>glass.</b> It is created with a similar process to broad sheet, but larger {{cylinders}} are produced by swinging the cylinder in a trench. The glass is then allowed to cool before the cylinder is cut. The glass is then re-heated and flattened. The result is much larger panes and improved surface quality over broad sheet.|$|R

50|$|The {{architecture}} of Christ Chapel {{is quite different}} from the traditional seminary chapel. Two things are especially striking: the shape—inspired by Bedouin tents—reminds us that we are all just travelers here passing through; and the Cross—located outside the chapel—reminds us that the work of the Church is in the world. The chapel—including the floor-to-ceiling <b>hand-blown</b> stained <b>glass</b> windows—was designed by celebrated architect Arthur Fehr. It was, by his own admission, Fehr’s favorite work.|$|R

30|$|Chanel {{incorporates}} recurring {{colors of}} black and white as brand recognition in all its channels (Chanel Floraison 2014). Since touch increases probabilities of purchase, it places accessories where customers can feel the products. For example, Chanel has LED signage that visually promotes its signature tweed. In New York City, its flagship store lights up {{in the shape of a}} perfume bottle at night. Chanel’s London flagship store has a gravity-defying staircase and <b>hand-blown</b> Venetian <b>glass</b> focal point reminiscent of Gabrielle Chanel’s iconic pearls (Larocca 2013). The London store has curtains with hand-stitched pearls as a means of authenticating the brand. Chanel boutiques have a sitting area that features tweed chairs, plush carpet, fireplaces and coffee tables stacked with Chanel books on each floor for visual consistency (Karmali 2017). In addition, the store sprays Gabrielle Chanel’s classic Chanel No. 5 perfume to enhance the customer olfactory sensory experience (Larocca 2013). Indeed, Chanel is one of the successful brands that have utilized multi-sensory stimuli to intensify their customers’ experiences.|$|R
50|$|All Saints Hall {{is a small}} {{convention}} center attached to Grace Episcopal Church's main structure. The building efforts that led to its construction began in 1976 when the Reverend J. Roland Johnston served as rector. Even after his death, Grace parish sought to gain all of its surrounding properties in order to regenerate a dying neighborhood which compromised its existence. This was accomplished by 1984 and included the acquisition of an automobile body shop, a plumbing store, a billiards hall, and a Veterans of Foreign Wars Club. The demolition projects cost Grace Church over $200,000, which were financed by a substantial bequest and a budgetary allocation. It was designed by a local architect named Tom M. Paine. The construction of All Saints Hall was about $375,000, {{made possible by the}} Diocese of Kentucky Revolving Fund and Planters Bank and Trust Company. Additionally, about half of building's total cost was raised in special pledges and congregational donations. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 4, 1984 and completed by the Rader Construction Company in 1985. Grace parish gathered {{for the first time in}} All Saints Hall for a dinner on November 14, 1984. Today, it is used for meals and other functions, to include a nursery and weekday kindergarten. The addition features <b>hand-blown</b> stained <b>glass</b> and a variety of heraldic banners adorned with apostolic symbols, which were designed by the St. Elizabeth's Guild and the Episcopal Church Women.|$|R
5000|$|Elliot's {{first feature}} film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2009 {{and was the}} first {{animated}} film and first Australian film in the festival's 25-year history to screen in the coveted opening night slot. The 92-minute film was made in Elliot's hometown of Melbourne and took five years to complete at a cost of 8.3 million Australian dollars. The project required a crew of over 120 people and a team of six animators who shot continuously for 57 weeks. For the narration, Elliot employed the services of the iconic comedian and stage performer Barry Humphries. Max is voiced by Academy Award-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, Mary by Toni Collette and Damian by Eric Bana. Molly Meldrum and Renee Geyer provided cameo voices. Elliot was determined that young Mary should be voiced by a real eight-year-old girl and, after auditioning over 40 actresses, finally chose Bethany Whitmore. From 2 March to 6 June 2010, Mary and Max was showcased in a free exhibition at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI). [...] "Mary and Max: The Exhibition" [...] provided a behind-the-scenes insight into the making of the film. Items on display included character models, costumes, storyboards, props (meticulously crafted miniature <b>hand-blown</b> wine <b>glasses,</b> a working typewriter, light bulbs) and footage of the animators at work. The film is currently included in IMDb {{as one of the top}} 250 highest-rated films of all time.|$|R

5000|$|Casting {{came back}} as a common {{technique}} when rolled glass began to be manufactured in the mid-1830s and as glass jewels (also used for architectural glass) became popular.

5000|$|In {{the late}} ‘70s Kehlmann began using {{sandblast}} on sheets of <b>hand-blown</b> <b>glass</b> to make “nuanced monochromes” which glow with inner-light trapped in their surfaces. [...] Perhaps {{in response to}} his brother’s untimely death in 1982, the exuberance of the early leaded compositions gives way to introspection in two major series: Tablets (1981) and The Stations of the Cross (1982-1995).|$|E
50|$|Begun in 1999, the Kandor project (2007) {{deals with}} the town of Kandor, on the planet Krypton from which the child Kal-El escaped to Earth, where he became Superman. Kandor’s {{depiction}} in these narratives is inconsistent and fragmentary, prompting Kelley to create multiple versions of it, cast in colorful resins and illuminated like reliquaries. The installation Kandor-Con 2000 was first presented in the millennium show at Kunstmuseum Bonn and later at the Technical University Berlin (2007), the Deichtorhallen/Sammlung Falckenberg, Hamburg (2007); ZKM, Karlsruhe (2008); the Shanghai Biennial (2008); and the Centre Pompidou, Paris (2010). Kandor-Con 2000 is conceived - and continued to develop - as a work in progress. Throughout the exhibitions, architecture students built cardboard models of Kandor inspired by the original comics. These models were sent to Pasadena, where Kelley made scaled down casts. Kandor 10A (2010), a yellow city housed in a <b>hand-blown,</b> pink <b>glass</b> bottle, is a grouping of tall skyscrapers situated within a full-scale rock grotto. Kandor 10B (Exploded Fortress of Solitude) (2011) is a pile of dark boulders and slabs forming a cave with a quarry-like foyer made from faux black rock and built {{on a scale that}} invites the viewer into the forbidden fortress. Set within the cave’s inner recesses is a glowing rose-colored city-in-a-bottle. Kandor 12, constructed in off-white resin and evocative of a group of chess pawns, or minarets, is encased in a shadowy brown bottle, which sits on a platform resembling a Greek column positioned in front of a chest of drawers and an illuminated translucent green wall.|$|R
