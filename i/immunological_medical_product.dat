2500|$|McNeil Consumer Healthcare {{was founded}} on March 16, 1879 by 23-year-old Robert McNeil. In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, {{became part of the}} company and {{together}} they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on direct marketing of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of acetaminophen began under the leadership of Robert L. McNeil, Jr., who later served as the firm's chairman. In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell Tylenol for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil <b>medicals</b> <b>products</b> and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil <b>medicals</b> <b>products</b> is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil <b>medicals</b> <b>products</b> merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty <b>medicals</b> <b>products.</b> However, it was later changed to [...] "McNeil Consumer Healthcare".

40|$|Abstract. This paper mainly {{analyses}} and discusses the application {{and significance of}} the visual negative afterimage on the colour design of <b>medical</b> <b>product</b> based on the visual negative afterimage theory. The design for the colour of <b>medical</b> <b>product</b> based on the visual negative afterimage theory focuses more human orientation in aspect of the visual effect design. The paper {{also points out that}} the trend of future design is to organically combine the art, the therapy features and the humanity. The complementary colour equilibrium of the visual negative afterimage will play a more and more important role in the colour design of the <b>medical</b> <b>product.</b> In the modern medical environment, the colour of the <b>medical</b> <b>product</b> has a decisive effect on the information exchange between people and the space environment. Although the visual negative afterimage is common in our daily life, the colour is not taken into consideration in the colour design of the <b>medical</b> <b>product,</b> which will result in negative effects. The colour is a strong and extremely attractive expression tool. Therefore, when the colour is designed for the <b>medical</b> <b>product,</b> it should be applied reasonably. The application of colour must be based on the special function requirements and the use of different people, so as to show its special function and requirements, which not only avoids the negative influence caused by the visual negative afterimage, but also creates a more humanistic atmosphere for the medical environment [1]...|$|R
