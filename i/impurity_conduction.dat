In all samples indications for <b>impurity</b> <b>conduction</b> at low temperatures were found. In low doped samples, a sharp transition between the <b>impurity</b> <b>conduction</b> transport regime and the hole conduction regime is visible in the temperature dependence of specific resistivity, charge carrier concentration and mobility. In highly doped samples (rho < 0. 2 ohm cm), this transition is no longer confined to a small temperature range and much less abrupt. We conclude that the <b>impurity</b> <b>conduction</b> is still present at high temperatures in highly aluminum doped SiC so {{that at least two}} competing transport mechanisms are present simultaneously in these samples...|$|E

The magneto-resistance is probably a consequence of magneto-striction.

40|$|We utilize variational {{method to}} {{investigate}} the Kondo screening of a spin- 1 / 2 magnetic impurity in tilted Dirac surface states with the Dirac cone tilted along the $k_y$-axis. We mainly study {{about the effect of}} the tilting term on the binding energy and the spin-spin correlation between magnetic <b>impurity</b> and <b>conduction</b> electrons, and compare the results with the counterparts in a two dimensional helical metal. The binding energy has a critical value while the Dirac cone is slightly tilted. However, as the tilting term increases, the density of states around the Fermi surface becomes significant, such that the impurity and the host material always favor a bound state. The diagonal and the off-diagonal terms of the spin-spin correlation between the magnetic <b>impurity</b> and <b>conduction</b> electrons are also studied. Due to the spin-orbit coupling and the tilting of the spectra, various components of spin-spin correlation show very strong anisotropy in coordinate space, and are of power-law decay with respect to the spatial displacements.

We show that spin relaxation effects (with time τ o s) in the vertex corrections to the Kondo self-energy lead to an exact cancellation of the singular temperature dependence arising from the diffusion poles. For a thin film of thickness L and a mean-free path ℓ, disorder provides a correction to the Kondo resistivity of the form τ o s /(kF Lℓ 2) ln T that explains both the disorder and sample-size depression of the Kondo effect observed by Blachly and Giordano (PRB 51, 12537 (1995)).

40|$|Spin-lattice {{relaxation}} times (T 1) and Knight shifts {{were measured}} for Cd 113 nuclei in 12 CdS crystals doped with various amounts of chlorine. Hall coefficients were measured {{in order to}} estimate conduction-electron concentrations. Data were obtained for all samples at 300 °K and for some highly doped samples at 77, 4. 2, and 2. 13 °K. Metallic properties were observed in all samples having electron concentrations n 3 ̆e 2 × 1018 cm- 3. At 300 °K, we find 1 /T 1 ∝n for nonmetallic samples and 1 /T 1 ∝n 2 / 3 when samples are metallic. The latter proportionality continues to hold at lower temperatures. The dependence of T 1 on n becomes increasingly less pronounced at lower temperatures in the nonmetallic samples indicating that the nuclear relaxation becomes at least partially dependent on mechanisms other than conduction electrons, such as spin-diffusion coupling to paramagnetic impurity sites. In the metallic samples, the Knight shift K∝n 1 / 3 and the Korringa product is a constant: T 1 TK 2 = 3. 3 × 10 - 6 sec °K. Both the Knight shift and Korringa product decrease sharply for n 3 ̆c 2 × 1018 cm- 3.

40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{performed}} {{on a number of}} Ta-Ta 2 O 5 -Au diodes of various thicknesses over a range of temperatures to determine the mechanism of current flow. The mechanism proposed for the current flow is field ionization of trap-type states at low temperatures and thermal ionization of these states at high temperatures and thermal ionization of these states at high temperature. High-temperature voltage-current data and low-temperature comparisons between forward and reverse characteristics agree well with the bulk-limited hypothesis and are in striking disagreement with barrier mechanisms. A discontinuity in the oxide properties is noted at a thickness of approximately 500 Å. High-temperature measurements at applied voltages less than the difference in the metal work functions yield an Ohmic characteristic with an activation energy of approximately 0. 1 eV, consistent with an <b>impurity</b> <b>conduction</b> process but not with a barrier process...|$|E
40|$|Conventional and spin-related {{thermoelectric}} {{effects in}} electronic transport through a nanoscopic system exhibiting magnetic anisotropy $-$with both uniaxial and transverse components$-$ are studied theoretically in the linear response regime. In particular, a magnetic tunnel junction with a large-spin impurity $-$either a magnetic atom or a magnetic molecule$-$ {{embedded in the}} barrier is considered as an example. Owing to magnetic interaction with the <b>impurity,</b> <b>conduction</b> electrons traversing the junction can scatter on the impurity, which effectively can lead to angular momentum and energy exchange between the electrons and the impurity. As we show, such processes {{have a profound effect}} on the thermoelectric response of the system. Specifically, we present a detailed analysis of charge, spin and thermal conductance, together with the Seebeck and spin Seebeck coefficients (thermopowers). Since the scattering mechanism also involves processes when electrons are inelastically scattered back to the same electrode, one can expect the flow of spin and energy also in the absence of charge transport through the junction. This, in turn, results in a finite spin thermopower, and the magnetic anisotropy plays a key role for this effect to occur. Comment: 23 pages with 16 figures; version as publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{dielectric}} {{and magnetic}} properties and their correlations were investigated in polycrystalline perovskite LaCoO_(3). The intrinsic bulk and grain-boundary (GB) dielectric relaxation processes were deconvoluted using impedance spectroscopy between 20 and 120 K, and resistivity and capacitance were analyzed separately. A thermally induced magnetic {{transition from a}} Co^(3 +) low-spin (LS) (S= 0;t^(6) _(2 g) e^(0) _(g)) to a higher spin state occurs at T_(s 1) ≈ 80 K, which is controversial in nature and has been suggested to be an intermediate-spin (IS) state (S= 1;t^(5) _(2 g) e^(1) _(g)) or a high-spin(HS) state (S= 2;t^(4) _(2 g) e^(2) _(g)) transition. This spin state transition was confirmed by magnetic-susceptibility measurements and {{was reflected in the}} impedance by a split of the single GB relaxation process into two coexisting contributions. This apparent electronic phase coexistence at T > 80 K was interpreted as a reflection of the coexistence of magnetic LS and IS/HS states. At lower temperatures (T ≤ 40 K) perceptible variation in bulk dielectric permittivity with temperature appeared to be correlated with the magnetic susceptibility associated with a magnetic defect structure.

40|$|This work {{develops}} the semiclassical theory of electrical conduction due to electrons in localized states, and compares the resultant formulae {{with a variety}} of experimental data. We begin by using the equivalent electrical network, derived from the phenomenological rate equations, to deduce the dc conductivity of a number of model systems. Percolation arguments are used to derive both the exponent and the prefactor when the dc conductivity is written in the form a = a exp [-sp]. In particular, we derive formulae for the cases when the energies of the electron states are distributed over a very narrow range, a very wide range and an intermediate range. In the first two cases the formulae are in excellent agreement with computer generated data obtained by numerical solutions of Kirchhoff's equations for the equivalent network. Experimental data obtained from studies of a number of systems are analysed, namely, <b>impurity</b> <b>conduction</b> in crystalline germanium and amorphous silicon, the conductivity of evaporated films of amorphous germanium and finally the conductivity due to electrons in an inversion layer formed in a metal-oxide-silicon-field-effecttransistor. In all cases very good agreement is found between experiment and theory. Formulae are also derived for the ac conductivity. Comparison of these formulae with computer data again shows good agreement between theory and experiment. We show how detailed considerations indicate that the ac data obtained from evaporated films of amorphous germanium cannot be due to hopping at the Fermi level, as is normally assumed. In conclusion, this work {{develops the}} simple hopping theory which adequately describes experimental data obtained from a variety of systems. Various problems are isolated; which relate to the model adopted rather than any approximation inherent in the deduction of the analytical formulae...|$|E
