5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpecker species {{live up to}} their name and feed on <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> other invertebrates living under bark and in wood, but overall the family is characterized by its dietary flexibility, with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic. The diet includes ants, termites, beetles and their larvae, caterpillars, spiders, other arthropods, bird eggs, nestlings, small rodents, lizards, fruit, nuts and sap. Many <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> their grubs are taken from living and dead trees by excavation. The bird may hear sounds from inside the timber indicating where it will be productive to create a hole.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small <b>insects,</b> <b>and</b> they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
