60|$|He {{twisted his}} chair around toward the stove. It was useless to dispute the {{question}} with him, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> felt inclined to do so. He absorbed {{himself in his}} stew-pan.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I've got {{prize money}} coming, too," [...] added Walter. [...] "I like the navy first-rate, and shall {{stick to it}} for the present, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a chance of being mustered out." ...|$|R
