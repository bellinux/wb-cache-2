5000|$|Except the Pyramidal Orchid (A. pyramidalis), {{all species}} of Anacamptis seem {{to form a}} clade around the <b>Green-veined</b> <b>Orchid</b> (A. morio). They have a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 32 or 36. A useful character for distinguishing Anacamptis from Orchis [...] - [...] where the <b>Green-veined</b> <b>Orchid</b> clade was formerly included [...] - [...] is the basal fusion of the three sepals in Anacamptis.|$|E
50|$|Anacamptis morio, the {{green-winged orchid}} or <b>green-veined</b> <b>orchid</b> (synonym Orchis morio), is a {{flowering}} plant of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>green-veined</b> shell <b>orchid</b> {{is found}} in inland areas between Kalbarri and Esperance in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest snd Mallee biogeographic regions.|$|R
50|$|Pterostylis scabra, {{commonly}} known as the <b>green-veined</b> shell <b>orchid,</b> is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. As with similar orchids, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants lack a rosette and have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has a white flower with green and pale brownish-fawn stripes and a long, curved protruding labellum. It is found in inland areas between Kalbarri and Esperance.|$|R
30|$|A dozen natural {{substances}} {{from the}} INCI list originate from {{plants that are}} on the red list of endangered species in Germany (class 2 or 3) [18], e.g. Drosera rotundifolia (sundew), Orchis morio (<b>green-veined</b> <b>orchid),</b> Gentiana lutea (great yellow gentian), Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry), or Arnica montana (mountain arnica). There were no notifiers of Drosera rotundifolia (sundew) and Orchis morio. Also, no notifier is entered for Arnica montana, although this plant is used frequently for pharmaceutical products. Some plants which are endangered in Germany and used for the production of natural substances may be cultivated (e.g. Gentiana lutea, Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi, and since recently also Arnica montana) or they may be collected in other countries (e.g. Arnica montana). Gentiana lutea, and Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi are notified by 747, respectively 25 notifiers. There are additional rare and protected plants, which are used for the production of personal care products, but which are itemized in the INCI list and not in the German red list. For example, alpine valerian (Valeriana celtica, German name: Speick) is used by the German Speick company for the production of soap. This company was granted an exception permit for the collection of Valeriana celtica in the Austrian Alps.|$|E
