40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the {{extensive}} utilisation of advanced Information Systems and the Internet have revolutionised {{the operations of the}} banking industry leading to vastly improved customer services, streamlined business operations and in particular profitability with reduced unit costs. On the other <b>hand,</b> security <b>breaches</b> and transaction fraud have been on the rise more recently, warranting a highly secure banking environment. Biometric technology appeals to many banking organisations as a near perfect solution to such security threats. However, due to the close association of biometrics with human physical and behavioural aspects, such technologies pose a multitude of social, ethical and environmental challenges. This paper analyses the security models of current Information Systems and identifies the biometric elements which could contribute to a more secure banking environment. In this research work, we have endeavoured to uncover the tangible and intangible issues pertaining to implementing biometric solutions in the New Zealand banking context. We discuss the underlying success factors of biometric solutions and describe a pilot study: a biometric-enabled security project called Bio-Sec in a large bankin...|$|R
5000|$|Baur's theory {{starts with}} the {{supposition}} that Christianity was gradually developed out of Judaism, see also List of events in early Christianity. Before {{it could become a}} universal religion, it had to struggle with Jewish limitations and to overcome them. The early Christians were Jewish-Christians, to whom Jesus was the Messiah. Paul, on the other <b>hand,</b> represented a <b>breach</b> with Judaism, the Temple, and the Law. Thus there was some antagonism between the Jewish apostles Peter, James and John, and Paul the [...] "Apostle to the Gentiles", and this struggle continued down {{to the middle of the}} 2nd century. In short, the conflict between Petrinism and Paulinism is, as Karl Schwarz puts it, the key to the literature of the 1st and 2nd century.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the number of {{expatriate}}s has shown a growth trend worldwide. Accordingly, the expatriate management, which integrates the subsystem of International Human Resources Management, has now a renewed attention and has been growing as an intervention area of Human Resources Management. Therefore, the psychological contract has been seen, more and more, as a relevant factor in explaining the labour relations {{and the number of}} studies around this theme has increased. The success of expatriation is directly influenced by the psychological contract and depends largely on how HRM practices are developed (Homem & Tolfo, 2008). Understanding the reaction of workers through changes (Bligh & Carsten, 2005; Shield et al., 2002) is essential, since the response behaviour can be a crucial contribution to {{the success or failure of}} the international assignment. In the same context, we are witnessing an increasing attention on the contribution that the Psychological Contract may have under uncertainty. The individual, as an employee of an organization that decides to accept an international assignment and move to another country, needs to fit in a continuous and motivating relationship with the employer. The concept of the psychological contract is fundamental to the understanding of labour relations, based on the perceptions of those involved. Many aspects of these relationships are implicit (unwritten) which can cause different interpretations of expectations, promises and obligations between parties. Several authors argue that the psychological contract is the key to understand and manage the attitudes and behaviour of individuals in organizations (Bunderson, 2001; Kraimer et al., 2005; Lemire & Rouillard, 2005). The goal of this work is to understand the psychological contract in expatriates: before the assignment, after adjustment to the host country and repatriation. A qualitative methodology was used, and for that we applied semi-structured individual interviews and sociographic questionnaire to people who were, at the time, expatriate. In total, ten interviews were conducted and the analysis of the interviews were made through Grounded Theory. The results suggest that there is only fulfilment of the psychological contract in the stage of the preparation of the international assignment, existing, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>breach</b> of the psychological contract during expatriation and at repatriation, according to the perception that expatriates have about the end of expatriation. However, most of the interviewed expatriates evaluates positively the expatriation experience, although organizations appear to have just a few rules to support expatriate, particularly logistical and financial support, and not having a complete and thorough program of support to the expatriation management. The results also suggest that it is essential that organizations encourage communication with expatriates and promote the continuous support, which should be constant and intrinsic to all phases of expatriation in order to avoid the “abandon” feeling. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|In {{situations}} where a river flow is weaker than the marine processes that build sand dunes, the river may be obstructed from {{flowing into the}} sea by {{the formation of a}} sand dune; that is, a sandbar. In such cases the river will often form an elongate estuary in the swales of the dune. When river flow increases, or once the estuary has built up a large mass of water, it breaches the sandbar and flows out to the ocean. If this breach occurs at the farthest end of the estuary from the river inflow, then water must flow through the whole length of the estuary in order to reach the sea. Thus the entire estuary is flushed, and there is no deadwater. On the other <b>hand,</b> if the <b>breach</b> occurs near the river inflow, then most of the estuary will not be flushed by the flow of the river into the sea, resulting in a large deadwater.|$|R
40|$|For {{some years}} {{we have seen a}} {{discussion}} about the scope of a lifting of the standardisation of employment forms and employment stability. On the one <b>hand,</b> far-reaching <b>breaches</b> in structure, and, on the other hand, consistency and limits of destabilisation, particularly in the areas of skilled, innovative and responsible work, are established here. Continuing this discussion, this report first outlines the arguments of the debate, which has so far remained inconclusive. Then, secondly, the paper examines the development of employment forms using among other things the microcensus, as well as the development of employment duration {{on the basis of the}} BIBB/IAB survey and the IAB employment sample. Here, it is shown that the lifting of the standardisation of contracted forms of employment is progressing slowly. However, there is no empirical evidence of a far-reaching structural breach. Rather, since the 1970 s, considerable proportions of short-term employment relationships have been observed, though with the share rising in the 1990 s. Against the background of these findings, a third step is taken to examine, on the basis of the data of the BIBB/IAB surveys 1991 / 92 and 1998 / 99, what characteristics distinguish stable and unstable employment relationships. It becomes clear that contrary to the assumptions of the consistency and limit approach, the indications of company-functional limits of a steady lifting of standardisation are confined to a relatively small circle of people in stable employment in superior positions. The performance of skilled, innovative or generally responsible jobs is a feature of both short-term and long-term employment relationships. In a fourth step, these analyses are supplemented by research on the job satisfaction of some stability groups. Here, it is especially the people in jobs suited to their training and without a subjective risk of being dismissed that show higher values of job satisfaction.

40|$|STRUGGLING FOR NEW PARADIGMS: PERSONALITIES AND INSTITUTIONS IN BULGARIAN ETHNOGRAPHY AND FOLKLORISTIC (1944 - 1989) Summary Milena Benovska-Sabkova It is {{the aim of}} {{this work}} is to analyze changes which have taken place in the {{development}} of academic ethnography and folkloristic in Bulgaria during socialism, through the prism of the personalities and their impact on the scientific paradigms and institutions. This is accomplished through the outlining of the profiles of five leading personalities of Bulgarian ethnography and folkloristic from the socialist period. The selection of these personalities has been determined not only by the leading position of a certain scholar in the academic hierarchy. What has been taken into consideration is the impact of the personality on the formation of the research paradigms and {{on the development of the}} disciplines: theories, opinions, convictions and even delusions. Observations here have been based, most of all, on the analysis of publications and archive sources, but also on information orally conveyed. The social and academic profile of five paradigmatic ethnographers and/or folklorists is outlined, whereby a sketch is provided concerning the context of the political, social and academic changes fitting into which have been their biographies, and their theoretical legacy. Five leading scholars are addressed here in chronological order: Mihail Arnaoudov (1878 - 1978), Hristo Vakarelski (1896 - 1979), Peter Dinekov (1910 - 1992), Stoyan Genchev (1936 - 1990), and Todor Ivanov Zhivkov (1938 - 2004). Under socialism, working on ethnography and folkloristic became a profession. When it was established in 1947, the Ethnographic Institute had three research fellows, whereas by the end of the socialist period entire cohort of several dozens of scholars works at the same institute, at the Institute of Folklore, at the universities and colleges, at local museum all over the country. It has been involved in various ways and to a different extent in the “production of knowledge”, but in the final count this has been a fruitful process, yielding result in an impressive flow of publications. Ethnographers and folklorists are social actors and mediators in yet another process – the transformation of rural culture from a living reality into a cultural heritage. Throughout the entire socialist period, however, the discipline developed under the impact of contradictory trends: between the dominating striving for continuity, on the one <b>hand,</b> and the <b>breaches</b> of political pressure and the manifestations of instrumentation, on the other. In this sense these intellectual trajectories have likewise been an expression of the contradictory nature of socialism as a whole. The evolutionist theoretical models have proved long-lasting in Bulgaria under socialism, and particularly instrumental to this has been Marxism with the “petrified” evolutionism, contained in it. Along with this, new research paradigms have been developing, lending a specific appearance to Bulgarian ethnography and folkloristic, although no clear-cut boundary between the two can be delineated. The significant intellectual and human potential, created under socialism, has been a resource for the search for new ways and new theoretical horizons...|$|R
5000|$|The central {{character}} {{of the story is}} a doctor, Sir Dominic Holden, who has had a long spell of service in British India first as a military doctor and then as a private surgeon in Bombay. Once when he was posted at Peshawar, then a main city of undivided Punjab (hence a part of India), he had to attend a poor Afghan whose one hand was in such a bad state due to the growth of a gangrene, {{that the only way to}} save his life was to amputate it. The operation was performed and Dr. Holden asked for the amputated hand as his fees. Dr. Holden had a hobby of collecting discarded limbs, organs, cysts from living and dead humans and thus wanted to add the [...] "brown hand" [...] to his collection. The Afghan being Islamic, refused to part with his amputated <b>hand,</b> as it <b>breached</b> the rule of his religion which stated amputated body parts to be kept with the owner himself. But Dr. Holden promised to return the Afghan his hand before his death and took the hand with him to his house in Bombay.Dr. Holden retired soon after and settled in Wiltshire. Then one night he was awakened by someone pulling his clothes - the ghost of his old Afghan patient. Dr. Holden understood that the Afghan had died and his ghost wanted back the amputated hand. From then onwards, the ghost haunted the doctor's lab every night for four years looking for his hand. But the ghost failed to find the hand since it had been damaged in a fire that broke out at the doctor's house in Bombay. The recurring visit of the ghost, however, had made the life of Dr. Holden and his wife, Lady Holden, miserable and the effect on their health was prominent. A doctor known for his steel nerves had now become a scared individual.The protagonist of the story, Dr. Holden's nephew, Hardecar decided to solve this problem. He spent his first night in the lab and saw the Afghan searching for his hand. The next day, Dr. Holden explained him everything in details and Hardecar left for London. Hardecar, a doctor himself, went through a book on spirits and found that certain spirits could not leave the living world because of them being strongly attached to something or someone existing in this world. Hardecar decided to try his luck and left for Chadwell where a friend of his was the home surgeon at a hospital for sailors. The home surgeon provided Hardecar with an amputated hand of an Indian sailor as the requirement was a [...] "brown hand".Hardecar returned to Wiltshire and placed the hand in a jar and placed it in his uncle's lab. Hardecar stayed awake as the Afghan ghost came visiting as usual. But Hardecar's experiment failed as the Afghan on seeing the hand, wailed in agony and smashed the jar on the floor before disappearing. Next morning, Hardecar realised his mistake as he had brought the left hand of the sailor while the Afghan had had his right hand separated. Hardecar rushed back to Chadwell and luckily got the right hand of the sailor. He returned and placed the hand in a jar in the lab just like the previous day. Dr. Holden forbade Hardecar from sleeping in the lab as he feared risking his nephew's life.That night, Hardecar again saw somebody approaching him while he tried to sleep. But it wasn't any ghost but his uncle who seemed overwhelmed with joy and had suddenly regained some of the energy he possessed earlier. Dr. Holden stated that the ghost had finally found his amputated hand and before leaving, he had bowed thrice in front of him, in a way similar to how Afghans pay respect. The Holdens lived on peacefully and consulted Hardecar for every major decisions they took thereafter. Before he died, Dr. Holden named Hardecar as the heir to his property.|$|R
