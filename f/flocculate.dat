40|$|The paper {{describes}} a three-part experiment on <b>flocculating</b> emulsions {{in order to}} determine whether ultrasonic spectroscopy could be used to detect and characterize the flocculation process. Three emulsions which represented unflocculated, partially <b>flocculated,</b> and fully <b>flocculated</b> systems were prepared. They were characterized independently using direct microscopic examination and their creaming behavior. Ultrasonic spectroscopic measurements of the <b>flocculating</b> emulsions showed large changes during the flocculation process, which were not readily modeled using single particle scattering theory. The ultrasonic properties of the unflocculated emulsion did not change during the measurement period. The results demonstrate that ultrasonic techniques are capable of detecting the flocculation process. There is clear potential to use ultrasonic techniques to characterize <b>flocculated</b> structures, but more work is needed on the theoretical analysis of the interaction of ultrasound with particle aggregates...|$|R
40|$|Optimization for the {{production}} of Pestan was followed by the Plackett- Burman Design, using modified Czapek-dox medium as the starting point. At the flask level, K 2 HPO 4, MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, and aeration variables positively affected the Pestan production, DCW (dry cell weight), apparent viscosity, and <b>flocculating</b> activity response. KCl and FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O negatively affected the Pestan production, DCW, apparent viscosity, and <b>flocculating</b> activity response. Aeration variable was shown to {{have a positive effect on}} only the <b>flocculating</b> activity response among Pestan production, DCW, and apparent viscosity responses. In comparison of the positive and negative variables media conditions, Pestan production and <b>flocculating</b> activity differed by about 9 and 125 times, respectively. In particular, at the jar fermentor level, the aeration variable was the most important factor of the all responses (Pestan production, DCW, apparent viscosity, <b>flocculating</b> activity, and anionic charge density). The <b>flocculating</b> activity and apparent viscosity of Pestan were closely related to the molecular chain length and charge density. ope...|$|R
40|$|Bioflocculants are <b>flocculating</b> {{substances}} {{produced by}} microorganisms during growth and have recently received considerable attention from researchers; {{due to their}} biodegradability, non-toxicity and lack of secondary pollution from degradation intermediates. This study evaluated the efficiency of bioflocculant produced by Bacillus sp. AEMREG 4 isolated from Tyhume River. The bacterial identification was through 16 S rDNA sequencing; nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank as Bacillus sp. AEMREG 4 with an Accession number KP 406729. The optimum culture conditions for bioflocculant production were an inoculum size of 4 % (v/v) and starch as well as yeast extract as sole carbon and nitrogen sources respectively. The addition of CaCl 2 enhanced the <b>flocculating</b> activity, at {{a wide range of}} pH 4 - 10 and the highest <b>flocculating</b> activity was reached at an initial pH 8 (80 %). A bioflocculant yield of 0. 78 g was recovered from 1 L of culture broth. The optimum <b>flocculating</b> activity of 78 % was reached at the lowest bioflocculant dosage of 0. 1 mg/ml and the presence of divalent cations (Ca 2 +, Mn 2 + and Mg 2 +) as well as a trivalent cation (Al 3 +) enhanced <b>flocculating</b> activity. The purified bioflocculant retained more than 70 % <b>flocculating</b> activity when subjected to heating at 100 °C for 1 h and maximum <b>flocculating</b> activity of 83 % was achieved at both acidic and basic pH values of 3 and 10 respectively. Chemical analysis showed that the bioflocculant is predominantly polysaccharide. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum revealed the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl and methoxyl groups as the functional moieties and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of the purified bioflocculant showed its morphological structure as rod-shaped which contributes to its high <b>flocculating</b> efficiency. The high flocculation activity displayed by this bioflocculant indicates its potential suitability for industrial application. Keywords: Bioflocculant, Bacillus sp.

40|$|Abstract. Electrolysis-assisted {{flocculation}} {{methods were}} used in decoloration of azophloxine. Electrolysis-assisted flocculation of azophloxine was conducted under the applied potential using titanium anode. The concentration of KNO 3, <b>flocculating</b> time and applied potential were investigated. The application of applied potential has nearly no power to remove the dye from wastewater since the highest decoloration rate is only 2. 5 % after treatment at KNO 3 concentration of 0. 6 mol/L. The total <b>flocculating</b> decoloration efficiency decreases gradually after increasing the KNO 3 concentration in the solution.

40|$|We {{have used}} the newly {{developed}} concept of CROSS (cation ratio of soil structural stability) instead of SAR (sodium adsorption ratio) in our study on dispersive soils. CROSS incorporates the differential dispersive powers of Na and K and {{the differences in the}} <b>flocculating</b> effects of Ca and Mg. The CROSS of the dispersed soil solutions, from the differently treated soils of three soil types varying in clay content, mineralogy, and organic matter, was highly correlated with the amount of clay dispersed. The relation between CROSS and exchangeable cation ratio depended on soil type, and particularly organic matter and the content and mineralogy of clay. Threshold electrolyte concentration of the <b>flocculated</b> suspensions was significantly correlated with CROSS of the dispersed suspensions. The cationic <b>flocculating</b> charge of the <b>flocculated</b> suspensions, which incorporates the individual <b>flocculating</b> powers of the cations, was significantly correlated with CROSS. However, these types of relations will depend on several soil factors even within a given soil class.

2500|$|In oil-in-water {{emulsions}} such as mayonnaise, {{however, the}} continuous water phase freezes, allowing the oil droplets to <b>flocculate.</b> This process causes a phase {{separation between the}} water and the oil. Once ice crystals start to form in the continuous water phase, they begin to inhibit the lecithin and phospholipids from working. These two emulsifying agents lose their functionality due to dehydration: water is crystallizing out, leaving these agents [...] "out to dry." [...] The oil droplets begin to <b>flocculate</b> without the emulsifying agents keeping them separated. At the freezing point of water, this is enough to destabilize the mayonnaise emulsion; at even lower temperatures the fused oil droplets reach their freezing points and fat crystal nucleation begins. These processes make mayonnaise degrade when frozen and thawed; freezing is not a suitable way to store it.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, several novel cation-independent bioflocculants {{have been}} reported, which {{can avoid the}} {{secondary}} contamination caused by addition of cations. However, compared with cation-dependent bioflocculants, the <b>flocculating</b> mechanism of cation-independent bioflocculants is largely unknown. In this study, a cation-independent bioflocculant MBF-W 6 produced by Chryseobacterium daeguense W 6 {{was used as a}} model to investigate the <b>flocculating</b> mechanism. The results showed that the major <b>flocculating</b> component of MBF-W 6 is a complex of proteins and polysaccharides. The zeta potential results indicated that kaolin clay particles were not precipitated due to charge neutralization and the bridging mediated by cations did not {{play a major role in}} the <b>flocculating</b> process. These results are consistent with the fact that MBF-W 6 is a cation-independent bioflocculant. Further scanning electron microscopic observation showed that MBF-W 6 induced flocs formed tight packed structure, suggesting that the kaolin clay particles maybe directly attached and bridged by bioflocculant MBF-W 6. In addition, we also found out that Fe 3 + ions inhibit the <b>flocculating</b> activity of MBF-W 6 by affecting –COO− and –NH groups. Therefore this study can improve our understanding on <b>flocculating</b> mechanism of cation-independent bioflocculants...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{electrolyte}} concentration and pH on the settling behaviour, floc sizes and rheological behaviour of kaolinite suspensions were investigated.

Short-term tank experiments {{were conducted to}} determine the retention of nitrogen (N) from natural biota, dominated by <b>flocculated</b> particles, in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) at a high-intensity, zero-exchange shrimp farm in Central America (Belize Aquaculture (BAL)). There were two treatments: 'floc' and 'floc+ 20 %' (3 ױ 000 -l replicate tanks each) based on two densities of <b>flocculated</b> particles. The floc density in the 'floc' treatment was typical of shrimp growout ponds at BAL, whereas the 'floc+ 20 %' treatment had a 20 % higher density of <b>flocculated</b> particles.
