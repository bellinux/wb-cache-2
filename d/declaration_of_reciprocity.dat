40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 93 - 96). David Attwell, in {{the interview}} that prefaces "The Poetics of Reciprocity" section of Doubling the Point, identifies a recurrent concern with the function <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> {{in the work of}} J. M Coetzee. 1 "The I-You relation [...] . connects with larger things in the whole of [Coetzee's] work, what I would like to call broadly the poetics <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity.</b> " (Attwell 1992 : 58) This dissertation seeks to examine the poetics <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> as an aesthetic-ethical concern of Coetzee' s fiction. By establishing Coetzee's works as an extended critique <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> in their thematic and structural elements, this dissertation presents a notion <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> that acknowledges both an ethical imperative to engage with others and the aesthetic problems of depicting that ethical engagement in art. The aim of the dissertation is therefore to show the use of a poetics <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> in raising and examining particular ethical and aesthetic issues in Coetzee' s work...|$|R

40|$|Many {{legal systems}} foster metarules <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> to {{facilitate}} cooperative outcomes. This paper considers the role <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> rules in various strategic environments. We start {{by considering the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> constraints in a classic prisoners' dilemma with two symmetric parties and linear payoffs. We extend the analysis to continuous strategies and then further extend the basic model <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> to (a) asymmetric players and (b) nonlinear payoff functions. Then we examine the welfare properties of the reciprocity-induced equilibrium. In many game-theoretic situations, reciprocity constraints facilitate the achievement of cooperative outcomes. Yet the reciprocity-induced equilibrium is not always socially optimal. ...|$|R

50|$|The norm <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> {{requires}} that we repay in kind what another has done for us. It {{can be understood as}} the expectation that people will respond favorably to each other by returning benefits for benefits, and responding with either indifference or hostility to harms. The social norm <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> often takes different forms in different areas of social life, or in different societies. All of them, however, are distinct from related ideas such as gratitude, the Golden Rule, or mutual goodwill. See reciprocity (social and political philosophy) for an analysis of the concepts involved. The norm <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> mirrors the concept of reciprocal altruism in evolutionary biology. However, evolutionary theory and therefore sociobiology was not well received by mainstream psychologists. This led to the revitalisation of reciprocal altruism underneath the new social psychological concept, norm <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity.</b> Reciprocal altruism has been applied to various species, including humans, while mainstream psychologists use the norm <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> to only explain humans.|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} adopted {{in this paper}} is a concept of strong sustainability (Del Baldo et al., 2015) {{that is based on}} gratuity and reciprocity aspects (Bruni, 2008), in which the “intentions” are important in a first phase, but more important are actions concretely implemented. In the sustainability development process that are pursuing particularly the so-called “rich” countries, we want to understand how enterprises are implementing their business models using good praxis and not only general <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> intents. There are some enterprises that implemented new sustainable business models, such as: ethics finance, fair trade and economy of communion (Baldarelli, 2005; Baldarelli et al., 2015).

The study was conducted using a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach that involves different types of data (from interviews and egocentric networks) and different methods of data analysis.

40|$|Previous {{workplace}} {{research on}} narcissists has mainly {{focused on their}} performance or their role as leaders. However, {{little is known about}} their reaction to work stressors. The current study examined the moderating role of narcissism in the relationship between lack <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> (feeling under-benefited) and irritation. Based on the notion that narcissists have an inflated self-view and a sense of entitlement, we proposed that lack <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> would be positively related to irritation as an indicator of impaired well-being, and that the reaction to lack <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> <b>of</b> those scoring high on narcissism should be particularly strong. We tested these hypotheses in a cross-sectional study with two samples, the first consisting of 106 pilots in the Swiss air force and the second comprising 103 employees in various Swiss organizations. In line with our assumptions, lack <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> was positively related to irritation. Moreover, this relationship was stronger among participants who were high, as compared to low in narcissism. Practical implications of these results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: From the {{perspective}} of reciprocal altruism, we examined the role <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> in the close relationships of people inflicted with a spinal cord injury (SCI) (n = 70). We focused on the help receiver {{rather than on the}} help giver. Participants perceived more reciprocity in relationships with friends than in relationships with the partner and with family members. In these last relationships, perceptions of indebtedness were more prevalent than perceptions of deprivation. However, most negative feelings were evoked by a lack <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> in partner relationships, followed by family relationships, and next by friendships. Moreover, depression was especially associated with a lack <b>of</b> perceived <b>reciprocity</b> in the relationships with family, and somewhat less with a lack <b>of</b> perceived <b>reciprocity</b> in the relationship with the partner. These results underline the importance <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> in relationships, but suggest that reciprocity may be more, rather than less important in partner and family relationships...|$|R

The aim is to highlight the practices, relationships and reciprocity structures among fishermen by analyzing its implications for a more sustainable local/territorial development.

40|$|In the {{derivation}} of {{the equation}} for the flanking sound reduction index for EN 12354 - 1, reciprocity {{was used to remove}} the radiation efficiencies of the elements from the calculations. The exclusion of the radiation efficiencies was beneficial since they are often not known. However, the assumption <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> may only be applicable to the heavy monolithic constructions for which EN 12354 - 1 was intended. If EN 12354 - 1 is applied to lightweight constructions which may exhibit direction dependent sound transmission, the assumption <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> may contribute to an over prediction of the apparent sound reduction. A correction factor is proposed to correct for the over prediction due to the assumption <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity.</b> However, due to the inclusion of the radiation efficiencies in the correction factor, its use is limited. Alternatively, the correction factor may be used to estimate the error due to the assumption <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> so that the accuracy of the EN 12354 - 1 predictions can be assessed for lightweight constructions. ...|$|R
40|$|From a brief {{statement}} {{of the principles of}} the theory <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> in economic anthropology, this paper proposes a critical reading of the social and economic relations through the prism of market exchange. This view denies the existence of structuring relationships <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> in many economic activities sectors, including the case of rural Brazil which we focus on in this article. The design, development, implementation and evaluation of public policies for rural development are also constrained and formatted by an exclusive reading of development processes based on the principle of exchange. This only thought also applies to the critics of the system by political economy: ignoring the economics <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> it considers only the alienation of the market exchange system, namely the capitalist exploitation. The strength of alienation forms specific to reciprocity (particularly paternalistic oppression) is thus forgotten. These specific forms exist, for instance in Brazil, where the situation corresponds to a mixed system which combines exchange practices and practices <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
