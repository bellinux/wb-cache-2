We review the scientifi c background to the use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for ROP, highlight a number of design issues in the BEAT-ROP study and problems with interpretation of the results.

40|$|In the Netherlands between 179. 000 and 204. 000 {{children}} were born annually during the last ten years. Congenital anomalies occur in 1 in 33 births. Th e most frequent anomaly involves the heart with a prevalence of 1 in 150 births (66. 7 per 10. 000 births). Th e ventricular septal defects occur the most frequent (30. 0 per 10. 000 births) (Central Bureau of Statistics Netherlands, European Registration of Congenital Anomalies, National Neonatology Registration). A rare congenital anomaly is craniosynostosis, affecting 1 in 2. 500 births. Th e newborns cranial vault is composed of seven individual bones separated by sutures. Th is arrangement accommodates transient skull distortion during birth and permits future growth of the brain, the volume of which quadruples during the <b>fi</b> <b>rst</b> two years <b>of</b> life. Th ere are six major cranial sutures: the metopic, two coronal, the sagittal, and two lambdoid sutures. Six additional sutures are considered minor: two frontonasal, two temporosquamosal, and two frontosphenoidal. At the anterior of the skull, the sagittal, coronal, and metopic sutures meet to form the anterior fontanelle. Th e posterior fontanelle is formed by {{the intersection of the}} sagittal and lambdoid sutures. The sutures function as growth centres. In the center of a suture lie undiff erentiated, proliferating cells. A part of these cells undergo osteogenic diff erentiation and migrate to the borders of the bone sheets. After diff erentiation in osteoblasts growth of the sheets occurs by apposition. At two months of age, the posterior fontanelle closes, followed by anterior fontanelle closure at approximately two years of age.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Developmental {{coordination}} disorder (DCD) is {{impairment in}} motor coordination {{which can be}} manifested also by poor balance. Some childrenwith DCD can be more dependent on visual feedback to control their movements. This fact can result in disruption of predictive control, recognition of movement errors and correcting them. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the study was}} to compare foot pressure distribution and basic temporal and spatial variables during gait in the children with a risk of developmental defi ciency in balance and without motor diffi culties. METHODS: According to the results of the Test MABC- 2 (Movement Assessment Battery for Children) subjects were divided into two groups &# 8211; with the risk of developmental defi ciency in balance (rBAL) (n = 4, age 4. 0 &# 177; 1. 2 years, weight 18. 3 &# 177; 3. 5 kg, height 102. 9 &# 177; 10. 6 cm) and without motor diffi culties (KS) (n = 9, age 4. 4 &# 177; 1. 2, weight 17. 9 &# 177; 2. 9 kg, height 106. 4 &# 177; 7. 9 cm). Distribution of plantar pressure was detected by the Footscansystem (RSscan International, Olen, Belgium). Basic time and pressure variables were assessed in these areas: lateral and medial heel, 1 st&# 8211; 5 th metatarsal, midfoot and big toe and other toes. The gait was performed at self-selected speed, barefoot, three trials per child. Diff erences between groups were assessed by eff ect size &# 8211; Cohen&# 8217;s d. RESULTS: The medium eff ect was reported for pressure impulse in lateral heel, pressure peak in medial heel, pressure peak, pressure impulse and contact duration of 1 st metatarsal, contact duration in 4 th metatarsal and pressurepeak in area of 2 nd&# 8211; 5 th toe. Except for the pressure peak in the <b>fi</b> <b>rst</b> metatarsals, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the mentioned parameters were higher in the KS group. Generally, the foot pressure and foot contact in the rBAL group was smaller and shorter, so their steps were faster and diff erent from a normal gait performance. Large eff ect sizes were found for contact duration in the 1 st metatarsal and pressure peak in the 2 nd metatarsal. It means that the rBAL children had shorter <b>fi</b> <b>rst</b> metatarsal contact duration and produced higher pressure on 2 nd metatarsal than the KS children. Also, the step length of the rBAL group was less symmetric than in the KS group. The period of stance and double support was found similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results may indicate that as early as preschool age there could be discernible diff erences in some parameters of gait cycle between the typically developed children and children with delayed motor development...|$|R

Free and upon payment systems grew and are integrating the consolidated buy and own approach: Zipcar, Airbnb, Couchsurfi ng, Bookcrossing. These forms differ from traditional market transactions in many respects (Humphreys and Giesler 2007). For example, consumers often access goods, services, and information without purchasing or possessing them.

Bedtime was at around 22 : 00 and remained stable at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Approximately 20 % of the infants had more than 2 awakenings and slept more often in the parent bed. Nearly 10 % of the infants were considered as having a problematic sleep by parents and this signifi cantly correlated with nocturnal awakenings and diffi culties falling asleep. Conclusions: Sleep patterns change during the <b>fi</b> <b>rst</b> year <b>of</b> life but most sleep variables (i. e., sleep latency and duration) show little variation from 6 to 12 months. Our data provide a context for clinicians to discuss sleep issues with parents and suggest that prevention efforts should focus to the <b>fi</b> <b>rst</b> 3 - 6 months, since sleep patterns show stability from that time point to 12 months...|$|R
