5000|$|Pigment Yellow 16 is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that {{is classified as}} a <b>diarylide</b> <b>pigment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pigment Yellow 81 is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that {{is classified as}} a <b>diarylide</b> <b>pigment.</b> It {{is used as a}} yellow colorant.|$|E
50|$|These acetoacetamides are {{precursors}} to arylide {{yellow and}} <b>diarylide</b> <b>pigments.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Diarylide</b> <b>pigments</b> are organic {{compounds}} {{that are used}} as pigments in inks and related materials. They often are yellow or yellow-green. To some extent, these {{organic compounds}} have displaced cadmium sulfide from the market. They exist as yellow powders of low solubility in water.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diarylide</b> yellow <b>pigments</b> are {{considered}} to be non-toxic. However, {{there is some evidence that}} these pigments can break down when exposed to temperatures above 200 degrees C to release 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine, which is a carcinogen and is listed in the U.S. EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory. 3,3’-dichlorobenzidine is structurally similar to one of the polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, PCB 11 (3,3’-dichlorobiphenyl), and there is some evidence that the use of <b>diarylide</b> yellow <b>pigments</b> introduces PCB 11 to the environment.|$|R
50|$|Another commercially {{important}} {{class of}} coupling partners are acetoacetic amides, {{as illustrated by}} the preparation of Pigment Yellow 12, a <b>diarylide</b> <b>pigment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Arylide yellow, {{also known}} as Hansa yellow and monoazo yellow, are a family of organic {{compounds}} used as pigments. They are primarily used as industrial colorants including plastics, building paints and inks. They are also used in artistic oil paints, acrylics and watercolors. These pigments are usually semi-transparent yellows and yellow-greens. Related organic <b>pigments</b> are the <b>diarylide</b> <b>pigments.</b> Overall, these pigments have partially displaced the toxic cadmium yellow in the marketplace. Painters such as Alexander Calder and Jackson Pollock {{are known to have}} employed arylide yellow in their artworks.|$|R
5000|$|... 3,3-Dichlorobenzidine is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (C6H3Cl(NH2))2. The pure compound is pale yellow, but commercial samples are often colored. It is barely {{soluble in water}} and is often supplied as a wet paste. It is widely used {{in the production of}} diarylide dyes and <b>diarylide</b> yellow <b>pigments</b> used in the production of printing inks.|$|R
50|$|The diarylide yellows are {{the most}} common yellow {{pigments}} used in printing as well as a wide variety of other applications. Due to their stability, diarylide yellows are used in inks, coatings, and as plastic colorants. The pigment is insoluble. It is a standard pigment used in printing ink and packaging industry. The <b>diarylide</b> yellow <b>pigment</b> Yellow 12 is one of the three main colored pigments used in the four color process of color printing. As such, its use is ubiquitous in printing both in commercial applications and in home color printers, as well as in textile printing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{molecular}} {{structures of}} these molecules is more conjugated than {{represented in the}} images shown below. [...] The pigments' colors can range from yellow to green. One {{of the most common}} diarlyide yellow pigments is Pigment Yellow 12. Its CAS number is [...] Other <b>diarylide</b> yellow <b>pigments</b> include ‘’’yellow 13’’’ [...] , ‘’’yellow 17’’’ [...] and ‘’’yellow 83’’’ [...] These pigments share the same backbone and vary in color depending on substitution of the benzene rings. Worldwide production of color organic pigments was estimated to be about 250,000 metric tons (t) in 2006, with about 25%, or 62,500 t, being diarylide yellows.|$|R
40|$|A non-Aroclor PCB congener, 3, 3 '-dichlorobiphenyl (PCB 11) has {{recently}} attracted wide concerns {{because of its}} environmental ubiquity and specific sources potentially associated with yellow pigment production. In order to investigate PCB 11 and other PCBs in the yellow pigment products, 24 yellow pigment samples were collected from three different manufacturing plants in China. Sigma(20) PCBs and PCB 11 were {{in the range of}} 50. 7 - 9. 19 x 10 (5) ng g(- 1) and 41. 7 - 9. 18 x 10 (5) ng g(- 1), respectively, which was much higher than those reported in previous study. The corresponding TEQ values ranged between 0. 16 and 4. 21 x 10 (3) ng WHO 2005 -TEQ kg(- 1). The contribution of PCB 11 to Sigma(20) PCBs reached up to 85. 5 % (median value) followed by PCB 28, PCB 77, and PCB 52 with contributions of 10. 5 %, 6. 70 %, and 5. 40 %, respectively. Significant differences were observed for PCB 11 concentrations among the different types of yellow pigment from the same plant and among the same sample types from different plants. The PCB 11 concentrations in <b>diarylide</b> yellow <b>pigments</b> produced from 3, 3 '-dichlorbenzidine were the highest in all the samples. It demonstrates that yellow pigment is a significant source not only for the widespread pollution of PCB 11 but also for other PCBs, especially for the lower chlorinated congeners.
