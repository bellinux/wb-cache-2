50|$|Caragana {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} <b>dark</b> <b>dagger.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{species has}} grey {{forewings}} with bold black dagger-shaped markings. (The Latin specific name also refers to these markings, as resembling the Greek letter psi ψ.) The hindwings are dirty grey, generally paler in the male. The wingspan is 34-45 mm. This moth {{is very similar}} to the <b>dark</b> <b>dagger</b> (Acronicta tridens) and identification is generally only possible by minute examination of the genitalia. However, in general this moth is generally darker in colour than the <b>dark</b> <b>dagger</b> and always lacks the white hindwings often present in the male of that species. The grey dagger flies at night from June to August [...] and is attracted to light and sometimes to sugar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dark</b> <b>dagger</b> (Acronicta tridens) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is {{distributed}} throughout Europe (from southern Fennoscandia to the Balkans and Italy), Turkey, the Near East, the European part of Russia, southern Siberia, the Ural, the Russian Far East (Primorye, southern Khabarovsk, southern Amur region and Sakhalin), the Korean Peninsula, China and Japan (Hokkaido).|$|E

25|$|Six {{weeks after}} the group entered Camelot, they awaken in Granny's Diner, back in Storybrooke, where they are wearing Arthurian attire. However, they also find that their memory ends with them {{entering}} Camelot. To make matters worse, Emma has embraced the darkness, acquired the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>Dagger,</b> and vows revenge against the others for failing her.|$|R
50|$|Rumplestiltskin's name {{is fading}} from the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger,</b> {{signifying}} that Gold is dying. Since Gold's death {{would cause the}} Dark One's powers to cease to exist, Cora decides her only option is to kill Gold with the dagger and become the Dark One herself. Regina questions Cora's motives, as Henry would never forgive them if Cora openly murders Emma Swan's family. Cora insists she is protecting their family.|$|R
50|$|The larva is whitish {{below and}} black above with red spots and a bold yellow stripe along the back. It has a {{distinctive}} horn {{just behind the}} head (absent from the larva of <b>dark</b> <b>dagger).</b> It feeds {{on a wide range}} of plants, mainly trees and shrubs (see list below). The species overwinters as a pupa.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species has}} grey {{forewings}} marked with bold black [...] "daggers". The hindwings {{of the males}} are white, those of the females dirty grey. The wingspan is 35-43 mm. Adults of this species are extremely similar to the grey dagger (Acronicta psi). Despite the common name, the <b>dark</b> <b>dagger</b> is usually the paler of the two species and the white hindwings of the male are usually diagnostic. However, the only reliable way of distinguishing adults of the two species is by examination of the genitalia. The larvae, however, are very different (see below). This species flies at night in June and July [...] and is attracted to light and sometimes to sugar.|$|E
25|$|King Arthur {{and two of}} his knights, Sir Lancelot and Sir Percival, {{arrive to}} the {{location}} of the stone in which Excalibur is embedded. Sir Kay has found it first and as he tries to pull the sword out, he is turned to ash. Despite this, Arthur proceeds with his mission and manages to successfully pull the sword out, only to discover that the tip is missing. He vows to seek out the missing piece, which is revealed to be the blade of the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>Dagger.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Though the Camelot arc isn't {{the most}} {{compelling}} yet, the Storybrooke crew is fitting into it nicely. Arthur's story isn't taking over, and the Excalibur and <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger</b> connection means Emma and co. are thoroughly involved. The introduction of the sand from Avalon and seeing Arthur's true nature is {{opening the door to}} understanding why Emma embraced evil. They're doing a suitable job of planting those seeds; there's just enough information to start theorizing about Emma's decision." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 6.6 rating out of 10.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next day}} Emma {{continues}} her investigation by confronting Sidney (Giancarlo Esposito) with the bug she {{found in his}} flowers. When Sidney tries to defend Regina, Emma realizes he does her bidding because he {{is in love with}} her. Mr. Gold breaks into August's motel room and discovers a drawing of The <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger.</b> This raises his concern that the writer might want to kill him. Mr. Gold follows August and discovers him talking with Mother Superior (Tracy). He demands to know what August wanted and she answers only that August asked for advice on reconnecting with his long estranged father. David finally catches up with Mary Margaret and apologizes profusely for doubting her innocence, but she is still hurt deeply by it.|$|R
50|$|In the Enchanted Forest a year earlier, Belle and Neal {{talk about}} Rumplestilskin as they search for clues in his castle {{on how to}} find him. As they enter the library to check for any evidence, a voice starts calling for the two, and a face of flame in a {{candelabra}} is revealed to be Lumiere, who tells them Rumplestiltskin had him entrapped in this form as punishment. He directs them to a key with a triangular sign on it, which opens the vault where the first <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger</b> was made. A curious Neal agrees to use it, then blows Lumiere's candles out with Belle carrying it to the destination in the forest. Unbeknownst to Neal and Belle, Zelena enters the library, and is pleased that they fell for her trap using Lumiere as her minion, believing {{that they are not}} as smart as they think.|$|R
50|$|Hook steals Belle {{away from}} a date with Will Scarlet and tells her his suspicions that the Queens are after the <b>Dark</b> One’s <b>dagger</b> and plan {{to use it to}} force the Dark One to find the Author. The twosome agree to hide the dagger, but Belle has a strange feeling that Gold is already in Storybrooke, so Hook {{suggests}} that she try to conjure him. Belle uses the dagger to try to summon Gold, but he does not appear, and she gives the dagger to Hook and leaves. However, it is revealed that Belle calling the Dark One to her did not work because Gold was already there, masquerading as Hook in an attempt to acquire the dagger. Gold, as Hook, goes to the pawn shop to make Belle promise to never mention the events that transpired with the dagger, to which she agrees, believing it to be the safest option. He then questions her about her relationship with Will. She responds that she could never be truly over Gold but that Will makes her happy for the time being.|$|R
50|$|Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{is upset}} that Henry has left town with Emma and Gold, but Cora (Barbara Hershey) reassures her that Henry {{is safe and}} will return. Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) wants to pursue and kill Gold, who is {{vulnerable}} without his magic, but Cora instead asks his help in locating the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger,</b> which {{will enable them to}} kill Gold in Storybrooke. Regina visits Belle (Emilie de Ravin) in the hospital; upon determining that Belle doesn't remember anything useful, Regina magically renders her unconscious and levitates the contents of her purse, locating a note with a Dewey decimal number. This leads Regina, Cora, and Hook to a map hidden on a bookshelf in the library. Hook deciphers the map, but Cora then attacks him magically and knocks him unconscious, her use for him at an end. She reveals to Regina that her plan is for them to use the dagger to command Gold to kill Mary Margaret, David, and Emma, leaving Regina blameless in Henry's eyes.|$|R
50|$|Ruby visits Belle in the {{hospital}} but is disappointed that she doesn't remember who she is. When Belle recalls Rumple healing her wound with magic, as well as making a fireball to throw at Hook, Ruby acts as though Belle isn't making any sense. Belle knows what she saw though, sending her into a frenzy, thus forcing the need {{for her to be}} sedated. She later finds that she isn't alone in her beliefs, for she is approached by Greg Mendell (Ethan Embry) who reveals that he saw the same thing. With Regina and Cora now conspiring together, Regina visits Belle in {{the hospital}} in order to find details on where Rumple's <b>Dark</b> One <b>dagger</b> is located. Rumple is later poisoned with Dreamshade by Hook, and on his deathbed Rumple calls Belle at the hospital in order to speak to her one last time, telling her that although she cannot remember it, she is a hero. Their call ends, but Rumple is cured when Mary Margaret sacrifices Cora's life for Rumple's.|$|R
2500|$|Six weeks later, {{the rest}} of her friends {{returned}} to Storybrooke, but with a horrifying and shocking twist, their memories were wiped out once again and wearing Arthurian attires. As it turned out Emma made an appearance as the Dark One, with her new attire. Henry asks what happened to her, and she told them that they all went to Camelot to remove the darkness from her and they all failed (except Henry). Emma with her powers turned Sneezy into stone, proclaiming that there's no savior in the town. Emma surprisingly gave the <b>Dark</b> One <b>dagger</b> to Regina with the intention that if she goes too dark Regina would be the only one that would willingly [...] "put her down." [...] Shortly after this, Hook attempts true love's kiss with Emma in the hopes that the Dark One's curse would break, but ultimately failed, as Emma has fully embraced the darkness. Unbeknownst to the others, Emma currently has possession of the Excalibur in a locked room inside of her new house. She intends to make Excalibur and the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger</b> whole again, as with it she will be able to snuff out the light forever and become invulnerable. However, she must recruit a hero to do so, as she cannot remove the sword; the hero she chooses is her predecessor Rumplestiltskin, who she tells finally has a chance to become a hero. She planned to siphon the darkness out of both of them and put it Zelena, who she forced into an accelerated labor to avoid killing Robin's child, and slay her. She regains her memories of what Hook plans, by resurrecting all the Dark Ones as part of his revenge. At first, Emma plans to absorb all the darkness inside her and kill herself. Things do not go according to plan when Hook steals it from her. Killian orders her to kill him, taking in all the darkness and Emma slays him with Excalibur while the darkness is removed from her, reverting to her old self. After blackmailing Mr. Gold for tricking her and Hook into making him the Dark One again, she and her friends and family descend into the Underworld to find Hook and plans to split her heart in half and share it with him like her parents.|$|R

50|$|Rumplestilskin {{encounters}} {{a form of}} Belle frequently in Neverland as an illusion {{to act as a}} crutch to his cowardliness; she is later revealed as his father Peter Pan's shadow in disguise. In Storybrooke, Belle helps Ariel retrieve Pandora's Box to send to the heroes in Neverland as a method to defeat Peter Pan. Belle and Rumple are reunited when the group returns to Storybrooke after retrieving Henry, though Gold soon sacrifices himself to kill his father and save Belle and the others. However, Pan's curse remains and Belle, along with the other inhabitants are sent back to their original worlds. In the Enchanted Forest, Belle and Neal travel to the Dark One's vault. To the disapproval of Belle, Neal ignores the possible repercussions and unlocks the vault, resurrecting Rumplestiltskin but sacrificing himself. Belle is returned to Storybrooke when Snow and Charming enact a new curse to stop Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West, from taking their baby. In Storybrooke, Belle mourns Neal's death and eventually discovers Zelena's plan to change the past. She also discovers that Zelena is in possession of the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger</b> and therefore is keeping Rumple captive and under her control. Upon Zelena's defeat at Regina's hand, Mr. Gold proposes to Belle after entrusting her with his dagger (though unknown to her, it is a replica) and the two are married at the wishing well.|$|R

25|$|That night, {{the people}} of Storybrooke are all celebrating at Granny's diner. Lily tells Emma {{that she wants to}} find the {{identity}} of her father and plans on staying in Storybrooke during her search. Belle shows up to tell everyone that the last bit of humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer’s Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>Dagger,</b> and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|R

The Snow Queen enacts the spell of Shattered Sight to make everyone kill each other; however, she is given a letter written by Elsa and Anna's mother that shows how much she was loved.

Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to [...] "do what is necessary" [...] to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of [...] "weakness," [...] but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories.

Mary Margaret finds David there and revives him, informing him of Regina's duplicity. They resolve to find the dagger first, and Mary Margaret decides to try to drive a wedge between Regina and Cora. She meets with Regina and reveals what she knows, warning her that Cora doesn't care about Regina or Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), but Regina dismisses her. Mary Margaret and David ask Mother Superior for help finding the dagger, but a protection spell over Gold's shop prevents her from learning anything.

Just after they retrieve it, Regina and Cora appear. They summon Johanna and Regina rips her heart out and demands the dagger. When Cora taunts Mary Margaret over her mother's hopes that she would always be good, Mary Margaret realizes that her private conversation with the Blue Fairy had really been with Cora and that Cora murdered her mother.

Henry going to school, Mary Margaret goes back to teaching, Regina resumes being Mayor of Storybrooke and Emma Swan continues her job as Sheriff and her growing relationship with Hook. During the six weeks, Hook and Belle have been working together attempting to find a solution to liberate the fairies from Sorcerer's hat, they talk about their feelings towards Gold and their lives as they attempt to move on from what Gold did to them. Finding a solution, the two visit Regina and Emma in Regina's office, where Regina talks about the torn page of her and Robin Hood embracing after Emma finds it in a drawer. Hook informs the two that they managed to get a professor to translate a counter spell to free the fairies from the hat, but only Regina can enact it. When the foursome, along with Mary Margaret, return to the woods, Regina uses the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger</b> to release the fairies. Unfortunately, just seconds after the fairies are freed, the hat releases a thick, black smoke that begins to ooze out, floating into the sky and forming the shape of the winged demon Chernabog, and starts flying away. As the town, save for a remorseful Hook, celebrates the fairies' return, Regina asks the Mother Superior about the author. She responds that the author and sorcerer are two different people and that the author had left behind clues to his identity in his works. The celebration is interrupted by earthquake-like thunder and strange cries. The people rush outside to find Chernabog perched on the clock tower. Realizing he must have been released from the hat, Emma asks if they can capture him again but Belle tells her that because he was released from the hat, he can not be placed back in. Emma and Regina attempt to use their magic to destroy the demon but quickly discover all they can do is temporarily repel it.|$|R
5000|$|Later at the street, Regina {{wakes up}} and says she knows {{what must be done}} to stop the Curse, however, Pan shows up to {{retrieve}} the scroll and freezes all of them. Pan decides to take out his grandson Neal, only to be thwarted by Gold, who shows up to stop him. After vowing to Neal and Belle that he is finally ready to pay the price to keep them safe knowing that means killing himself, Gold's shadow appears, carrying the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>Dagger</b> and hands it to Gold, and stabs both Pan and himself at the same time. Pan transforms back into Malcolm, who urges Gold to stop before it is too late, but Gold tells his father [...] "Ah but, I am a villain and villains don't get happy endings." [...] He twists the knife and both men vanish in a burst of light. As Belle cries after they disappear, Neal asks a hesitant Regina if {{there is a way to}} stop the Curse, to which Regina reveals that the only way to stop it is to give up the one thing she loved the most: Henry. As the Curse approaches, Regina tells Emma that she and Henry will have to leave Storybrooke forever because once the Curse takes place everyone will return to the Enchanted Forest and since Henry was born in the Land Without Magic, he won't be able to go back with them, but Emma will be able to stay with him because she's the savior and the only one who can escape it. As everyone says goodbye to Emma and Henry, Regina gives the two a spell that will give them good memories but they will not remember the events that broke the Curse in the first place. As Emma and Henry drive away, Regina destroys the scrolls as the Curse consumes everyone and Storybrooke disappears.|$|R
50|$|After {{this time}} period, the curse's power begins to weaken and time {{begins to move}} forward again.

However, while aboard the Nautilus, Hook learns that Nemo's first mate {{is none other than}} his {{half-brother}} Liam. Upon learning Hook is responsible for their father's death, Liam tries to kill the pirate, but ultimately shoots Nemo instead. Hoping to save Nemo, Liam travels to the Mysterious Island, where time stands still, and Hook returns to the Jolly Roger to wait {{out the rest of the}} curse. After the curse has broken completely, Hook encounters Emma Swan and Snow White in the Enchanted Forest. Working with Aurora and Mulan, Emma and Snow counter Hook and Cora's attempts to follow them into Storybrooke. However, Hook had captured a magic bean from a giant he and Swan encountered previously, a bean which is used to carry him and Cora into Storybrooke. While in Storybrooke, Hook confronts Rumplestiltskin (known in this land as Mr. Gold) and robs him from his chance to return to his son. After he is thwarted by Belle and Gold, he tracks them down at the town line and shoots Belle. Belle falls across the town's border and loses her memory again. After he is betrayed by Regina and Cora (who decide to use the <b>Dark</b> One's <b>dagger</b> for themselves), Hook flees into the Land Without Magic and strikes Gold with dreamshade, the same poison which killed his brother. After realizing that Gold's life was spared in a deal made with Snow White, Hook agrees to work with Greg Mendell and Tamara, two of Pan's agents. Per their plan, he forges an alliance with Regina, then betrays her, so they can capture her. However, upon realizing that Greg and Tamara's plan would involve his death and the deaths of everyone else in Storybrooke, Hook betrays them and allies with his former enemies. Though he originally attempted to do the honorable thing and help save the town, when the plan offered by the townspeople seems to have little hope of success, he steals the magic bean to use for himself. However, upon learning of Baelfire's supposed death, he returns to honor his memory. Afterward, he journeys with Gold, Regina, and the heroes to Neverland to rescue Henry.|$|R

This distracted Zelena long enough for Regina to put a magical binding cuff to her sisters wrist. Zelena travels with the heroes to Camelot in search of Emma, after becoming the Dark One. She is told {{to pretend to be}} Reginas mute handmaiden (Regina having taken her voice). In Camelot, Zelena is threatened by Regina that her baby will be taken by Regina once it has been born.

Zelena is met by the Dark Swan (name for Emma as the Dark One) and is told she will need an ally in the town after people learn the truth. Zelena eats darkly enchanted onion rings (made by Emma) and as a result, her pregnancy is sped up from two months to nine. She gives birth to a baby girl and is taken away by Emma into her basement with Hook at her side. She is freed from her cuff once again and leaves Hook in Emmas house, wanting to get answers. Zelena steps back inside after Emma finds him. She brings in an enchanted dreamcatcher, which holds the memories of Hook becoming a Dark One (it is Emmas fault) in order to save him. Zelena learns that Robin and Regina are allowing her to see her baby, as long as one of them is with her. This is when she shares a bonding moment with her child. During the Dark Siege of Storybrooke, Zelena plans to take Reginas place in Storybrooke including her office. After claiming full custody of her baby, Zelena is transported by Regina (and the Apprentices Wand) back to Oz. She claimed they will see each other again. , , , , , , , , ...|$|R
