50|$|The {{preferred}} prevention strategy involves <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> {{to eliminate}} noise sources. Administrative controls and hearing protection {{can also be}} used when <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are not feasible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> is {{the third}} of {{five members of the}} {{hierarchy}} of hazard controls, which orders control strategies by their feasibility and effectiveness. <b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are preferred over administrative controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) because they are designed to remove the hazard at the source, before it comes in contact with the worker. Well-designed <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings {{in other areas of the}} process.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are {{strategies}} {{designed to}} protect workers from hazardous conditions by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard or by removing a hazardous substance through air ventilation. [...] <b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> involve a physical change to the workplace itself, {{rather than relying on}} workers' behavior or requiring workers to wear something.|$|R
25|$|Perceptual {{control theory}} (PCT) is a {{psychological}} theory of animal and human behavior originated by William T. Powers. In contrast with other theories {{of psychology and}} behavior, which assume that behavior {{is a function of}} perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with <b>engineering</b> <b>control</b> theory, the reference variable for each negative feedback control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the setpoint of the controller. PCT also applies to nonliving autonomic systems.|$|E

2500|$|Systems {{engineering}} is an interdisciplinary field {{of engineering and}} engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles. At its core systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. [...] Issues such as requirements engineering, , logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing <b>engineering,</b> <b>control</b> engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, organizational studies and project management. [...] Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are {{physical}} {{changes to the}} workplace that isolate workers from hazards by containing them in an enclosure, or removing contaminated air from the workplace through ventilation and filtering. They are used when hazardous substances and processes cannot be eliminated or replaced with less hazardous substitutes. The types of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> optimal for each situation {{is influenced by the}} quantity and dustiness of the material as well as the duration of the task. Well-designed <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are typically passive, in the sense of being independent of worker interactions, which reduces the potential for worker behavior to impact exposure levels. The initial cost of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> can be higher than administrative controls or personal protective equipment, but the long-term operating costs are frequently lower and can sometimes provide cost savings {{in other areas of the}} process.|$|R
25|$|Use <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> (such {{as water}} or ventilation) to limit worker {{exposure}} to the PEL; provide respirators when <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> cannot adequately limit exposure; limit worker access to high exposure areas; develop a written exposure control plan, offer medical exams to highly exposed workers, and train workers on silica risks and how to limit exposures.|$|R
40|$|A {{convenience}} {{survey of}} 702 certified pesticide applicators {{was conducted in}} three states to assess the use of 16 types of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> and 13 types of personal protective equipment (PPE). Results showed that 8 out of 16 engineering devices were adopted by more than 50 % of the respondents. The type of crop, size of agricultural operation, {{and the type of}} pesticide application equipment were found to influence the adoption of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls.</b> Applicators working on large farms, users of boom and hydraulic sprayers, and growers of field crops were more likely to use engineering devices. Respondents reported a high level of PPE use, with chemical-resistant gloves showing the highest level of compliance. An increase in pesticide applicators wearing appropriate headgear was reported. The majority of respondents did not wear less PPE simply because they used <b>engineering</b> <b>controls.</b> Those who did modify their PPE choices when employing <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> used tractors with enclosed cabs and/or were vegetable growers...|$|R
