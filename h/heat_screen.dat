FritzWheat is {{increasing}} in importance {{as the global}} population rises; therefore, abiotic stresses adversely affecting wheat yield, such as heat stress, are of growing concern. Accessions of Aegilops speltoides, a relative of the ancestral donor of the B genome of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), have been determined to be highly heat tolerant. Six Ae. speltoides accessions were used as male donors in crosses with six hexaploid wheat lines, in all combinations, to obtain F 1 amphiploid seed (ABDS = 28 chromosomes). The F 1 seedlings were treated with a colchicine solution to achieve chromosome doubling (AABBDDSS = 56 chromosome doubled amphiploids) and grown out to maturity. S 1 seed was collected for optimal or heat treatment after anthesis and SPAD readings were taken daily during treatment until maturity. In addition to physiological measurements, leaf tissue samples were collected from S 1 plants and their respective parents for marker sequence analysis. Certain doubled amphiploids survived longer in heat treatment than their wheat parents with similar SPAD readings, but had a longer maturation time, similar to their Ae. speltoides parents. S 2 seed was collected from 20 S 1 plants, including one plant from the heat treatment.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to analyze the stresses experienced by radiation and <b>heat</b> <b>screens</b> similar to those installed at nuclear power plants. This type of design, also known as "the dry protection" is designated to reduce the effects of radiation and heat emitted by the reactor. The authors have considered the axis-symmetric problem resolved through the employment of the variational difference method. The {{solution to the problem}} is composed of several steps. The first step represents the distribution of the temperature field over the thickness of the screen. The second step represents the distribution of the neutron flux in the thick screen. The third stage represents the change in the Young's modulus due to thermal and radiation effects. The fourth stage is the immediate determination of stresses in the thick screen. The authors have proven that the combined effect of radiation and thermal stresses produced on the Young's modulus causes substantial voltage change in the thickness of the cylinder, whereas the solution that assumes a constant value of the Young's modulus is less accurate. The aforementioned phenomenon suggests that no changes in physical and mechanical properties of materials can be neglected, whenever structures exposed to several supplementary (temperature, radiation exposure, etc.) loads are analyzed.
