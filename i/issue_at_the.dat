5|$|A {{fair and}} {{efficient}} imposition of subsidies for renewable energies and aiming at sustainable development, however, require coordination and regulation at a global level, as subsidies granted {{in one country}} can easily disrupt industries and policies of others, thus underlining the relevance of this <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Organization.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{time was}} the protective tariff. While {{it had not been}} a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E

Even with the softer tyre choice, tyre degradation was not an <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> event, with drivers able to record fast lap times all through the race on a one-stop strategy.|$|E

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heart of the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was {{not covered by the}} environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Montreal-based {{publisher}} Drawn and Quarterly {{began with}} an anthology title also named Drawn and Quarterly. It quickly picked up {{a number of other}} titles, such as Julie Doucet's semi-autobiographical, bilingual Dirty Plotte, which, like Yummy Fur, had started out as a minicomic; Seth's Palookaville; illegal resident from the US Joe Matt's Peepshow; and Yummy Fur, which made the jump with its twenty-fifth <b>issue.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, an autobiographical comics trend took place. Brown, Seth and Matt in particular were thought of as a Toronto comics rat pack, depicting one another in their comics and doing signings and interviews together.|$|E
5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not realize it was an <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|The first Springbok colours {{were created}} in 1906 during the 1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour of the Northern Hemisphere as none had been {{provided}} for them and the captain Paul Roos decided that the team need {{to create their own}} emblem and nickname to prevent the British press creating one for them. Using the guidelines that the director of the South African Rugby Board (SARB) had given for the playing kit of myrtle green jerseys and a gold collar, Roos instructed that a green blazer with gold piping and a Springbok emblem on the breast pocket would be made for the team in Richmond. Despite this, not many colours were made as they were not standard <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Later on they became standard issue for all sportsmen representing South Africa internationally but primarily was used by rugby union as the creators.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} was bimonthly until the March 1954 issue, which {{was followed by}} April 1954, inaugurating a monthly period that ran until June 1955. This was followed by August 1955, resuming a bimonthly schedule that ran until July 1964, with only one irregularity, when the February 1959 issue was followed by July 1959. After July 1964, If ran a monthly schedule until April 1970, with three omissions: there were no issues dated September 1964, June 1969, or August 1969. From May–June 1970, the issues were bimonthly and bore the names of two months. This bimonthly sequence ran through the last <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1974. The date the magazine printed on the cover reverted to a single month with the June 1971 issue, though the contents page still used two months to identify the issue. The volume numbering began with six issues to a volume: there were three errors on the magazine contents page, with volume 8 number 1 incorrectly printed as volume 7 number 6; volume 9 number 3 printed as volume 8 number 6; and volume 10 number 1 printed as volume 10 number 6.

25|$|Discipline {{and student}} {{behavior}} {{was a major}} <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university almost from the day it opened.

To combat the severe discipline problem, president Landon Garland lobbied and received approval from the legislature in 1860 to transform the university into a military school.|$|E
