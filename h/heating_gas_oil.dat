40|$|Reduction of {{sulphur content}} in diesel to near zero levels plays a {{significant}} role for improving air quality. Hydrodesulphurization is the most developed desulphurization technology today. However meeting the 10 ppm sulphur limit in the diesel fuel requires expensive revamps of the existing hydrotreating units or building of new grass root units. This specification also necessitates running the units at higher severity which is related to higher energy consumption and higher amount of emissions of CO 2 release in the atmosphere. Extraction of sulphur and aromatic compounds from the middle distillates offers another opportunity for desulphurization and dearomatization of diesel fractions at low temperatures without participation of hydrogen. This process allows a substantial reduction in the energy consumption. It was found in this study that by extraction of <b>heating</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> and hydrotreated diesel with the selective solvents, methanol, furfural, and ethylene glycol the sulphur content could be reduced sevenfold and the aromatics content threefold respectively. The extraction of the sulphur compounds from the hydrotreated diesel was about 40 % more efficient than that of the <b>heating</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> while the extraction of the aromatics from the hydrotreated diesel was twice as high as that from the <b>heating</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil.</b> This indicates that the chemical nature of the middle distillate fractions plays {{a significant role}} on the efficiency of the extraction process...|$|E
40|$|A {{major part}} of urban traffic in many European cities is due to {{diesel-powered}} vehicles, which occasionally, albeit illegally, run on <b>heating</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> rather than the more expensive road diesel; this practice is no doubt abetted {{by the fact that}} the properties of the two fuels are quite similar. The purpose of the work described in this paper was to look into the possibility of altering the properties of heating oil so as to make it less desirable as a diesel fuel but without adverse environmental effects. Tests were run with two diesel-powered vehicles and a domestic boiler and included measurements of emissions of smoke, carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and boiler thermal efficiency. Smoke opacity of diesel exhaust was found to have an almost linear relationship with many of the basic interrelated properties (cetane number, viscosity, density) of fuels with similar distillation characteristics, whereas the presence of heavier components tended to increase smoke. Addition of aromatic oxygenates (cresols) reduced the cetane number of diesel fuel but at the same time reduced smoke and NOx in diesel exhaust; the same materials appeared to enhance the thermal efficiency of the boiler and lower its smoke emissions, while slightly increasing the emitted NO. © 1994 American Chemical Society...|$|E

IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE EXPERIMENTS, A MEASURING FACILITY INCLUDING A HONDA GASOLINE ENGINE, A PETTER DIESEL ENGINE AND THE PROPER EXHAUST ANALYSERS WAS SET UP AT THE LABORATORY OF FUELS TECHNOLOGY AND LUBRICANTS OF NTUA. THEHEATING OIL MEASUREMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT THE DIN STANDARDISED FACILITY OFTHE LABORATORY OF STEAM ENGINES AND POWER OF NTUA. IN THE CASE OF MOTOR GASOLINE, THE EXPERIMENTS INCLUDED A TYPICAL GREEK PREMIUM LEADED GASOLINE, AND TWOREFORMULATED WITH 2 % AND 10 % RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS SHOWED A DECREASE IN CARBON MONOXIDE AND HYDROCARBONS EMISSIONS, AND A SMALL INCREASE IN NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSIONS AND FUEL CONSUMPTION. IN THE CASE OF AUTOMOTIVE DIESEL, A MATRIX OF FUELS WITH DIFFERENT PROPERTIES WAS EMPLOYED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PROPERTIES AFFECTING EMISSIONS,ARE CETANE NUMBER AND DENSITY. THESE TWO PROPERTIES CORRELATE WELL WITH CARBON MONOXIDE AND HYDROCARBONS EMISSIONS. NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSIONS CORRELATE ADDITIONALLY WITH 90 % POINT RECOVERY TEMPERATURE (T 90).

[...] The Kiviter retort is a vertical cylindrical vessel that heats coarse oil shale with recycled gases, steam, and air. [...] To supply <b>heat,</b> <b>gases</b> (including produced <b>oil</b> shale <b>gas)</b> and carbonaceous spent residue are burnt within the retort. Raw oil shale is fed {{into the top of}} the retort, and is heated by the rising gases, which pass laterally through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. Pyrolysis is completed in the lower section of the retort, where the spent shale contacted with more hot gas, steam and air is heated to about [...] to gasify and burn the residual carbon (char). Shale oil vapors and evolving gases are delivered to a condensing system, where condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gases are fed back to the retort. Recycled gas enters the bottom of the retort and cools the spent shale, which then leaves the retort through a water-sealed discharge system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Households consume direct energy, using natural <b>gas,</b> <b>heating</b> <b>oil,</b> {{gasoline}} and electricity, and consume indirect energy, the energy {{related to the}} production of goods and the delivery of services for the households. Past trends and present-day household energy use (direct and indirect) are analysed and described. A comparison of these findings with objectives concerning ecological sustainability demonstrates that present-day household energy use is not sustainable. A scenario towards sustainable household energy use is designed containing far-reaching measures with regard to direct energy use. Scenario evaluation shows a substantial reduction of direct energy use; however, this is not enough to meet the sustainability objectiv es. Based on these results, the possibilities and the limitations are discussed to enable households to make their direct and indirect energy use sustainable on the long run...|$|R

Of particular importance is their application for remote monitoring of various objects and processes in natural, technical, environmental, medical, military and other systems [8, 9].

The interest-adjusted basis and expected returns for crude <b>oil,</b> natural <b>gas,</b> <b>heating</b> <b>oil,</b> gasoline, and propane are estimated {{in relation to}} proxies {{for the state of}} the economy, inventory and other determinants predicted by the theory of storage over the period 1987 - 2011. We find that the energy bases and returns over three-month horizon have a business cycle pattern. Consistent with the theory of storage, demand shocks near business cycle peaks generate negative interest-adjusted bases and the positive returns. In recessions the bases become positive and the returns tend to be negative. The inventory is an important predictor for petroleum interest-adjusted bases when the physical stock is low, while its impact on the basis is small and insignificant when inventory is high. In turn, energy bases and economic conditions are informative about expected returns, and they can be used to predict energy future spot prices...|$|R

Although the differences of the two models are minimal, it is up to a decision maker as to which model to choose.
