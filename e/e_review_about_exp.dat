40|$|A {{large body}} of {{experimental}} evidence indicates that over-activation of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors may mediate irreversible neuronal injury {{in a variety of}} pathologic settings including cerebral ischemia, and that the developing brain may be par-ticularly susceptible to the adverse effects of EAA receptor overactivation. In this article, w <b>e</b> <b>review</b> current information <b>about</b> EAA receptor pharmaco-logy and EAA neurotoxicity in the immature brain, and summarize recent experimental data indicating that EAA contribute to the pathogenesis of perina-tal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. introduction In the last decade, several seminal observations have provided support for the hypothesis that endoge-nous excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmitters (e. g., glutamic acid) {{play a major role in}} the pathge-nesis of hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury. In vitro, in cultured hippocampal neurons, Rothman first demonstrated that anoxic neuronal injury was dependent on synaptic activity; a substantial body of subsequent work confirmed that EAA mediated anoxic neuronal injury in vitro (1). Concurrently, in experimental animal models of ischemic brain injury, a variety of experimental strategies yielded complementary evidence that EAA contributed to the pathogenesis of irreversible ischemic neuronal injury. Important findings included: the recognition that regions with high densities of EAA receptors were particularly susceptible to ischemic injury (Z), Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|The driven collisionless {{magnetic}} reconnection processes at the dayside magnetopause {{and in the}} magnetotail are investigated through 2. 5 D particle simulations. During reconnection, {{magnetic field}} configurations with both a single X line and multiple X lines are obtained. Magnetic reconnection enhancements, which are indicated by the peaks in the inductive electric field, are observed in the simulations. Coincident with the magnetic reconnection enhancements, bursts of energetic particles, electrons with an energy spectrum of <b>about</b> E <b>exp</b> - 3. 8 and ions with an energy spectrum of <b>about</b> E <b>exp</b> - 4. 4, are generated during the reconnection processes. Field-aligned particle heat fluxes are also generated. Intense plasma waves associated with the reconnection processes are observed. It is found that the fluctuating magnetic field has a power spectrum of <b>about</b> f <b>exp</b> - 3. 8 and the fluctuating electric field has a power spectrum of <b>about</b> f <b>exp</b> - 1. 8, respectively.

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{program designed}} to investigate the spatial structure of centimetric radio emission from close binary systems using multistation VLBI array is discussed. Eleven binaries, including eight RS CVn systems, Algol, LSI 61 deg 303, and Cyg X- 1, have been detected. The measured brightness temperatures vary from T(B) <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 8. 5 K during periods of low activity to T(B) <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 10. 5 K during flares. Extensive observation of a few sources {{has shown that the}} spatial structure is 'core-halo' with linear dimensions of about a stellar radius and the binary system, respectively. The observations are consistent with gyrosynchrotron emission of mildly relativistic electrons in magnetic fields of <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 1. 5 + or - 0. 5 gauss. The core sources appear to be optically thick, while the halo component is optically thin...|$|R

The observations show {{that less than}} 20 percent of the pulsars's spindown luminosity can be carried away by electrons and positrons with Lorentz factor gamma <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 5, and less than 5 percent by electrons and positrons with gamma <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 8. Neither of these fluxes can provide the penetrating flux required to heat the companion's photosphere. These observations and those by Fruchter et al.

40|$|If gamma-ray burst {{sources are}} in the Galactic halo, they inevitably involve the {{creation}} of an opaque pair plasma fireball, just like in cosmological sources. We find that the typical physical conditions in a Galactic halo fireball are optical depth <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 8, thermal energy about 100 keV, maximal relativistic expansion about 300, and a maximal baryonic load of <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> - 15 solar masses. This does not rule out Galactic halo models, but it poses an additional severe constraint on all such sources. A comparison of these conditions with the physical conditions at cosmological fireballs reveal that Galactic halo fireballs are less favorable than cosmological ones as sources of gamma-ray bursts...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of recent {{calculations}} of pycnonuclear reaction rates for light elements, we consider the problem of slow interstellar accretion onto old, possibly magnetized neutron stars. We argue that accretion will occur at the Hoyle-Lyttleton rate after the star has spun down in less than <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 9 yr. A deep ocean of liquid hydrogen and helium, extending down to depths about 100 m, will cover {{the surface of the}} star once it has accreted <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 25 g of gas. Beneath the ocean will be a layer of almost pure solid O- 16 which undergoes two-stage electron capture to C- 16 above a pressure 2. 7 x 10 exp 28 dyne/sq cm, corresponding to an accreted mass of <b>about</b> 10 <b>exp</b> 27 g. Taking into account the presence of multiple layers of distinct chemical composition, we conclude that the crust will be stable to small perturbations under the conditions envisaged for instellar accretion. A thick layer of up to 10 exp 27 g of metastable C- 16 will then accumulate. We discuss the implications of these results to old Galactic neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts...|$|R

40|$|A spatial {{distribution}} of gamma-ray bursts {{which is based on}} a log N - log n(max) relation, where N is the number of bursts which have a maximum photon count rate in excess of n(max), is proposed. A relation of N of <b>about</b> n(max) <b>exp</b> - 1. 5 is predicted for the case of sources uniformly distributed in infinite, flat space. It is noted that the apparently isotropic distribution of about 100 bursts over the sky combined with the N of <b>about</b> n(max) <b>exp</b> - 1. 5 distribution does not permit a purely observational distance estimate for the sources.
