How this structure can account for empirical effects such as repetition priming, semantic priming or face naming difficulties is briefly discussed. Then, it is shown how the model can be applied to the analysis of a typical neuropsychological impairment of face processing: prosopagnosia. Finally, the intriguing phenomenon of covert face recognition in prosopagnosic patients is briefly reviewed.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of language disorders using <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> (IA) <b>networks</b> and connectionist systems is discussed. An existing IA account of aphasic naming is described, {{in which two}} network parameters (decay rate and connection strength) are varied to fit the error production of an aphasic patient. Fairly similar results can be obtained through modification of additional parameters, including the so-called `shared weight increase factor' linking lexical and semantic units. This leads us to consider {{simulation of}} aphasic naming using connectionist networks which do not require explicit variation of network parameters. A modular connectionist architecture is presented, in which semantic-lexical and phonological knowledge are instantiated using self-organising Kohonen maps, while connections between them are implemented using Hebbian networks; a linear connectionist network (Madaline) is used to simulate non-word repetition. The Hebbian connections are lesioned in order to reproduce [...] ...|$|R

40|$|To be able {{to decide}} and act quickly and {{efficiently}} in a complex world, individuals rely on mechanisms that reduce information in a meaningful way. Instead of holding a set of partially contradicting cognitions, individuals construct coherent interpretations or stories {{to make sense of}} the available information using <b>interactive</b> <b>activation.</b> <b>Interactive</b> <b>activation</b> describes cognitive processing as bidirectional propagation of activation among simple processing units, which allows individuals to integrate large amounts of information quickly and with little cognitive effort.

40|$|Extraversion, {{arousal and}} time of day have {{characteristic}} interactive effects on semantic priming of lexical decision. Matthews and Harley's activation-sensitization hypothesis attributes these effects to individual differences in the sensitivity of units in an <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> <b>network.</b> The hypothesis predicts that the characteristic arousal-dependent effects on extraversion of priming should be found only when priming depends on pre-lexical activation processes, but not on later post-lexical processing. An experiment (N = 64) was conducted in which the roles of pre- and post-lexical processing in priming were varied by manipulating the confusability of words and non-words. The characteristic interactive effect of extraversion, arousal {{and time of}} day was found only when words and non-words were non-confusable, so that priming depended mainly on pre-lexical processing. This finding supports the Matthews and Harley hypothesis, and indicates the importance of task parameter selection in investigating arousal-dependent effects of extraversion on performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{central issue}} in bilingual {{research}} concerns {{the extent to}} which linguistic representations in the two languages are processed independently of each other. This paper reports the results of an empirical study and a model stimulation, which provide evidence for the interactive view, which holds that processing is not independent. Specifically, a reading experiment examined whether morpho-syntactic features associated with lexical representations in a bilinguals ’ native language, in this case the masculine gender feature associated with the er ending of agentive nouns in German, are automatically activated by the processing of morphologically related representations in their second language, in this case English agentive nouns that end in er. Experimental findings suggest that the German–English bilinguals have a bias to interpret the referents of such nouns as male relative to English monolinguals. Subsequent computational simulation studies with an <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> <b>network</b> confirmed that this effect is due to the influence of the morphosyntactic er representation in the bilingual models that is absent in the monolingual models.

40|$|In {{a seminal}} 1977 article, Rumelhart argued that {{perception}} required the simultaneous {{use of multiple}} sources of information, allowing perceivers to optimally interpret sensory information at many levels of representation in real time as information arrives. Building on Rumelhart’s argu-ments, we present the <b>Interactive</b> <b>Activation</b> hypothesis—the idea that the mechanism used in perception and comprehension to achieve these feats exploits an <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> process implemented through the bidirectional propagation of activation among simple processing units. We then examine the <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model of letter and word perception and the TRACE model of speech perception, as early attempts to explore this hypothesis, and review the experi-mental evidence relevant to their assumptions and predictions. We consider how well these models address the computational challenge posed by the problem of perception, and we consider how consistent they are with evidence from behavioral experiments.

40|$|One of {{the core}} {{principles}} of how the mind works is the graded, parallel activation of multiple related or similar representations. Parallel activation of multiple representations has been particularly important {{in the development of}} theories and models of language processing, where coactivated representations (neighbors) have been shown to exhibit both facilitative and inhibitory effects on word recognition and production. Researchers generally ascribe these effects to <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> and competition, but there is no unified explanation for why the effects are facilitative in some cases and inhibitory in others. We present a series of simulations of a simple domain-general <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> and competition model that is broadly consistent with more specialized domain-specific models of lexical processing. The results showed that <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> and competition can indeed account for the complex pattern of reversals.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a large-scale study that collected word identification thresholds and {{errors in the}} fragmentation task for all four-letter French words. In {{the first part of}} this article, we identify some of the variables (e. g., word frequency, neighborhood size, letter confusability) that affect performance in the fragmentation task. In the second part, we analyze individual response performance and identify different response strategies. We demonstrate that the <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model can account for individual response strategies by adapting two of its original parameters: word–letter feedback and letter– word inhibition. In the third part, we demonstrate that the adaptation of the <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model to the fragmentation task makes it possible to successfully simulate a facilitatory frequency effect on identification thresholds, an inhibitory neighborhood size effect on error rates, and an inhibitory letter confusability effect on identification thresholds. When the task-specific processes of the fragmentation task are specified and individual response strategies are considered, the <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model provides a parsimonious architecture for modeling the task-independent processes involved in word perception.

40|$|Empirical {{results from}} both reading and speech {{perception}} indicate that stimulus and context information have independent intluences on perceptual recognition. Massaro (1989) argued that {{these data are}} inconsistent with an <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> and competition (IAC) model (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981), and consistent with the fuzzy logical model of perception (FLMP) (Massaro, 1979; 1989). McClelland (1991) then modified the <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model to be stochastic rather than deterministic and to use a best one wins (BOW) decision rule, allowing it to predict independent influences of stimulus and context. When tested against real data, however, the network proposed by McClelland and extended by us gives a poorer description of actual empirical results than the FLMP. To account for the dynamics of information processing, the SIAC model, an interactive model based on the Boltzmann machine, and the FLMP are formulated to make quantitative predictions of performance {{as a function of}} processing time. It is shown that the dynamic FLMP provides a better description of the time course of perceptual processing than does <b>interactive</b> <b>activation.</b> The SIAC and Boltzmann models have difficulty predicting 1) context effects given little processing time and 2) a strong stimulus influence given substantial processing time. Finally, we demonstrate that the FLMP predicts that context can improve the accuracy of performance, in addition to providing a bias to respond with the alternative supported by context. In summary, there is now both empirical and theoretical evidence in favor of the FLMP over SIAC models of pattern recognition. We therefore argue that <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> is both less consistent with empirical results and not necessary to describe the joint influence of stimulus and context in language perception. 0 1991 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether {{the balance of}} neighborhood distribution (i. e., the way orthographic neighbors are spread across letter positions) influences visual word recognition. Three word conditions were compared. Word neighbors were either concentrated on one letter position (e. g., nasse/basselasse- tasse-masse) or were unequally spread across two letter positions (e. g., pelle / celle-selle-telle-perle), or were equally spread across two letter positions (e. g., litre / titre-vitre-libre-livre). Predictions based on the <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model [McClelland & Rumelhart (1981). Psychological Review, 88, 375 – 401] were generated by running simulations and were confirmed in the lexical decision task. Data showed that words were more rapidly identified when they had spread neighbors rather than concentrated neighbors. Furthermore, within the set of spread neighbors, words were more rapidly recognized when they had equally rather than unequally spread neighbors.

50|$|TRACE {{was created}} during the {{formative}} period of connectionism, and was {{included as a}} chapter in Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructures of Cognition. The researchers found that certain problems regarding speech perception could be conceptualized {{in terms of a}} connectionist <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model. The problems were that (1) speech is extended in time, (2) the sounds of speech (phonemes) overlap with each other, (3) the articulation of a speech sound is affected by the sounds that come before and after it, and (4) there is natural variability in speech (e.g. foreign accent) as well as noise in the environment (e.g. busy restaurant). Each of these causes the speech signal to be complex and often ambiguous, making it difficult for the human mind/brain to decide what words it is really hearing. In very simple terms, an <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model solves this problem by placing different kinds of processing units (phonemes, words) in isolated layers, allowing activated units to pass information between layers, and having units within layers compete with one another, until the “winner” is considered “recognized” by the model.|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a rapprochement between explicitly Bayesian models of contextual effects in perception and neural network models of such effects, particularly the connectionist <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model of perception. The article is in part an historical review and in part a tutorial, reviewing the probabilistic Bayesian approach to understanding perception and how it may be shaped by context, and also reviewing ideas about how such probabilistic computations may be carried out in neural networks, focusing {{on the role of}} context in interactive neural networks, in which both bottom-up and top-down signals affect the interpretation of sensory inputs. It is pointed out that connectionist units that use the logistic or softmax activation functions can exactly compute Bayesian posterior probabilities when the bias terms and connection weights affecting such units are set to the logarithms of appropriate probabilistic quantities. Bayesian concepts such the prior, likelihood, (joint and marginal) posterior, probability matching and maximizing, and calculating vs. sampling from the posterior are all reviewed and linked to neural network computations. Probabilistic and neural network models are explicitly linked to the concept of a probabilistic generative model that describes the relationship between the underlying target of perception (e. g. the word intended by a speaker or other source of sensory stimuli) and the sensory input that reaches the perceiver for use in inferring the underlying target. It is shown how {{a new version of the}} <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model called the multinomial <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model can sample correctly from the joint posterior of a proposed generative model for perception of letters in words, indicating that interactive processing is fully consistent with principled probabilistic computation.

40|$|Automatic {{imitation}} or "imitative compatibility" {{is thought}} to be mediated by the mirror neuron system and to be a laboratory model of the motor mimicry that occurs spontaneously in naturalistic social interaction. Imitative compatibility and spatial compatibility effects are known to depend on different stimulus dimensions-body movement topography and relative spatial position. However, it is not yet clear whether these two types of stimulus-response compatibility effect are mediated by the same or different cognitive processes. We present an <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> model of imitative and spatial compatibility, based on a dual-route architecture, which substantiates the view they are mediated by processes of the same kind. The model, which is in many ways a standard application of the <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> approach, simulates all key results of a recent study by Catmur and Heyes (2011). Specifically, it captures the difference in the relative size of imitative and spatial compatibility effects; the lack of interaction when the imperative and irrelevant stimuli are presented simultaneously; the relative speed of responses in a quintile analysis when the imperative and irrelevant stimuli are presented simultaneously; and the different time courses of the compatibility effects when the imperative and irrelevant stimuli are presented asynchronously...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{studies of}} {{individual}} differences have shown mild but significant correlations in performance on tasks that require the withholding of {{a response to a}} prepotent stimulus, i. e., on so-called response inhibition tasks. Several computational models of response inhibition tasks have been developed, but the dominant models of such tasks have been produced in isolation of each other. Consequently they fail to present a coherent unitary picture of response inhibition. In this paper we consider two established <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> models of distinct response inhibition tasks – the stop signal task and the Stroop task – and explore potential mechanisms within those models that might underlie the observed behavioural correlation. Only one plausible account of the correlation emerges: that it results from shared mechanisms of attentional bias. This account does not map onto the classical concept of response inhibition. It is concluded that either the accepted models are flawed or that the concept of response inhibition as applied to these tasks is misleading (and hence counterproductive). More generally the work may be taken to support an architectural approach to modelling, albeit at the level of <b>interactive</b> <b>activation</b> models, rather than the more traditional production system models...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} new approach for assessing the effects of pediatric epilepsy on the language connectome. Two novel data-driven network construction approaches are presented. These methods rely on connecting different brain regions using either extent or intensity of language related activations as identified by independent component analysis of fMRI data. An auditory description decision task (ADDT) paradigm was used to activate the language network for 29 patients and 30 controls recruited from three major pediatric hospitals. Empirical evaluations illustrated that pediatric epilepsy can cause, or is associated with, a network efficiency reduction. Patients showed a propensity to inefficiently employ the whole brain network to perform the ADDT language task; on the contrary, controls seemed to efficiently use smaller segregated network components {{to achieve the same}} task. To explain the causes of the decreased efficiency, graph theoretical analysis was carried out. The analysis revealed no substantial global network feature differences between the patient and control groups. It also showed that for both subject groups the language network exhibited small-world characteristics; however, the patient 2 ̆ 7 s extent of <b>activation</b> <b>network</b> showed a tendency towards more random networks. It was also shown that the intensity of <b>activation</b> <b>network</b> displayed ipsilateral hub reorganization on the local level. The left hemispheric hubs displayed greater centrality values for patients, whereas the right hemispheric hubs displayed greater centrality values for controls. This hub hemispheric disparity was not correlated with a right atypical language laterality found in six patients. Finally it was shown that a multi-level unsupervised clustering scheme based on self-organizing maps, a type of artificial neural network, and k-means was able to fairly and blindly separate the subjects into their respective patient or control groups. The clustering was initiated using the local nodal centrality measurements only. Compared to the extent of <b>activation</b> <b>network,</b> the intensity of <b>activation</b> <b>network</b> clustering demonstrated better precision. This outcome supports the assertion that the local centrality differences presented by the intensity of <b>activation</b> <b>network</b> can be associated with focal epilepsy. ...|$|R
