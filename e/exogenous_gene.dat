Spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase 2 (SSAT 2) or inactive SSAT 1 mutant enzymes (R 101 A or R 101 K) were without effect. The loss of <b>exogenous</b> <b>gene</b> expression is not due to accelerated protein degradation, because various inhibitors of proteases, lysosome, or autophagy did not mitigate the effects. This SSAT 1 effect cannot {{be attributed to the}} depletion of overall cellular polyamines or accumulation of N 1 -acetylspermidine (N 1 -AcSpd) because of the following: (i) addition of putrescine, spermidine, spermine, or N 1 -AcSpd did not restore the expression of GFP or GFP-eIF 5 A; (ii) depletion of cellular polyamines with α-difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, did not inhibit <b>exogenous</b> <b>gene</b> expression; and (iii) N 1,N 11 -bis(ethyl) norspermine caused a drastic depletion of cellular polyamines through induction of endogenous SSAT 1 but did not block <b>exogenous</b> <b>gene</b> expression.

Because rat hepatocytes plated on collagen-coated dishes and maintained in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) -supplemented chemically defined medium are an excellent model system for studying liver function in vitro, we investigated the ability of baculoviruses to infect and deliver <b>exogenous</b> <b>genes</b> to cells in this culture system. Efficient delivery to hepatocytes in short-term culture becomes restricted to peripheral cells, or “edge” cells, as the hepatocytes acquire intercellular junctions and form islands with time in culture. This barrier to baculovirus entry can be overcome, and the percentage of internal cells within the hepatocyte islands that are infected with the baculovirus can be increased more than 100 -fold, when cells are subjected to transient calcium depletion before and during infection. These findings suggest that at least in some cell types, such as hepatocytes, baculovirus entry may require contact with the basolateral surface. We conclude from this study that recombinant baculovirus infection following transient depletion of extracellular calcium results in delivery of <b>exogenous</b> <b>genes</b> to at least 75 % of hepatocytes in long-term DMSO culture, thereby making it possible {{for the first time to}} carry out gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in this cell system...|$|R

The plasmid pHr 2 -NL was constructed and nucleofected into MSCs. The recombinants were selected using G 418 and characterized using PCR and Southern blotting. Results. BFGF is critical to MSC growth and it acted synergistically with vitamin C, VEGF, and ITS-X, causing the cells to expand significantly.
