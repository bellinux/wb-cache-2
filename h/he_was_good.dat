5|$|On 7 May {{he became}} the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate. He passed as Second Class Flier. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching {{a student in the}} Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E

An ardent cricketer {{during his years}} in New South Wales, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to hit 196 runs during a match in Newcastle, and {{encouraged}} his children to play sport. He played for the Rita Social Club after moving to Fitzroy, while his wife kept score. His daughter was also a scorer for the club. As recreational facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, the boys took to playing cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house. Here they played cricket with a tennis ball, home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket.|$|E
5|$|Watts was {{selected}} to attend Atlanta University Laboratory High School, a school created for exceptional students who were college bound, located at Spelman College's campus.

At that time, {{he and his brother}} worked a paper route, delivering copies of the Atlanta Constitution every morning to support their education. Watts was encouraged to attend medical school by his Morehouse College biology teacher, Samuel Nabrit, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at science subjects, especially biology. Watts received a degree in mathematics in 1938 from Morehouse College. After working at the Washington, D.C., post office to support his education, Watts attended Howard University College of Medicine.|$|E

25|$|Kinsey {{approached}} his father {{with plans to}} study botany at college. His father demanded that he study engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology instead.

25|$|He {{made his}} Test debut versus Pakistan at Karachi in 1990/91 {{and in his}} third test took test best figures of 11-152, {{including}} 7-52 in the first innings. The match and the series was dogged by controversy as both teams were accused of ball tampering. He appeared intermittently for the test side, gaining more success in the one day game. From his seemingly uncoordinated action <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at bowling yorker length deliveries in the closing overs.|$|E
25|$|Durham won the toss against Leicestershire {{and elected}} to bat first at Grace Road, Leicester. The first day was {{dominated}} by Durham's Australian left-handed opener, Mike Hussey. Hussey may not {{be good enough to}} make the Australian Test squad, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> to make an undefeated 165 off 290 balls on a flat pitch on the first day. Former England Under-19 batsman Gordon Muchall helped Hussey add 166 for the third-wicket partnership, before being run out for 82. Durham finished day one on 325 for 3.|$|E
25|$|George Earl Toolson was {{a pitcher}} with the Newark Bears in 1949, a farm {{team for the}} New York Yankees in the AAA-class International League. He {{believed}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough {{to play in the}} major leagues, if not for the Yankees then for another team. But due to the reserve clause in his and every other player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team.|$|E

25|$|Decathlon {{qualifying}} {{was held}} in Milwaukee {{as part of the}} Central Tryouts. Glenn Morris, a newcomer who had completed his first decathlon only two months before the Trials, won with a world record tally of 7875 points; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> in all events and had no weak points. Bob Clark broke the long jump decathlon best with a jump of 25ftin (7.91m), but was not as strong as Morris in the hurdles and throws. Morris's world record was superseded by his Olympic winning score of 7900 points and never ratified; the Americans swept the medals at the Olympics.|$|E
25|$|A {{mechanical}} engineer with anarchist leanings, possibly {{based on the}} Russian Machist, Alexander Bogdanov (the character's ancestor) and Arkady Strugatsky, he is regarded by many {{other members of the}} First Hundred, particularly Boyle, as a troublemaker. He leads the team which establishes an outpost on the moon Phobos, and leads an uprising against the transnational corporation towards the end of first novel. Like Boone (with whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> friends), his political ideas (later known as Bogdanovism) weigh heavily on characters later in the series. In love with Nadia Chernyshevski, he is killed during the first Martian revolution in 2061.|$|E

Tipu Sultanwho became the ruler after Hyder Ali was also very able at military tactics. He defeated and repelled the British several times.

They hide in a classroom where Hirano is able to put together a nail gun rifle powered by gas cartridges. Kohta has an unrequited crush on Saya. Kohta provides long-range cover when Takashi rescues Alice Maresato from approaching zombies after Alice's father is killed. At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses saying this is the one thing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at and that he wants to protect Saya.

25|$|In his youth, Bellamy focused chiefly on soccer, {{at which}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> {{enough to play}} for Northampton Town as an inside forward. Bellamy joined the ground staff of Northamptonshire, which shared its ground with the soccer club, in 1912, but his powers as a cricketer ripened very slowly indeed. He was denied a regular place in the county team until 1922, due to the First World War and the long career of Walter Buswell. By {{this time he was}} thirty-one years old. Bellamy then {{remained}} the first choice wicket-keeper for 14 seasons, making his last appearance for the county as a batsman with Ken James having become the preferred wicket keeper.|$|E

He didn't score a run. His bowling performance in that match remains the tenth best in all matches for Ireland and the fourth best in first-class cricket for Ireland. His bowling average of 10.22 is the second best for Ireland in first-class cricket.|$|E
