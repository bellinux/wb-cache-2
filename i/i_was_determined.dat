25|$|According to the {{historical}} sources there were three Bulgarian missions to the Pope with the participation of Peter, the first one being {{in the summer of}} 866. The interest of Boris I in the Roman Church was caused by the reluctance of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to accept his request to appoint an independent patriarch (or at least an archbishop) for the Bulgarian diocese in order to retain it subordinated to Constantinople. Boris <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to make Bulgaria Christian while keeping the country's religious and political independence. Since the end of the 850s the churches of Rome and Constantinople were in a period of a heated competition for influence over the Slavs and the Ecumenical Church power. This rivalry favoured Boris' plans, as it gave him the opportunity to play one side off against the other and choose. The new orientation of the Bulgarian policy also allowed Boris I to calm down the nobility of the boyars, which was cautious and hostile to the increased Byzantine influence in the country after the Christianization.|$|E

500|$|John Rogers, {{described}} as a [...] "penny-pinching" [...] majority owner of the Phillies, assured Lajoie {{that he would make}} the same salary as Delahanty. However, Lajoie discovered that while he was earning $2,600 ($ in current dollar terms), Delahanty earned $3,000 ($ in current dollar terms) (contracts for NL players were not allowed to surpass $2,400). Rogers increased Lajoie's pay by $200 but the damage had already been done. [...] "Because I felt I had been cheated, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to listen to any reasonable American League offer", Lajoie said.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} high school, Stebbins {{enrolled}} in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He initially majored in civil engineering, thinking it a better career option than biology, but became unhappy with the program. Struggling with poor performance and health issues related to congenital heart problems, he took a leave for year and a half. During his time in recuperation, {{he turned his attention}} back to natural history, and was persuaded to return to UCLA by Raymond Cowles, a biology professor there. Stebbins returned with enthusiasm despite the perceived lack of job security, remarking in 1985: [...] "I was cautious because of the Great Depression, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to pursue biology even if it meant standing on a corner with a tin cup." [...] He switched his major to zoology and graduated in 1940 with highest honors.|$|E

500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
500|$|The elder Lajoie, {{who worked}} as a {{teamster}} and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias [...] "Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called [...] "Slugging Cabby." [...] "When I told my father I had decided to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> {{to give it a try}} at least one season", Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname [...] "Larry" [...] from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.|$|E
500|$|Although a Labour activist for two decades, Lamont had not sought {{election}} to the House of Commons during that time, telling a 2014 BBC interview there were few chances for women to be elected to Westminster: [...] "In 1987 Labour sent down 50 MPs and {{only one of them}} was a woman." [...] Instead, her decision to seek political office was influenced by the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Speaking to The Herald in 2011, she said, [...] "It is easy to forget what a great opportunity it was for women and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that women would be represented, would have a strong voice." [...] The parliament was established as a result of the 1997 referendum that saw a 74% vote in favour of devolving legislative powers to Scotland. Lamont was first elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999. She held the seat in 2003, when she faced a strong challenge from the Scottish Socialist Party leader Tommy Sheridan, and then again in 2007 and 2011.|$|E

[...] His family, of Spanish ancestry, owned a small business making agricultural equipment. [...] He grew up in the south west French country side and in his adolescence acquired a passion for films. From 1952 to 1959 he [...] went to a Catholic boarding school in Montauban. [...] He was allowed to leave the school only on Sunday afternoons when he would go to the cinema, although he often had to return before the screening ended. From 1959 he attended a secular state school, which exposed him to a different culture, with Marxist teachers, a cine club and a film magazine, La Plume et l'écran, to which he contributed. [...] "Films were my only opening to the world," [...] Téchiné explained in an interview. [...] "They were my only possibility of escaping my family environment and my boarding school. It was probably dangerous because, through movies, I learned how the world works and how human relations work. But it was magical, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to follow the thread of that magic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{his arrival}} in Paris, Bourguiba settled in Vauqueur pension who {{reserved}} him a sordid welcoming. The pension was nearby Hôtel Saint-Séverin, next to Place Saint-Michel, {{where he used to}} lodge in a room on the sixth floor for 150 francs per month, with an extra for a heater that did not work. He spent his first months wandering in hotels in Quartier latin and Tunisian student's dormitories. Preferring to attend philosophical classes, Bourguiba sent his notes to his brother M'hamed and excelled in his studies. Interested in Arab culture, he attend William Marçais's lessons beside his psychological and psychotherapy interest in George Dumas's conference, in hôpital Saint-Anne. Furthermore, he met, in the hospital, paranoias who thought they were Napoleon or other historical personalities. [...] "I felt then that euphoria of knowledge that increases as our research extends", he recalled in 1973. [...] "However, I ended realising that I did not come to France for that purpose, but rather to arm myself intellectually to combat the French colonization. Therefore, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> {{to put an end to}} these parallel endless studies that diverted me from my goals".|$|E

This sudden and unexpected appearance of the armour-clad sea monster, bursting open the door... instantly created a sensation. The cook screamed, the house-maid fainted, the cat jumped on the dresser, the dog retreated behind the copper and barked, the monkeys went mad with fright, and the sedate parrot has never spoken a word since." ...|$|E
2500|$|She had {{two films}} {{released}} in 1970: the Telugu film Amma Kosam and the Hindi film Sawan Bhadon, which was considered her acting debut in Bollywood. She {{had to learn}} Hindi, as that was not her naturally spoken language. Sawan Bhadon became a hit, and Rekha – a star overnight. Despite {{the success of the}} film, she was often scorned for her looks. She subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl. She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), yet she was not regarded for her acting abilities and—according to Tejaswini Ganti—"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society." [...] Rekha recalls that the way she was perceived at that time motivated her to change her appearance and improve her choice of roles: [...] "I was called the ‘Ugly Duckling’ of Hindi films because of my dark complexion and South Indian features. I used to feel deeply hurt when people compared me with the leading heroines of the time and said I was no match for them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to make it big on sheer merit." ...|$|E
