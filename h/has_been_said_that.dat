5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Jehovah's Witnesses do {{not entirely}} oppose {{the idea of}} {{national}} service, but rather the notion of armed military service.

5|$|In 2009, after Jackson's sudden death, La Toya Jackson {{said that}} she had {{discovered}} two hard disks at her brother's home which contain more than 1,000 songs that were never released and that are even not registered by any bodies (excluding some). It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Jackson, in his lifetime, recorded more than 50,000 songs but many of the songs were not released.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E
6000|$|... 42. [...] "Conquered the world"? The {{rest of the}} {{sentence}} is true, but this, hyperbolic, and greatly false.

5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse {{and in front of}} the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Robert Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{an error}} of fact {{involves}} {{a situation where there}} are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{suggested the}} discovery and subsequent positive exposure and good morale {{around the city}} contributed to Leicester City F.C.'s shock Premier League victory in 2016. A {{few days after the}} burial, Leicester City began a winning streak to take them from bottom of the league to comfortably avoiding relegation, and they {{went on to win the}} league the following year. Mayor Peter Soulsby said:For too long, people in Leicester have been modest about their achievements and the city they live in. Now - thanks first to the discovery of King Richard III and the Foxes' phenomenal season - it's our time to step into the international limelight.and:It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we are somehow being repaid for burying Richard with honour in our cathedral.|$|E

5|$|As {{was often}} the case with Celtic churches from this period, the church was {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It {{is probably one of the}} oldest buildings in Penmon. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the lower stone walls near the well were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would make it the oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. A small chamber surrounds the well. In modern times, water from the well has been used as a symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5000|$|The local populace {{quickly found}} an {{explanation}} for the Mummy of the Knight of Kahlbutz. They <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> God's punishment for the murder of the shepherd.

5|$|The European Parliament (EP) {{shares the}} {{legislative}} and budgetary {{authority of the}} Union with the Council of the European Union (not {{to be confused with}} the European Council). Its 751 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. They represent nearly 500million citizens (the world's second largest democratic electorate) and form the only directly elected body in the Union. Despite forming one of the two legislative chambers of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some sensitive areas, and does not have legislative initiative. It does, however, have powers over the Commission which the Council does not. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> its democratic nature and growing powers have made it one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} stories that depict {{suggestions}} of staging a rugby union world cup before the 1980s. One {{of the earliest}} known pioneers was Harold Tolhurst, an Australian player who would later become a referee. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Tolhurst brought {{up the idea of}} such a tournament as early as the late 1950s. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> in 1968, the International Rugby Board made it known that it did not want its unions {{to be a part of}} such a competition that resembled a world cup.|$|E
60|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> not Maruja's way to {{encounter}} man, woman, or child, old or young, without {{an attempt at}} subjugation. Strong in her power and salient with fascination, she leaned gently over the fence, and with the fan raised to her delicate ear, made him repeat his question under the soft fire of her fringed eyes. He did so, but incompletely, and with querulous laziness.|$|R

50|$|Liberation Theology {{had come}} under attack for not being a {{theology}} at all. At times it was compared to Marxism. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> an ideology masquerading as theology. Younger Christians {{at the time were}} seeking an ideology and not finding it in the Christian faith. Segundo responds to this climate by addressing these words and their meaning and how a Biblical perspective {{can be applied to the}} political world.|$|R
