5|$|On {{the eve of}} battle, Grant's and Johnston's armies were of {{comparable}} size, but the Confederates were poorly armed with antique weapons, including shotguns, hunting rifles, pistols, flintlock muskets, and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pikes; however, some regiments, such as the 6th and 7th Kentucky Infantry, had Enfield rifles. The troops approached the battle with very little combat experience; Braxton Bragg's men from Pensacola and Mobile were the best trained. Grant's army included 32 out of 62 infantry regiments who had combat experience at Fort Donelson. One half of his artillery batteries {{and most of his}} cavalry were also combat veterans.|$|E
5|$|The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast {{new light}} on the {{commissioning}} of a work that was previously thoughtsince it has no central religious imageto be an atypical altarpiece. Many Netherlandish diptychs intended for private use are known, and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no donor portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, The Gardens bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a tapestry that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E

5|$|The {{organisation}} of the French 55th Infantry Division was chaotic. Most units {{had been}} involved in construction work and were constantly moved to different tactical positions. Of the nine companies in position by 10 May, only a few had been holding their respective positions for <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days and were not familiar with them. One of the premier infantry regiments, the 213th Infantry Regiment, was removed from the line altogether and was replaced with the 331st Regiment. In some cases, Infantry regiments were made up of several different companies from several different battalions from different regiments. For example, the 295th Infantry Regiment's 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, was made up of four different companies which were drawn from three different battalions belonging to three different regiments.|$|E
5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle {{is removed from the}} freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> inches. Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weight—a safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E
5|$|The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, {{or nearly}} black in colour) {{separated}} by light hair (usually white or cream in colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed {{to serve as}} camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any benefit that camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend {{a large part of}} the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation is certainly important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings {{does not in}} itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied {{by the fact that}} young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of all}} giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E
5|$|With <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred missiles, the Soviets {{could afford}} to target every US bomber base. With no warning system in place, a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the airborne alert force and its own small ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E
