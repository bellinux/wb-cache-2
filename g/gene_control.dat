25|$|Protein {{interference}} is {{the process}} where in some signaling protein interacts, either with the promoter or with some stage of the partially constructed complex, to prevent further construction of the polymerase complex, so preventing initiation. In general, {{this is a very}} rapid response and is used for fine level, individual <b>gene</b> <b>control</b> and for 'cascade' processes for a group of genes useful under a specific conditions (for example, DNA repair genes or heat shock genes).|$|E
25|$|Mutations {{in these}} repeating {{segments}} {{can affect the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of proteins, with the potential for producing gradual and predictable changes in protein action. For example, length changes in tandemly repeating regions in the Runx2 gene lead to differences in facial length in domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris), with an association between longer sequence lengths and longer faces. This association also applies to a wider range of Carnivora species. Length changes in polyalanine tracts within the HoxA13 gene are linked to Hand-Foot-Genital Syndrome, a developmental disorder in humans. Length changes in other triplet repeats are linked to more than 40 neurological diseases in humans, notably triplet expansion diseases such as fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. Evolutionary changes from replication slippage also occur in simpler organisms. For example, microsatellite length changes are common within surface membrane proteins in yeast, providing rapid evolution in cell properties. Specifically, length changes in the FLO1 <b>gene</b> <b>control</b> the level of adhesion to substrates. Short sequence repeats also provide rapid evolutionary change to surface proteins in pathenogenic bacteria; this may allow them to keep up with immunological changes in their hosts. Length changes in short sequence repeats in a fungus (Neurospora crassa) control the duration of its circadian clock cycles.|$|E

2500|$|Regulation of gene {{expression}} {{refers to the}} control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a <b>gene.</b> <b>Control</b> of expression is vital to allow a cell to produce the gene products it needs when it needs them; in turn, this gives cells the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment, external signals, damage to the cell, and other stimuli.

2500|$|The haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) {{superfamily}} is {{a further}} PP group that uses Asp as a nucleophile and was recently shown to have dual-specificity. These PPs can target both Ser and Tyr, but {{are thought to have}} greater specificity towards Tyr. A subfamily of HADs, the Eyes Absent Family (Eya), are also transcription factors and can therefore regulate their own phosphorylation and that of transcriptional cofactor/s, and contribute to the control of gene transcription. The combination of these two functions in Eya reveals a greater complexity of transcriptional <b>gene</b> <b>control</b> than previously thought [...] A further member of this class is the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphatase. While this family remains poorly understood, it is known to play important roles in development and nuclear morphology.|$|E

However, {{the information about the}} inheritance of qualitative and quantitative characters on hypocotyl and cotyledon of Chili pepper was not available. The aim of this research was to determine the inheritance of qualitative and quantitative characters on hypocotyl and cotyledon of Chili pepper. This research used purple Chili pepper (P 1 (IPB C 20)), green Chili pepper (P 2 (IPB C 2)), F 1, F 1 R, BCP 1, BCP 2, and F 2 populations. Analysis for qualitative characters used mendelian genetics analysis, whereas model genetic prediction for quantitative characters used join scaling test analysis. The result showed that hypocotyl and cotyledon color of Chili pepper <b>controlled</b> by single <b>gene.</b> The <b>gene</b> <b>controlling</b> purple color was dominant than the <b>gene</b> <b>controlling</b> green color on hypocotyl, whereas the <b>gene</b> <b>controlling</b> green color was dominant than the <b>gene</b> <b>controlling</b> purple color on cotyledon.
