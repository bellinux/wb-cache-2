5|$|The {{first of}} three 2012 presidential {{election}} debates took place on October 3, in Denver. Media figures and political analysts widely viewed Romney as having delivered a stronger and more focused presentation than did President Obama. That initial debate overshadowed Obama's improved presentation {{in the last two}} debates later in October, and Romney maintained a small advantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> when seen as a whole.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> {{leading up}} to World War I, a number of isolationist {{senators}} filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies. Despite their victories, {{the small group of}} senators continued to lock up the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of all Senators, not only the ones voting.|$|E

25|$|Logically speaking, {{the prior}} {{question}} was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin's On the Origin of Species was devoted.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> on {{the need}} for an {{increased}} effort to rearm British forces, Amery tended to focus on army affairs, with Churchill speaking more about air defence and Roger Keyes talking about naval affairs. Austen Chamberlain was, until his death, a member of the group as well. While there was no question that Churchill was the most prominent and effective, Amery's work was still significant. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Army League, a pressure group designed to keep the needs of the British Army before the public.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> {{one issue}} was {{especially}} important: {{the treatment of}} 26,000 asylum seekers which had been in legal procedures for over five years. The left-wing opposition parties PvdA, SP, GL and CU, joined by former coalition-partner D66 wanted a general pardon for this group, granting them all a residence permit. The CDA, VVD and the smaller right-wing parties of Geert Wilders and Marco Pastors opposed such a permit because it would attract illegal immigrants. Minister Verdonk claimed that she had actually already taken care of these 26,000 asylum seekers, sending many back to their own country and granting many a residence permit.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates,</b> Douglas reiterated {{his support}} of popular sovereignty. He demanded to know whether Lincoln would ever vote to admit a new slave state, even if the {{majority}} of settlers favored slavery. He denounced Lincoln for his insistence that slavery was a moral issue {{that had to be}} resolved by the nation as a whole. Douglas described this as causing an unnecessary conflict between free and slave states, which threatened to boil up into disunion and war. He also asserted that Lincoln supported civil and social equality between the races, and insinuated that Lincoln even accepted interracial marriage.|$|E
25|$|In the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, as {{elsewhere}} in the Soviet Union, political activity was expressed in various ways, including by organizing groups and clubs independent of the government that had long withheld the right of association to any sort of civil organization. Two sets of concerns were particularly prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> that accompanied the opening of political dialogue in the late 1980s. The first was concern for the ecologic devastation that was so characteristic of Soviet industrial society. The second, and increasingly ascendant concern, revolved around the Moldovan (or Romanian) language and national heritage that many felt had been trammeled by Soviet and Russian domination.|$|E
25|$|The New Testament, {{especially}} the Gospel of John, {{has traditionally been}} interpreted as relating Christian accounts of the Pharisee rejection of Jesus and accusations of the Pharisee responsibility for his crucifixion. Luke T. Johnson nuances the harsh portrayal of the Jews in the Gospels by contextualizing the polemics within the rhetoric of contemporaneous philosophical debate, showing how rival schools of thought routinely insulted and slandered their opponents. These attacks were formulaic and stereotyped, crafted to define who was the enemy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates,</b> but not used {{with the expectation that}} their insults and accusations would be taken literally, as they would be centuries later, resulting in millennia of Christian antisemitism.|$|E
