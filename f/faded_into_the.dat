5|$|While {{the initial}} {{system in the}} Bay of Campeche {{continued}} to struggle in its organization, a new cluster of thunderstorms concentrated in a band developed to the depression's northwest late on June18. Over the next 24hours, this new area of precipitation began to wrap cyclonically around a new and dominant circulation center; the NHC assumed the tropical depression to have relocated to the northwest and classified the system as Tropical Storm Arlene at 1200UTC on June19. As Arlene would not strengthen after classification, peak intensity was attained concurrent with its upgrade to tropical storm strength with maximum sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg). Meandering {{off the coast of}} South Texas due to the presence of a shortwave trough to its north, Arlene eventually made landfall at 0900UTC on June20 at a virtually unchanged intensity at point on Padre Island roughly 45mi (70km) south of Corpus Christi, Texas. The tropical storm quickly deteriorated to tropical depression intensity after landfall, and was no longer considered a tropical cyclone after 0600UTC on June21. The remnants of Arlene continued to track across the Rio Grande Valley before they <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ambient environment.|$|E

500|$|Early critics {{often had}} {{difficulty}} separating Irving {{the man from}} Irving the writer—"The life of Washington Irving {{was one of the}} brightest ever led by an author", wrote Richard Henry Stoddard, an early Irving biographer—but as years passed and Irving's celebrity personality <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> background, critics often began to review his writings as all style, no substance. [...] "The man had no message", said critic Barrett Wendell. [...] Yet, critics conceded that despite Irving's lack of sophisticated themes—Irving biographer Stanley T.

500|$|In 1965, Warner {{surprised}} many industry observers when {{he purchased}} {{the rights to}} Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee's searing play about a destructive marriage. [...] From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman's script, which was extremely faithful to Albee's play, stretched the U.S. film industry's Production Code to the limit. [...] Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him [...] "uneasy". [...] "I was uncomfortable {{with the thought that}} this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight," [...] Valenti wrote. Meanwhile, Lehman and the film's director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white. [...] These controversies soon <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an [...] "Adults only" [...] label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively. Upon its release, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike. [...] It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966.|$|E

500|$|While studying, Hol became {{interested}} in journalism. He began writing for the apolitical magazine Norsk Nationaltidende in 1877, but found his interest in politics growing as he observed the mounting political turmoil at the time. Liberal politicians in the Norwegian Parliament struggled to introduce the practice of calling government ministers in for questioning. Initially, this {{was not meant to}} function as a lever against individual ministers, but rather to increase debate on important issues. The executive branch of government was not elected, and the intention was to enhance a co-governing with the democratically elected legislature. Also, ministers were already criticized in parliamentary debates; if they were questioned in person they would have the chance to defend themselves. This required altering the Constitution, a move which the executive branch, led by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, continuously vetoed. The conservatives in Parliament also opposed this, fearing that the increasingly liberal-dominated parliament would use constitutional change to check the executive branch, and thereby infringe upon the separation of powers. The first royal veto came in 1872, after which the proposition was slightly altered, but it was vetoed again in 1874. Two identical propositions followed, and were defeated, in 1877 and 1880. After 1880, the question about ministers <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> background; instead the disagreement centered around the King's right to a veto in constitutional cases. According to the Constitution, the King had the right to postpone a non-constitutional act three times. On the other hand, the Constitution did not mention any veto in constitutional cases. Three views became distinct: some argued that the King had no veto at all, the middle ground was held by people who would allow a postponing veto, while the government and the King claimed an absolute veto. Allegedly, an absolute veto was in the [...] "spirit" [...] of 1814 and the separation of powers principle. Those who held the first view cited the principle of popular sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|While still {{rooted in}} pop punk, Blink-182 finds the band {{expanding}} their sonic template with darker, restless songs. The compositions {{on the record}} {{have been described as}} musically diverse and [...] "borderline experimental," [...] with sullen moodiness and off-kilter hooks the basis for many tracks. The record pulls from a variety of styles, including electronic rock, jangle pop, and [...] "reflective" [...] alternative rock. Experimentation was constantly present: the band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, [...] and turntables. The band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side-projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants.) In a full article about the album in the November 20, 2003 edition of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ben Wener described the music of the album as [...] "expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral." [...] The New York Times considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing popularity of emo pop, while AllMusic regarded it a delve into post-punk. [...] "Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound", wrote Tom Bryant of Kerrang!. The goal for Blink-182 was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. [...] In addition to the side-projects, the music of the album was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: [...] "It was so weird because we'd all be glued to the TV, watching these bombs explode over another country. So I'd see all this and wonder where he was at, and then we'd have to go into the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day." [...] In addition, it was just inspired by socializing: [...] "We would just hang out for hours talking. It was really cool", said DeLonge.|$|E

2500|$|After the war, {{the songs}} {{during the war}} have been {{regarded}} as a taboo even in Japan despite those historical importance.
