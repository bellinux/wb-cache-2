50|$|In April 1999, INMARSAT was {{succeeded by}} the <b>International</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Organization (IMSO) as an {{intergovernmental}} regulatory body for satellite communications, while INMARSAT's operational unit was separated {{and became the}} UK-based company Inmarsat Ltd. The IMSO and Inmarsat Ltd. signed an agreement imposing public safety obligations on the new company. Inmarsat was the first international satellite organization that was privatized.|$|R
40|$|Satellite-based mobile {{communications}} systems provide voice and data communications to users over a vast geographic area. The users may communicate via mobile or hand-held terminals, which may also {{provide access to}} terrestrial communications services. While previous <b>International</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Conferences have concentrated on technical advances and the increasing worldwide commercial activities, this conference focuses on {{the next generation of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> services. The approximately 80 papers included here cover sessions in the following areas: networking and protocols; code division multiple access technologies; demand, economics and technology issues; current and planned systems; propagation; terminal technology; modulation and coding advances; spacecraft technology; advanced systems; and applications and experiments...|$|R

5000|$|IFAST {{inherited}} {{the assignment of}} SID ranges to countries and has continued the allocation of blocks to countries that need more codes or that were never assigned a block (e.g., because the country was not independent when the blocks were first assigned in the 1980s). IFAST considers it the responsibility of national telecom regulators to assign SID codes to individual wireless systems, but IFAST will perform this function when the national regulator is {{unwilling or unable to}} do so. IFAST also allocates SID ranges to international carriers, such as <b>international</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> carriers and companies that provide cellular service through base stations on boats.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} other {{intergovernmental}} organizations that have concluded cooperation agreements with the United Nations such as, IOM, UNIDO, WFP, IMSO (<b>International</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Organization) and many more. In terms of cooperation structures, some agreements come {{very close to the}} relationship agreements concluded under articles 57 and 63 of the UN Charter with the specialized agencies, but due to Charter requirements that the agencies deal with [...] "economic, social, cultural, educational, health, and related fields", organizations with such agreements are not formally specialized agencies of the United Nations. [...] The IAEA established such an agreement with the UN in 1957, and the OPCW and the CTBTO used this model for agreements of their own with the UN.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1990s, {{there was}} {{contrasting}} views among member {{states for the}} agency's future. There was a growing realization among the member states that the organization's business assets needed to be privatized, {{mainly because of the}} competitive nature of the satellite communication industry and the unwillingness of many member states to invest money into INMARSAT to improve its network. There were also many which believed in the importance of maintaining the organization's role in overseeing maritime satellite communication. The issue was resolved in a session in April 1998, which resulted in the Convention on the <b>International</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Organization, in which the operational assets would be split and privatized while the agency would continue as a regulatory organization.|$|R
50|$|On 11 May 2004 Lockheed Martin {{announced}} that Intelsat, Ltd. would acquire Lockheed Martin's COMSAT General business for $90 million.

50|$|Satellite systems {{operated}} by the Inmarsat company, overseen by the <b>International</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Organization (IMSO) are also important elements of the GMDSS. The types of Inmarsat ship earth station terminals recognized by the GMDSS are: Inmarsat B, C and F77. Inmarsat B and F77, {{an updated version of}} the now redundant Inmarsat A, provide ship/shore, ship/ship and shore/ship telephone, telex and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Fleet 77 fully supports the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) and includes advanced features such as emergency call prioritisation. The Inmarsat C provides ship/shore, shore/ship and ship/ship store-and-forward data and email messaging, the capability for sending preformatted distress messages to a rescue coordination center, and the Inmarsat C SafetyNET service. The Inmarsat C SafetyNET service is a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high seas weather warnings, NAVAREA navigational warnings, radionavigation warnings, ice reports and warnings generated by the USCG-conducted International Ice Patrol, and other similar information not provided by NAVTEX. SafetyNET works similarly to NAVTEX in areas outside NAVTEX coverage.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the U. S. FCC has {{developed}} the regulatory {{structure for the}} provision of <b>mobile</b> services via <b>satellite.</b> In May 1989, the FCC awarded American <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Corporation (AMSC) a license to provide the full range of domestic <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> services in the U. S. At that time, the FCC reaffirmed the U. S. <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> industry structure and spectrum allocations that had been adopted previously. Also in May 1989, the FCC authorized the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), the U. S. Signatory to Inmarsat, to provide international aeronautical satellite service via the Inmarsat system. Earlier in 1989, the FCC permitted the use of Ku-band satellites to provide messaging and tracking services. In the mid- 1980 's, the FCC established the Radiodetermination Satellite Service and awarded licenses. Among the <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> matters currently facing the FCC are whether additional spectrum should be allocated for domestic 'generic' <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> services, the regulatory structure {{for the provision of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> service on an interim basis before AMSC launches its dedicated satellites, and whether to authorize a low earth orbit satellite system to provide mobile data service...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Communications Program of the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The program's objectives are {{to facilitate the}} deployment {{of the first generation}} commercial <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> by the private sector, and to technologically enable future generations by developing advanced and high risk ground and space segment technologies. These technologies are aimed at mitigating severe shortages of spectrum, orbital slot, and spacecraft EIRP which are expected to plague the high capacity <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> systems of the future. After a brief introduction of the concept of <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> systems and their expected evolution, this paper outlines the critical ground and space segment technologies. Next, the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Experiment (MSAT-X) is described. MSAT-X is the framework through which NASA will develop advanced ground segment technologies. An approach is outlined for the development of conformal vehicle antennas, spectrum and power-efficient speech codecs, and modulation techniques for use in the non-linear faded channels and efficient multiple access schemes. Finally, the paper concludes with a description of the current and planned NASA activities aimed at developing complex large multibeam spacecraft antennas needed for future generation <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{environmental}} restrictions on size, weight, and power consumption have severely limited both the processing and storage capacity of embedded signal processing systems. Today, however, as increases in processor speed and capabilities continually out-pace increases in memory densities and performance, processor capacity {{is no longer}} a major concern for many signal processing applications — memory usage is now the primary concern. We present techniques for managing the memory requirements of signal processing applications in the synthesis of a real-time uniprocessor system from processing graphs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our memory management techniques, we compare the memory requirements of a statically scheduled implementation of an INMARSAT (<b>International</b> Maritime <b>Satellite)</b> <b>mobile</b> receiver, with our dynamic scheduling techniques. The case study demonstrates that state-of-the-art, static schedulers use over 300 % more memory than our simple, preemptive, EDF scheduler for a large class of signal processing applications. 1...|$|R

50|$|GPS {{receiver}} manufacturers design GPS receivers to use spectrum {{beyond the}} GPS-allocated band. In some cases, GPS receivers {{are designed to}} use up to 400 MHz of spectrum in either direction of the L1 frequency of 1575.42 MHz, because <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> services in those regions are broadcasting from space to ground, and at power levels commensurate with <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> services. However, as regulated under the FCC's Part 15 rules, GPS receivers are not warranted protection from signals outside GPS-allocated spectrum. This is why GPS operates next to the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Service band, and also why the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> Service band operates next to GPS. The symbiotic relationship of spectrum allocation ensures that users of both bands are able to operate cooperatively and freely.|$|R
