40|$|To {{compare the}} effects of slow-release {{nitrogen}} fertilizer at six different levels on the flag leaf chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics of super hybrid rice, a field fertilization experiment was conducted with super hybrid rice Y Liangyou 1 as a test material. The photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR), effective quantum yield (EQY), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), and non-photochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ) of flag leaves were measured at the initial <b>heading,</b> <b>full</b> <b>heading,</b> 10 d after <b>full</b> <b>heading</b> and 20 d after <b>full</b> <b>heading</b> stages. Results showed that the values of ETR, EQY and qP increased with rice development from initial heading to 20 d after <b>full</b> <b>heading,</b> whereas the NPQ decreased. During the measured stages, ETR, EQY and qP increased initially and then decreased as nitrogen application amount increased, but they peaked at different nitrogen fertilizer levels. The maximum ETR and EQY values appeared at the treatment of 135 kg/hm 2 N.

25|$|This {{system was}} used {{extensively}} in Ancient China {{and in many}} other parts of the world. But this method was dangerous, and many boats were sunk by the torrent of water. Since this system necessarily involved lowering the level in the pound, it was not popular with millers who depended on a <b>full</b> <b>head</b> of water to operate their equipment. This led to constant battles, both legal and physical, between the navigation and milling interests, with rivers being closed to navigation if there was any shortage of water. It was mainly this conflict, which led to the adoption of the pound lock in medieval China, as this means that relatively little water is consumed by navigation.|$|E
25|$|Ghigny {{was awarded}} the Military William Order 3rd Class on 8 July 1815. He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general on 26 October 1826. During the Belgian Revolution he was in command at Ghent, which he declared {{in a state of}} siege. Soon after, he was placed on the inactive list and he received an honorable discharge from the Dutch Army on 31 December 1830. Ghigny entered Belgian service as a lieutenant general on 15 February 1831. He received the Belgian Order of Leopold on 9 July 1837 for meritorious service. He died on either 1 December or 30 November 1844. A sepia print from the 1800s shows Ghigny in a dark military coat with epaulettes and a single row of buttons on the front.

25|$|In Luthor's {{earliest}} appearances, he {{is shown}} as {{a middle-aged man}} with a <b>full</b> <b>head</b> of red hair. Less than a year later, however, an artistic mistake resulted in Luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip. The original error is attributed to Leo Nowak, a studio artist who illustrated for the Superman dailies during this period. One hypothesis is that Nowak mistook Luthor for the Ultra-Humanite, a frequent foe of Superman who, in his Golden Age incarnation, resembled a balding, elderly man. Other evidence suggests Luthor's design was confused {{with that of a}} stockier, bald henchman in Superman #4 (Spring 1940); Luthor's next appearance occurs in Superman #10 (May 1941), in which Nowak depicted him as significantly heavier, with visible jowls. The character's abrupt hair loss has been made reference to several times {{over the course of his}} history. When the concept of the DC multiverse began to take hold, Luthor's red-haired incarnation was rewritten as Alexei Luthor, Lex's counterpart from the Earth-Two parallel universe. In 1960, writer Jerry Siegel altered Luthor's backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin.|$|E

25|$|Luthor {{decides to}} fake {{his own death}} by {{piloting}} a prototype jet on a proposed trip {{around the world and}} crashing it in the Andes; this is merely a cover for the removal of his brain from his cancer-ridden body and the growth of a cloned body around it, whereupon he passes himself off as his hitherto unknown, illegitimate 21-year-old son and heir, Lex Luthor II. His deception is benefited by a vibrant new body with a beard and <b>full</b> <b>head</b> of red hair, as well as assuming an Australian accent as part of his fake backstory. As Luthor II, he inherits control of LexCorp and seduces Supergirl (a protoplasmic clone of an alternate universe Lana Lang), due to his resemblance to her creator (the alternate universe's Luthor). Luthor's clone body eventually begins to deteriorate and age (and lose its hair) at a rapid rate, a side-effect of a disease that affects all clones. Meanwhile, Lois Lane discovers proof of Luthor's clone harvesting and false identity; with help from Superman, she exposes the truth, and a despondent Superman helps to apprehend Luthor. In the end, Luthor becomes a permanent prisoner in his own body, unable to even blink, and swearing vengeance on Superman.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} high {{temperature}} on rice yield has been evaluated by using simulation models or conducting experiments with controlled high temperature and sowing times. In this paper, observed {{daily maximum temperature}} data at 6 representative stations in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Valley (MLYRV) from 1984 to 2013 was analyzed to examine the daily relationship between rice seed setting rate (RSSR) and the maximum temperature by {{using data from the}} mid-season late-maturing indica rice variety regional experiments conducted in field conditions at the same representative stations from 2004 to 2011 (totally using 615 samples and 69 rice varieties). The results indicated that RSSR appears to be sensitive to high temperature from 36 days before <b>full</b> <b>heading</b> to 4 days before <b>full</b> <b>heading</b> (with the significance of the negative correlation between RSSR and maximum temperature in this period above 99  % confidence level) and the most sensitive at about 14 days before <b>full</b> <b>heading</b> (near the meiosis phase), indicating that for the mid-season late-maturing indica rice variety in the MLYRV, more attention should be paid to the high temperature damage at the meiosis stage. According to the extracted high temperature sensitive period, statistical forecast models were established to predict the regional rice high temperature damage in the MLYRV by using atmospheric circulation indices in preceding 12  months with a correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed heat stress index of 0. 95 and a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 28. 4  %. In addition, a high temperature-induced rice sterility simulation model was also used to quantitatively forecast the meiosis phase high temperature influence on rice at the site scale. The NRMSE of the simulated and forecasted relative seed setting rate was 4. 74  % and 2. 84  %, respectively. In conclusion, the presented prediction models were useful to improve the rice high temperature damage forecast and were expected to be helpful to rice high temperature disaster prevention and reduction in the MLYRV...|$|R
500|$|The filmmakers {{intended}} {{to create a}} very mobile Batsuit {{that would allow the}} wearer to move easily to fight and crouch.

Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed [...] "Cape Town", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.|$|E
500|$|Designed to be [...] "harder and wilder" [...] {{than the}} {{original}} Mega Man, Zero's design ultimately resembled Mega Man X in several ways due to his initial character concept, Inafune's insistence on drawing the character, and input from other project artists.
