5|$|In New York Bond meets up {{with his}} {{counterpart}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> Felix Leiter. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E
5|$|Argo is a 2012 {{political}} thriller {{directed by}} Ben Affleck, and produced by Grant Heslov, Affleck and George Clooney. The screenplay by Chris Terrio {{was adapted from}} sections of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative Tony Mendez's memoir The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> and the 2007 Wired article The Great Escape by Joshuah Bearman on the Canadian Caper. The film stars Affleck as Mendez, who attempts to rescue six United States diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979–81 Iran hostage crisis by pretending that {{they are part of}} a film crew scouting the country for the filming of a fictitious science-fiction film, Argo.

5|$|Smith {{is remembered}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> {{as its first}} {{successful}} Director of Central Intelligence, {{and one of its}} most effective, who redefined its structure and mission. The CIA's expansive covert action program remained the responsibility of Frank Wisner's quasi-independent Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), but Smith began to bring OPC under the DCI's control. In early January 1951 he made Allen Dulles the first Deputy Director for Plans (DDP), to supervise both OPC and the CIA's separate espionage organization, the Office of Special Operations (OSO). Not until January 1952 were all intelligence functions consolidated under a Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI). Wisner succeeded Dulles as DDP in August 1951, and it took until August 1952 to merge the OSO and the OPC, each of which had its own culture, methods, and pay scales, into an effective, single directorate.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the book}} Charlie Wilson's War, he unofficially advised his {{associates}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Junta to assassinate Andreas Papandreou. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1980s while at Langley, Avrakotos led Operation Cyclone, the largest covert operation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> history.

Avrakotos eventually met congressman Charlie Wilson of Texas's 2nd congressional district. Together they collaborated to massively increase funding for the rebels, and together helped persuade officials from Egypt, Pakistan, China, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere to increase support for the cause. Avrakotos also plucked Michael G. Vickers from obscurity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> paramilitary group to revamp the strategy for the Mujahideen.

25|$|Use {{of gross}} {{domestic}} product or gross national product should be treated with caution as this does not accurately measure a country's ability to provide aid. Similarly, whether to use 'nominal' or 'real' GNP/GDPs can be argued. Some GDP/GNP figures are also out of date e.g. for the year 2002, or even 2001, so comparisons between countries may not be for the same time period. A better comparison might be used by examining purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP/GNP figures (as used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> factbook).|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his senior}} status <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> Gates was close to many figures who played {{significant}} roles in the Iran-Contra Affair and {{was in a position}} to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the U.S. do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the Sandinista government. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment of Gates for his Iran-Contra activities or his responses to official inquiries.|$|E
