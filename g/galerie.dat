5|$|During the Restoration (1814–30), LouisXVIII and CharlesX {{between them}} added 135pieces {{at a cost}} of 720,000francs and created the {{department}} of Egyptian antiquities curated by Champollion, increased by more than 7,000works with the acquisition of antiquities in the Edme-Antoine Durand, the Egyptian collection of Henry Salt or the second collection former by Bernardino Drovetti. This was less than the amount given for rehabilitation of Versailles, and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris. After the creation of the French Second Republic in 1848, the new government allocated twomillion francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the <b>Galerie</b> d'Apollon, the Salon Carré, and the Grande <b>Galérie.</b> In 1861, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte bought 11,835artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the Campana collection. During the Second French Empire, between 1852 and 1870, the French economy grew; by 1870 the museum had added 20,000new pieces to its collections, and the Pavillon de Flore and the Grande <b>Galérie</b> were remodelled under architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel.|$|E

5|$|De l'Orme's {{original}} {{plans have}} not survived. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, however, has left us {{a set of}} plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so {{is likely to have}} been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's. It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments. Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the Petite <b>Galerie,</b> was completed in her lifetime. It was left to Henry IV, who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the Grande <b>Galerie</b> that finally linked the two palaces.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} palace has been home to three of Strasbourg's most {{important}} museums: the Archaeological Museum (Musée archéologique, basement), the Museum of Decorative Arts (Musée des arts décoratifs, ground floor) and the Museum of Fine Arts (Musée des beaux-arts, first and second floor). The municipal art gallery, <b>Galerie</b> Robert Heitz, in a lateral wing of the palace, is used for temporary exhibitions. The Palais Rohan has been listed since 1920 as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} from 1935 to 1956, Jolin {{spent much of his}} time travelling. In 1954, he toured the United States with an exhibition. It was opened in January, by Swedish {{ambassador}} Erik Boheman, at <b>Galerie</b> St. Etienne in New York. Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld, attended the exhibition and bought a painting depicting Riddarholmen for his study of the United Nations building. The exhibition was shown on national TV in the United States. Jolin also exhibited his works at galleries in several other countries, and in 1957, the Liljevalchs konsthall hosted a retrospective exhibition featuring over 200 of his paintings.|$|E
5|$|Many of Rix Nicholas's works {{went into}} private {{collections}} for which records are limited. Many more were burned {{in a fire}} at the family property after her death in the 1960s. Though her fortunes declined {{in the latter part}} of her career, the twenty-first century saw a renewed appreciation of her output. Her oeuvre is represented in most major Australia public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Queensland Art Gallery, as well as in other collections including that of the Australian War Memorial. Internationally, Rix Nicholas is represented in the <b>Galerie</b> nationale du Jeu de Paume and Leicester Gallery, as well as by her works in the Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{continued}} working, even at her wealthiest. Perhaps {{driven to}} express herself by the unfortunate circumstances in her life, {{along with the}} needs of her family, she delved into different types of art. She learned sculpture at the hand of Auguste Rodin and had several exhibitions of sculptures and paintings in Paris and the United States. These works were more experimental in nature, and largely influenced by dreams and mythology. O'Neill spent 1921 to 1926 living in Paris. While there, she was elected to the Société Coloniale des Artistes Français in 1921, and had exhibitions of her sculptures at the <b>Galerie</b> Devambez in Paris and the Wildenstein Galleries in New York in 1921 and 1922, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The archaic is {{demonstrated}} by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long <b>Galerie</b> Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E
5|$|The museum lies in {{the center}} of Paris on the Right Bank. The neighborhood, known as the 1st arrondissement, was home to the former Tuileries Palace, which closed off the western end of the Louvre {{entrance}} courtyard, but was heavily damaged by fire during the Paris Commune of 1871 and later demolished. The adjacent Tuileries Gardens, created in 1564 by Catherine de' Medici, was designed in 1664 by André Le Nôtre. The gardens house the <b>Galerie</b> nationale du Jeu de Paume, a contemporary art exhibition space which was used to store confiscated Jewish cultural property during the 1940 to 1944 German occupation of France. Parallel to the Jeu de Paume is the Orangerie, home to the famous Water Lilies paintings by Claude Monet.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the <b>Galerie</b> d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to {{the fragility of the}} paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} was rebuilt, {{the architect}} Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading {{on the upper}} level. Today the upper arcades are known as the <b>Galerie</b> d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honoré II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On {{the other side of}} the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, 1937 and 1938, Pinchon {{exhibited}} multiple times: at the 27th Salon des artistes rouennais (Rouen), <b>Galerie</b> Reitlinger (Paris), <b>Galerie</b> des Artistes Modernes (Paris), Maison the la Culture (Rouen), {{and three}} shows at <b>Galerie</b> Legrip (Rouen).
