25|$|Exhaust valves are {{necessary}} to prevent the diver inhaling water, and to allow a negative pressure difference to be induced over the diaphragm to control the demand valve. The exhaust valves should operate at a very small pressure difference, and cause as little resistance to flow as reasonably possible, without being cumbersome and bulky. Elastomer mushroom valves serve the purpose adequately, though duckbill valves were also common in twin-hose regulators. Where {{it is important to}} avoid leaks back into the regulator, such as when diving in contaminated water, a system of two sets of valves in series can reduce the risk of contamination. A more complex option which can be used for surface supplied helmets, is to use a reclaim exhaust system which uses a separate <b>flow</b> <b>regulator</b> to control the exhaust which is returned to the surface in a dedicated hose in the umbilical.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{sophisticated}} water-powered astronomical clock was Al-Jazari's castle clock, {{considered by some}} to be an early example of a programmable analog computer, in 1206. It was a complex device that was about [...] high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and a pointer {{in the shape of the}} crescent moon which traveled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour. It was possible to re-program the length of day and night in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year, and it also featured five musician automata who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel.

40|$|Vortex <b>flow</b> <b>regulators</b> (VFR) {{are used}} in urban {{drainage}} systems {{as a replacement for}} traditional flow throttling devices. Vortex regulators are not only very efficient energy dissipators but also atomizers which are beneficial for sewer aeration. A deficit of dissolved oxygen can be a problem in both natural waters and sewerage. Hydrodynamic <b>flow</b> <b>regulators</b> can boost oxygen concentration preventing putrefaction and improving treatment of stormwater and wastewater. We were first to investigate the aeration efficiency of semi-commercial scale cylindrical vortex <b>flow</b> <b>regulators</b> to determine the potential of their application in environmental engineering and to propose modification to enhance the aeration capacity of basic designs. Different device geometries and arrangements of active outlets for both single and double discharge vortex regulators were tested in a recirculating system. In this study, we present a concise review of the current state of our extensive research on the aeration efficiency of vortex <b>flow</b> <b>regulators</b> and their application in sewerage systems...|$|R

5000|$|The first barrier {{across the}} Barwon {{was built in}} 1838 to provide fresh water for Geelong.

Later it was protected permanently and its level of protection upgraded to that of game reserve.

40|$|AbstractAmong many {{practical}} applications in hydraulic engineering, rotational separators of a suspension and vortex flow controls {{may serve as}} especially interesting examples. This form of motion, despite some evident regularity, is a complex phenomenon so to describe it one should make use of CFD tools or pursue an experimental approach to the subject. Both of these possibilities are not very convenient, so any rational method that provides a possibility for calculating the velocity field and pressure distribution is welcome. For the considered class of technical objects, the family of kinematic models is to the purpose. The velocity field is described in this case by some algebraic relations, assumed arbitrarily {{on the basis of}} a qualitative evaluation of this field and the model constant is calculated from a delivered and dissipated energy in the energy balance. This method was effectively used in the description of rotational separators and pressure flow controls operation.
