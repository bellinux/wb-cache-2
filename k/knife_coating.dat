40|$|Purpose: Performance of DLC and W-DLC <b>coated</b> {{woodworking}} <b>knives</b> was investigated. The {{results of}} testing DLC and W-DLC coating properties {{as well as}} the results of life-time tests in the form of wear of HSS and HM knives with these coatings is presents. Design/methodology/approach: DLC coating was deposited by MCVA method, and W-DLC coating was deposited by pulsed RMS. Tests of <b>knives</b> <b>coated</b> with DLC and W-DLC as uncoated ones was made by machining: MDF board, pinewood slats and floorboard - using a typical industrial milling machine. Findings: DLC coating is significantly harder (33 - 40 GPa) than W-DLC coating (19 GPa). From Rockwell test it can be concluded that both coatings display high adhesion (HF 1), whereas in the scratch methods, significantly lower adhesion of DLC coating can be observed (LC 2 = 17 - 21 N) in comparison to W-DLC coating (LC 2 = 54 N). Influence of the hardness and adhesion of coatings on wear resistance of coated tools is discussed. Practical implications: Wear resistance of planer <b>knives</b> <b>coated</b> with DLC is by approx. 20 %, and W-DLC by approx. 30 % higher in comparison with uncoated knives during MDF milling. Wear of planer <b>knives</b> with W-DLC <b>coating</b> is approx. by 10 %, and DLC by approx. 25 % lower in comparison to uncoated HSS knives during pinewood milling. Lifetime of HM shape tools coated DLC and W-DLC is considerably higher (200 - 300 %) during floorboard milling. Originality/value: The industrial tests of cutting wood and wood-based materials indicate that the carbon coatings deposited on the tool generally improve its performance and all wear indexes for the tools are lower than for uncoated.

40|$|The {{increase}} of cutting performance of knifes attempt {{to enhance the}} abrasion resistance of the edge, for example with coatings. Nowadays there are sporadic applications using hardened steel knifes for non-shape cutting, which use a coating of Titanium, Chromium or Titanium aluminium nitride. Thereby are friction minimizing and abrasion protection more important than cutting performance enhancement. The paper describes the results of studies with <b>coated</b> <b>knives</b> which use a super hard Diamond Like Carbon coating (DLC). The trials show that the amorphous carbon coating improves the cutting output of hardened knives. The {{research shows that the}} cutting performance of technical knives can be enhanced through coatings. The amorphous hydrogen-free carbon coating obviously improves the cutting output of hardened stainless steel <b>knives.</b> <b>Coated</b> machine-guided paper <b>knives</b> show a double cutting performance compared to uncoated knifes. Furthermore the tests have not been performed to the end so the difference in practice might be higher than the test results in laboratory. By the coated samples the aimed sharpness protecting effect occurs. The protection of one edge side leads to wear on the uncoated side thus minimize the widing of the edge breadth. Therefore the sharpness of th <b>coated</b> <b>knife</b> stays on longer. To achieve such good results it was very important to produce a very adhesive coating. For that reason the pre-treatment of the sample before coating has been adjusted for this special base material. The micro edged geometry and the coating properties have to be adapted for each application. An integrated view which takes all those parameters into consideration fails. Even though the results show that coatings can improve the cutting performance of hardened knives, {{further research is needed to}} understand the adhesion problems of the coatings at the small edge. The behaviour of the coated side is different to the free surfaces because of its unequal properties. The influence of the roughness and the sharping method is not scientifically defined. The effect to the coated side adhesion is not quite clear and subject of further research. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACX Coating and Laminating offer a {{wide variety}} of methods by which one can process textile and film webs for various end uses. Choosing the best method is often {{dictated}} by the materials to be processed, the coating, the required properties of the finished product, and the cost-effectiveness of manufacture. A best syztcm is ultimately the one that gives you the product you want, manufactured by the most economical mcthod. To better determine a best way, one must know the various coating and laminating methods and understand the key principles o f their operation. This presentation reviews those methods and gives some of their special features. Coating is usually divided into three (3) major categories, namely, knife, roll, and speciality coating. Within each of these categories arc variations that should allow a manufacturer to select the best method by which to achieve the end product. Lamination can be either an adjunct to the coating process, or a separate process combining already existing webs. In the former, a laminate web can be bonded to a coated substrate as part of the coating process. In the latter, separate webs are com-bined either by using an adhesive or through thermal bonding.

In the last years, many {{studies have focused on}} gel properties of this biopolymer; but the agar films and coatings still have few studies reported. The edible film and coating have a protective function, preventing moisture, oxygen and flavour transfers between food and surroundings. The objectives of this work are the production of biodegradable agar films from Gracilaria vermiculophylla, collected in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, and the study of the effect of glycerol, an hydrophilic plasticizer, on the properties of the films and on subsequent application in edible coating of fresh fruits and vegetables. The agar extraction was carried out at specific optimum parameters determined in previous work (3. 5 h pre-treatment duration, 6 % NaOH concentration and 2 h extraction time). Agar films were made using the <b>knife</b> <b>coating</b> technique and compared with commercial agar. The physical properties of films such as hygroscopicity, mechanical resistance (Young’s modulus, tensile strength and elongation), and permeability to water vapour and oxygen were characterized.

The films were transparent and optically clear, showing good properties similar to the commercial agar films. The potential application of the agar/glycerol solution to fresh vegetable preservation was tested. Model fruits and vegetables were coated with the biopolymer/plasticizer solution and compared with a control sample in terms of colour, firmness, weight loss and shelf life.

The <b>knife</b> <b>coated</b> with 140  nm Al 2 O 3 ALD film (Fig.  3 c), where a 1  s TMA pulse and 4  s nitrogen purge (bottom) was used, showed no visible hazy regions in the coating (note that the colored areas {{at the tip of the}} knives are artifacts of edge diffraction, which produces dispersion according to wavelength, along with the chromatic aberration of the lens used in making the image; these are present even in the absence of a coating, as seen in Fig.  3 a). EDS analysis, shown in the second column of Table  1, revealed the presence of aluminum across the surface of the knife, indicating complete coverage by the Al 2 O 3 ALD film. Our results indicate that longer pulse and purge times are required for complex 3 D objects, particularly near supports, to allow the precursors and by-products adequate time to diffuse to all portions of the object. Understanding the precursor reaction and transport, tortuous diffusion paths and ALD chamber flow dynamics around complex objects is critical and an area of ongoing study [41 – 43]. While this topic is beyond the scope of this paper, we note that the apex of the prominent hazy plume in Fig.  3 b coincides with the position of one of the supports that was used to hold the knife in place.|$|R

40|$|In smart textiles, {{electrical}} conductivity is often required for several functions, especially contacting (electroding) and interconnecting. This thesis explores electrically conductive textile surfaces made by combining conventional textile coating methods with the intrinsically conductive polymer complex poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) -poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). PEDOT:PSS {{was used in}} textile coating formulations including polymer binder, ethylene glycol (EG) and rheology modifier. Shear viscometry was used to identify suitable viscosities of the formulations for each coating method. The coating methods were <b>knife</b> <b>coating,</b> pad coating and screen printing. The {{first part of the}} work studied the influence of composition of the coating formulation, the amount of coating and the film formation process on the surface resistivity and the surface appearance of knife-coated textiles. The electrical resistivity was largely affected by the amount of PEDOT:PSS in the coating and indicated percolation behaviour within the system. Addition of a high-boiling solvent, i. e. EG, decreased the surface resistivity with more than four orders of magnitude. Studies of tear strength and bending rigidity showed that textiles coated with formulations containing larger amounts of PEDOT:PSS and EG were softer, more ductile and stronger than those coated with formulations containing more binder. The coated textiles were found to be durable to abrasion and cyclic strain, as well as quite resilient to the harsh treatment of shear flexing. Washing increased the surface resistivity, but the samples remained conductive after five wash cycles. The second part of the work focused on using the coatings to transfer the voltage signal from piezoelectric textile fibres; the coatings were first applied using pad coating as the outer electrode on a woven sensor and then as screen-printed interconnections in a sensing glove based on stretchy, warp-knitted fabric. Sensor data from the glove was successfully used as input to a microcontroller running a robot gripper. These applications showed the viability of the concept and that the coatings could be made very flexible and integrated into the textile garment without substantial loss of the textile characteristics. The industrial feasibility of the approach was also verified through the variations of coating methods...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} and characterization of hybrid organic/inorganic membranes obtained from solutions, where the organic phase is the sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and the inorganic phase are silica nanoparticles obtained from the in situ "water free" sol-gel process of polyethoxysiloxane (PEOS). PEOS is a soluble and liquid hyperbranched polymer of low viscosity synthesized in our laboratories via a one pot reaction between tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and acetic anhydride. The PEOS used within this thesis contains ca 48 wt% of silica. The use of the polymeric silica precursor PEOS instead of the commonly used TEOS offers several advantages among which the need of less water for the conversion into silica, the possibility to modify the ethoxy end-groups so that functional groups can be anchored to the silica particles, and the higher thermal stability of PEOS that allows {{the application of the}} sol-gel method not only for the preparation of materials from solution but also from the melt. The aim of this research study was to establish a correlation between membranes’ morphology and proton conductivity, a property relevant for the application that motivated our research: proton exchange membranes for fuel cells. Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Their efficiency depends on the efficiency of the proton transport through the membranes. We postulate that the proton transport in hybrid membranes occurs at the interface between the organic and the inorganic phase. Therefore our efforts were addressed toward the preparation of SPEEK-silica membranes with the highest possible organic-inorganic surface area. In order to create a composite membrane with nanoscopic phase morphology, we followed a semi-interpenetrating network concept, where the phase separation occurs during film formation while one phase becomes highly crosslinked, i. e. the liquid PEOS is transformed into silica. We investigated the parameters that influence the final morphology {{in order to be able}} to control it. The morphology of the membranes was determined by transmission electron microscopy, while the proton mobility was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and 1 H solid state NMR. The membranes were prepared from solutions via centrifugal casting and <b>knife</b> <b>coating.</b> The solutions containing from 10 to 50 wt% of PEOS lead to tough samples containing ca 5 to 33 wt% of silica, mostly transparent or opalescent. Higher inorganic contents produced brittle membranes. The particles size can be controlled by selecting carefully the starting polymers: SPEEK prepared from the sulfonation of poly(ether ether ketone) in concentrated sulfuric acid without the addition of oleum and PEOS from which the low volatile fractions had been removed produced samples with smaller sizes and narrower particles size distribution. Other relevant parameters that influence the morphology are: (i) concentration of the solution; (ii) PEOS content; (iii) presence of a compatibilizer that reduces the SPEEK-PEOS phase separation (iv) presence of acidic doping agent that speeds up the conversion of PEOS; (v) presence of water in solution; (vi) stirring time and temperature; (vii) speed of solvent evaporation; (viii) membrane thickness. The non conductive silica generated from PEOS improves the proton mobility within the samples. It is speculated that this effect is due to: (i) the presence of silanol groups that help water retention on the surface of the silica particles, thus facilitating proton hopping between neighboring particles; (ii) the re-arrangements of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic microstructure of SPEEK during the transformation of PEOS into silica. The proton conductivity was enhanced by the introduction of small amounts of phosphotungstic acid, a heteropolyacid that exhibits high conductivity at room temperature. The formation of an ultrafine morphology was achieved by using a compatibilizer - N-(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) - 4, 5 -dihydroimidazole - that reduced the phase separation between SPEEK and PEOS via acid-base interaction with SPEEK and via condensation reaction with PEOS...|$|E
