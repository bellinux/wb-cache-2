The results show that, although for the zero transactions costs case above-normal returns are possible, these returns become negative when the bid-ask spread cost is taken into account. These results persist over the two sample periods studied. Two variations of the trading rule that compute model prices by using the same model but with two different estimators of the standard deviation of the underlying stock's return as inputs to the model, also produce similar results. The study concludes that, with respect to the trading rules used and the sample periods studied, there were no inefficiencies on the stock options market of the <b>European</b> <b>Options</b> <b>Exchange...</b>|$|R

40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} {{were introduced}} in 1981 when the <b>European</b> <b>Option</b> <b>Exchange</b> in Amster- dam was introduced. Despite some opinions that say that financial derivatives cause deformations in prices at financial markets, volume of sales of financial derivatives are annually rising. Financial derivatives brought with themselves large opportunities for position creating. They can be used not only for trading, but for hedging and arbitrage as well. Nowadays, financial derivatives, namely options, are used to provide new banking products of treasury management. Yields of treasury in- struments are in certain way derived from the yields gained from other regular financial instruments on financial market. Banks use option strategies to create financial positions that are divided into smaller parts and, consecutively, sold to clients of banks as new products. Especially, option strategies are used to emit investments certificates. Situation on financial markets forces banks to create new products that bring higher potential profits at lower level of risk. The investments certificates are one of favourite instruments used. The paper deals with option strategy and its usage in creating the treasury products in banks. We focus on Inverse Vertical Ratio Call Back Spread strategy as the one, {{which can be used}} for specific investment certificates creation. The aim of the paper is to find the way of creation of Spe- ed certificates, so called Sprint certificates, Double Chance certificates or Double-up certificates. We analyze this type of certificates, derive the profit function in analytical form and we propose the way of its creation through Inverse Vertical Ratio Call Back Spread option strategy...|$|E

This paper explores whether a multilayer backpropagation model offers exploitable profit opportunities for some limited period. Using an intradaytransaction dataset obtained from the <b>European</b> <b>Options</b> <b>Exchange</b> (Amsterdam), We attempted to predict the return on Philips. Two neural nets are contrasted to ordinary linear regression analysis on the basis of three benchmarks (MSE, and net realized returns).

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} systematic {{deviations of}} the observed futures price from the value predicted by the simple cost-of-carry relationship. A model to explain this deviation (the basis) is presented in Chen, Cuny, and Haugen (1995, henceforth CCH). According to CCH, the basis should be negatively related to the return volatility of the underlying instrument. CCH themselves find support for their model on data for S&P 500 contracts in the USA. However, since the data used by CCH in testing their model {{at least to some}} extent was familiar to them when developing the model, {{there is a need for}} a test on data that is completely independent of their data. The purpose of our study is to report the results of such a test. The data is for stock index futures on the <b>European</b> <b>Options</b> <b>Exchange</b> in Amsterdam. The period covered is 1991 through 1993. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the CCH model. An increase in perceived volatility of the underlying index will cause a drop in the basis, as well as an increase in the open interest on the futures market. ...|$|R

We study these pricing issues both under a risk neutral martingale measure and the historical measure. The dependence between the asset’s components is incorporated in the joint characteristic function of the MMLPs. As an example, we concentrate upon a regime-switching version of the model of Ballotta et al. (2015) in which the dependence structure is introduced in a flexible way.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of {{different}} stochastic processes which have a common feature: they are Markov-modulated, which means that their evolution rules depend on the state occupied by an underlying Markov process. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we analyse the stationary distribution and various first passage problems for Markov-modulated Brownian motions (MMBMs) as well as for two extensions: MMBMs with jumps and MMBMs modified by a temporary change of regime upon visits to level zero. The second part of this thesis {{is devoted to}} the use of Markov-modulated processes in mathematical finance, more precisely for the calculation of different option prices. We use a Fourier transform approach to price different <b>European</b> <b>options</b> (vanilla, <b>exchange</b> and quanto <b>options)</b> in the case where the value of the considered risky assets evolves like the exponential of a Markov-modulated Lévy process. The third part of this thesis {{is devoted to the}} study of some stochastic epidemic processes, namely the SIR processes. In our models, a Markov process is used to modulate the behaviour of the individuals who bring the disease. We use different martingale approaches as well as matrix analytic methods to obtain various information about the state of the population when the epidemic is over.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} quarter of 2006 Chicago Board <b>Options</b> <b>Exchange</b> (CBOE) introduced, as one of the listed products, options on its implied {{volatility}} index (VIX).

In this paper we propose a new approach to this problem using spectral methods. We use a regime switching model with jumps and local volatility defined in [1] and calibrate it to the <b>European</b> <b>options</b> on the S&P 500 for a broad range of strikes and maturities. The main idea {{of this paper is to}} “lift ” (i. e. extend) the generator of the underlying process to keep track of the relevant path information, namely the realized variance.

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>European</b> barrier <b>options</b> are path-dependent {{options in}} which the {{existence}} of the <b>European</b> <b>options</b> depends on whether the underlying asset price has touched a barrier level during the option life. They have emerged as significant products for hedging and investment in foreign exchange, equity, and commodity markets since the late 1980 s, largely in the overthe -counter (OTC) markets. The only barrier option that is traded on the <b>options</b> <b>exchanges</b> is the capped index spread on the S&P 100 and S&P 500. The cap is automatically exercised with a fixed profit when the underlying price closes beyond the barrier level. Thus the option is canceled with a fixed return at the barrier level. Its pricing and hedging are discussed by Chance (1994). An example of a barrier option is an up-and-out put. An investor could buy an up-and-out U. S. dollar put (Japanese yen call) instead of an ordinary U. S. dollar put to hedge the value of U. S. dollar versus Japanese yen. The put opti...|$|R
