50|$|Another {{solution}} considered—to {{raise the}} Merlion {{on a pedestal}} at its original location—was deemed unsuitable as the view would still be blocked by the bridge. Other possible relocation sites considered included Nicoll Highway <b>Extension</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Esplanade Park, Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, a promontory at Marina Centre (near where Singapore Flyer is located now), a promontory site at Bayfront (near the tip of Marina Bay Sands integrated resort) and Kim Seng Park.

40|$|The {{availability}} {{and quality of}} student housing is daunting, particularly in Auckland. While developers move quickly, extending university campuses and building fast, cheap apartments, a blind eye is turned to the rapid changes in post-compulsory education, influenced particularly by digital technology. As student numbers continue to increase within tertiary institutes, as well as outside through online courses, an increasing pressure {{is placed on the}} quality and location of where learning might actually take place. Too many graduate students cannot find work, either due to little work available in their industry or employers’ anxiety at hiring a graduate with little or no work experience. The question for the architectural profession is: Does architecture {{have a role to play}} in helping students make a smoother transition from tertiary studies into the working world? This project is an exploration, based on literature reviews and precedent studies, into how a live, learn and work environment can be designed to encourage students to integrate with one another, form relationships and gain experience from a co-operative working community, thus preparing them better for their future at work. Throughout the design process, various concepts and attempts to resolve issues are made. The final design will aim to provide a glimpse into the future of student residences, supportive live-learn-work spaces that create interactive and co-operative communities, enhancing individual growth and development, research and innovation. Whilst various research and design findings have been identified in the text, the final outcome of the design process is indicative in nature, with scope for further architectural and interior development to be presented at the final design presentation Site: Totara Avenue, Clark Street <b>Extension</b> <b>Bridge</b> carpark, New Lynn, Aucklan...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBacteria {{are known}} to {{communicate}} primarily via secreted extracellular factors. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized type of bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes that bridge neighboring cells. Using Bacillus subtilis as a model organism, we visualized transfer of cytoplasmic fluorescent molecules between adjacent cells. Additionally, by coculturing strains harboring different antibiotic resistance genes, we demonstrated that molecular exchange enables cells to transiently acquire nonhereditary resistance. Furthermore, nonconjugative plasmids could be transferred from one cell to another, thereby conferring hereditary features to recipient cells. Electron microscopy revealed the existence of variously sized tubular <b>extensions</b> <b>bridging</b> neighboring cells, serving as a route for exchange of intracellular molecules. These nanotubes also formed in an interspecies manner, between B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and even between B. subtilis and the evolutionary distant bacterium Escherichia coli. We propose that nanotubes represent a major form of bacterial communication in nature, providing a network for exchange of cellular molecules within and between species. PaperFlic...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{retrospective}} clinical study, 58 patients were examined 4 to 8 years (median 77 months) following {{the incorporation of}} a fixed reconstruction. No regular maintenance care had been provided during the interval period. The periodontal conditions represented by the Plaque Control Record (PCR), the Gingival Index (GI) and pocket probing depths were examined on 182 abutment teeth of 94 reconstructions. Pulpal vitality and periapical pathology were assessed clinically as well as radiographically. The periodontal parameters of the abutment teeth were compared with homologous contralateral uncrowned teeth. Significantly higher plaque prevalence, gingival indices, and pocket probing depths {{were found in the}} crowned teeth. Also, bleeding on probing was observed more frequently whenever the crown margins were located subgingivally. At the end of the interval period, 3. 7 % of the originally vital abutments had lost their vitality. A technical failure rate of 7. 4 % with no apparent differences between conventional and <b>extension</b> <b>bridges</b> was noted. This study indicates that even with precise marginal fit {{and in the absence of}} a regular maintenance program, the supragingival location of the crown margin is more favourable than the subgingival location for the maintenance of oral health. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) {{and rice}} genetic {{improvement}} are proposed as two approaches to improving and increasing rice production. In recent exchanges, {{they have been}} represented by their respective supporters as starkly contrasting, almost mutually incompatible alternatives. However, advocates {{on both sides of}} this argument have tended to stress the genetic and physiological characteristics of rice plants and place less emphasis on the spatially and temporally situated knowledge and management skills of farmers, which are the means by which any agricultural technology is locally adapted and integrated into livelihood strategies, and technological potential is translated into real outcomes in specific settings. Taking this proposition seriously would entail a substantial reorganisation of agricultural research and <b>extension,</b> <b>bridging</b> the historical divide between these two wings of professional agronomy. It would require agronomists of both types to work more collaboratively with farmers. It would also require scientists to produce new kinds of outputs, such as analytical frameworks, heuristics and decision-making tools to help farmers apply scientific insights to their own constrained circumstances. This argument is made with reference to the cases of SRI (a cultivation system that is said to boost farm yields without the need for genetically improved germplasm) and C 4 rice (a crop-improvement project intending to ‘supercharge’ rice photosynthesis to increase rice yields). The paper uses the agronomic concepts of the ‘yield gap’ and the ‘yield ceiling’ to offer a perspective on strategic questions about the goals and organisation of agricultural research and extension...|$|R
