40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{secondary}} infection with Toxoplasma gondii on antibody responses to unrelated antigens was examined in mice. A reinfection with 5 X 10 (3) organisms did not affect either primary anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> responses, or anti-dinitrophenol antibody responses to dinitrophenylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. With an increase of the reinfection dose to 2. 5 X 10 (4) organisms, suppression of anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> responses was induced. By contrast, in the primary infection, the anti-sheep erythrocyte and anti-dinitrophenol antibody responses were markedly suppressed by an injection with only 5 X 10 (2) or 1 X 10 (3) T. gondii organisms. Plastic-adherent cells of spleens from mice reinfected with 2. 5 X 10 (4) organisms showed a strong suppressor activity in an in vitro primary anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> response system. These results demonstrate that a nonspecific suppression of antibody responses is provoked by a secondary T. gondii infection, only when mice receive {{a large number of}} organisms in the reinfection, and the suppressed antibody responses seem to be caused by an activation of suppressor cells that adhere to plastic...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The passive {{transfer}} of sera containing a {{high concentration of}} anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> to juvenile chickens resulted in antibody mediated suppression of the primary hemagglutination response. This immunosuppression was not dependent upon having antibody in the system for several hours prior to the introduction of the antigen or upon multiple injections of the antisera. It appears that antibody mediated suppression in the young chicken is not mechanistically dependent upon the amount of antibody which is transferred or upon antibody being present in circulation for several hours prior to the antigen challenge...|$|R
40|$|BALB/c mice {{have been}} immunized by {{intravenous}} administration of native or reduced and alkylated lysozyme. Primary immune {{response to these}} antigens was studied at the humoral level (by the Farr assay) and at the cellular level (by the rosette and the plaque assays using lysozyme coupled to sheep or pigeon <b>erythrocytes).</b> <b>Antibodies</b> and theta-negative RFC were specific for the antigen used for immunization. Specific inhibition of theta-negative RFC after incubation with the soluble immunizing antigen confirmed this specificity. Conversely, most theta-positive RFC had double specificity both to native and denatured lysozyme and showed lower avidity for the immunizing antigen, as shown by inhibition studies with soluble antigen. These data suggest that T cells have a broader specificity for lysozyme than B cells and also that, in this particular system, cytophilic antibodies are probably {{not responsible for the}} formation of theta-positive rosettes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Cold {{agglutinin}} {{disease is}} an uncommon hemolytic anemia associated sometimes withlow-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. The disease results from increased production of anti <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Standard treatment is mostly unsuccesful. Patient and A 76 -years-old patient is presented who {{was diagnosed with}} hemolytic anemia caused bymethods cold agglutinins. Later a bone marrow located B cell CD 20 non Hodgkin lymphoma wasdiagnosed. Standard treatment was unsuccesful, so she received rituximab. After 3 cyclesthe signs of hemolysis disappeared and the hemoglobin level normalized. The patient istreated every 3 months with rituximab and is in complete remission. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with rituximab is used also for treating immune cytopenias. There are somereports of treating cold agglutinin anemia, where standard treatment is mostly withoutsuccess. As this is a rare disease only some small studies and case reports have demonstrated the beneficial effect of rituximab on this type of anemia. Despite its high price,rituximab has numerous advantages: immediate and long lasting effect and relatively fewside effect...|$|R
40|$|Cell-mediated {{immunity}} was {{induced by}} the injection of a low dose of sheep erythrocytes in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. This state of cell-mediated immunity was found to correlate with a reduce capacity of the spleen cells taken from such animals three days after priming to produce anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> in vitro. Evidence presented suggested that the depression {{is due to a}} competition between the cell mediated and humoral responses for the same thymus-derived lymphocyte. Thymus-derived lymphocytes perform a helper function in the synthesis of anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies in mice. The helper cell could be replaced by a cell-free supernatant derived from short term culture of the thymus-derived cells with the antigen. This supernatant "factor" was shown to be heat labile, non-dialysable and immunologically specific.

40|$|Humoral {{immunoglobulin}} synthesis {{has been}} studied in two adult urodeles, Pleurodeles waltlii Michah. and Triturus alpestris Laur. following SRBC immunization. The specific antibody response is detected after {{a long period of}} immunization and is due exclusively to 'incomplete' antibodies which are unable to induce agglutination. The antibody titre is essentially dependent on the number of stimulations rather than on the dose or nature of the antigen (papainized or normal <b>erythrocytes).</b> <b>Antibodies</b> are detected in only 50 per cent of the immunized animals, 50 per cent never respond. This suggests that the latter group does not possess the genetic equipment (Ir genes) to recognize the antigenic determinants and to synthesize the corresponding antibodies. The sedimentation coefficient of the synthesized immunoglobulins was investigated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and their characterization was carried out by starch and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With this peculiar antigen even after a booster injection, only one class of immunoglobulin, an 18 - 2 S IgM could be detected...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of influenza virus (INFV) -induced immunosuppression and {{the mode of}} inosiplex action against INFV infection were studied. INFV suppressed both anti-lipopolysaccharide and anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> production in mice. INFV infection caused viral mRNA synthesis and increased total RNA synthesis in lymphocytes, but total mRNA synthesis was decreased. The translational ability of INFV-infected lymphocytes was also suppressed. Thus, INFV seemed to cause suppression of both mRNA synthesis and the translational ability of lymphocytes, resulting in suppression of lymphocyte functions. Inosiplex potentiated antibody production against sheep erythrocytes but not against lipopolysaccharide in normal and INFV-infected mice. Adamantanamine did not produce such a potentiating effect. The lymphocytes obtained from INFV-immunized and inosiplex-treated mice conferred resistance against INFV infection. This resistance was partially inhibited by anti-Thy 1. 2 antibody treatment of the lymphocytes. In an adoptive cell transfer system, inosiplex treatment of T-cell donors potentiated antibody production when a non-immunosuppressive carrier (human serum albumin) was used. When an immunosuppressive carrier (INFV) was used, inosiplex treatment of either B-cell donors or T-cell donors increased antibody production. Direct introduction of inosiplex into lymphocytes by a cell fusion technique stimulated anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> production more effectively than the addition of inosiplex to cultures. Inosiplex increased total RNA and total mRNA syntheses in phytohemagglutinin-treated lymphocytes. In INFV-infected lymphocytes, inosiplex decreased syntheses of total RNA, total mRNA, and viral mRNA and restored translational ability. From these results, we concluded that inosiplex penetrates into lymphocytes and suppresses viral RNA synthesis and that it supports lymphocyte functions by promoting RNA synthesis and translational ability, {{both of which are}} necessary for hosts...|$|E
40|$|In {{the acute}} phase of Toxoplasma infection, the {{function}} of both helper T and B cells was suppressed in primary antibody responses to dinitrophenol (DNP) -conjugated protein antigens. During the course of infection, the suppressive effect on T cells seems to continue longer than that on B cells, since suppression in responses to sheep erythrocytes, a T-dependent antigen, persisted longer than those to DNP-Ficoll, a T-independent antigen. Plastic-adherent cells from the spleens of Toxoplasma-infected and X-irradiated (400 rads) mice had strong suppressor activity in primary anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> responses of normal mouse spleen cells in vitro. These {{data suggest that the}} activation of irradiation-resistant and plastic-adherent suppressor cells causes the suppression of both T and B cells in Toxoplasma-infected mice...|$|E
40|$|Migraine {{is mostly}} mis-diagnosed, {{and even when}} {{correctly}} diagnosed does not receive desired attention. This study was aimed at assessing the levels of antiphospholipid <b>antibody,</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> sedimentation rate and platelets during migraine attack so as to provide physicians and allied healthcare professionals with guidelines for the diagnosis and subsequent management of migraine in clinical practice. One hundred consecutive adult (18 years and above) patients that met the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine who attended the Neurology Clinic of the Department of Medicine, University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Maiduguri from May, 2009 to December, 2010 and from whom {{informed consent was obtained}} were evaluated for this disorder. General, physical and neurological examinations were also conducted. Samples were taken for haematological and immunological analyses before and after acute therapy. Acute migraine attack caused a statistical significant increase in the levels of antiphospholipid <b>antibody,</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> sedimentation rate and platelets among the migraineurs studied (p< 0. 001). Acute migraine therapy significantly reduced the levels of laboratory parameters studied among migraineurs with either moderate or severe attack (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background. Hemolytic {{disease of}} the fetus and newborn (HDFN) {{develops}} because of the passage of maternal erythrocyte alloantibodies through the placenta. These antibodies cause a reduction of the erythrocyte life span in the fetus and newborn. This severe form of the disease is most commonly caused by anti-D antibodies. Besides those, the hemolytic disease can also be caused by anti-K, anti-c, anti-E, anti-A, anti-B and some other antibodies. Methods and material. A case of a pregnant {{woman who has been}} pregnant four times is presented. During the first pregnancy, she developed anti-D <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and after the third pregnancy also additional anti-C antibodies. During the first pregnancy, hemolytic disease of fetus led to the intrauterine death of the fetus. The second child died one day after birth. The third and fourth fetuses required several intrauterine exchange transfusions due to high titers and great hemolytic activity of anti-D antibodies. In both newborns, exchange transfusions had to be performed after birth, and both received additional transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes because of anemia. Conclusions.

Addition of purified protein derivative (PPD) to spleen cell cultures prepared from animals previously sensitized to Mycobacterium bovis reversed the immunosuppression caused by passive antibody. Passive antibody regulation was dose dependent; low doses of anti-sheep erythrocyte antiserum caused enhancement, whereas higher doses resulted in complete inhibition of anti-sheep erythrocyte responses. Addition of PPD to cultures of sensitized cells containing passive antibody resulted in progressively increased antibody responses as the dose of anti-sheep <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> increased.

40|$|Insulin, as well {{as other}} ligands which {{increase}} intracellular guanosine 3 ', 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), augments thymic-derived (T) - lymphocyte effector activity as revealed by alloimmune lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. The observation that insulin binds only to monocytes among circulating nonimmune human mononuclear cells fosterd reexamination of the mechanism by which insulin augments T-lymphocyte function. This report concerns a test of the hypothesis that the T cell is directly affected by insulin and that an insulin receptor emerges upon T lymphocytes consequent to immune activation. Spleens were removed from rats skin grafted across a major histocompatibility barrier. Lymphocytes were harvested from Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients and subsequently enriched for T cells by passage over one or two nylon wool columns. This population was composed of more than 98 % T cells as assessed by surface marker techniques (Ig staining, <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody,</b> and <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> complement rosetting, anti-T staining). There was no loss of augmentation of lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity induced by insulin, carbamycholine, and 8 -bromo-cGMP in the purified cells when compared to unfractionated cells 7 days after transplantation. 125 I-insulin bound saturably to the allostimulated T-enriched lymphocytes with maximum binding at 12. 8 +/- 0. 2 pg and a dissociation constant at equilibrium of 1. 3 nM. In contrast, insulin receptors were not present on nonimmune T-enriched cells or on T cells from animals that received syngeneic grafts. The affinity of the lymphocyte insulin receptor was similar to that of more conventional insulin-sensitive tissues e. g., liver, adipocyte. After 89 % of T cells from spleens on day 7 were lysed with anti-thy 1. 1 antibody and complement, the ability to measure specific insulin binding was lost. These data confirm a physiologic role for insulin in T-lymphocyte effector function and describe the emergence of insulin receptors concomitant with cell sensitivity to ligand. Such receptors {{may play a role in}} hormonal modulation of the immune response...|$|E
40|$|The T-lymphotropic lentivirus, feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) is now recognised {{as a major}} viral pathogen affecting domestic cat populations worldwide. A rapid, autologous red cell agglutination test for antibodies to FIV has been developed. A synthetic peptide analog corresponding to the immunodominant epitope within the FIV transmembrane glycoprotein gp 40 residues (680 - 715) KVEAMEKFLYTAFAMQELGC (Acm) NQNQFFK(BrAc) KIPLELWTR was conjugated to an anti-feline <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> using a thio-ether linkage. Within 3 min of adding this reagent to 20 μl of whole blood, circulating antibody to the peptide epitope caused agglutination of the red blood cells. The performance of this simple test is comparable with the two commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits and an EIA based on this peptide. A variant of the gp 40 (680 - 715) peptide corresponding to the FIV, PPR strain gp 40 (678 - 716) sequence was also synthesised and no difference in reactivity was observed in an EIA on 211 seropositive samples, indicating that the peptide-based test may be applicable to other known strains of the virus...|$|E

40|$|Complement {{activation}} {{on human}} platelets {{is known to}} cause platelet degranulation and activation. To evaluate how normal platelets escape complement attack in vivo, we studied the fate of murine platelets deficient in 2 membrane complement regulatory proteins using an adoptive transfer model. We show here that deficiency of either decay-accelerating factor (DAF) or complement receptor 1 –related gene/protein y (Crry) on murine platelets was inconsequential, whereas DAF and Crry double deficiency led to rapid clearance of platelets from circu-lation in a complement- and macrophage-dependent manner. This finding contrasted with the observation on erythrocytes, where Crry deficiency alone resulted in complement susceptibility. Quantitative flow cytometry revealed that DAF and Crry were expressed at similar levels on platelets, whereas Crry expression was 3 times higher than DAF on <b>erythrocytes.</b> <b>Antibody</b> blocking or gene ablation of the newly identified complement receptor CRIg, but not complement receptor 3 (CR 3), rescued DAF/Crry-deficient platelets from complement-dependent elimination. Surprisingly, deficiency of CRIg, CR 3, and other known complement receptors failed to prevent Crry-deficient erythrocytes from complement-mediated clearance. These results show a critical but redundant role of DAF and Crry in platelet survival and suggest that complement-opsonized platelets and erythrocytes engage different complement receptors on tissue macrophages in vivo...|$|R

However, this response was markedly suppressed in HBO-treated mice. The suppression {{is dependent on the}} duration of HBO and it works on the early and the late stage of antibody responses. HBO suppresses the development of both sheep erythrocyte-specific B cells and helper T cells after the immunization. Then, we tried to expose autoimmune mice to HBO. Spontaneous immunoglobulin production of NZB and MRL/lpr spleen cells was also significantly suppressed by HBO. Furthermore, long term HBO exposure results in the suppression of the development of autoimmune symptoms such as proteinuria, facial erythema and lymphadenopathy in MRL/lpr mice. All these results suggest that HBO is applicable for the treatment of autoimmune diseases...|$|E

For producing SBF, de novo protein is required, but not DNA or DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. This mediator is {{released into the}} culture supernatant of FcR gamma + B cells during 6 to 48 hr after stimulation by EA. SBF suppresses the proliferation of B, but not non-B cells.

T cells were identified by their capacity to spontaneously form rosettes with SRBCs. The percentage of B lymphocytes was determined by the <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> complement (EAC) rosette-forming test. The EAC complex was prepared with either whole rabbit anti-SRBC serum or with the IgM fraction of rabbit anti-SRBC serum. The two kind of erythrocyte complement rosette-forming cells (EAC-RFC) are designated erythrocyte-haemolysin-complement RFC (EA(H) C-RFC), and erythrocyte-IgM-complement RFC (EA(M) C-RFC). The percentage of total lymphocytes and T cells was not altered in MG patients. The percentage of 'active' T cells, which have been considered to be more actively involved in cellular immunity, was also similar in MG patients and controls. A significant increase in EA(H) C-RFC occurred in both thymectomized and non-thymectomized MG patients, while in B cells detected by EA(M) C-RFC no alterations were found. The increase in EA(H) C-RFC in lymphocytes from MG patients may be due to an increase in the 19 S antibody-forming B lymphocytes or to an increase in T cells which have Fc receptors on their surface...|$|E

This naturally occuring killer (NK) cell had low adherent properties and had the morphological appearance of a lymphocyte. Still it lacked surface characteristics of mature T or B lymphocytes. In the present report a functional study was carried out, comparing in parallel the NK system, the T-cell killing across an H- 2 barrier (anti-P 815), and the antibody-dependent cell- mediated chicken red blood cell (CRBC) system. In contrast to the effector cells in the CRBC system, the NK cells were insensitive to <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> complement (EAC) rosette depletion and would pass through nylon wool columns.

Due to complement inhibitor expression on erythrocytes, {{the development of}} an alternative method to measure complement function in sheep serum was required. Method of study Several species of target erythrocyte and sensitizing antibody were investigated for improved measurement of complement function testing. Results and conclusion Guinea pig erythrocytes were identified as the optimal target, although sensitizing them with rabbit antiguinea pig <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> did not enhance the lysis by maternal sheep serum. In contrast, preterm neonatal sheep serum was unable to efficiently lyse guinea pig erythrocytes unless pre-sensitized with antibody. Further investigation revealed that maternal serum contained high levels of antibodies that cross-reacted with guinea pig and rabbit erythrocytes, while no cross-reacting antierythrocyte antibodies were found in preterm neonatal serum. Therefore, unlike primates, rabbits, and guinea pigs, no transplacental transfer of maternal IgG to foetal sheep occurs. Use of exogenous complement regulators is often used to dissect the contribution of complement to disease pathogenesis; however, we found that while full-length soluble human complement receptor 1 (sCR 1, CDX- 1135) was able to inhibit lysis of guinea pig erythrocytes by human and rat serum, no inhibition of sheep serum could be observed.

During acute infection, the MSP 5 cELISA detected antibodies prior to or concomitantly with the appearance of rickettsiae in <b>erythrocytes.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> were detectable in sera from persistently infected cattle inoculated as long as 6 years previously...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} human band 3 {{alteration}} that {{is associated with}} anemia as determined by a reticulocyte count of 20 %. Erythrocyte defects included increased IgG binding, increased breakdown products of band 3, and altered anion- and glucose-transport activity in middle-aged cells. These changes were observed during normal erythrocyte aging in situ. Binding of ankyrin to band 3 was normal. Serum/cell crossover studies indicated that a neoantigen appears on the propositus' erythrocytes to which IgG from both propositus and control serum binds as measured with a protein A binding assay. IgG eluted from the propositus' erythrocytes appeared to have a specificity for senescent cell antigen as determined by a phagocytosis inhibition assay. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that antibodies to band 3, which do not normally bind to intact erythrocytes, bound to the propositus' <b>erythrocytes.</b> <b>Antibody</b> 980 binds to normal old cells but not young or middle-aged cells. It also binds to a distinct region of band 3 in immunoblots of membranes from the propositus' middle-aged cells. Cells from both of the propositus' parents exhibited increased IgG binding and altered anion and glucose transport. The results of these studies suggest that (i) band 3 is aging prematurely in erythrocytes from the propositus, (ii) senescent cell antigen appears on the propositus' middle-aged red cells, and (iii) band 3 alterations observed in the propositus may have a genetic component...|$|R
40|$|E (erythrocyte) and EAC (<b>erythrocytes</b> {{coated with}} <b>antibody</b> and complement) rosettes were quantitated in baboons, cebus monkeys and cotton-topped marmosets. There was poor {{correlation}} between E rosette levels and other parameter of T-lymphocyte function.
