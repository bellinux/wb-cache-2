25|$|A {{high-quality}} <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> {{product that}} closely resembles natural <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> {{can be made}} from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace, and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. Leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{amorphous}} {{and fine}} <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> {{are used in}} brake linings or brake shoes for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important {{with the need to}} substitute for asbestos. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market. According to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in brake linings was 6,510 tonnes in 2005.|$|E
40|$|In this article, the {{influence}} of ion irradiation on temperature dependent electrical transport characteristics of thin <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes</b> was investigated. Thin <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes</b> were exfoliated by mechanical exfoliation method. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study surface morphology of the <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes.</b> The resistance versus temperature studies revealed that the <b>graphite</b> <b>flake</b> not subjected to Ga+ ion-irradiation showed a perfect metallic behavior, while the <b>graphite</b> <b>flake</b> after ion-irradiation showed a semiconducting behavior. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of bare and ion-irradiated <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes</b> were investigated. The bare <b>graphite</b> <b>flake</b> showed an ohmic-type I-V characteristics representing metallic behavior, while the ion-irradiated <b>graphite</b> <b>flake</b> showed a non-linear type diode-like characteristics. The temperature-dependent conductance measurements of ion-irradiated <b>graphite</b> <b>flake</b> were also performed and discussed in detail. The effect of Ga+ ions on the electronic transport behavior of thin <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes</b> has been discussed based on the investigation results...|$|R
30|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} tip sonication power and time on the exfoliation behavior of graphite into GNPs, the <b>flaked</b> <b>graphite</b> samples were exfoliated by tip sonication at a power of 60, 100, 200, or 300  W for 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 180  min. In each exfoliation experiment, <b>flaked</b> <b>graphite</b> (4  mg) was added into the selected dispersing liquid medium (40  mL) and then sonicated by the tip sonicator. A temperature control system with a thermostatic water bath maintained the dispersion at 20  °C during sonication. The dispersion was centrifuged at 1000  rpm for 30  min to sediment the aggregated <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes.</b> Finally, the supernatant was collected to characterize the properties of GNPs produced under different tip sonication powers and times.|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{the results}} {{demonstrated}} that with increasing sonication power and time, {{the size of}} the produced GNPs decreased slightly. However, regardless of the initial size of the <b>flaked</b> <b>graphite,</b> the GNPs produced using various tip sonication times and powers ranged from ~[*] 1 to ~[*] 3  μm in size.|$|R
25|$|Crucibles {{began using}} very large <b>flake</b> <b>graphite,</b> and carbon-magnesite brick {{requiring}} {{not quite so}} large flake graphite; for these and others there is now much more flexibility in size of flake required, and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware, such as nozzles and troughs, to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold, and carbon magnesite bricks line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical. High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks.|$|E
25|$|A foundry facing mold wash is a {{water-based}} paint of amorphous or fine <b>flake</b> <b>graphite.</b> Painting {{the inside of}} a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It {{can be used as a}} dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} types of natural graphite—amorphous, flake or {{crystalline}} flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry [...] "amorphous" [...] refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. <b>Flake</b> <b>graphite</b> is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. <b>Flake</b> <b>graphite</b> can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as flame retardants. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, {{and it is only}} commercially mined in Sri Lanka.|$|E

Here we report on high aspect ratio and stacking fault free Ag-seeded InAs {{nanowires grown}} on exfoliated <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes</b> by molecular beam epitaxy.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between fabrication variables, microstructure and selected properties of carbon bonded magnesia-graphite refractory composite materials have been investigated. A novel optical microscope method of characterizing the morphology of <b>flake</b> <b>graphites</b> {{was developed and}} used to determine distributions of length and thickness and average aspect ratios for the four graphite samples used in the study. The compaction behaviour of magnesia alone and {{in combination with the}} <b>flake</b> <b>graphites</b> has been studied in some detail and the microstructures of the products elucidated. It is shown that the amount of magnesia of small particle size plays a significant role in determining the graphite-graphite contact area in the structure. An irreversible volume expansion is observed on firing composites, the magnitude of which can be related to the microstructure and the graphite content. A phenolic resin binder restricts this expansion. It is shown that the carbon binder does not bond to the graphite phase and only weakly, if at all, to the magnesia. Consequently the strengths and moduli are low and show only a small variation with graphite type. The effect of adding graphite to carbon-bonded magnesia is to lower the strength slightly, but increasing the graphite content from 20 - 30...|$|R
30|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the effects of tip sonication power and time on the exfoliation of graphite into GNPs. First, a series of ethanol/water solvent mixtures with different surface tensions were used to disperse three kinds of <b>flaked</b> <b>graphite</b> samples. The solvent mixture with the highest GNP concentration was selected as the dispersing liquid medium. Then, the qualities of GNPs including their concentration, size, defect density, and sedimentation behavior, produced under different tip sonication powers and times were determined. The study has important implications for selecting the suitable tip sonication parameters in exfoliating graphite into GNPs.|$|R
50|$|The {{graphite}} {{takes on}} {{the shape of a}} three-dimensional flake. In two dimensions, as a polished surface, the <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes</b> appear as fine lines. The graphite has no appreciable strength, so they can be treated as voids. The tips of the flakes act as preexisting notches at which stresses concentrate and it therefore behaves in a brittle manner. The presence of <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes</b> makes the Grey Iron easily machinable as they tend to crack easily across the <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes.</b> Grey iron also has very good damping capacity and hence it is often used as the base for machine tool mountings.|$|R

Abstract- Cast iron being a material {{very sensitive to}} section has been a choice of automotive industries because of its versatile properties. This study was aimed to {{examine the effect of}} section thickness on microstructure of grey cast iron. Grey cast iron micro-structure consists of <b>flakes</b> of <b>graphite</b> with a matrix of pearlite or ferrite. It was found in this study that size of the <b>graphite</b> <b>flake</b> changes with the change in cooling rate. Flake size affects the properties like hardness, UTS and damping capacity of grey iron. It was observed that small section thickness contains small <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes,</b> whereas thick sections consist of larger <b>graphite</b> <b>flakes.</b> Hardness of thin section was also found greater than thick section. The hardness results obtained from Pro-cast simulation were validated and it was found that simulation results are in quite agreement with experimental results.
