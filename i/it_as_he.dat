5|$|Benchley {{was forced}} to take a {{publicity}} position with the Liberty Loan program, and he continued to freelance until Collier's contacted him with an associate editor position. Benchley took this offer to Vanity Fair {{to see if they}} would match <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> felt Vanity Fair was the better magazine, and Vanity Fair offered him the position of managing editor. He accepted and began work there in 1919.|$|E
5|$|His ruse revealed, Redheffer {{immediately}} {{departed for}} New York City {{where he was}} still unknown. He changed his machine somewhat {{so that it could}} not be detected as easily, and he exhibited <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had done in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In his work, Durkheim {{focused on}} totemism, the {{religion}} of the aboriginal Australians and Native Americans. Durkheim saw totemism as the most ancient religion, and focused on <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.|$|E
30|$|My physics {{teacher was}} {{explaining}} solenoids…he’s not just saying something, he’s asking us questions {{so we can}} think about <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he’s</b> teaching. …If we don’t get it, he can explain it further (18).|$|R

5|$|After the Khmer Rouge {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer Rouge {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E
5|$|Laos was {{a neutral}} country {{according}} to the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed on 23July1962. Therefore, the United States was prohibited from openly conducting military operations in the kingdom. Activities undertaken by the USAF in Laos had {{to be approved by}} the U.S. Ambassador to Laos William H. Sullivan. When the plan to install a navigation system on Phou Pha Thi Mountain was proposed, Sullivan initially opposed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> thought that Laotian Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma would not allow his country to be involved in an aerial offensive against North Vietnam. However, Souvanna Phouma did permit the installation, on the condition that it not be manned by U.S. military personnel.|$|E
5|$|San Martín made a {{new request}} for ships to Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, to make a similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part in <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Some {{theories}} {{attempt to}} explain Daily's tempestuous behaviour, {{one of which was}} put forth by Frank Vaccaro in his 1999 edition of The National Pastime. His theory explains that, in Daily's day, except in cases of injury, for a pitcher to be relieved from his position, another player already in the game would have to relieve him, and the pitcher would have to take a position in the field. His physical condition did not allow him many opportunities to play any other positions, so this compelled his managers to leave him in the game longer, even when his performance was declining. He was allowed to play in the field on several occasions, when the situation warranted <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is credited as playing three games in the outfield, two at second base, and one at shortstop.|$|E
5|$|When {{the script}} was ready, Meiyappan's sons and the film's {{co-producers}} M. Saravanan, M. Kumaran and M. Murugan narrated it to Ganesan at his residence, Annai Illam. Ganesan initially rejected <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> felt {{the character of}} Dr. Gopal had more impact than the main character, Raju, and sought to film the portions involving Dr. Gopal in four days. However, on Meiyappan's insistence, Ganesan {{played the role of}} Raju. The role of Dr. Gopal went to S. A. Ashokan and Ganesan assisted him for acting in the scene where Dr. Gopal dies of a heart attack. S. V. Ramadoss was cast as Raju's father Sankaralingam, Major Sundarrajan as Raju's classmate, Vanishree as Raju's wife Parvathi, Sowcar Janaki as Raju's cousin Vimala, Sivakumar as Raju's son Sathyamurthy, and V. S. Raghavan portrayed Sathyamurthy's uncle Murugan.|$|E
5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so {{it was decided to}} strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested it, though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E
60|$|The dog didn't seem to {{be quite}} 'imself next day, {{and he was so}} fierce in the yard that my missis was afraid to go near 'im. I was going to ask the skipper about <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>'e</b> seemed to know more about dogs than I did, but when I got to the wharf the barge had sailed.|$|R

5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{there was}} strong {{interest}} in discovering a Northwest Passage that would permit navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to Hudson Bay or the Missouri River. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of Bruno de Heceta, who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On {{the advice of his}} officers, he did not explore <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was short-staffed and the current was strong. He considered it a bay, and called it Ensenada de Asunción. Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river, labeled Rio de San Roque, or an entrance, called Entrada de Hezeta. Following Heceta's reports, British maritime fur trader Captain John Meares searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist. He named Cape Disappointment for the non-existent river, not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river's mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} considered Danny Denzongpa for {{the role}} of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered {{for the role}} of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested {{to play the role of}} Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not extremely popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself.|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{restarted}} on lap twelve, Michael Schumacher led, while Häkkinen and Villeneuve were running second and third. Behind them were Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, Wurz, Gene, Heidfeld, Zonta, Mazzacane, Diniz, Salo and Alesi. Michael Schumacher began to immediately {{pull away from}} Häkkinen as he set consecutive fastest laps. Further down the field, Wurz overtook Diniz and Mazzacane for tenth position. By the start of lap 13, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 2.1 seconds. Further back, Zonta passed Heidfeld to take ninth. On lap 14, Zonta moved up into seventh position after passing Gené and Wurz. Villeneuve became the third retirement of the race when he pulled {{over to the side}} of the track with gearbox problems on the same lap. Meanwhile, Verstappen overtook Fisichella to take fourth position. Heidfeld retired after his engine failed and spun off at Variante della Roggia chicane on lap 15. One lap later, Ralf Schumacher lost two positions after being passed by Verstappen and Zonta. Salo passed Mazzacane to claim ninth position on lap 17. At the start of the 19th lap, Zonta tried to pass Verstappen heading into the Variante Goodyear chicane, but Verstappen moved onto an early defensive line to prevent Zonta from moving ahead. Zonta attempted to overtake Verstappen into the Variante della Rogia chicane to take third place four laps later, but was unable to complete <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ran wide. He managed to get ahead after exiting the chicane on the same lap.|$|E

60|$|With some {{exertion}} he drew down a cobwebbed object curiously {{framed in}} iron, which clanked <b>as</b> <b>he</b> moved <b>it.</b> It {{was about three}} feet in length and half as wide. Tim contemplated <b>it</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could in the dying light of day, and raked off the cobwebs with his hand.|$|R
25|$|Approximately {{five minutes}} later, {{one of the}} {{newsroom}} staff members rushed to Cronkite's desk with another bulletin. As Cronkite read the bulletin, he had to re-read <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stumbled over his words.|$|E
25|$|Ignác Goldziher later {{mentioned}} the religion {{in an article}} reviewing Islam in 1913, and read western newspaper accounts on the religion but did not sustain an interest in <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> personally identified with Islam and Judaism.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{became popular}} and was {{frequently}} republished. To Harte's dismay, however, the poem reinforced racism among his readers instead of challenging <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> intended. Nevertheless, {{he returned to}} the character years later. The poem also inspired or influenced several adaptations.|$|E

25|$|In 1787 she {{returned}} to England where she first appeared at the King's Theatre in London that year. In fact, she hoped to return to Vienna for the 1788 Easter season, but the Emperor's opera budget would no longer permit <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had embarked on an expensive war with Turkey.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 Strauss {{allowed an}} orchestral Rosenkavalier Suite to be published, {{but he was}} {{apparently}} not involved in creating it. It is likely that conductor Artur Rodziński arranged <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had conducted the Suite's first performance, which was in October 1944 by the New York Philharmonic.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{arguments}} were heard {{late in the}} year. Richard Williams, the village attorney and drafter of the ordinance, argued for <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had throughout the proceedings; similarly, Michael Pritzker argued for the Flipside. Justice John Paul Stevens, the Seventh Circuit's chief judge prior to his 1976 elevation to the Court, took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.|$|E
