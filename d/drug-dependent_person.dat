Lucie Špuláková Signs of {{epilepsy}} spectrum {{disorder in}} <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> Diploma thesis Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové Department of Biological and Medical Sciences Specialist in laboratory methods Objectives: The {{objective of this}} diploma thesis was to demonstrate the signs of epile- psy spectrum disorder in risk group of <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons.</b> Methods: We investigated the signs of epilepsy spectrum disorder by questionnaire survey - specifically by questionnaires Limbic System Checklist- 33 (LSCL- 33) and Complex Partial Seizure-like Symptoms Inventory (CPSI). We used statistical methods for results evaluation - the percentage comparison, chi-square test, and Spearman corre- lation coefficient. Results: The questionnaire survey demonstrated a significant shift towards abnormal values for both questionnaires. Abnormal score was achieved by 77 % respondents for questionnary LSCL- 33, suspected score was achieved by 19 % respondents. Score for epilepsy spektrum disorder was achieved by 32 % respondents for questionnary CPSI and 45 % respondents showed unusual values. Conclusions: Signs of epilepsy spectrum disorder in <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> was thus proved. The incidence is higher than in ordinary population and population of smokers. It was also [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The Narcotics Act {{mandates}} {{drug treatment}} {{under the auspices}} of the Narcotics Control Board and punishes repeat offenders and those who otherwise fail to abide by the terms of treatment. The Board is bound to ensure treatment, rehabilitation, and social reintegration of <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons,</b> through interventions, counseling, and detoxification; it is thus required by law to maintain adequate personnel and institutions to provide such services. Records of treatment must be kept confidential. Persons dependent on drugs are subject to compulsory treatment and rehabilitation; those who refuse to submit voluntarily must be confined in criminal custody.|$|R

African governments are concerned about the continued incidence and involvement of their nationals in drug trafficking and abuse. Examination of available data reveal that cannabis is the primary drug abused in the continent, with some abuse of opium and cocaine, and an alarming increase in the availability for non-medical use and illicit trafficking in psychotropic sub-stances (mainly methaqualone in the form of Mandrax and amphetamines). This paper analyzes the efforts and programs aimed at the prevention of drug abuse and the treatment and rehabilitation of <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> in Africa. It describes and prescribes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effectiveness of teaching emotion regulation based on gross model in reducing impulsivity in drug dependent people. Method: This research project was some type of pilot studies that has employed pretest - posttest design with control group. For the present study, all the addicted referring to drug-quitting clinics in 2011 at Marivan constituted the study population. A total of 30 <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> was selected by simple random sampling and {{randomly assigned to one}} of the experiment and control groups. Findings: The results showed that emotion regulation training can be effective in reducing symptoms of impulsivity in drug-dependent individuals. Conclusion: Given that drug-dependent individuals are naturally more susceptible to negative emotions, they will probably act impulsively without having any plans in such situations. Therefore, emotion regulation training to such people can enhance their self-restraining power in such situations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was aimed at {{comparing}} interpersonal sensitivity and assertiveness between <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> and ordinary people. Method: The research method was causal-comparative. The statistical population of the study consisted of all narcotic addicts of Tabriz City who referred to Addiction Treatment Centers while the research was being conducted. The number of 30 addicted persons was selected through cluster sampling and 30 ordinary persons as control group through convenience sampling method. Gmbryl & Ritchie’s assertiveness questionnaire (1975) and Boyce & Parker’s Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM 1989) were used for data collection purposes. Results: The results showed {{that there was a}} statistically significant difference between two groups in terms of interpersonal sensitivity and assertiveness. The addicts showed less assertiveness and more interpersonal sensitivity in comparison with their healthy counterparts. Conclusion: The findings show that people who are unable to express themselves and exert sensitivity in interpersonal relationships are more likely at high risk of substance dependence. However, it is possible to prevent these persons from turning to addiction by teaching them these skills...|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the beliefs that {{relatives}} of alcohol and drug dependent persons, and representatives from social services have to {{the various forms of}} support available for the relatives. Those who participate in the study points out that {{there are many people who}} have a need for support as a relative of an alcohol or drug addicted individual, but that there are circumstances that make them choose not to seek assistance. The study shows that the relatives can experience a reluctance to seek support from social services because of how the organization looks like. The study is qualitative, where the collection of the empiric material has consisted in six semi-structured interviews. Three of them have been with relatives of alcohol-or <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> and three have been with social workers in various professions, whose work consists of helping both the relatives of people with alcohol and drug dependence as well as people who are dependent. The empirical material has been analyzed according to the theories of Stigma and Us and them, both of which occur in the field of symbolic interactionism...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of group psychotherapy of transactional analysis in the reduction of craving beliefs, cognitive emotion regulation, and adjustment of attachment styles. Method: This was an experimental study along with pre-test and post-test and control group. The study population consisted of all male drug addicts who had referred to Tehran rehab clinics in 2004. A total of 30 <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> were selected as the participants of the study using convenience sampling method and, then, were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. For data collection purposes, Craving Beliefs Questionnaire, Adult Attachment Scale, and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire were used. Group psychotherapy of transactional analysis was carried out during ten 90 -minute sessions. Results: The results of analysis of covariance showed that therapy of transactional analysis can reduce craving beliefs, self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, other-blame, and insecure attachment styles and increase positive refocusing, refocusing on planning, positive reappraisal, perspective taking, acceptance, and secure attachment styles. Conclusion: Considering that drug-dependent individuals are more exposed to negative emotions, they are likely to act haphazardly and impulsively in such situations. Therefore, teaching transactional analysis to these people can increase the control rate in stressful situations...|$|R
40|$|Marked {{regional}} differences in HIV-related clinical outcomes exist across Europe. Models of outpatient HIV care, including HIV testing, linkage and retention for positive persons, also differ across the continent, including examples of sub-optimal care. Even in settings with reasonably good outcomes, existing models are scrutinized for simplification and/or reduced cost. Outpatient HIV care models across Europe may be centralized to specialized clinics only, primarily handled by general practitioners (GP), or {{a mixture of}} the two, depending on the setting. Key factors explaining this diversity include differences in health policy, health insurance structures, case load and the prevalence of HIV-related morbidity. In clinical stable populations, the current trend is to gradually extend intervals between HIV-specific visits in a shared care model with GPs. A similar shared-model approach with community clinics for injecting <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> is also being implemented. Shared care models require oversight to ensure that primary responsibility is defined for the persons overall health situation, for screening of co-morbidities, defining indication to treat comorbidities, prescription of non-HIV medicines, etc. Intelligent bioinformatics platforms (i. e. generation of alerts if course of care deviates from a prior defined normality) are being developed to assist in providing this oversight and to provide measure of quality. Although consensus exists to assess basic quality indicators of care, a comprehensive set of harmonized indicators are urgently needed to define best practise standards via benchmarking. Such a tool will be central to guide ongoing discussions on restructuring of models, as quality of care should not be compromised in this process...|$|R
40|$|THIS is AN OPPORTUNE TIME {{to present}} the medicolegal issues to be {{considered}} by a physician undertaking the treatment, or other disposition, of narcotic-dependent persons (ad-dicts) (1). In the past few years, {{there has been a}} marked increase in the attention given in professional and lay publications and other channels of communication to problems of nar-cotic and other drug dependence (addiction). Increasing numbers of physicians are finding the treatment of narcotic-dependent persons "respectable, " but many still hesitate to become involved, sometimes because of lack of famili-arity with the medical factors but also, too often, because of misunderstanding about the associate medicolegal issues. There has never been any real question about the legal right of physicians to use narcotics in controlling acute and chronic pain in their patients (2 - 4). There is, of course, the obliga-tion to seek and, if possible, relieve the cause of pain and, when narcotics are indicated, to prescribe for them only in such manner as to minimize the possibility of iatrogenic drug de-pendence. If the patient is now, or was formerly, dependent on narcotics and "there is bona fide symptomatic need, other than to relieve drug dependence per se, it is the physician's responsi-bility to prescribe [...] . as he would for any other patient " (3). Such prescribing must, of course, take into account [1] the ability of many <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>persons</b> to simulate medical conditions calling for analgesics and [2] the level of tolerance (1) present in narcotic-dependent patients. Unfortunately, the situation is not as simple {{when it comes to the}} treatment of narcotic-dependent persons for their drug dependence. Some physicians erroneously believe that there are legal sanctions proscribing essentially all use of narcotics in the medical management of such persons. Such erroneous beliefs may be due in part to conscious and unconscious de...|$|R
