40|$|Due {{to their}} {{extremely}} compact and short design and extremely high torsional stiffness, the so-called torque <b>flanges</b> <b>based</b> on strain gage technology {{are the most}} up-to-date devices used for in-line torque measurement in power test stands.

It includes recommendations on how to avoid or minimize these effects in order to achieve optimum comparabilities, especially with respect to the sensitivity and the measuring characteristics.

The RC hybrid deep T-beam was cast with normal weight concrete web and light weight concrete <b>flanges.</b> <b>Based</b> on the Softened Truss Model and Bredt’s theory, a new equation was derived and proposed to show the relationship between compression strut of light weight concrete and normal weight concrete. Based on the experimental results of cracking angles and curvature equation of light weight concrete and normal weight concrete, a new equation was also proposed to show the relationship between strain diagram of light weight concrete and normal weight concrete.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} flange tightening {{methods for}} small bore and low rating piping flange joints are clarified {{to improve the}} sealing performance of the bolted flange joints and the workability of flange tightening work. It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on flange bolts, while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges. So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt tightening tests and sealing tests results. On the other hand, for the bolted flanges applying spiral wound gaskets, measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven tightening balance and to perform the appropriate tightening work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the <b>flanges</b> <b>based</b> on the sealing tests results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and tightening work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the bolted flanges and the workability of flange tightening work...|$|R
40|$|Distortional {{buckling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important buckling modes of the steel-concrete composite girder under negative moment. In this study, the equivalent lateral and torsional restraints of the bottom flange of a steel-concrete composite girder under negative moments due to variable axial forces are thoroughly investigated. The results show that there is a coupling effect between the applied forces and the lateral and torsional restraint of the bottom <b>flange.</b> <b>Based</b> on the calculation formula of lateral and torsional restraints, the critical buckling stress of I-steel-concrete composite girders and steel-concrete composite box girders under variable axial force is obtained. The critical bending moment of the steel-concrete composite girders can be further calculated. Compared to the traditional calculation methods of elastic foundation beam, the paper introduces an improved method, which considers coupling effect of the external loads and the foundation spring constraints of the bottom flange. Fifteen examples of the steel-concrete composite girders in different conditions are calculated.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is a {{preliminary}} assessment and critical discussion of full-scale experimental test results recently obtained for hybrid steel-glass beams composed of a laminated glass web and steel <b>flanges,</b> <b>based</b> on the analytical Möhler method. As known, the structural response of this typology of hybrid solutions markedly depends on the stiffness and resistance of all its components, and specifically the connection, which act as a flexible shear bonding layer between the glass web and the steel flanges. Therefore, the appropriate mechanical calibration of the component materials is mandatory for accurate calculations. In order to fully characterize the used adhesive, push-out shear tests and simple shear tests were performed on small specimens. The results obtained from these small specimens are then implemented as main input mechanical parameters for the analytical model, so that this latter {{could be applied to}} the full-scale tests in view of comparative analyses. As shown, due to accurate estimation of the main mechanical properties of the adhesive layers, the presented analytical method provides rather accurate results for the examined full-scale hybrid beams, hence suggesting its application for practical calculations and pre-design considerations...|$|R
40|$|Automating {{the process}} of {{automotive}} weather strip assembly has been a challenge to production engineers for years. In fact, a recent publication concluded that this process is too difficult to automate. At the IPA a robot tool for flexible automation of the weather strip assembly process has been developed. In close cooperation with Opel AG, weather strip supplier Mesnel S. A. in France, assembly system manufacturers Kuka, and Thyssen Nothelfer, a prototype assembly cell {{has been set up}} at IPA. The assembly system consists of a pick-up station supplying the weather strip seals, a sophisticated insertion tool, and an industrial robot (Fanuc S- 420 F). The basic function of the robot tool is very similar to the manual operation. The tool combines gripping, guiding and hammering functions. It uses open guides with pneumatic fingers to pickup and guide the seal, and a pneumatic hammer to drive the seal onto the <b>flange.</b> <b>Based</b> on a thorough analysis of significant process parameters, the cycle time of the seal assembly could be halved compared with manual operation.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb stud assembly tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single <b>flange).</b> <b>Based</b> on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b]. A proposal is also recommended to revise the wording in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b] to include provisions for the design of jamb studs based on the results of this research...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of structural wide flange steel sections introduces residual stresses in the material. These stresses due to hot-rolling or welding influence the inelastic buckling response of structural steel members {{and need to}} be taken into account in the design. Based on experimental data standardized residual stress models have been proposed for inclusion in inelastic buckling analyses. By incorporating these residual stress models their effect on the resistance of beams and columns can be obtained. Residual stress models for roller bent steel sections are currently not available. Roller bent wide flange sections are manufactured by curving straight members at ambient temperature. This manufacturing technique, which is also known as roller bending, stresses the material beyond its yield stress, thereby overriding the initial residual stresses prior to bending and generating an entirely new pattern. This paper proposes a residual stress model for roller bent wide <b>flange</b> sections, <b>based</b> on earlier conducted numerical investigations which were validated by experimental research performed at Eindhoven University of Technology. The proposed residual stress model can serve as an initial state of a roller bent steel section in fully non-linear finite element analyses to accurately predict its influence on the inelastic buckling response...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} number of damages in piping systems and components during recent seismic events {{have been reported in}} literature which calls for a proper seismic design of these structures. Nevertheless, there exists an inadequacy of proper seismic analysis and design rules for a piping system and its components. Current seismic design Codes are found to be over conservative and some components, e. g., bolted flange joints, do not have guidelines for their seismic design. Along this line, this paper discusses about the main issues on the seismic analysis and design of industrial piping systems and components. Initially, seismic analysis and component design of refinery piping systems are described. A review of current design approaches suggested by European (EN 13480 : 3) and American (ASME B 31. 3) Codes is performed through a Case Study on a piping system.
