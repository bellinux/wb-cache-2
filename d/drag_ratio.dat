The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value.

25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} {{aircraft in}} the contemporary sense, with a structure of duralumin but largely fabric covering. A parasol wing, with a cut-out in the trailing edge over the open cockpit, ensured the pilot a good all round view. The wing was straight edged with constant chord and was fitted with long span ailerons. It was braced to the lower fuselage on each side {{with a pair of}} parallel, faired struts to about half span. The wing section to half span was moderately thick but thinned outboard, giving an overall maximum lift to <b>drag</b> <b>ratio</b> of almost 20.|$|E

50|$|Because {{flying fish}} are {{primarily}} aquatic animals, their body density must {{be close to}} that of water for buoyancy stability. This primary requirement for swimming, however, means that flying fish are heavier than other habitual fliers, resulting in higher wing loading and lift to <b>drag</b> <b>ratios</b> for flying fish compared to a comparably sized bird. Differences in wing area, wing span, wing loading, and aspect ratio {{have been used to}} classify flying fish into two distinct classifications based on these different aerodynamic designs.|$|R

Many of the {{design features}} were adopted, and are still used today, on most cars. Because of this, the exterior only received minor changes throughout the first-generation's production run. The only major change came in 1988, when the Taurus received a new slimmer grille and headlights, with a full length chrome bar underneath for model year 1989.|$|E
2500|$|The Konsul was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with a high, cantilever, single spar wing with stressed 3-ply covering {{from the}} spar to {{the leading edge}} and fabric covered aft. It was built in three parts, an 8m (26ft3in) inner section with a box spar and outer panels with an I-section one. The wing had a thick and strongly cambered profile, using the then new Göttingen 535 airfoil with its high lift to <b>drag</b> <b>ratio</b> that attracted many pre-World War II sailplane designers. The long wings had constant chord except for tapered tips, where the wing decreased in thickness. There was no dihedral. [...] Half span, large area ailerons had angled hinges attached to the spar at its tip and, in the early flight tests, projected well beyond the fixed wing tip. [...] These proved both heavy in flight and vulnerable on the ground, so were soon tapered and rounded off, slightly reducing the span and aspect ratio. The ailerons operated differentially, upward deflections being smaller than downward ones; this was a relatively new way of reducing adverse yaw but in addition the rudder and ailerons were interconnected. [...] Small rudder deflections {{did not affect the}} ailerons but larger ones moved them appropriately. [...] No flaps, airbrakes or spoilers were fitted, normal for the time ...|$|E
2500|$|The Feiro Dongó was {{the second}} design of Lajos Rotter in his {{collaboration}} with the brothers Gyula and László Feigl. Rotter aimed to produce a training aircraft of high aerodynamic refinement with a high lift to <b>drag</b> <b>ratio</b> (L/D) which was also stable but responsive to the controls, structurally strong, easy to land and with a good all-round view from the cockpit. An innovative wing design was a key feature. [...] The Dongó was a biplane with wings of very high aspect ratio and modified elliptical plan, thus minimising induced drag. The upper wing had an aspect ratio of 16.9, very high at the time, and both wings had a root chord of only , though the lower was [...] shorter. Both had thick airfoils. [...] The very narrow wings were claimed to provide longitudinal stability, as the centre of pressure could not move far, and further pitch stability was provided by heavy stagger, with the lower wing [...] behind the upper. The two wings were set at different angles of attack, 0° on the lower and 2° on the upper, again {{with the intention of}} improving longitudinal stability [...] To provide roll stability the upper wing had dihedral beyond a short centre section. The latter was supported by a steel tube cabane which had pairs of vertical, kinked struts, faired in the upper part, and a forward, transverse inverted-V, all joined to the upper fuselage. This structure made it possible to vary the upper wing's angle of incidence and the stagger. [...] The wings were 3-ply covered, two spar structures. [...] High aspect ratio, metal covered ailerons were mounted on the lower wings.|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of replacing the conventional wing on a transatlantic business jet with a larger, strut braced wing of aspect ratio 25 were evaluated. The lifting struts reduce both the induced drag and structural {{weight of the}} heavier, high aspect ratio wing. Compared to the conventional airplane, the strut braced wing design offers significantly higher lift to <b>drag</b> <b>ratios</b> achieved at higher lift coefficients and, consequently, a combination of lower speeds and higher altitudes.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation of a zero-pressure gradient drag-reducing {{turbulent boundary layer}} of homogeneous viscoelastic fluids was performed using constitutive equation models such as the Oldroyd-B and Giesekus models. Mean velocity profiles and turbulence statistics at the different streamwise locations were discussed using both inner and outer scaling. The maximum <b>drag</b> reduction <b>ratio</b> for the Oldroyd-B model, which has the higher elongational viscosity, is larger than for the Giesekus model. The distinct difference in turbulence statistics near the wall between the Oldroyd-B model and Newtonian fluid is observed, {{as reported in the}} drag-reducing turbulent channel flow, while in the outer region, distributions of turbulence statistics for the Oldroyd-B model with a <b>drag</b> reduction <b>ratio</b> of about 40 % are similar to those for Newtonian fluid. The production term for the turbulent boundary layer does not correspond to the amount of drag reduction, which is consistent {{with the fact that the}} streamwise turbulence intensity profile is not a direct indication of the drag reduction. The contribution of the advection term to the budget of streamwise Reynolds normal stress, which does not appear for the turbulent channel flow, is not negligible near the wall for the Oldroyd-B model. For the Oldroyd-B model with a maximum <b>drag</b> reduction <b>ratio</b> of 42 %, we can see that quasi-streamwise vortices are weakened and become larger in the streamwise direction, compared to Newtonian fluid. On the other hand, quasi-streamwise vortices for the Giesekus model with a maximum <b>drag</b> reduction <b>ratio</b> of 16 % are slightly larger than those for Newtonian fluid. These modifications of near-wall coherent structures are explained by the profile of the trace of mean viscoelastic stress and the elastic energy theory presented by Min et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 486, 213 (2003) ] for the drag-reducing turbulent channel flow...|$|R
