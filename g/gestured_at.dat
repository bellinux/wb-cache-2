25|$|On June 26, 1957, Margaret Harold and her boyfriend—a U.S. Army {{sergeant}} {{on weekend}} leave—were traveling near Annapolis, Maryland when Rees, driving his green Chrysler, forced {{them off the}} road. After exiting the vehicle, Rees <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> the couple to roll down their car window, displaying a gun. After being refused demands for cigarettes and money, an angered Rees shot Harold point-blank in the face. The horrified soldier fled the scene and ran across several rural fields before reaching a farmhouse, where he called the police. As the soldier was being {{picked up at the}} farmhouse, other officers arrived at the crime scene, where they found that Rees had removed the deceased Harold's clothing and sexually assaulted her.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson and {{his command}} arrived {{late in the}} afternoon. However, unable to find A.P. Hill or D.H. Hill, Jackson did nothing. Although a major battle was raging within earshot, he ordered his troops to make camp for the evening. Hill's 11,000 men, most of them green regiments who had never fired a shot in battle, {{launched}} a series of futile attacks {{over the next few}} hours. The brigade of John R. Anderson assaulted the Union right flank, with James Archer's and Charles W. Field's brigades in support. Maxcy Gregg's brigade was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle at all. Directing his troops, John Reynolds <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> the oncoming mass of Confederates and told a staffer [...] "There they come like flies on a piece of gingerbread." [...] The Union artillery and musketry tore enormous gaps in the Confederate lines as they attempted to cross the creek. Although A.P. Hill had 24 guns with him, he made no attempt to use massed artillery fire to counter the Union gunners, instead sending individual batteries in support of the infantry, most of which were quickly put out of action by enemy shelling.|$|E

After returning from Illinois, however, they moved into a basement apartment. Their son, Leslie Jr., was born on July 14, 1913. Dorothy had quickly learned that King was abusive, short-tempered and had trouble with alcohol. A few days after their son's birth, King <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> his wife and son with a knife and threatened to kill them. Dorothy quickly completed plans to leave her husband; she would not tolerate the abuse nor threats to their son's safety. King also quarreled with his mother-in-law.|$|E

Unhappy with the move, Patrick exited her car, went near the track's apron and <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> Kahne as he passed. She was fined $20,000 for the action. At Talladega, Patrick was {{involved}} in a crash with Matt Kenseth; while Kenseth was sent airborne, Patrick collided with the inside wall at high speed, causing her car to catch fire. Patrick was taken to the infield care center for a chest x-ray and described the wreck as [...] "the worst of her career".|$|E

5000|$|We who {{classify}} {{ourselves as}} [...] "analytic" [...] philosophers tend {{to fall into}} the assumption that our allegiance automatically grants us methodological virtue.

But within the analytic tradition many philosophers use arguments {{only to the extent that}} most [...] "continental" [...] philosophers do ... How can we do better? We can make a useful start by getting the simple things right. Much even of analytic philosophy moves too fast in its haste to reach the sexy bits. Details are not given the care they deserve: crucial claims are vaguely stated, significant different formulations are treated as though they were equivalent, examples are under-described, arguments are <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> rather than properly made, their form is left unexplained, and so on. ... Philosophy has never been done for an extended period according to standards as high as those that are now already available, if only the profession will take them seriously to heart.|$|E
50|$|Cavendish had a {{slow start}} to 2011 failing to win a race until late February {{when he won the}} stage six of the Tour of Oman. He {{continued}} to race and came to his second victory of the season in the Scheldeprijs, his third following his previous triumphs in 2007 and 2008, brought him to the record tied with Piet Oellibrandt. At the Paris-Roubaix he failed to finish. He came second in the second stage of the Giro d'Italia in contentious circumstances (Cavendish <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> winner Petacchi for appearing to move across his path in the final sprint), to take the pink jersey into stage three. Cavendish got his first grand tour victory of the year by winning stage ten of the Giro, shrugging off claims that he had illegally held on to his team car when climbing Mount Etna on stage nine. He won his second Giro victory of 2011 on stage twelve before leaving the race. On 11 June it was announced that Cavendish was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E

[...] Multiple Dolphins players later said the spectators responded in a similar fashion towards them. After a 22-13 Dolphins victory over the Bills, sportswriter Bill Plaschke called the game [...] "a considerable step toward making their rivalry the ugliest in the league". The teams met twice more in the playoffs during the 1990s. On December 30, 1995, Buffalo broke the league record for rushing yards in a game with 341, winning 37-22. This was Dolphins head coach Don Shula's last {{game in the}} NFL. Three seasons later, the teams met at Pro Player Stadium on January 2, 1999 for their fourth playoff game of the decade, which the Dolphins won 24-17 after forcing five Bills turnovers. In regular season games during the decade, the Bills held a 10-8 win-loss advantage.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Waltrip went winless {{and dropped}} five {{spots in the}} standings. In 2005 Waltrip only had seven top tens and one pole. It {{included}} a runner up at Phoenix despite hitting the wall on the next to last lap. He had an incident with Robby Gordon at New Hampshire. After Waltrip intentionally wrecked Robby Gordon and spun as a result, Gordon furiously tried to back his damaged racecar into Waltrip's. When Gordon failed to hit Waltrip's car with his own, he climed out of his racecar and threw his helmet at Waltrip's driver side door. Waltrip repeated the words Gordon said the previous year in another helmet-tossing incident: [...] "He just threw a helmet at my car." [...] Waltrip was fined $10,000 after he <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> Gordon for the damage on his car from the helmet, but he and Teresa Earnhardt appealed and the fine was overturned after a short investigation proved the charge false. Gordon however was fined $50,000 and put on probation {{for the rest of}} the year after he was discovered to have said [...] "You know everybody thinks Michael is this good guy. He's not the guy he acts he is. The caution was out, and he wrecked me, and he's a piece of shit." [...] Waltrip and Gordon conferred later on, apologized, and continued their careers. After the 2005 season, Waltrip left DEI for Bill Davis Racing.|$|E
50|$|Early on {{the night}} of 14 July 2001 the young backpackers were {{travelling}} on the Stuart Highway near Barrow Creek, in the Northern Territory, in their orange Kombi. Falconio was driving and Lees was next to him in the passenger seat. The two had been conscious of the headlights of a car behind them for some time, and were waiting to be overtaken. However, when the vehicle - a white, four wheel drive utility - drew alongside, the man in the cab, Murdoch, <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> them to pull over. Falconio stopped the van and went to speak with the man, who pulled off the road ahead of them. The man explained he had seen sparks shooting out of the van's exhaust. The two went {{to the rear of the}} vehicle to investigate, and Lees slid into the drivers seat, ready to rev the engine. She then heard a loud bang from the rear of the van and, moments later, turned to the window. Instead of the night sky, the man filled it, with a silver gun in his hand. He climbed into the van, threatening her with the gun, as she backed away from him. She let him secure her hand behind her back with cable ties. She was forced out of the van landing on her knees on the gravel and falling to her face on the ground, but she escaped while he was distracted (apparently while moving Falconio's body). She hid for five hours in nearby bushes before running out onto the road and flagging down a truck driver who removed her cable ties and took her to safety at Barrow Creek Hotel from where the police were called.|$|E

50|$|Said drove for Phoenix Racing at the Sprint Cup Series road course {{events in}} 2011. Following an {{incident}} with Greg Biffle, after Said accidentally turned David Ragan (Biffle's teammate) into David Reutimann at the Glen in 2011, causing Reutimann to flip violently, at the garage Biffle punched Said {{in his car}} and apparently <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> Said. Said climbed out and Biffle stood behind his pit crew and while exchanging words Said was prevented by Biffle's pit members from attacking Biffle. After the race Said apologized for wrecking Ragan but angrily retorted; I'm more upset with Greg Biffle, he is the most unprofessional little scaredy cat I've ever seen in my life, he won't even fight me like a man. So if someone texts me his address, I’ll go see him Wednesday at his house and show him what he really needs. He needs a friggin’ whooping, and I’m {{going to give it to}} him. He was flipping me off, giving the finger, totally unprofessional. Two laps down, I mean, he's a chump.... I went over there to go talk to him and he wouldn't even let me get out of the car and he comes over and throws a few little baby punches, and when I get out, he runs away and hides behind some big guys. But he won't hide from me long, I'll find him. I won't settle it out on the track - it's not right to wreck cars - but he'll show up at a race with a black eye one of these days. I'll see him somewhere. The incident was investigated by NASCAR officials, but no penalties were given. Said received a late call up from Turner Scott Motorsports to run the 2011 NAPA Auto Parts 200 Nationwide Series race in Montreal in the No. 30 Great Clips Chevrolet. In 2012, he teamed with FAS Lane Racing to contest the races at Infineon Raceway and Watkins Glen International.|$|E
40|$|Speakers gesture at {{high rates}} when {{explaining}} their solutions to spatial problems. The present work investigates {{one possible explanation}} for why speakers gesture so frequently during spatial problem solving, namely, that when speakers imagine the problem components in motion, they are particularly likely to gesture. We compared speakers ’ gesture rates as they actively solved a mental rotation problem and as they described the end state of the problem. Speakers <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> a higher rate in the rotation condition. Thus, it appears that thoughts about the problem pieces in motion in the rotation condition do lead to increased gesture rates...|$|E
30|$|Paula {{made the}} {{necessary}} adjustments to her gestures {{based on her}} observations of Haile. He showed how {{he could make a}} repeating pattern out of shells. Here, I refer to Vygotsky (1978) who states that pointing gestures were the first stage in the development of speech and that it is nothing more than an unsuccessful attempt to grasp. Over time a child’s movements “change with the act of pointing becoming a gesture of pointing for others and is understood by others as a gesture” (Ewing 2005, p. 44). Paula was influenced by Haile’s physical movements, gestures and facial expressions, all the while gently prompting and guiding him through the task. Where Haile became unsure, she <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> the thirteenth shell with him. He then confidently continued to explain the pattern ending with a triumphant grin.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis of}} my 2005 book Disorienting Fiction: The Autoethnographic Work of Nineteenth-Century British Novels is <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> {{by the three}} words of this essay's main title: nineteenth-century Britain's {{imperial}} expansion is the ultimate context in which {{to make sense of}} the nineteenth-century novel's apparent commitment to an autoethnographic enterprise aimed at writing into existence a delimited and distinctive culture for the English or even the British people at a time when there was every encouragement for them to regard their way of life as exhausted in identification with a globally exportable “Civilization” or capital-C “Culture” itself. That delimiting impulse found expression in what I call the “self-interrupting” features prominent in Romantic-era and Victorian narrative. This essay considers the challenges facing a planned sequel to Disorienting Fiction that would extend that thesis from the later nineteenth century into the heyday of modernism...|$|E
30|$|In the {{two studies}} we {{investigated}} the possibility that people would spontaneously use spatial analogies when reasoning about positive and negative feedback, relational systems that are complex, widespread, and abstract in nature. As a potential window onto such hypothesized analogies, we examined the gestures people produced as they explained the main characteristics of these causal systems and the differences between them. Despite the paucity of concrete visual imagery in the lesson we provided—and, in Study 2, the lack of spatial language—when people explained the systems, they <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> high rates. These gestures did not represent the actual locations or movements of objects—rather, they used space abstractly to represent the different factors in the system, the changes to those factors, the causal relations between the factors, and the overall dynamics of the system. Abstract system elements were thus spatialized extensively in gesture. Importantly, these elements were not often spatialized in speech, highlighting the value of observing gesture in reasoning tasks.|$|E
40|$|When {{the doctors}} couldn’t cure the Tyrant’s headache, he called upon the philosophers. “Show me some {{necessary}} condition for having a headache, which I can defeat!” The philosophers sent forth the great David K. Lewis in magician’s robes. 1 With him traveled a madman, in top hat and monocle, and a Martian. Said the Philosopher to the Tyrant: There might be a strange man who sometimes feels pain, just as we do, but whose pain differs greatly from ours in its causes and effects. Our pain is typically caused by cuts, burns, pressure, and the like; his is caused by moderate exercise on an empty stomach. Our pain is generally distracting; his turns his mind to mathematics, facilitating concentration on that but distracting him from anything else. Intense pain has no tendency whatever to cause him to groan or writhe, but does cause him to cross his legs and snap his fingers. He {{is not in the}} least motivated to prevent pain or to get rid of it. The Philosopher <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> the madman, who did forty jumping-jacks, then sat crosslegged upon a windowsill, snapped his fingers six times, and began a discourse on the relation between e and π. (“Most Stoical, how he deals with his pain! ” whispered an advisor to the Tyrant. ...|$|E
