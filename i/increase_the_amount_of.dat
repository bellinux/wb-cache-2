5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> well-watered vegetation. These two options can be {{combined}} {{with the implementation of}} green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|During the {{considerations}} {{prior to}} the establishment of the national park, there was a conflict with the mining industry. Svalbard Minerals had found baryte within the national park borders, and Arktikugol holds two mining claim areas just south of the national park. The national park was established on 9 September 2005. It completed a several-year-long plan to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> protected areas of Svalbard from 55% to 65%, which had two years earlier resulted in Nordenskiöld Land National Park, Sassen – Bünsow Land National Park and Nordre Isfjorden National Park.|$|E

5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; {{the power of}} the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> dopamine in the {{basal ganglia}} by inhibiting {{the activity of}} monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of meth mouth usually {{attempts}} to increase salivary flow, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes. Toothpaste with fluoride {{is very important}} to the restoration of dental health. Only prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition. Sialogogues, drugs that <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against dental health problems. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this {{can also lead to}} less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E

5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range {{in the same way as}} the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E
5|$|Henry Washington Sawyer III (December 23, 1918 – July 31, 1999) was an American lawyer, {{civil rights}} activist, and Democratic politician. Born in Philadelphia, {{he served in}} World War II and {{attended}} the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Sawyer worked as a corporate lawyer but {{is best known for}} his advocacy of civil liberties, especially in First Amendment cases. In Abington School District v. Schempp and Lemon v. Kurtzman, he successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court of the United States that became the basis for all modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence. He pursued civil rights causes in Philadelphia and in the South during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He also served a four-year term on Philadelphia City Council, where he worked for civil service reform and to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> public art in the city.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 1965, the New York City Transit Authority {{announced}} plans to construct a subway station on the island along the planned 63rd Street Line, {{as part of the}} island's proposed transit-oriented development (TOD). TOD tries to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport. With this announcements, more suggestions for {{what to do with the}} island were made. The construction of a station was viewed to be vital for the development of the island, which was still known as Welfare Island. At that point, it was decided to build a shell for the station, to allow for the station to open after the opening of the rest of the line, with a projected savings of $4 million compared to building the station as an infill station after the rest of the line opened. The projected cost of the station was $3,300,000. It was soon decided to build the station with the rest of the line.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to manufacture an emulsified product with high emulsifying ability and emulsion stability by mixing minced meat from lizardfish with chicken-egg and rapeseed oil for better processing. The emulsifying ability and emulsion {{stability of the}} products were improved by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> oil added, and moreover, the former was improved by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> chicken-egg added. <b>The</b> emulsion stability of the products differed depending {{on the state of}} the egg added, i. e. the stability of the product with egg-white was highest, consequently, the stability of the product with whole egg was greater than that of the product with egg-yolk. The Hunter whiteness of the products was improved by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> oil added. <b>The</b> fishy odor in the product was depressed by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> egg and oil added to the meat. From these results, the satisfactory standard ratio of the meat:egg:oil was found to be 100 : 50 : 24 for manufacturing the product...|$|R

5|$|One form {{of apple}} allergy, {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{was often}} the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added {{on each side of}} the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of defences to make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises– a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage– and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for {{a short amount of}} time.|$|E

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E
5|$|Trees play a {{significant}} role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are one of the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.|$|E
5|$|When White {{took over}} as editor, Amazings {{circulation}} was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; Analog, by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden on his wife. White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the typeface to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both Fantastic and Amazing to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.|$|E
