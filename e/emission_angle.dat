25|$|The most {{advanced}} {{type of a}} detector is the RICH, or Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, developed in the 1980s. In a RICH detector, a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon detector, which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, the radius {{of which is a}} measure for the Cherenkov <b>emission</b> <b>angle.</b> Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a spherical mirror and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the emission point along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators—i.e. gases—due to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance—the proximity gap—and is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light, the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov <b>emission</b> <b>angle</b> and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID), a detector currently under construction for ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the six experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.|$|E

40|$|Rounding border effects at {{the escape}} point of open {{integrable}} billiards are analyzed via the escape times statistics and <b>emission</b> <b>angles.</b> The {{model is the}} rectangular billiard and {{the shape of the}} escape point is assumed to have a semicircular form. Stickiness and self-similar structures for the escape times and <b>emission</b> <b>angles</b> are generated inside "backgammon" like stripes of initial conditions. These stripes are born at the boundary between two different <b>emission</b> <b>angles</b> but same escape times. As the rounding effects increase, backgammon stripes start to overlap and the escape times statistics obeys the power law decay and anomalous diffusion is expected. Tiny rounded borders (around 0. 1 % from the whole billiard size) are shown to be sufficient to generate the sticky motion, while borders larger than 10 % are enough to produce escape times with chaotic decay.

5000|$|A surface which obeys Lambert's law {{is said to}} be Lambertian, and {{exhibits}} Lambertian reflectance. Such a surface has the same radiance when viewed from any angle. This means, for example, that to the human eye it has the same apparent brightness (or luminance). It has the same radiance because, although the emitted power from a given area element is reduced by the cosine of the <b>emission</b> <b>angle,</b> the apparent size of the observed area (="projected source area") as seen by a viewer, is decreased by a corresponding amount. Or equivalent, a remote sensor with a constant solid viewing angle (or [...] "aperture") will perceive a larger source area with decreasing emission angles, but observe less emitted power per unit source area: these two effects compensate each other and hence the observed radiance is independent from <b>emission</b> <b>angle.</b> Therefore, its radiance (power per unit solid angle per unit projected source area) is the same.|$|E

50|$|Real objects never {{behave as}} full-ideal black bodies, and instead the emitted {{radiation}} {{at a given}} frequency is {{a fraction of what}} the ideal emission would be. The emissivity of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body. This emissivity depends on factors such as temperature, <b>emission</b> <b>angle,</b> and wavelength. However, it is typical in engineering to assume that a surface's spectral emissivity and absorptivity do not depend on wavelength, so that the emissivity is a constant. This is known as the gray body assumption.|$|E
50|$|The {{spectrometer}} can use {{entrance and}} exit slits {{or use a}} small source, which only emits into specific angle and a small detector. Photoelectron spectra from single crystals exhibit a dependency on the <b>emission</b> <b>angle,</b> so that the entrance slit is needed. All the electrons from an isotopic source may be sucked off and focused into a directed beam (much like in an electron gun), which can then be analyzed. A position sensitive detector can detect the energy along one direction and depending on the additional optics lateral resolution or one angle along the other direction.|$|E

5000|$|Undulators {{can provide}} several orders of {{magnitude}} higher flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. For an undulator with N periods, the brightness can be up to [...] more than a bending magnet. The first factor of N occurs because the intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. The usual pulse is a sine with some envelope. The second factor of N comes from {{the reduction of the}} <b>emission</b> <b>angle</b> associated with these harmonics, which is reduced as 1/N.

50|$|Table-top {{laser-based}} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy {{had been}} developed by some research groups. Daniel Dessau of University of Colorado, Boulder, made the first demonstration and applied this technique to explore superconducting system. The achievement not only greatly reduces the costs and size of facility, but also, most importantly, provides the unprecedented higher bulk sensitivity due to the low photon energy, typically 6 eV, and consequently the longer photoelectron mean free path (2-7 nm) in the sample. This advantage is extremely beneficial and powerful {{for the study of}} strongly correlated materials and high-Tc superconductors in which the physics of photoelectrons from the topmost layers might be different from the bulk. In addition to about one-order-of-magnitude improvement in the bulk sensitivity, the advance in the momentum resolution is also very significant: the photoelectrons will be more broadly dispersed in <b>emission</b> <b>angle</b> when the energy of incident photon decreases. In other words, for a given angular resolution of the electron spectrometer, the lower photon energy leads to higher momentum resolution. The typical momentum resolution of a 6 eV laser-based ARPES is approximately 8 times better than that of a 50 eV synchrotron radiation ARPES. Besides, the better momentum resolution due to low photon energy also results in less k-space accessible to ARPES which is helpful to the more precise spectrum analysis. For instance, in the 50 eV synchrotron ARPES, electrons from the first 4 Brillouin zones will be excited and scattered to contribute to the background of photoelectron analysis. However, the small momentum of 6 eV ARPES will only access some part of the first Brillouin zone and therefore only those electrons from small region of k-space can be ejected and detected as the background. The reduced inelastic scattering background is desirable while doing the measurement of weak physical quantities, in particular the high-Tc superconductors.|$|E
