Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms.

5|$|While {{analyses}} by {{molecular phylogeny}} {{are confident that}} members of Lophotrochozoa are {{more closely related to}} each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. The Lophotrochozoa are generally divided into: Lophophorata (animals that have lophophores), including Phoronida and Brachiopoda; Trochozoa (animals many of which have trochophore larvae), including molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans; and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, <b>Gastrotricha,</b> Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Rotifera).|$|E
5|$|The gastrotrichs (phylum <b>Gastrotricha),</b> {{commonly}} referred to as hairybacks, are a group of microscopic (0.06-3.0mm), worm-like, pseudocoelomate animals, and are widely distributed and abundant in freshwater and marine environments. They are mostly benthic and live within the periphyton, the layer of tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and the beds of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. Nearly eight hundred species of gastrotrich have been described.|$|E
25|$|The Platyzoa {{include the}} phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms. These were {{originally}} considered {{some of the}} most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors. A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the flukes and tapeworms. Flatworms are acoelomates, lacking a body cavity, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic <b>Gastrotricha.</b> The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate. The most prominent are the Rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments. They also include the Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and possibly the Cycliophora. These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the Gnathifera.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gastrotricha</b> is a phylum of {{microscopic}} animals, found in freshwater and marine environments. Its members are termed gastrotrichs. They are bilaterally symmetric, {{with a complete}} gut. The body is covered with cilia, especially about the mouth, and has two terminal projections that serve as adhesive tubes. Like many microscopic animals, locomotion is primarily powered by hydrostatics, and they reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. Originally gastrotrichs were thought to have a pseudocoel, but this was an artifact created by preservation methods, and they are now known to be acoelomate. Genetic testings demonstrates close relation to flatworms. About 450 species are known, with an average life span of about three days.|$|E

5000|$|D. aspetos has {{originally}} been {{considered as a}} [...] "High Arctic species" [...] found in low Arctic only in winter since it has {{originally been}} found in its type locality (Kigdlugssaitsut, Disko Island, West Greenland) exclusively during winter. However, in 2006, the animal has also been sampled during the summer in the bay of Iterdla (also in Disko Island). Specimens are found in 2 to 5 meters water depth in well-sorted sand with detritus. D. aspetos appears to be associated to a rich diversity of <b>Gastrotricha</b> like Chaetonotus atrox, Halichaetonotus sp., Mesodasys sp., Paradasys sp., Tetranchyroderma sp., Thaumastoderma sp. and Turbanella sp.
