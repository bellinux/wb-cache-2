It {{is used in}} {{the magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, spine, and associated tissues. Particularly, it is able to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood–brain barrier and/or abnormal vascularity. <b>Gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> has been also approved for MR angiography of supraaortic vessels, cardiac MR (to detect myocardial infarctions), as well as whole-body MRI including abdominal, renal, pelvic, breast, and osteoarticular diseases. Cyclic chelates are more stable compared to linear chelates, and ionic chelates are more stable compared to nonionic chelates. Linear chelates have a greater likelihood of releasing free Gd 3 + compared to cyclic chelates. Non-ionic chelates are more likely, compared to ionic chelates, to release Gd 3 + from their chelates. <b>Gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> is a cyclic ionic chelate and has the greatest kinetic stability among gadolinium-based contrast agents. In patients with chronic reduced kidney function, the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents leads to acute kidney injury and dialysis. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agents. Therefore, it is recommended to administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging. The dose reduction allows protection the patients form potential risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a systemic reaction that is probably due to unbound Gd 3 + ions deposited in body tissues. The dose of <b>gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> should not exceed 0. 1 mmol/kg body weight. More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated administration, Dotarem® injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days. After administration, hemodialysis may not be useful to remove Dotarem® from the body. Dotarem® may allow the administration of a significantly lower dosage (a single dose of 0. 1 mmol/kg) compared to 0. 5 mmol/mL non-protein-binding gadolinium compounds and achieving equivalent efficacy in the MRI diagnostic detection rate.

40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} imaging-based response to standardized neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance mammography (DCE-MRM), whereas MR images were analyzed by an automatic computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system in comparison to visual evaluation. MRI findings were correlated with histopathologic response to NACT and also with the occurrence of metastases in a follow-up analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty-four patients with invasive ductal breast carcinomas received two identical MRI examinations (before and after NACT; 1. 5 T, contrast medium <b>gadoteric</b> <b>acid).</b> Pre-therapeutic images were compared with post-therapeutic examinations by CAD and two blinded human observers, considering morphologic and dynamic MRI parameters as well as tumor size measurements. Imaging-assessed response to NACT was compared with histopathologically verified response. All clinical, histopathologic, and DCE-MRM parameters were correlated with the occurrence of distant metastases. RESULTS Initial and post-initial dynamic parameters significantly changed between pre- and post-therapeutic DCE-MRM. Visually evaluated DCE-MRM revealed sensitivity of 85. 7...|$|E
40|$|Xylem flow is {{progressively}} {{shut down}} during maturation beginning with minor veins at the stylar end and progressing to major veins {{and finally to}} bundles at the stem end. This study investigates the functionality of the xylem vascular system in developing sweet cherry fruit (Prunus avium L.). The tracers acid fuchsin and <b>gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> were fed to the pedicel of detached fruit. The tracer distribution was studied using light microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. The vasculature of the sweet cherry comprises five major bundles. Three of these supply the flesh; two enter the pit to supply the ovules. All vascular bundles branch into major and minor veins that interconnect via numerous anastomoses. The flow in the xylem as indexed by the tracer distribution decreases continuously during development. The decrease is first evident at the stylar (distal) end of the fruit during pit hardening and progresses basipetally towards the pedicel (proximal) end of the fruit at maturity. That growth strains are {{the cause of the}} decreased conductance is indicated by: elastic strain relaxation after tissue excision, the presence of ruptured vessels in vivo, the presence of intrafascicular cavities, and the absence of tyloses...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE In {{contrast}} to conventional breast imaging techniques, one major diagnostic benefit of breast {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) is the simultaneous acquisition of morphologic and dynamic enhancement characteristics, {{which are based on}} angiogenesis and therefore provide insights into tumor pathophysiology. The aim of this investigation was to intraindividually compare 2 macrocyclic MRI contrast agents, with low risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, in the morphologic and dynamic characterization of histologically verified mass breast lesions, analyzed by blinded human evaluation and a fully automatic computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained. In this prospective, single-center study, 45 women with 51 histopathologically verified (41 malignant, 10 benign) mass lesions underwent 2 identical examinations at 1. 5 T (mean time interval, 2. 1 days) with 0. 1 -mmol kg doses of <b>gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> and gadobutrol.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{biomedical}} sciences, ex vivo angiography is {{a practical}} mean to elucidate vascular structures three-dimensionally with simultaneous estimation of intravascular volume. The objectives {{of this study were}} to develop a magnetic resonance (MR) method for ex vivo angiography and to compare the findings with computed tomography (CT). To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, examples are provided from four different tissues and species: the human placenta, a rice field eel, a porcine heart and a turtle. Results The optimal solution for ex vivo MR angiography (MRA) was a compound containing gelatine (0. 05 g/mL), the CT contrast agent barium sulphate (0. 43 mol/L) and the MR contrast agent <b>gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> (2. 5 mmol/L). It was possible to perform angiography on all specimens. We found that ex vivo MRA could only be performed on fresh tissue because formalin fixation makes the blood vessels permeable to the MR contrast agent. Conclusions Ex vivo MRA provides high-resolution images of fresh tissue and delineates fine structures that we were unable to visualise by CT. We found that MRA provided detailed information similar to or better than conventional CTA in its ability to visualize vessel configuration while avoiding interfering signals from adjacent bones. Interestingly, we found that vascular tissue becomes leaky when formalin-fixed, leading to increased permeability and extravascular leakage of MR contrast agent. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the ability of}} different types of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to stimulate fibroblast proliferation in monolayer cell culture. Materials and Methods: The National Health Service West Glasgow Ethics Committee granted approval for this study. Fibroblasts established from healthy volunteers (control subjects) and from lesional skin of patients with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis were exposed to a range of concentrations of ionic and nonionic linear and macrocyclic contrast agents over 4 days, and the effect on growth was determined. The lowest concentration of contrast agent that stimulated the maximum effect on fibroblast growth was selected for determination of its effect on fibroblast growth over 8 days. The effect of contrast agents on hyaluronan and collagen synthesis was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Responses were assessed with analysis of variance (general linear model). Results: The linear gadolinium contrast agents (gadodiamide, gadoversetamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, and gadobenate dimeglumine) produced a maximum stimulation of fibroblast proliferation at a concentration of 0. 1 mmol/L, with cell numbers increasing up to 2. 3 -fold. The macrocyclic contrast agents (<b>gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> and gadoteridol) produced a maximum stimulation of fibroblast proliferation at a concentration of 5 mmol/L. The reference gadolinium agents (N-methylglucamine gadolinium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and gadolinium trichloride) stimulated fibroblast proliferation at a concentration of 0. 01 mmol/L and were toxic at a concentration greater than 1 mmol/L. Growth curves supported the dose-response observations. Hyaluronan synthesis was stimulated by gadoversetamide, gadobenate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, and gadopentetate dimeglumine at a concentration of 0. 1 mmol/L and by gadolinium trichloride at a concentration of 0. 01 mmol/L, whereas collagen synthesis was unaffected.

40|$|Background The {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} study is to evaluate the results of T 1 -weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pediatric patients at 1. 5 T, with a low peripheral intravenous <b>gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> injection rate of 1 [*]ml/s. Materials and methods Children with neurological symptoms were examined prospectively with conventional MRI and T 1 -weighted DCE MRI. An magnetic resonance perfusion analysis method was used to obtain time-concentration curves (persistent pattern, type-I; plateau pattern, type-II; washout pattern, type-III) and to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters. A total of two radiologists manually defined regions of interest (ROIs) {{in the part of}} the lesion exhibiting the greatest contrast enhancement and in the surrounding normal or contralateral tissue. Lesion/surrounding tissue or contralateral tissue pharmacokinetic parameter ratios were calculated. Tumors were categorized by grade (I-IV) using the World Health Organization (WHO) Grade. Mann-Whitney testing and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed. Results A total of nine boys and nine girls (mean age 10. 5 years) were included. Lesions consisted of 10 brain tumors, 3 inflammatory lesions, 3 arteriovenous malformations and 2 strokes. We obtained analyzable concentration-time curves for all patients (6 type-I, 9 type-II, 3 type-III). K(trans) between tumor tissue and surrounding or contralateral tissue was significantly different (p[*]=[*] 0. 034). K(trans) ratios were significantly different between grade I tumors and grade IV tumors (p[*]=[*] 0. 027) and a K(trans) ratio value superior to 0. 63 appeared to be discriminant to determine a grade IV of malignancy. Conclusions Our results confirm the feasibility of pediatric T 1 -weighted DCE MRI at 1. 5 T with a low injection rate, which could be of great value in differentiating brain tumor grades...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundAntibody-mediated {{rejection}} (AMR) {{is characterized}} by histopathological and immunophenotypic findings such as activated endothelial cells, intravascular macrophages and evidence of capillary C 4 d deposition. This inflammatory reaction could be followed by diffuse fibrosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with recently T 1 mapping is a promising technique to identify diffuse myocardial fibrosis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess T 1 mapping in patients with AMR. Method 2 patients with clinical AMR (histopathological and immunophenotypic findings, presence of donor-specific allo antibodies and allograft dysfunction) performed a CMR study one week (for the first patient) and 3 weeks (for the second patient) after the treatment of AMR (plasmapheresis, IV Immunoglobulins and Rituximab). Images were acquired on a 1. 5 Tesla scanner (Siemens) including T 1 mapping using a shortened modified look-locker inversion-recovery sequence and T 2 mapping in a matched mid-ventricular short axis slice using a black- blood single shot fast spin echo pulse sequence. Segmental and global T 1 values were measured before and 15 minutes after administration of 0. 2 mmol/kg of <b>Gadoteric</b> <b>acid</b> and compared to our cohort of 17 controls. ResultsMean non contrast T 1 values were significantly higher in heart transplants patients compared to controls (1100 ± 5 ms vs 947 ± 29 ms, P< 0. 001). Segmental T 1 values were significantly higher in the 6 regions of interest compared to controls (P < 0. 001 in all segments). Mean post contrast T 1 values were not significantly different in patients and controls. Mean T 2 value was higher in patients compared to controls (73 ± 13 vs 50 ± 4 ms), suggesting the presence of global edema. ConclusionHeart transplant patients with clinical antibody-mediated rejection show a significant increased global and segmental non contrast T 1 values suggesting the presence of diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Further studies are required to confirm these data...|$|E
