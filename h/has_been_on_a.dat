5|$|First {{inhabited}} by native people, Cooper was founded around 1870, {{at the same}} time that Delta County was established. Cooper grew rapidly and it quickly became the center of local events. The city's economy relied primarily on agricultural farming and the shipping of local goods. In the mid-1890s, a railroad line was built through the city, assisting in Cooper's growth. The city continued to grow through the 1910s, and into the early 1920s. In 1926, however, the region's cotton crop failed, devastating the local economy. Many businesses were forced to close, including the railroad, and the city's population plummeted. Although Cooper began to recover during the mid-1930s, many people who left did not return, and the city never fully recovered. The local economy continued to rely on the growing of cotton as the main economy into the 1960s, until it began to shift to wheat growing in the early 1970s. The population of Cooper <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slow decline since the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|With the {{administration}} of President Donald Trump, environmental regulations concerning coal mining are set to be eased. An executive order was proposed in February 2017 to reverse the Stream Protection Rule that aims at protecting nearby waters from surface mining debris.

The repeal of President Obama's Stream Protection Rule could possibly endanger species by polluting ecosystems and thereby harming biodiversity.
