This effect is the peak natural {{resonance frequency}} of the circuit and in general is not exactly the same as the driven resonance frequency, although the two will usually be quite close to each other.

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of blood pressure using a fluid-filled catheter and an electromechanical transducer is widely accepted in clinical practice. However, errors {{associated with the}} measurement are often not appreciated and these catheter-manometer systems are frequently unable to accurately reproduce applied pressures. To assess the accuracy of catheter-manometer systems used for invasive arterial blood pressure measurements, in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed. The frequency response (described in terms of <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and damping factor) {{for a variety of}} cannulae, pressure tubing and stopcocks (and combinations thereof) and their dependence on various parameters (catheter length, lumen diameter, fluid temperature and catheter material) were measured using an hydraulic pressure generator. The design and construction details of the pressure generator are presented. It was found that the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of the catheter-manometer system is directly proportional to lumen diameter of the pressure tubing/catheter. Furthermore, damping factor is inversely related to the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and stiffer catheter material (for identical radius ratios) results in higher <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> Catheter length is inversely related to <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and the resonant frequency decreases for an increase in fluid operating temperature. It was established that all catheter-manometer systems tested were under-damped (0. 15 < β < 0. 37) and that the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> ranged from 10. 5 Hz for 1500 mm to 27. 0 Hz for pressure tubing of 300 mm in length. Furthermore, catheter-manometer systems which had pressure tubing in excess of 300 mm in length did not comply with the bandwidth requirements for accurate dynamic blood pressure measurement. For the in vivo assessment of the catheter-manometer system, the blood pressure waveform was analysed in the time and frequency domains. It was established that in 60 percent of the cases, the systolic pressure peak was higher when measured by a narrow bandwidth catheter-manometer system compared to that measured by a wide bandwidth system. Furthermore, values of dp/dt maximum were lower for wide bandwidth catheter-manometer systems than those measured by narrow bandwidth systems for heart rates above 90 beats per minute. In the frequency domain analysis, artifact was sometimes found to occur at frequencies higher than the bandwidth of the catheter-manometer system. This high frequency artifact was found to distort the blood pressure waveform and resulted in false high dp/dt and peak systolic pressures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} the Complex Mode Indication Function (CMIF) and its application in spatial domain parameter estimation. The concept of CMIF is developed by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Frequency Response Function (FRF) matrix at each spectral line. The CMIF is defined as the eigenvalues, which are the square of the singular values, solved from the normal matrix formed from the FRF matrix, [] []) () (ww jHjH H, at each spectral line. The CMIF appears to be a simple and efficient method for identifying the modes of the complex system. The CMIF identifies modes by showing the physical magnitude of each mode and the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> for each root. Since multiple reference data is applied in CMIF, repeated roots can be detected. The CMIF also gives global modal parameters, such as damped natural frequencies, mode shapes and modal participation vectors. Since CMIF works in the spatial domain, uneven frequency spacing data such as data from Spatial Sine Testing can be used. A second stage procedure for accurate <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and damping estimation as well as mode shape scaling is also discussed in this paper...|$|E

Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of quantified measurement variables; however, little {{work has been done}} to correlate experimental data with theoretical models using entire PTR responses. In the present study, it is hypothesized that PTR responses may be described by the exponential decay rate and <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of a theoretical second-order system.
