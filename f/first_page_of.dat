5|$|As {{was common}} in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) played {{a young man}} (Peter). The play's script assigns {{dialogue}} to three numbered villagers in the opening scene. The named character of Jacques has no more lines than any of these and disappears after the <b>first</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the script. Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish caricature. Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad portrayal and interpolations show that Gilbert had little control of Righton's portrayal of the part.|$|E
5|$|The {{headpieces}} are decorated, with headings {{written in}} gold and red; in some places nicely decorated initial letters can be found (in red or gold). The Ammonian sections are written in red. The pages are numbered; the Greek quire numbers are still found at the top right of some pages. At the top left of the <b>first</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> most quires in Gospel of Matthew, Arabic quire numbers are found.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of holding}} a bicycle race around Italy was first {{suggested}} in a telegram sent by Tullo Margagni, editor of La Gazzetta dello Sport, to the paper's owner Emilio Costamagna and cycling editor Armando Cougnet. La Gazzettas rival, Corriere della Sera {{was planning to}} hold a bicycle race of its own, flushed {{with the success of}} its automobile race. Morgagni decided to try and hold the race before Corriere della Sera could hold theirs, and following La Gazzettas success in creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San Remo, Costamagna decided to back the idea. The inaugural Giro d'Italia bicycle race was announced on 7 August 1908 in the <b>first</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> that day's edition of La Gazzetta, to be held in May 1909. The idea of the race was influenced by the success of the French magazine L'Autos organization of the Tour de France.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts {{had been made of}} the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the <b>first</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if {{they were part of the}} text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million pounds of wool, 316,610 pounds of hides and skins, 1.3 million pounds of tanning materials, 4 million pounds of copra, 544,660 pounds of crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of electrolytic copper. The <b>first</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{happened on}} 28 March 1997 in the Strait of Otranto when the Italian Navy vessel Sibilia {{collided with the}} Albanian ship Kateri i Radës which had left from the Albanian port city of Vlorë with 142 people on board. The Sibilla sought to stop and inspect the ship suspected of containing irregular migrants. The vessel instead ended up colliding with the ship and sinking it. According to Italian authorities, there was no intention to cause the collision. The Zefiro first approached and identified the Kateri i Radës as a motorboat with approximately 30 civilians on board. The motorboat continued toward Italy even though a stop order issued by the Zefiro. This happened around 4:30 PM, near the Albanian island Sazan. Sibilia then took over the operation and during its maneuvers, the Italian ship caused the Kateri i Radës to turn which resulted in subsequent deaths. After the Albanian ship was capsized, the Sibilia allegedly left and came back approximately 20 minutes later. The bodies of at least 52 {{who lost their lives}} were recovered. The total number of dead may be as high as 83. The survivors were taken to the Apulian port of Brindisi, where they arrived at 2:45 AM. They were then put on a bus, and taken to an immigration center to be identified. On 29 and 30 March 1997, news of the disaster made it to the <b>first</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> major Italian newspapers, relating the sense of gravity of the incident, which reported it as either a collision or a ramming. March 31 was a day of mourning in Albania.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} innovation of Roslin {{in regards}} to ornaments within canon tables is the addition of bust portraits. In the Gospel of 1262 (MS No. 2660), Eusebius and Carpianus are represented as full figures standing in the outer margins of the Letter of Eusebius. Roslin also represented prophets such as David, Moses and John the Baptist. This system was highly unusual for canon table decoration, for although portraits of prophets had been represented next to canon tables {{as early as the}} 6th-century Syriac Rabbula Gospels, their relationship to the gospels was not made explicit through the quotation of their messianic prophecies. New zoomorphic creatures are also added to the usual repertoire of winged sphinxes and sirens such as dog or goat headed men carrying branches of flowers along with various quadrupeds and birds. On the <b>first</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> each gospel and the beginning of pericopes floral as well as zoomorphic letters are formed utilizing peacocks or other creatures.|$|E
