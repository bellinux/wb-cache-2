5|$|Brown {{initially}} conceded discovery {{credit to}} Ortiz, but came to suspect the Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from the Spanish observatory {{the day before}} the discovery announcement. These logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images, and they were accessed again just before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating he was merely verifying whether they <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> new object.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> {{simple method}} to {{implement}} deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy {{and his students}} in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, Sullivan {{scholars}} Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry {{announced that}} they <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts. These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded. This piece has now been performed {{a number of times}} by amateur and professional companies, although it has not become a standard addition to the traditional scores or recordings.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{began in}} August 2000, when John Purnell, director {{of security for}} Tesco, the United Kingdom's largest supermarket chain, was telephoned by a newsagent in Bournemouth, Dorset, who <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> copy of an extortion letter left on his shop's photocopier. The letter demanded that Tesco give away Clubcards, modified for use in cash machines, in the Bournemouth Daily Echo. Over the following days, Dorset Police received two other letters, threatening to send bombs to Tesco customers if the demands were not met.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, Szilard {{began working}} at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Working {{with a young}} {{physicist}} on the hospital staff, Thomas A. Chalmers, he began studying radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. It was known that bombarding elements with neutrons could produce either heavier isotopes of an element, or a heavier element, a phenomenon known as the Fermi Effect after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. When they bombarded ethyl iodide with neutrons produced by a radon-beryllium source, {{they found that the}} heavier radioactive isotopes of iodine separated from the compound. Thus, they <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> means of isotope separation. This method became known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect, and was widely used in the preparation of medical isotopes. He also attempted unsuccessfully to create a nuclear chain reaction using beryllium by bombarding it with X-rays. In 1936, Szilard assigned his chain-reaction patent to the British Admiralty to ensure its secrecy.|$|E

5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, {{people began}} {{treasure}} hunting at Buckton Castle, and in 1767 {{there were reports}} that one such venture <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> gold necklace and a silver vessel, though these artefacts have since been lost. This prompted the interest of local antiquarians and several visited in the 18th and 19th centuries, often drawing plans of Buckton Castle. In the 20th century it was suggested that the castle may have been an Iron Age hillfort, however a study of hillforts in Cheshire and Lancashire found that Buckton Castle was topographically different from these sites. Excavation in the 1990s demonstrated that the site was medieval, with no sign of earlier activity. It was also suggested that the castle was a ringwork – a type of fortification where earthworks formed {{an integral part of the}} defence. However, this was before archaeologists established that the first phase of the castle was a curtain wall and the earthworks seen today are the result of the collapse of the structure. Buckton is now considered to be an enclosure castle, with stone walls forming the key defence.|$|E
5|$|Plantard then {{enlisted the}} aid of author Gérard de Sède {{to write a book}} based on his {{unpublished}} manuscript and forged parchments, alleging that Saunière <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> link to a hidden treasure. The 1967 book L'or de Rennes, ou La vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château ("The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of Bérenger Saunière, Priest of Rennes-le-Château"), which was later published in paperback under the title Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Château ("The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Château") in 1968, became a popular read in France. It included copies of the found parchments (the originals were, of course, never produced), though it did not provide the decoded hidden texts contained within them. One of the Latin texts in the parchments was copied from the Novum Testamentum, an attempted restoration of the Vulgate by John Wordsworth and Henry White. The other text was copied from the Codex Bezae. Based on the wording used, the versions of the Latin texts found in the parchments can be shown to have been copied from books first published in 1889 and 1895, which is problematic considering that de Sède's book was trying to make a case that these documents were centuries old.|$|E

25|$|In the 1940s, {{the most}} famous betting scandal in North American {{organised}} sport was baseball's 1919 World Series. However, gambling was also a problem in professional hockey.

25|$|At the time, all dyes {{used for}} {{colouring}} cloth were natural substances, {{many of which}} were expensive and labour-intensive to extract. Furthermore, many lacked stability, or fastness. The colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times, was especially expensive and difficult to produce — the dye used, known as Tyrian purple, was made from the glandular mucus of certain molluscs. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and so Perkin and his brother realised that they <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> possible substitute whose production could be commercially successful.|$|E
