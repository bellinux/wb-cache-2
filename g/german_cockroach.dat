5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the <b>German</b> <b>cockroach</b> holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

Populations of cockroaches which became established in rooms, increased in summer but decreased with the fall in indoor temperature. However, the population which became established around the heating resource did not decrease.

40|$|Nutritional {{status of}} <b>German</b> <b>cockroaches</b> {{from the field}} (HUD apartments) was {{estimated}} using uric acid content to measure amount of protein consumed, and respiratory quotient (RQ) to measure fat and carbohydrate metabolized. Initial trials demonstrated the stability of these two indicators as nymphal cockroaches grow and with timing of meals. Nutrient consumption (and presumed availability) was estimated by comparing uric acid content and RQ of nymphal cockroaches collected from kitchens of HUD apartments with those reared in the laboratory and provided a series of meridic diets. Uric acid content was linearly related to percentage of dietary protein (y= 6. 2 x 232. 07, r 2 = 0. 96) and RQ was linearly related to log 10 (% fat: % carbohydrate) (y= 20. 148 Log(x) + 0. 790, r 2 = 0. 68). Field-collected <b>German</b> <b>cockroaches</b> contained 10. 9 – 7. 7 to 22. 9 – 5. 1 m g/mg uric acid and RQ of 0. 770 – 0. 024 to 0. 803 – 0. 260. Comparatively, cockroaches provided rodent chow had greater uric acid content (125. 1 – 9. 6 m g/mg) and RQ (0. 878 – 0. 022). Employing linear calibration and these regressions, diet consumed by <b>German</b> <b>cockroaches</b> in the field was estimated at 7 – 3 % to 9 – 3 % protein and equivalent amounts of carbohydrates and fat as an energy source. <b>German</b> <b>cockroaches</b> in the field consume less protein and carbohydrates, and more fat compared to those provided a standard laboratory diet such as rodent chow.

40|$|<b>German</b> <b>cockroaches</b> are {{important}} urban pests {{that have been}} linked to asthma and serious allergic reactions in sensitized individuals. In this research project I, (i) identified different proteins expressed in the tergal glands of male <b>German</b> <b>cockroaches,</b> (ii) determined the expression levels of these proteins in different cockroach life stages and tissues, and (iii) investigated the role of the tergal gland alpha-amylase (BGTG- 1) protein. ^ Four major tergal gland proteins were separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. With peptide sequencing two of these proteins were identified as alpha-amylase (BGTG- 1) and Blattella germanica allergen 2 (Bla g 2). Both of these proteins showed highest relative expression in adult male tergal glands as compared to other body parts of adult males, non-gravid females and gravid females. Enzyme assays and RNA interference (RNAi) based silencing of the BGTG- 1 gene/protein, provided preliminary evidence that it hydrolyzes starch to release maltose. ^ Overall, proteins found in the tergal glands of male <b>German</b> <b>cockroaches</b> appear to be serving potentially important roles within the glands. Future research will identify the functional roles of these proteins in cockroach mating behavior and allergen biology. The ultimate goal of tergal gland biology research is to find ways to disrupt cockroach mating behavior and allergen production and use this knowledge for cockroach management and allergen mitigation. ...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>German</b> <b>cockroach</b> reproduces {{faster than}} any other {{residential}} cockroach, growing from egg to reproductive adult in approximately 50 - 60 days. [...] Once fertilized, a female <b>German</b> <b>cockroach</b> develops an ootheca in her abdomen. The abdomen swells as her eggs develop, until the translucent tip of the ootheca begins to protrude {{from the end of}} her abdomen, and by that time the eggs inside are fully sized. The ootheca, at first translucent, soon turns white and then within a few hours it turns pink, progressively darkening until, some 48 hours later, it attains the dark red-brown of the shell of a chestnut. The ootheca has a keel-like ridge along the line where the young emerge, and curls slightly towards that edge as it completes its maturation. A small percentage of the nymphs may hatch while the ootheca is still attached to the female, but the majority emerge some 24 hours after it has detached from the female's body. The newly hatched 3mm-long black nymphs then progress through six or seven instars before becoming sexually mature, but ecdysis is such a hazardous process that nearly half the nymphs die of natural causes before reaching adulthood. Molted skins and dead nymphs are soon eaten by living nymphs present at the time of molting.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of essential oil of Chenopodium ambrosioides flowering aerial parts and its three main active ingredients was evaluated against Blattella germanica male adults. Methods: Composition of essential oil {{was determined by}} GC-MS. Topical application bioassay was used to evalu-ate contact toxicity of essential oil and three main components. Fumigant toxicity of essential oil and its main com-ponents was measured using a sealed space method. Results: Twenty-two components were identified in the essential oil and the main components were (Z) -ascaridole (29. 7 %), isoascaridole (13. 0 %), ρ-cymene (12. 7 %) and piperitone (5. 0 %). The essential oil and (Z) -ascaridole, isoascaridole and -cymene possessed fumigant toxicity against male <b>German</b> <b>cockroaches</b> with LC 50 values of 4. 13, 0. 55, 2. 07 and 6. 92 mg/L air, respectively.
