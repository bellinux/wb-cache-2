40|$|ABSTRACT 1 The fatigue {{analysis}} of a wind turbine component typically uses representative samples of cyclic loads to determine lifetime loads. In this paper, several techniques currently in use are compared to one another based on fatigue life analyses. The generalized Weibull <b>fitting</b> <b>technique</b> is used to remove the artificial truncation of large-amplitude cycles that is inherent in relatively short data sets. Using data from the Sandia/DOE 34 -m Test Bed, the generalized Weibull <b>fitting</b> <b>technique</b> is shown to be excellent for matching {{the body of the}} distribution of cyclic loads and for extrapolating the tail of the distribution. However, the data also illustrate that the <b>fitting</b> <b>technique</b> is not a substitute for an adequate data base...|$|R

50|$|The {{somewhat}} arbitrary {{choice of}} starting values produces a {{bias in the}} calculated values. The refinement process continues by setting the new calculated structure factor to the observed structure factor value. The process is then repeated with the new structure factor estimate. At this point, the unit cell, background, peak widths, peak shape, and resolution function are refined, and the parameters are improved. The structure factor is then reset to the new structure factor value, and the process begins again. Structural refinement can continue with whole profile <b>fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> or further treatment of peak overlap. Probabilistic approaches may {{also be used to}} treat peak overlap.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 31) This surface fitting {{program was}} designed for the student of graphics who has {{a special interest in}} shape modeling techniques. The techniques studied are used when the primary concern is not the computation of derived properties such as areas and volumes but, rather, the flexibility given to the designer in the design of shapes. The three surface <b>fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> implemented in this program are Bezier, non-periodic B-spline, and periodic B-spline. The program allows the user to give surface specifications which consist of a set of points in 3 -space, a set of surface <b>fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> with all their associated parameters, and transformations to be performed on the surfaces. When requested the surface specifications will be interpreted and if no errors were found the surfaces will be drawn. If errors occur the appropriate error messages are generated and the user may save the surface specification on a Floppy Disk to be retrieved later on for display or further work. Included in this project is a description of the three surface <b>fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> and the algorithms used to implement them, a users manual, a set of actual curves and surfaces demonstrating many of the properties of the surface <b>fitting</b> <b>techniques,</b> and syntax diagrams which define what the program accepts as a valid surface specification...|$|E

40|$|Freeform feature <b>fitting</b> is a <b>technique</b> {{underlying}} different applications, including reverse engineering, {{object recognition}} and conceptual shape design. The latter application poses specific requirements to the <b>fitting</b> <b>technique</b> {{with regard to}} speed, robustness and interactivity. On the other hand, the spatial accuracy and {{the density of the}} input data can be permitted to be relatively low. We have performed freeform feature fitting to physical shapes using both a high-density mechanical scanning device and a low-cost desktop laser scanner. The performance of these technologies have been compared. The <b>fitting</b> <b>technique</b> is based on direct template matching, where a template is a 3 D shape feature under control of 6 placement parameters (defining the ridged body transformation) and a number of intrinsic form parameters. We found that template matching remained reliable even for sparse and partly missing data. A low-cost, high-speed scanner can hence function as a 3 D digital shape copier and be a supportive tool for conceptual product design. Limitations and extension of the technology are addressed...|$|R
