5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E

25|$|At {{the death}} of his father, Charles VI, the {{succession}} was cast into doubt. The Treaty of Troyes, signed by Charles VI in 1420, mandated that the throne pass to the infant King Henry VI of England, the son of the recently deceased Henry V and Catherine of Valois, daughter of Charles VI; however, Frenchmen loyal to the king of France regarded the treaty as invalid on grounds of coercion and Charles VI's diminished mental capacity. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not recognize the treaty and believed the Dauphin Charles to be of legitimate birth, he was considered to be the rightful heir to the throne. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not recognize his legitimacy, the rightful heir was recognized as Charles, Duke of Orléans, cousin of the Dauphin, who was in English captivity. Only the supporters of Henry VI and the Dauphin Charles were able to enlist sufficient military force to press effectively for their candidates. The English, already in control of northern France, were able to enforce the claim of their king in the regions of France that they occupied. Northern France, including Paris, was thus ruled by an English regent, Henry V's brother, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, based in Normandy (see Dual monarchy of England and France).|$|E
25|$|Brynien {{negotiated}} a new {{collective bargaining agreement}} for PEF in 2008. Negotiations for the new contract were short and generated almost no public notice. The four-year contract's terms, which were retroactive to April 2007 (the date the old agreement expired), included an average 4 percent wage increase per year, higher pay for employees working in or near New York City, new health insurance benefits, and improved educational benefits. About two-thirds of PEF members voted in contract approval balloting, with the pact receiving 97 approval <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> vote.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} first {{announced}} in April 2014, alongside multiple media expansions to the franchise, including a Japanese live-action movie and an original novel and comic. The game's title and release date were revealed during a special Niconico livestream in July. The digital version's large size required the purchasing {{of an additional}} external drive <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not own a Deluxe Wii U. It was initially stated by Koei Tecmo's European branch that the game would not be released outside Japan. Its release in Western territories was initially hinted at by Tomonobu Itagaki, who stated through his Twitter account that Kikuchi would release the game in North America.|$|E

25|$|Women {{comprised}} {{one-third of}} the EZLN army, and {{a significant portion of}} them held commanding offices. In addition, about half of the EZLN’s support base was women. Initially, the majority of the women insurgents were in the less-organized local militias, but later decided to join the actual EZLN. The women who joined as insurgents had to renounce having a family of their own, because it was too difficult to care for children in the conditions they lived in. There was family planning for women insurgents, but <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> get pregnant, they either went home or left the child with their parents. In the insurgent camps men and women share cooking and cleaning tasks equally.|$|E
25|$|Social and {{political}} pressure {{led to the}} abolition of the slave trade throughout the British Empire in 1807, with other European nations following suit. Labour-intensive industries, such as cotton and sugar plantations, mines and railway construction, in the colonies were left without a cheap source of manpower. As a consequence, a large-scale slavery-like trade in Asian (primarily Indian and Chinese) indentured labourers began in the 1820s to fill this vacuum. Some of these labourers signed contracts based on misleading promises, some were kidnapped and sold into the trade, some were victims of clan violence whose captors sold them to coolie brokers, while others sold themselves to pay off gambling debts. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> sign on voluntarily, they generally signed on for a period of two to five years. In addition to having their passage paid for, Coolies were also paid under twenty cents per day, on average. However, over a dollar would be taken from them every month in order to pay off their debts. British companies were the first to experiment with this potential new form of cheap labour in 1807, when they imported 200 Chinese men to work in Trinidad. One of the first people to begin importing Coolies from the East was Sir John Gladstone.|$|E

500|$|The {{attempt at}} Christianization of the Aboriginal people of Canada had been ongoing {{since the first}} missionaries arrived in the 1600s, however it became more {{systematic}} with the Indian Act in 1876, which would bring new sanctions <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not convert to Christianity. For example, the new laws would prevent non-Christian Aboriginal people from testifying or having their cases heard in court and ban alcohol consumption. When the Indian Act was amended in 1884, traditional religious and social practices, such as the Potlatch, would be banned, and further amendments in 1920 would prevent [...] "status Indians" [...] (as defined in the Act) from wearing traditional dress or performing traditional dances {{in an attempt to}} stop all non-Christian practices.|$|E

500|$|The New York {{newspaper}} industry came to {{an abrupt}} halt on Dec. 8 1962 when the local of the International Typographical Union, led by Bert Powers, walked off the job, leading to the 114-day 1962-63 New York City newspaper strike. The ITU, known as [...] "Big Six," [...] represented 3,800 printers, as well as workers at 600 printshops and 28 publications in the city but, like other newspaper unions, had taken a backseat to the Newspaper Guild (which had the largest membership among the unions) in contract negotiations. This arrangement began to fray in the 1950s, as the craft unions felt the Guild was too inclined to accept publishers' offers without concern <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the manual work of printing.

500|$|Large {{quantities}} of two-cent pieces were withdrawn in the 1870s and after. Approximately 17,000,000 of the some 45,600,000 two-cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909. Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one-cent pieces. [...] A bill for a two-cent piece bearing {{the portrait of}} recently deceased former president Theodore Roosevelt passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted. Numismatist S.W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two-cent piece, but <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did,</b> it was often associated with spending it at a candy store. [...] He recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets, as a dime did in Freeman's day, and, he feared, {{it would take a}} quarter to do in the future. Full legal tender status was granted the two-cent piece by the Coinage Act of 1965, long after the coin had passed from circulation, as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit. Nevertheless, numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan, the piece [...] "hardly got its two cents in".|$|E
