The strain Weissella cibaria (KTSMBNL 28) isolated from goat milk showed more antibactericidal activity than other strains from cow milk and idli batter. This strain was able to tolerate pH 3. 0 which maintained in gastric fluid and resist upto 1 % of bile salt retained in intestinal fluid. Moreover, KTSMBNL 28 recorded highest level of hydrophobicity (35 - 70 %) and its non <b>haemolytic</b> <b>property</b> ensured the safe mode of application. Among the 15 antibiotics tested, KTSMBNL 28 showed resistance towards penicillin, vancomycin and nalidixic acid.

Smoked Asian Clams were known as a popular side dishes in Malaysia especially in state of Kelantan. Eventhough there was increasing rate of gastrointestinal disease and E. coli infections suffered among the peoples who consumed the Smoked Asian Clams. there was no detail database information on antibiogram profile of E. coli from Smoked Asian Clams had been recorded. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the total bacterial colony of E. coli in Smoked Asian Clams and to determine the effectiveness of 19 antibiotics against isolated E. coli. The susceptibility testing was pc:thorned using standard disk diffusion method against 19 tested antibiotics namely sulphamethoxazole (25 μg), oleondomycin (15 μg), florfenicol (30 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), spiramycin (100 μg), colistine sulphate (25 μg), flumequine (30 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), oxolinic acid (2 μg), novobiocin (30 μg), fosfomycin (50 μg). erythromycin (15 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), doxycycline (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), compound sulphonamides (300 μg), lincomycin (15 μg), amoxycillin (25 μg). gentamycin (120 μg). The isolates were highly resistance to nine antibiotics (novobiocin, ampicillin, lincomycin, amoxycillin, colistin sulphate, spiramycin. oleondomycin, erythromycin, sulphamethoxazole) and as well as highly sensitive to another four antibiotics (chloromphenicol, oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, flumequine).

Incubation of silver (Ag), gold (Au) and Pt nanoparticles with human RBC demonstrated that Au and Pt nanoparticles are non-haemolytic but cause haemagglutination, while Ag nanoparticles are haemolytic [14]. In vitro haemocompatibility studies indicated that biosynthesised Pt nanoparticles had negligible haemolytic effects [17], while Ashranani et al. reported that Pt and Au nanoparticles (compared to Ag) were more haemocompatible and did not show the agglutination of erythrocyte and also no precipitation properties [14]. On the other hand, Ag nanoparticles did not cause significant changes in micronucleated polychromic erythrocytes, and no dose-dependent differences in haemolysis were observed [3].

40|$|Study on the {{biomarkers}} types {{to assess}} {{health status of}} marine ecosystems in environmental biomonitoring has an important value. Accordingly, accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) in sediment, water and tissues (liver and gill) of mudskipper(i. e. Boleophthalmus dussumieri) and some physiological responses like lysosomal membrane change performed on haemocytes, stability of red blood cell membrane and the Glutathione-S Transferase (GST) activity in the liver were measured in mudskipper. Samples were obtained from five sites along north western coast of the Persian Gulf (Khuzestan coast). Red blood cell membrane changes after different concentration of PAHs at different time was also studied to evaluate impact of PAHs compound on cell membrane. PAHs concentration was measured by HPLC method. The activity of GST enzyme was analysed by spectrophotometric method. Lysosomal membrane change was measured by NRR time method and stability of red blood cell membrane was evaluated by EOF test. Total PAH concentrations in the coastal sea water, the sediments, the liver and the gill tissues ranged between 0. 80 - 18. 34 μg/l, 113. 50 - 3384. 34 ng g- 1 (dry weight), 3. 99 - 46. 64 ng g- 1 dw and 3. 11 - 17. 76 ng g- 1 dw, respectively. Highest PAHs pollution was found at Jafari while the lowest was detected at Bahrakan sampling sites. The lowest enzymatic activity was identified at Bahrakan (7. 19 ± 1. 541 nmol/mg protein/min), while the highest was recorded at Jafari (46. 96 ± 7. 877 nmol/mg protein/min). Comparative analysis of GST activity in the liver of mudskippers showed significant difference (p 0. 05). Osmotic fragility curves indicated that erythrocytes collected from mudskippers at Jafari were the most 009 fragile followed by Zangi> Arvand> Samayeli> and Bahrakan. The mean erythrocyte fragility was significantly higher at Jafari site (p 0. 05). The results further indicated significant differences (P< 0. 05) between the control and treatments of mudskipper RBC exposed to acute. Potency Divisor concentrations. It {{is clear from the}} present result that chronic. Potency Divisor concentrations protect red cells against osmotic hemolysis. This study, however, showed that PAH concentrations in this region are not higher than the available standards. The findings showed that Lysosomal membrane destabilization, liver GST activities and fragility of red cell membrane are highly sensitive in the mudskipper, B. dussumieri. Thus, mudskipper perceived to be good sentinel organisms for PAH pollution monitoring. Sediment PAH concentrations were strongly correlated with biomarkers, indicating that PAH type pollutants were biologically available to fish. One of the possible risk assessment implications {{of this study is that}} biomarkers can be applied not only to characterize biological effects of pollution exposures, but also to determine the bioavailability of pollution in aquatic systems.

30|$|The <b>haemolytic</b> <b>properties</b> of Pt drugs during {{chemotherapy}} {{are also}} responsible for higher risks of blood diseases like anaemia [28]. Comparing {{the results of this}} study with previous reports on the haemocompatibility of cisplatin confirmed the haemolytic activity of Pt-based drugs as one of the main side effects causing haemolytic anaemia and also bone marrow diseases and haemolysis [2, 29]. The present results demonstrated that both cisplatin and NP-Pt induced haemolysis compared to the control group. Evaluation of haemocompatibility of nanoparticles should be considered as one of the factors of assessing systemic toxicity. <b>Haemolytic</b> <b>properties</b> of the nanoparticles can be determined by spectrophotometric measurement (540  nm) and based on adjustments of the ASTM F- 756 - 00 standard [22]. Human RBC have different morphology than chicken RBC, with the primary difference being that chicken RBC have a nucleus containing genetic material. The mechanism of action for platinum-containing anticancer drug utilizes the presence of DNA to induce cancer cell death by apoptosis [30, 31]. Regarding the antineoplastic properties of ciplatin, it is important to emphasize that the intravenous administration of cisplatin has severe side effect on blood compartments. The present results confirmed that cisplatin and NP-Pt not only induced haemolysis but also caused the structural damage of RBC. Haemolytic as well as toxic properties of nanoparticles can be reduced by increasing the particle size [12] or by excluding intravenous administration.|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of new anti-infective compounds is stagnating and multi-resistant bacteria continue to emerge, threatening {{to end the}} "antibiotic era". Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and lipo-peptides such as daptomycin offer themselves as a new potential class of antibiotics; however, further optimization is needed if AMPs are to find broad use as antibiotics. In the present work, eight analogues of mastoparan-X (MPX) were investigated, having side chain modifications in position 1, 8 and 14 to modulate peptide hydrophobicity. The self-association properties of the peptides were characterized, and the peptide-membrane interactions in model membranes were compared with the bactericidal and <b>haemolytic</b> <b>properties.</b> Alanine substitution at position 1 and 14 resulted in higher target selectivity (red blood cells versus bacteria), but also decreased bactericidal potency. For these analogues, the gain in target selectivity correlated to biophysical parameters showing an increased effective charge and reduction in the partitioning coefficient for membrane insertion. Introduction of an unnatural amino acid, with an octyl side chain by amino acid substitution, at positions 1, 8 and 14 resulted in increased bactericidal potency {{at the expense of}} radically reduced membrane target selectivity.

More recently, molecular methods were developed that target RNA rather than DNA, such as RT-PCR, real time PCR or nucleic acid based sequence amplification (NASBA). These tests not only provide a measure of cell viability but they can also be used for quantitative analysis. In addition, a variety of tests are available for sub-species characterization, which are particularly useful in epidemiological investigations. Early typing methods differentiated isolates based on phenotypic markers, such as multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, phage typing and serotyping.

40|$|The buccal glands {{of adults}} of the Southern Hemisphere lamprey Geotria australis {{consist of a}} pair of small, bean-shaped, hollow sacs, {{embedded}} within the basilaris muscle in the region below the eyes and to either side of the piston cartilage. Each gland, which is lined by a simple columnar epithelium and surrounded by an incomplete layer of skeletal muscle, discharges its contents into the oral cavity via a long, narrow duct. In downstream migrating young adults, the epithelial cells are low columnar, intermediate in electron density, and contain dark-staining inclusions and numerous lipid-like droplets. After saltwater acclimation, the epithelial cells become taller and the numbers of dark-staining inclusions increase whereas those of lipid-like droplets decline. By the end of the marine phase, the epithelium is more folded and now also contains dark and light cells. The ultrastructure of the epithelium shows the characteristics of both apocrine and merocrine secretion. Although intra-epithelial nerve endings were not observed, axons and occasional neurons are present in the lamina propria. Since the skeletal muscle capsule is also well innervated and contains neurons, a local feed-back mechanism may regulate the release of buccal gland fluid by monitoring the luminal pressure. Contractions of the skeletal muscle capsule and movements of the basilaris muscle during feeding would presumably assist the movement of secretion along the duct.

Repeated intravenous administration of platinum salts may induce haemolytic anaemia by interfering with iron metabolism, decreasing {{the level of}} red blood cell precursors and creating an immune-complex between red blood cells (RBC) and cisplatin [4, 5]. Moreover, side effects, including <b>haemolytic</b> <b>properties,</b> and resistance of cancer cells to cisplatin are major drawbacks to its application in cancer therapy, and recently, the possibility of replacing platinum salts with nanocompounds has been considered [6 – 8]. Due to their size (< 25  nm), large surface to mass ratio, quantum properties, catalytic activity and high reactivity, platinum nanoparticles (NP-Pt) have unique physicochemical properties and can exert specific effects on a living organism. The bioavailability of NP-Pt colloids depends on particle size, and small NP-Pt (< 4  nm) were more barcterio-toxic [9], induced the human cell genotoxic stress (5 to 8  nm) [10] and activated the cell death by apoptosis [11] compared to the bigger nanoparticles (> 100  nm) [12, 13]. NP-Pt can cause cell cycle arrest and activate apoptosis through the release of Pt 2 + ions during H 2 O 2 generation due to the low pH in endosomes [14], and DNA double-strand breaks are caused by Pt 2 + ions when NP-Pt are incubated with human colon carcinoma cells (HT 29) [15].

A less toxic liposomal formulation is expensive limiting its use in the UK NHS and, even with a large WHO subsidy, restricting application to treating leishmaniasis. Semisynthetic modification has led to improved analogues, but at prohibitive cost.

40|$|A {{number of}} skin and conjunctival {{reactions}} - such as Arthus' phenomenon and the tuberculin test -are based on this condition of hypersensibility and prove valuable tests for the antigenic properties of substances. These results are specific. The injection of streptococci does not give rise to sera agglutinating staphylococci; here however there is an obvious morphological difference. But the injection of, or infection with, B. Faratyphosus B. does not give rise to sera agglutinating B. Paratyphosus A.; but the two bacilli are morphologically indistinguishable and biologically very similar. Passive or active immunity for the one does not, however, confer any immunity for the other. The symptoms of infection are different, the toxins are therefore different. Immune sera {{were found to be}} capable of distinguishing further than this. The clinical pictures of epidemic cerebro-spinal fever due to any of the causative cocci are identical but four strains can be distinguished by agglutinating sera (Gordon 1907). These questions then arise. Are the toxins producing the symptoms of the disease or anaphylaxis identical with the "antigen"? Is it possible to remove the antigenic principal from, the body a bacterium, or other antigenic material? Finally, to what class of substances do antigens belong? The distinction between the antigenic products isolated from bacteria and from other parasites, from blood and other tissues, has been almost entirely based on relative solubility in different solvents. It has become customary to regard the fractions extracted by physiological saline and similar solvents as 'protein"; and those isolated by organic solvents, principally ether and alcohol, 'as "lipoids and fats". This - 3 - division, though questionable from the chemical standpoint, gives an initial grouping of antigens. It is so far unquestioned that the proteins are antigenic. Crystallised egg albumen will give rise to antibodies, Dakin and Dale (1919) have shown that whilst by chemical and physical means it is not yet possible to distinguish between the crystallised egg albumen of the hen and the duck; antigenically they are specific in action. Further, that on racemization of these compounds different pro-portions were obtained of the laevao- and dextro- forms of certain of the constituent amino-acids. In this case then, protein specificity is associated with differences of stereo-chemical configuration. Bierry, Henri and Pettit Auguste (1904) stated that the "Nucleo-proteins" - that portion of different organs of a dog which was soluble in 0. 2 % sodium carbonate and precipitated by acetic acid - when injected intraperitoneally into rabbits gave rise, in the serum of these rabbits, to products which were toxic for the organ from which they were prepared. Hence the serum of a rabbit inoculated with the nucleo-protein from dog's kidney when injected into a dog caused albuminuria. (1916) stated that the extracts of tissues with boiling water, yielding solutions of (2 -nucleo-proteins gave rise to anaphylactic reactions but that the extracts from the pancreas of the pig and the ox and the spleen of the latter showed no specificity. Gideon Wells (1913) considered that the nucleic acids showed little evidence of antigenic properties; and that the so-called nucleo-proteins were mixtures of all kinds, both from the cytologist's nucleus and from the cytoplasm, probably in part denaturised and capable of giving rise to non-specific precipitins and complement fixation, even when they have lost the power of inducing anaphylactic reactions. Apart from tissue extracts and such special antigens as Cobra venom and ricin, antigens may be placed in three classes. First, the haemolytic antigens, those which confer <b>haemolytic</b> <b>properties</b> on the serum. Secondly, bacterial antigens, those which are intimately connected with the problems of disease. Thirdly, other parasitic antigens which may be closely parallel with the processes of infection, as is hydatid fluid in tests for hydatid disease; or purely empirical, as is the extract of ox heart in the Wassermann reaction. The chemical nature of the antigenic substances in all three classes may ultimately prove the same; nevertheless it is convenient to consider them separately although the second and third classes at least are comparable in many respects.
