40|$|Aluminum-copper-magnesium-silver (Al-Cu-Mg-Ag) alloys {{that were}} {{developed}} for thermal stability also offer attractive ambient temperature strength-toughness combinations, and therefore, {{can be considered}} for a broad range of airframe structural applications. The current study evaluated Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy RX 226 -T 8 in plate gages and compared performance with sheet gage alloys of similar composition. Uniaxial tensile properties, plane strain initiation fracture toughness, and plane stress tearing resistance of RX 226 -T 8 were examined at ambient temperature as a function of orientation and thickness location in the plate. Properties were measured near the surface and at the mid-plane of the plate. Tensile strengths were essentially isotropic, with variations in yield and ultimate tensile strengths of less than 2 % as a function of orientation and through-thickness location. However, ductility varied by more than 15 % with orientation. Fracture toughness was generally higher at the mid-plane and greater for the L-T orientation, although the differences were small near the surface of the plate. Metallurgical analysis indicated that the microstructure was primarily recrystallized with weak texture and was uniform through the plate {{with the exception of a}} fine-grained layer near the surface of the plate. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed Al-Cu-Mg second phase particles which varied in composition and were primarily located on grain boundaries parallel to the rolling direction. Fractography of toughness specimens for both plate locations and orientations revealed that fracture occurred predominantly by transgranular microvoid coalescence. Introduction High-strength, low-density Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys were initially developed to replace conventional 2000 (Al-Cu-Mg) and 7000 (Al-Zn-Cu-Mg) series aluminum alloys for aircraft structural applications [1]. During the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) program, improvements in thermal stability were demonstrated for candidate aircraft wing and fuselage skin materials through the addition of silver to Al-Cu-Mg alloys based on Al 2519 chemistry [2]. Thermal stability of the resulting Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys, C 415 -T 8 and C 416 -T 8, was due to co-precipitation of the thermally stable. (AlCu) and ' (Al 2 Cu) strengthening phases [1 - 4]. The strength and toughness behavior was investigated for these alloys produced as 0. 090 -inch thick rolled sheet in the T 8 condition and after various thermal exposures. The mechanical properties were shown to be competitive with conventional aircraft alloys, 2519 -T 8 and 2618 -T 8 [2]. During the Integral Airframe Structure (IAS) program, advanced aluminum alloys were examined for use in an integrally stiffened airframe structure where the skin and stiffeners would be machined from plate and extruded frames would be mechanically attached (see Figure 1) [5]. Advantages of <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> <b>structure</b> include reduced part count, and reduced assembly times compared to conventional built-up airframe structure. The near-surface properties of a thick plate are of significance for a machined integrally stiffened airframe structure since this represents the skin location. Properties measured at the mid-plane of the plate are more representative of the stiffener web. RX 226 was developed to exploit strength-toughness improvements and thermal stability benefits of Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys in plate gages. This study evaluated the microstructure and properties of three gages of plate produced in the T 8 condition...|$|E

40|$|In {{launch vehicle}} {{structures}} design, importance {{is given to}} lightweight with high load bearing capacity design, so the factor of safety is kept low compared with ground-based structures {{and at the same}} time maintaining high reliability. This demands very accurate analysis of structural elements for launch vehicle. The main criteria are lightweight, ease of fabrication, lower cost {{and at the same time}} meeting the strength and stiffness requirements. The commonly used launch vehicle structure is the closely <b>stiffened</b> <b>structure</b> in which the structure consists of 90 or 120 no’s of stringers riveted onto a 1. 2 mm thick skin and a few number of bulkheads. In this type of structures, thin shell can buckle or cripple at a load much lower than the buckling strength of stringers. In order to overcome this, <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> <b>structures</b> such as isogrid structures is chosen. Isogrid is the name given to <b>integrally,</b> grid <b>stiffened</b> shell and <b>structures</b> in which the grids form an equilateral triangle pattern. The isogrid structure can withstand both compressive and bending loads and also offers lower weight and higher structural efficiency. A typical inter tank structure that was preliminary designed using closely <b>stiffened</b> shell <b>structure</b> has been identified for study. This is a cylindrical structure having a diameter of 4. 0 m and a height of 2. 75 m which should safely withstand the loads expected on it during different phases of flight.

40|$|State-of-the-art <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> {{composite}} materials, manufactured {{for use in}} {{the next}} generation of commercial and military aircraft, are being increasingly used for structural components such as wings and fuselages. However, due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, small variations in the shape of <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> composite <b>structures</b> often occur. Thus, a prioriknowledge of the part shape often does not provide sufficient tolerance to allow an automated conventional ultrasonic inspection. Many of the advantages of laser-based ultrasonics, including its noncontacting nature and applicability to rapid scanning of contoured and <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> <b>structures,</b> have been described previously [1 – 5]. To further extend the utility of laser-based ultrasonics, enable limited access inspections and also provide an upgrade/retrofit path for existing ultrasonic scanning systems, it is desirable {{to reduce the size of}} current laser-based ultrasound (LBU) system scan heads and provide both generation and detection laser beam delivery via optical fibers. A promising approach is the use of a scanning head based on a Cassegrain optical collection system. This approach minimizes the load carrying requirements of the scanning assembly and is also well-suited for integration with fiber optics to allow the delivery and reception of the ultrasonic generation and detection laser beams via long lengths of optical fiber. This provides increased mobility of the LBU scan head and allows the ultrasonic generation and detection lasers and other sensitive equipment to be housed in a clean environment which potentially can be located hundreds of meters from the inspection area. The use of a pulsed CO 2 laser has been reported previously for generation of ultrasonic waves in composite materials [4]. However, the CO 2 laser wavelength (λ = 10. 6 μm) and the high peak power laser pulses precludes the use of fiber-optic beam delivery over all but very short lengths (3 ̆c 1. 5 m) of specialized optical fiber. Consequently an alternative generating laser has been sought that can be transmitted efficiently over standard quartz optical fiber. An alexandrite laser, which is tunable over the 720 – 800 nm wavelength range, is being investigated for this application. Progress towards the implementation of a fiber-based LBU system for rapid NDE of large-area composites, and the use of an alexandrite laser for ultrasonic generation in composite materials are described below...|$|R
40|$|Current {{emphasis}} in the aircraft industry toward reducing manufacturing cost has created {{a renewed interest in}} <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> <b>structures.</b> Crack turning has been identified as an approach to improve the damage tolerance and fail-safety of this class of structures. A desired behavior is for skin cracks to turn before reaching a stiffener, instead of growing straight through. A crack in a pressurized fuselage encounters high T-stress as it nears the stiffener [...] a condition favorable to crack turning. Also, the tear resistance of aluminum alloys typically varies with crack orientation, a form of anisotropy that can influence the crack path. The present work addresses these issues with a study of crack turning in two-dimensions, including the effects of both T-stress and fracture anisotropy. Both effects are shown to have relation to the process zone size, an interaction that is central to this study. Following an introduction to the problem, the T-stress effect is studied for a slightly curved semi-infinite crack with a cohesive process zone, yielding a closed form expression for the future crack path in an infinite medium. For a given initial crack tip curvature and tensile T-stress, the crack path instability is found to increase with process zone size. Fracture orthotropy is treated using a simple function to interpolate between the two principal fracture resistance values in two-dimensions. An extension to three-dimensions interpolates between the six principal values of fracture resistance. Also discussed is the transition between mode I and mode II fracture in metals. For isotropic materials, there is evidence that the crack seeks out a direction of either local symmetry (pure mode I) or local asymmetry (pure mode II) growth. For orthotropic materials the favored states are not pure modal, and have mode mixity that is a function of crack orientation...|$|R

When compared to conventional reinforced structures, they present an integral profile, as the stiffened panel is obtained as a whole {{by means of an}} extrusion process. The choice of a ISP profile can lead to a more robust and defects-free solution, simultaneously maintaining the possibility to adopt complex reinforcement shapes. In the present work, three algorithms are studied and compared in the cross-section optimization of <b>Integrally</b> <b>Stiffened</b> Panels for aeronautical applications: (i) the classical Levenberg-Marquardt, (ii) the Simulated Annealing methodology, and a recently proposed approach involving (iii) a differential/nature-based algorithm called Hybrid Differential Evolution Particle Swarm Optimization (HDEPSO). Numerical simulation models are introduced for several shapes of ISP. Additionally, the presence of a Friction Stir Weld (FSW) zone is also taken into account, from the joining between distinct ISP's. This can allow us to infer about the influence of the heat affected zoned (HAZ) in the overall stability of the structure, under compressive buckling loads within the elasto-plastic regimen. Results show that the use of the proposed optimization algorithm represents a viable option, giving an added insight in terms of the buckling resistance and mechanical design in nonlinear material and geometric scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{friction}} stir weld (FSW) on the buckling behavior of an <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> panel (ISP) <b>structure</b> was investigated. For proper {{consideration of the}} buckling modes, the Riks method based on geometric imperfection was introduced.

A basic buckling benchmark test with a simple square plate was performed to verify the effect of the element type, Ramberg-Osgood model and the Riks method on the critical buckling load.

After confirming that the predicted results without FSW were in excellent agreement with known analytical solutions, finite element (FE) analyses for 2 - and 3 -stiffener ISP sections joined by FSW were performed. The simulated results with and without FSW were compared to each other. The presence of the weld reduced the maximum buckling load from 3 % to 10 % depending on the sectional shape {{as a result of the}} reduction in material strength in the weld zone. The reduction in buckling load was greater for the 2 -stiffener ISP section than for the 3 -stiffener ISP configuration, due to the closer spacing of the welds.

Advantages of textile composites include high area output, ease of handling during the manufacturing process, lower production costs per material used resulting from automation, and provide post-manufacturing assembly mainstreaming because significantly more complex geometries such as <b>stiffened</b> shell <b>structures</b> can be manufactured with fewer pieces. One significant challenge with using <b>stiffened</b> composite <b>structures</b> is stiffener separation under compression. Axial compression loading conditions have frequently observed catastrophic structural failure due to stiffeners separating {{from the shell}} skin. Characterizing stiffener separation behavior is often costly computationally and experimentally. The objectives of this research are to demonstrate unitized stiffened textile composite panels can be manufactured to produce quality test specimens, that existing characterization techniques applied to state-of-the-art high-performance composites provide valuable information in modeling such structures, that the unitized structure concept successfully removes stiffener separation as a primary structural failure mode, and that modeling textile material failure modes are sufficient to accurately capture postbuckling and final failure responses of the <b>stiffened</b> <b>structures.</b> The <b>stiffened</b> panels in this study have taken the <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> concept to an extent such that the stiffeners and skin are manufactured at the same time, as one single piece, and from the same composite textile layers. Stiffener separation is shown to be removed as a primary structural failure mode for unitized stiffened composite textile panels loaded under axial compression well into the postbuckling regime. Instead of stiffener separation, a material damaging and failure model effectively captures local post-peak material response via incorporating a mesoscale model using a multiscaling framework with a smeared crack element-based failure model in the macroscale stiffened panel. Material damage behavior is characterized by simple experimental tests and incorporated into the post-peak stiffness degradation law in the smeared crack implementation. Computational modeling results are in overall excellent agreement compared to the experimental responses...|$|R

The data were compiled as a function of location in the extruded cross-sections and the variation in the major deformation- and recrystallization-related texture components was identified...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-lightweight {{thermoformed}} <b>stiffened</b> <b>structures</b> {{are emerging}} as a viable option for spacecraft applications due to their advantage over inflatable structures. Although pressurization {{may be used for}} deployment, constant pressure is not required to maintain stiffness. However, thermoformed stiffening features are often locally nonlinear in their behavior under loading. This thesis has three aspects: 1) to understand stiffness properties of a thermoformed stiffened ultra-lightweight panel, 2) to develop finite element models using a phasedverification approach and 3) to verify panel response to dynamic loading. This thesis demonstrates that conventional static and dynamic testing principles can be applied to test ultra-lightweight thermoformed <b>stiffened</b> <b>structures.</b> Another contribution of this thesis is by evaluating the stiffness properties of different stiffener configurations. Finally, the procedure used in this thesis could be adapted in the study of similar ultra-lightweight thermoformed <b>stiffened</b> spacecraft <b>structures...</b>|$|R
