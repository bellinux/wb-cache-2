5|$|Type II (<b>excision)</b> is the {{complete}} or partial {{removal of the}} inner labia, with or without removal of the clitoral glans and outer labia. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, inner and outer labia. <b>Excision</b> in French can refer to any form of FGM.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar <b>excision</b> (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge <b>excision</b> may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Only around 60 % of skin lesions excised by GPs are {{referred}} to a pathologist. Clinical diagnoses of skin <b>excisions</b> by GPs may not be very accurate. Subcutis <b>excisions</b> are rarely done by GPs, and there is hence little information {{in the literature on}} the histopathological yield of subcutis <b>excisions</b> by GPs with regard to malignancies. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the yield of histopathological investigation of a relatively large group of subcutis <b>excisions</b> by GPs, with special emphasis on discrepancies between clinical and histopathological diagnoses of malignancy. Methods We investigated a series of 90 subcutis <b>excisions,</b> which was derived from a database of consecutive GP submissions from the years 1999 – 2000 where in the same time period 4595 skin <b>excisions</b> were performed by the same group of GPs. This underlines the apparent reluctance of GPs to perform subcutis <b>excisions.</b> Results The final diagnosis was benign in 88 cases (97. 8 %) and malignant in 2 cases (2. 2 %). Seven cases had no clinical diagnosis, all of which were benign. Of the 83 clinically benign cases, 81 (97. 6 %) were indeed benign and 2 (2. 4 %) were malignant: one Merkel cell carcinoma and one dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. The former was clinically thought to be a lipoma, and the latter a trichilemmal cyst. The dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans presented at the age of 27, and the Merkel cell carcinoma at the age of 60. Both were incompletely removed and required re-excision by a surgical oncologist. Conclusion Histopathological investigation of subcutis <b>excisions</b> by GPs yields unexpected and rare malignancies in about 2 % of cases that may initially be excised inadequately. Based on these data, and because of the relatively rareness of these type of <b>excisions,</b> it could be argued that it may be worthwhile to have all subcutis <b>excisions</b> by GPs routinely investigated by histopathology. </p...|$|R
40|$|In general {{practice}} 15 - 18 per 1000 patients per year present themselves {{with questions about}} a skin lesion or a pigmented spot on the skin. The general practitioner can choose to remove the lesion himself or send the patient to the hospital. Over {{the past few years}} the interest in skin lesions has risen. In January 2006 a new contract called the Vogelaarakkoord was introduced in the Netherlands. It planned {{to increase the amount of}} small surgical procedures in {{general practice}} by increasing the financial reward received for a small surgical procedure. This study looked at the changes in the number of <b>excisions</b> of skin lesions send by GP’s to a large pathological laboratory in the north of the Netherlands during 2004 - 2009. The possible influence of the Vogelaarakkoord on the number of <b>excisions</b> was judged. Also calculated was the diagnostic accuracy of a GP and the percentage of unexpected (pre-) malignancies. And whether GP’s who performed a lot of skin <b>excisions</b> had a significant better diagnostic accuracy than the GP’s who didn’t. The data was gathered from PALGA, which registers all <b>excisions</b> of skin lesions send in to the Martini Ziekenhuis by GP’s in the north of the Netherlands. The number of <b>excisions</b> sent in rose from 3568 in 2004 to 6341 in 2009. In 2007 the number of <b>excisions</b> increased with 24. 5 %, this is believed to be a late effect of the Vogelaarakkoord. The number of <b>excisions</b> each GP performed per year rose significantly in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Diagnostic accuracy varied between 38. 8 % and 44. 4 %. None of the changes seen here were significant. The diagnostic accuracy of much excising GP’s was comparable to their colleagues. 3. 2 % to 5. 4 % of the excised skin lesions which were clinically diagnosed as benign were in fact pathologically (pre-) malignant. So the number of <b>excisions</b> has risen steadily since 2004, just as the number of <b>excisions</b> performed by each GP alone. The Vogelaarakkoord caused a rise in the number of sent in <b>excisions</b> in 2007. Diagnostic accuracy didn’t change significantly during the study period...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{frequency}} of <b>excisions</b> and yields of histopathologically confirmed skin cancer. Design A population-based skin cancer screening intervention (the SCREEN project) in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein (July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2004). Setting Physician offices. Participants could choose between nondermatologist physicians and dermatologists for their initial whole-body skin examination. All screening physicians received a mandatory 8 -hour training course. Participants Inhabitants of Schleswig-Holstein 20 years or older with statutory health insurance (N = 360 288). Main Outcome Measures Frequency of <b>excisions</b> and yields of malignant skin tumors (malignant melanomas [MMs], basal cell carcinomas [BCCs], and squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs]), stratified by sex and age. Results Overall, 15 983 <b>excisions</b> were performed (1 of 23 screenees). A total of 3103 malignant skin tumors were diagnosed in 2911 persons: 585 MMs, 1961 BCCs, 392 SCCs, and 165 other malignant skin tumors. Overall, 116 persons (3103 of 360 288) had to be screened to find 1 malignant tumor, with 1 of 620 for MM, 1 of 184 for BCC, and 1 of 920 for SCC. Twenty <b>excisions</b> were performed to find 1 melanoma in men 65 years and older, but more than 50 <b>excisions</b> were required to find 1 melanoma in men aged between 20 and 49 years. Conclusions The results of SCREEN suggest a high yield of malignant skin tumors in a large-scale population-based screening project.

25|$|Nucleotide <b>excision</b> repair is a DNA repair mechanism. There {{are three}} <b>excision</b> repair pathways: {{nucleotide}} <b>excision</b> repair (NER), base <b>excision</b> repair (BER), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In NER, the damaged DNA strand is removed and the undamaged strand is kept as {{a template for}} the formation of a complementary sequence with DNA polymerase. DNA ligase joins the strands together to form dsDNA. There are two subpathways for NER, which differ only in their mechanism for recognition: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER).|$|E

25|$|Excisional biopsies may {{remove the}} tumor, but further surgery is often {{necessary}} {{to reduce the}} risk of recurrence. Complete surgical <b>excision</b> with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local <b>excision</b> (WLE) with 1 to 2cm margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 0.5cm. Many surgeons consider 0.5cm the standard of care for standard <b>excision</b> of melanoma-in-situ, but 0.2cm margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide <b>excision</b> aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for <b>excision</b> with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.|$|E

40|$|The {{defective}} specialized {{transducing phage}} SPβc 2 dcitK 1 carries two known bacterial genes, kauA and citK, {{as well as}} SPβ phage markers including the heat-sensitive repressor allele, c 2. Some phage genes (including essential ones) are missing. When SPβc 2 dcitK 1 transduces SPβ-sensitive cells of Bacillus subtilis, the defective prophage is inserted into sites in the homologous bacterial DNA of the attSPβ-kauA-citK region of the recipient chromosome. During the growth of these transductants, occasional <b>excisions</b> occur that result {{in the loss of}} the phage genes and of the heterogenotic state.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Due to a rapid {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} skin cancer, it seems inevitable that general practitioners (GPs) will play a larger role in skin cancer care. OBJECTIVES: To assess surgical procedures used by GPs in skin tumour management. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 1, 898 pathology reports of skin tumours excised by GPs in 2009. RESULTS: In 22. 9 % no diagnosis was provided on the application form. Mostly, once-off <b>excisions</b> (no preceding biopsy) were performed, 7 % of the excised lesions were malignant, and 35 % of incisions were incomplete. <b>Excisions</b> in the face and neck region were incomplete in 65. 4 %; 22 % of melanomas were biopsied or shaved. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the difficulties in skin tumour management in primary care. To stimulate adequate resource use, the number of <b>excisions</b> of benign lesions could be lowered, and pretreatment biopsy in non-melanoma skin cancer management should be encouraged. GPs should be aware of their limitations and consider referral of high-risk malignancies. (c) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
