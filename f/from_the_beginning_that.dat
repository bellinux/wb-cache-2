In April 1926, {{shortly after}} his arrival, he {{recorded}} nine strikeouts over six innings against the Atlanta Black Crackers. Part way through the 1927 season, Paige's contract was sold to the Birmingham Black Barons of the major Negro National League (NNL). According to Paige's first memoir, his contract was for $450 per month, but in his second {{he said it was}} for $275.|$|E

Very soon, they decided to call themselves the Middlesex county team and so we have here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Keefe {{retired as}} President of the ILA in 1908, succeeded by another Great Lakes tugboat man, T.V. O'Connor. O'Connor's {{presidency}} spanned {{twelve of the}} ILA's most intriguing and influential years. In 1909, a bitter three-year strike on the Great Lakes pitted the employers' Lake Carriers' Association against every maritime union except the ILA, whose locals wisely voted against participation because {{it was clear to}} them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the strike was a losing battle. So powerful and well equipped was the Lake Carriers' Association that Lakes shipping ran almost regularly despite the union walk out. In the end, the ILA was almost alone on the Lakes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} book, Dumbledore fetches Harry from Privet Drive and takes him to persuade Horace Slughorn {{to rejoin the}} Hogwarts staff. Harry notices that Dumbledore's right hand is shrivelled and black. During the school year, Dumbledore teaches Harry of events in Voldemort's past that he feels are of immense importance. Using the Pensieve, they visit the {{memories}} of others, which contain important information about Voldemort's life and his genocidal rise to power. While using the pensieve, Harry sees a vision of Dumbledore's first encounter with Voldemort, then a disturbed young orphan named Tom Riddle; Dumbledore had known <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the boy was dangerous, but believed that Hogwarts would change him.|$|E

25|$|Egypt {{went to war}} for a {{different}} reason than Syria did. While Assad wanted to regain lost Arab territory, Sadat wished to strengthen Egypt's position in its peace policy toward Israel. The Syrians were deceived by Sadat and the Egyptians, which would {{play a major role in}} the Arab defeat. Egyptian Chief of Staff Shazly was convinced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> Egypt could not mount a successful full-scale offensive against Israel; therefore, he campaigned for a limited war. Sadat knew that Assad would not participate in the war if he knew his real intentions. Since the collapse of the UAR, the Egyptians were critical of the Ba'athist government; they saw it as an untrustworthy ally.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset {{that it would be}} clear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
500|$|Yomiuri Giants club {{representative}} Hidetoshi Kiyotake {{has expressed}} dislike of the system, because it enables Major League Baseball to poach players from Japan. By using the posting system, he says, Japanese teams {{make a profit}} in the short term, but by allowing Japan's best players {{to be sold to}} MLB, NPB teams and Japanese baseball suffer in the longer term. When Giants pitcher Koji Uehara asked to be posted in 2005, Kiyotake denied his request, saying: [...] "We don't recognize the posting system.

While the National Command invoked party rules and regulations against the Military Committee, it was clear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the initiative lay with the Military Committee. The reason for the Military Committee's success was its alliance with the Regionalists, a group of branches which had not adhered to Aflaq's 1958 orders to dissolve the Syrian Regional Branch. The Regionalists disliked Aflaq and opposed his leadership. Assad called the Regionalists the [...] "true cells of the party".|$|E
500|$|The FBI speculated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> Cooper did {{not survive}} his jump. [...] "Diving into the {{wilderness}} without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his 'chute open," [...] said Carr. Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain would have been all but impossible without an accomplice at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There {{is no evidence that}} Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.|$|E

Itchy, Scratchy and Poochie play roles in the [...] "Grand Theft Scratchy" [...] section in The Simpsons Game. Itchy & Scratchy have also appeared in commercials for various products, including a 1999 Butterfinger advert where Bart watches a short called [...] "500 Easy Pieces".

500|$|Karan Johar {{was certain}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> {{he wanted to}} cast Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, having {{observed}} him during the making of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It took longer to fill the role of Tina. The role was written with Twinkle Khanna in mind, but she turned it down. Other actresses such as Tabu, Shilpa Shetty, Urmila Matondkar, Aishwarya Rai, Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor were offered the role but also turned it down. Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan noticed Rani Mukerji's beauty and acting talent in Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, and suggested her to Karan Johar. He thus signed her, giving a boost to her career. [...] Saif Ali Khan, Ajay Devgan and Chandrachur Singh were initially offered the role of Aman, but they all turned it down, thus prompting Johar to rope in Salman Khan.|$|E

Another reason that Duff wished to work with her was that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies.

White House counterterrorism advisor John O. Brennan said after the raid: [...] "If we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive, if he didn't present any threat, the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that." [...] CIA Director Leon Panetta said on PBS NewsHour: [...] "The authority here was to kill bin Laden.... Obviously under the rules of engagement, if he in fact had thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him. But, they had full authority to kill him." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Black, Vala's {{motivation}} {{to hide her}} miraculous pregnancy by marrying the local villager Tomin (played by Tim Guinee) in late season 9 stems from [...] "genuinely car for the man. She does something wrong, but she must in order to survive." [...] Against the audience's expectation, Vala and Tomin are shown as a seemingly functioning normal couple, and Vala makes several efforts to save him despite his deep indoctrination. Throughout season 10, Vala has {{to come to terms}} with her maternal feelings for Adria (as adult played by Morena Baccarin), well knowing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> Adria embodies a destructive entity that must be fought. Black believed Vala had to [...] "try her best to connect with her daughter in the hope of finding ways to humanize her", despite her own lack of maturity.

500|$|The most {{recognisable}} item of the herald's wardrobe {{has always}} been their tabards. Since the 13th century, records of this distinctive garment were apparent. At first {{it is likely that}} the herald wore his master's cast-off coat, but even <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> would have had special significance, signifying that he was in effect his master's representative. Especially when his master was a sovereign prince, the wearing of his coat would haven given the herald a natural diplomatic status. John Anstis wrote that: [...] "The Wearing the outward Robes of the Prince, hath been esteemed by the Consent of Nations, to be an extraordinary Instance of Favour and Honour, as in the Precedent of Mordecai, under a king of Persia." [...] The last King of England to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably King Henry VII. Today the herald's tabard is a survivor of history, much like the judges' wigs and (until the last century) the bishop's gaiters.|$|E
500|$|The command {{structure}} of the expedition had still to be settled. Markham had been determined <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> its overall leader should be a naval officer, not a scientist. Scott, writing to Markham after his appointment, reiterated that he [...] "must have complete command {{of the ship and}} landing parties", and insisted on being consulted over all future appointments. However, the Joint Committee had, with Markham's acquiescence, secured the appointment of John Walter Gregory, Professor of Geology at the University of Melbourne and former assistant geologist at the British Museum, as the expedition's scientific director. Gregory's view, endorsed by the Royal Society faction of the Joint Committee, was that the organisation and command of the land party should be in his hands: [...] "...The Captain would be instructed to give such assistance as required in dredging, tow-netting etc., to place boats where required at the disposal of the scientific staff." [...] In the dispute that followed, Markham argued that Scott's command of the whole expedition must be total and unambiguous, and Scott himself was insistent on this to the point of resignation. Markham's and Scott's view prevailed, and Gregory resigned, saying that the scientific work should not be [...] "subordinated to naval adventure".|$|E
