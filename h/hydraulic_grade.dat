Middle Paleozoic diamond-bearing kimberlite bodies are shown to be the source of these aureoles. The aureoles represent redeposited units. At the initial stage of their development in the Middle Proterozoic, they formed under near-shore conditions, which defined the monomineral pyrope composition of the assemblage of kimberlite minerals, the limiting degree of grain rounding, and the profound <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grading.</b> At least two kimberlite fields are predicted based on morphotypes of pyropes (including their geochemical features) —the Tychany aureole in the north of the studied area and the Tarydak aureole in the south of it. The northern aureole is similar in pyrope geochemistry to the Daldyn aureole of the Yakutian diamond-bearing province; the southern, to the Malo-Botuobin region. Diamonds form a polychro- nous mixture: one part of them are background diamonds for the Siberian platform and are derived from Pre-cambrian sources, whereas the other part is associated with the predicted Middle Paleozoic kimberlites. Reconnaissance and prospecting works are recommended west of the studied territory in the exposed areas. Methods of work are suggested that are based on the mineralogical control of aeromagnetic anomalies potentially related to karst.

HGL is used, instead of elevation, data because it is significantly more precise than elevation data. Because 2.31 ft of elevation translates into 1 psi of pressure (for water), calculating pressure to 1 psi precision requires elevation data that's accurate to roughly 2 ft. Normal elevation data that is accurate to the nearest 10 ft will result in pressure that is accurate to roughly 4 psi.|$|E

An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the Battersea and Park Lane pump-out shafts.

Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|R

40|$|In {{rail track}} environments, the loading system is cyclic unlike the steady seepage force that usually occurs in {{embankment}} dams. The mechanisms of filtration, interface behaviour, and time dependent {{changes of the}} drainage and filtration properties occurring within the filter medium require further research to improve the design guidelines. A novel cyclic process simulation filtration apparatus was designed and commissioned at the University of Wollongong, and a standard test procedure was established. The test apparatus was designed to simulate heavy haul train operations. The key parameters that influence the change in porosity and pore water pressure within the subballast layer under cyclic conditions in rail track environments were identified. Crushed basaltic road base {{was used as the}} filter subballast. The slurry form of the base soil, which is a low plasticity and highly erodible silty clay, was pumped {{from the bottom of the}} filter to simulate clay pumping and <b>hydraulic</b> erosion. <b>Grading</b> characteristics such as the uniformity coefficient and the mass of fines, and the external loading factors such as the maximum compressive load and slurry loading rate, were found to be the main factors that influence the mechanical characteristics and seepage hydraulics of subballasts under cyclic conditions. The evidence gathered from laboratory testing suggests that the subballast selection criteria adopted by the railway industry, which are based on mathematical and empirical models generated from static load conditions in embankment dams, does not address the filtration mechanism of subballasts under cyclic conditions. Apart from being a commonly used buffer for the ballast layer against subgrade attrition, subballast is primarily designed to act as a stress dissipation layer (capping layer) and its function as a filter is often regarded as a lesser priority. With more emphasis on the stress reduction function, well graded subballast containing larger particles provides a better skeletal resistance against applied stresses. However, well graded subballasts containing relatively coarse grains (20 % fine sand, 30 % fine gravel) are too porous to effectively Abstract vi capture the fines within its voids. Laboratory findings suggested that uniformly graded subballasts with not more than 30 % fine sands (particle range of 0. 15 to 0. 425 mm) had an enhanced filtering capacity. Due to the lack of mechanical resistance against axial deformation, the application of cyclic stress to uniformly graded subballasts reduces porosity and enables the filter to trap migrating fines more effectively. Moreover, this intrusion of fines changes the PSD of the subballast which reduces its porosity and further inhibits drainage. A multi-layer mathematical approach was used to predict the time dependent permeability of this filter, with (a) a reduction in porosity as a function of compression under cyclic loading, and (b) the amount of fines trapped within the filter voids, being the two main aspects of this proposed model. Laboratory test results conducted on a novel cyclic loading permeameter were used to validate the proposed model. The set of equations that forms an integral part of the proposed model is then presented as compact visual guidelines anticipated to provide a more practical tool for railway practitioners...|$|R

Production of a lime-pozzolan concrete with a 28 -day cube strength of approximately 50 MPa and an elastic modulus of 20 GPa has demonstrated the feasibility of producing modern, structural <b>grade</b> <b>hydraulic</b> lime-pozzolan concretes. Furthermore, construction and testing of two reinforced lime-pozzolan concrete beams has demonstrated the possibility of producing structural elements with a finished appearance and flexural behaviour similar to Portland cement concrete. This paper reflects {{on the value of}} this new material’s technological progress {{in the context of the}} industry wide search for low carbon cements. Results of the research reported in this paper demonstrate that the use of aluminosilicate byproducts, specifically ground granulated blastfurnace slag and silica fume, in combination with naturally hydraulic lime can realise savings in environmental impact; but that the savings are both future-orientated and highly dependent on the boundaries of the analysis. When considering only the secondary impacts of ground granulated blastfurnace slag and silica fume production, a ternary combination was observed to result in a lime-pozzolan concrete with a 28 -day cube strength of 33 MPa and an embodied-CO 2 of 95 kgCO 2 /m 3, 64 % lower than a CEMI, and 41 % lower than a CEMIII/A concrete of equivalent strength. Both mass and economic allocation procedures were, however, shown to have a very detrimental effect on the environmental credentials of silica fume and thus also on hydraulic lime-concretes containing this pozzolanic addition. It is recognised that technical performance alone cannot be used to assess or compare the merits of any new material.

40|$|A {{transient}} {{or water}} hammer event is initiated whenever a steady-state condition in a pipeline is disturbed either by a planned event or accidentally.

In a previous study, an analytical solution for the variation in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> line (HGL) {{expressed in terms of}} a Fourier series has been obtained based on a pipeline with known initial conditions and constant boundary conditions. Based on the analytical solution, a leak detection method was developed previously using leak-induced transient damping.

A Laplace transform solution approach overcomes this difficulty and is the focus of this paper. Normalized hyperbolic governing equations for a pressure transient in a pipeline with a leak are derived, where the discontinuity induced by a leak is considered by using a delta function. In addition the orifice-leak equation is linearized. The accuracy of the analytical solution has been verified by nonlinear numerical analyses using the method of characteristics.

Peak flow values for the historical events were derived by combining a survey of the water level marks with historical information on the cross-section geometry. The resulting data series contains 89 individual events covering the period 1725 – 2009.

It is essential that the hydraulic model be able to accurately simulate the real system conditions. Model calibration is the critical step to achieve this goal. To calibrate the model, Sidney’s Public Utility Department collected the pressure data at twenty locations, along with the boundary conditions of the observed tank levels and pump operating status. The calibration proceeds by applying a well-integrated hydraulic simulation and genetic algorithm optimization modeling platform in two phases including the systemic demand calibration to establish an extended period flow balance model and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> calibration under multiple loading conditions.

The free surface, bed pressure, sequent depth and velocity distribution are measured. The study {{also includes the}} role of the entrained air. Statistical analysis is used to analyze the experimental data and regenerate the necessary characteristic design charts for the free radial hydraulic jump. The macroscopic momentum balance is applied to the expanding section to drive the general equation for the free radial hydraulic jump. The energy equation is used to obtain the jump energy loss. The same experimental procedure and theory are applied to the submerged radial hydraulic jump to study its characteristics under different submergence and operating conditions. Since the macroscopic theory does not give the flow pattern within the jump, a mathematical model based on the strip integral method of solving the integral momentum and continuity equations is developed. The mathematical model is developed first for the free rectangular jump and it is extended to simulate the free radial hydraulic jump. The model predicts the water surface profile, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> profile, decay of the maximum velocity, variation of the surface velocity, variation of the energy coefficient (alpha), variation of the momentum coefficient (beta), sequent depth ratio, jump length and the energy loss.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction: In 2013, Madison Water Utility (MWU) {{consumed}} 19, 660, 250 kWh {{of energy}} to pump just over 10 {{million gallons of water}} (PSC 2013). Numerous benefits are observed by a utility when energy savings measures are implemented, with benefits being economic, environmental, operational, and customer relations in nature. Research performed for this project was aimed at identifying energy conserving practices, and applying them to Madison Water Utility?s system to observe the greatest energy savings. The objectives of the research are: 1. A system-wide variable frequency drive (VFD) study aimed at determining which wells in MWU?s system have characteristics that are ideal for future VFD installations 2. A system demand study in Pressure Zone 4, to characterize the impacts of peak demand periods on annual energy use 3. A hydraulic modeling study of Pressure Zone 4, aimed at estimating the energy savings produced by capital improvements and modifications to hydraulic operations within the zone. Background: On average, drinking water utilities are allocating 30 - 40 % of their total annual operating budget to energy use, of which 94 % or more can be attributed to pumping (Hamilton et al. 2009 and Elliot et al. 2003). Energy intensity can be defined as the amount of energy required to pump, treat, and deliver water to the customer?s tap. Energy intensity is a metric used to benchmark utilities on, and is reported as kilowatt-hours per thousand gallons pumped (kWh/kgal). In 2013, Madison Water Utility consumed 1. 95 kWh/kgal, close to the Wisconsin groundwater utility average of 1. 94 kWh/kgal (PSC 2013). However, energy savings are attainable, with estimates by the Water Research Foundation (WRF) predicting 10 - 30 % savings by all water utilities (WRF 2011). Energy consumption by pumping systems can be divided into two categories: energy consumed by components that are lifting water, and excess energy consumed due to inefficiencies. Deep well pumps and booster pumps lift water from the ground to the distribution system where it can flow into customer?s taps, consuming large amounts {{of energy to}} complete this process. Along the way, energy inefficiencies accumulate, requiring more energy to deliver water than would otherwise be needed. Inefficiencies may include friction, an improperly sized pump, elevated water pressure at a tap, or an aging motor that is no longer operating at its maximum efficiency. To combat high energy use, energy conservation practices including variable frequency drive (VFD) installation, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> line management, and flow distribution analyses were tested. Furthermore, pipe modification to reduce headloss, demand reductions to conserve water, and well refurbishment to improve efficiency were examined. Finally, off-peak pumping was tested to determine feasibility and potential energy savings of running pumps at night when energy rates are lowest. Methods: Three studies were performed with the goal of minimizing energy use in as many ways as possible. Much of the analysis revolved around Pressure Zone 4 (PZ 4), while the remaining analysis was performed on previously tested wells. The VFD study used previously collected data by Baniel (2013) to group wells according to specific capacity, a well property that defines the amount of drawdown for a given flow rate. Wells were grouped into low, medium, and high specific capacities, and a representative from each group was analyzed for energy savings and payback. This study allowed for the selection of a group of wells with which to implement VFDs in the future. The energy use characterization of various system demands study utilized MWU?s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and Madison Gas and Electric (MG&E) as data sources. Analysis of SCADA data was performed to identify flow ranges, or flow bins, where energy use was high. The hydraulic modeling software H 2 OMAP Water GIS was then used to test the energy use in each flow bin in Pressure Zone 4, attempting to identify flow bins which were consuming large quantities of energy. The study allowed for energy conservation measures to be specifically applied and optimized in flow bins of interest. The final study revolved around PZ 4, specifically Unit Wells 9 and 31. Again, the hydraulic modeling software H 2 OMAP Water GIS was used to test (1) the optimal VFD speed of the UW 31 deep well pump, (2) off-peak pumping feasibility, (3) optimal flow distribution between the two wells, and (4) optimal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> line. Significant input data was required to test the various scenarios including pump curves, MG&E rates, PZ 4 demands, and information about the proposed well (UW 31). Energy use and predicted savings were identified for each model variable, then payback of the option was determined to identify the economic feasibility. This study provided estimates of how to operate PZ 4 in the most energy efficient manner. Results: Results of the VFD study outlined the projected energy savings of high, medium, and low specific capacity site of Madison Water Utility. It was found that high specific capacity sites (> 21. 1 gpm/ft) generally had low energy use, low head savings, and low cost savings. Medium specific capacity sites (13. 8 ? 21. 1 gpm/ft) were found to have higher energy use than high specific capacity sites, on average, with greater potential for head savings. Large energy savings were found to be possible in some cases, with payback periods between 5 and 10 years being possible. Low specific capacity well sites ( 2. 1 MGD); Pressure Zones 7, 8, 9, and 10 all have similar characteristics and off-peak pumping should be tested in these zones. ? Operate UW 9 and UW 31 between a 60 / 40 operation and 75 / 25 operation to combat seasonal demand fluctuations, to maintain hydraulic residence time, and energy conservation guidelines by MWU. A 60 / 40 operation works during all seasons. ? Do not perform <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> line reductions in PZ 4 due to pressure concerns. ? Do not perform pipe modifications in PZ 4 to save energy, but only for operational reasons such as improved flow conditions. ? Continue flow reduction efforts as they have been found to conserve energy and water. ?

Despite the {{extensive}} research work {{carried out on}} flow through short square-edged orifice plates {{over the last century}} (e. g. Johansen, 1930; Benedict, 1977; Alvi et al., 1978; Swamee, 2005; ESDU, 2007), gaps in the engineering data still exist for certain ranges of flow conditions and geometries. The majority of data available in the literature are for Newtonian fluids in the turbulent flow regime (ESDU, 2007). Insufficient data have been observed for the orifice with pipe diameter ratio, β = 0. 2, in the laminar flow regime. There are no experimental data for β = 0. 3 and 0. 57. The objective of this thesis was to conduct wide-ranging experimental studies of the flow in orifice plates, which included those geometrical configurations, by measuring pressure loss coefficients and discharge coefficients across the orifice plates using both Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The test work was conducted on the valve test rig at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Four classical circular short square-edged orifice plates having, β = 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 57 and 0. 7, were tested. In addition, two generation 0 Von Koch orifice plates (Von Koch, 1904), with equivalent cross sectional area were also tested for β = 0. 57. Water was used as Newtonian fluid to obtain turbulent regime data and also for calibration purposes to ensure measurement accuracy and carboxymethyl cellulose, bentonite and kaolin slurries were used at different concentrations to obtain laminar and transitional loss coefficient data. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> line method was used to evaluate pressure loss coefficients (Edwards et al., 1985), while the flange tap arrangement method was used to determine the discharge coefficients (ESDU, 2007). A tube viscometer with three different pipe diameters was used to obtain the rheological properties of the fluids. The results for each test are presented in the form of pressure loss coefficient (kor) and discharge coefficient (Cd) against pipe Reynolds number (Re...|$|E
