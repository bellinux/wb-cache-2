5|$|The ant is notorious in Tasmania, {{where most}} {{fatalities}} have been recorded. In 2005, {{over a quarter}} of all jack <b>jumper</b> sting incidents were sustained in Tasmania; excessive in comparison to its 2006 population of only 476,000 people. Jack <b>jumper</b> stings are the single most common cause of anaphylaxis in patients at the Royal Hobart Hospital. The ant has also been a major cause of anaphylaxis outside Tasmania, notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne, while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed. One in 50 adults have been reported to suffer anaphylaxis due to the jack <b>jumper</b> or other Myrmecia ants.|$|E

5|$|Colonies {{are mainly}} {{polygynous}} with polyandrous queens, however, polyandry in jack <b>jumper</b> colonies {{is low in}} comparison to other Myrmecia ants, but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants. In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack <b>jumper</b> ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated {{to each other as}} mentioned previously, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation in jack <b>jumper</b> queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away.|$|E

The qualification round for men's long jump took place on August 16, where McGregor competed in the second heat. The long <b>jumper</b> was given three attempts. During the first, McGregor jumped 7.64meters, setting his highest time of the three attempts; he ranked fifteenth in his heat with that score. His second attempt (7.46meters) and his third attempt (7.36meters) were discounted in favor of his best mark. Overall, McGregor ranked 30 out of the 38 athletes who received a score, falling behind Morocco's Tarik Bouguetaib (7.69meters) and placing ahead of Denmark's Morten Jensen (7.63meters).

5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack <b>jumper</b> ant is {{successful}} in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals like bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and permethrin are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests {{if they are in}} a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack <b>jumper</b> nests.|$|E

5|$|The jack <b>jumper</b> ant genome is {{contained}} {{on a single}} pair of chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid).

Jack <b>jumper</b> ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex. The ant has nine polymorphic loci, which yielded 67 alleles.|$|E

40|$|In the {{approach}} {{phase of the}} long jump, athletes attempt to strike the take-off board accurately with minimum loss of speed, and in an optimum body position for take-off. Previous {{research has shown that}} skilled long <b>jumpers</b> demonstrate an ascending-descending trend of variability rather than a consistent pattern of foot placement over trials. The present study examined whether non-long <b>jumpers</b> showed a similar pattern of variability in footfall placement between trials to skilled long <b>jumpers.</b> Consistency of foot placement over trials for non-long <b>jumpers</b> (n = 11) was determined using a panned video camera. Digitization of the foot position provided toe- board distances during the run-up phase. Our results showed that non-long <b>jumpers</b> have a similar pattern of descending variability near to the take-off board to expert long <b>jumpers,</b> suggesting the use of visual regulation. However, in comparison to more skilled subjects, non-long <b>jumpers</b> accumulated a considerably larger maximum mean standard deviation in footfall placement between trials (58 cm). Since non-long <b>jumpers</b> had no previous task-specific training, these data extend our current understanding of the regulation of goal-directed gait...|$|R

50|$|<b>Jumper's</b> knee is injury {{term used}} in volleyball circles that {{describes}} the mechanism of the injury known as patella tendinopathy, patella tendinosis or patella tendonitis. <b>Jumper's</b> knee {{is defined as a}} syndrome of tendon pain, localized tenderness and that is detrimental to an athletes performance. in the initial phase of the <b>Jumper's</b> knee injury the tendons with the knee are usually inflamed. If <b>Jumper's</b> knee becomes a chronic injury ,which usually occurs as age increases, the tendons show an increasing degree of degeneration and little to no inflation present. As the etiology and pathology of <b>Jumper's</b> knee is not known the treatment varies and is largely based on a trial and error basis. <b>Jumpers</b> knee is said to occur after frequent actions involving quick accelerations and declarations, eccentric activities and quick cutting actions. As spiking involves jumping, in which a quick acceleration occurs when jumping and quick deceleration when landing, this action is a possible cause of <b>Jumper's</b> knee. Also blocking is a possible cause of <b>Jumper's</b> knee because it to involves jumping and landing quickly. However, <b>Jumper's</b> knee is less common among athletes who compete in beach volleyball rather than those who play indoor volleyball. This is because beach volleyball is played on sand which reduces the impact of landing on the knee.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, an Australian ant allergy venom {{study was}} conducted, {{with the goal}} of {{determining}} which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis. It showed that the jack <b>jumper</b> ant was responsible for the majority of patients' reactions to Myrmecia ant stings. Of the 265 patients who reacted to a sting from an ant belonging to the Myrmecia genus, 176 were from the jack <b>jumper.</b> 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack <b>jumper</b> ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack <b>jumper</b> allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack <b>jumper</b> ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
