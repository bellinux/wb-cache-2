Acaricides were at one time an effective method in regulating the transmission of V. jacobsoni in honey bees, but the buildup of residues in acaricide-resistant strains have decreased the effectiveness of mite control in honey bees. Among those acaricides used are acrinathrin, amitraz, bromopropylate, chlordimeform, coumaphos, <b>flumethrin,</b> and fluvalinate. Fluvalinate {{is the most effective}} acaricide.|$|E
50|$|Psoroptes mites infesting sheep are {{controlled}} by application of synthetic chemicals formulated for killing mites and ticks (acaricides, or more generally ectoparasiticides). These can be applied as aqueous washes in dipping baths, or as pour-on preparations in an oily formulation that spreads over the skin. Dip baths used to be commonly used for applying acaricides to sheep (also cattle). However, alternatives such as hand-held sprayers and pour-on applicators are now often used to reduce costs and risk of contamination associated with running a dip tank. Formamidine and synthetic pyrethroid acaricides such as amitraz and <b>flumethrin,</b> respectively, are often used.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} pesticides specific for ticks (acaricides) {{are suspended}} {{in water for}} application to the hair coat of domestic animals. Cattle can be immersed in dip-baths containing dipwash, or soaked using a pressurized spray-race made of metal tubing and nozzles. Sheep can be treated in smaller dips or showers. Acaricides {{can be applied to}} dogs in watery shampoo formulations. Acaricide-active ingredients are usually soluble in oil. This makes them suitable for concentrated oily formulations which spread from a pour-on applicator over the hair coat. Alternatively, some acaricides are incorporated in polyvinylchoride plastic ear tags for cattle, or collars for dogs. 7 Modern acaricides belong to the general classes of organophosphates (example chlorfenvinphos), formamidines (example amitraz), synthetic pyrethroids (example <b>flumethrin),</b> phenylpyrazoles (example fipronil), and benzylphenyl ureas (example fluazuron). 2 When correctly applied, they can be highly effective. Problems with acaricides are: danger of acute poisoning of treated animals and human staff; residues contaminating meat and milk; environmental contamination especially water sources; resistance that ticks acquire to acaricides; and cost of application. Cost and contamination can be reduced by seasonal timing of application (strategic treatment) based on ecological knowledge. Prediction of best times for treatment can be made using computerized models of the population dynamics of ticks. Farmers lacking sufficient cash to purchase manufactured synthetic acaricides often use various herbal treatments, locally available. Nicotine as treated tobacco leaf is an example, but such unregistered preparations require careful use to avoid poisoning or skin damage.|$|E

40|$|A {{mutation}} {{in the domain}} II S 4 – 5 linker region of the para-sodium channel gene has been associated previously with synthetic pyrethroid (SP) resistance in the cattle tick (Rhipicephalus microplus) in Australia. This is a C → A mutation at nucleotide position 190, which results in a leucine to isoleucine amino acid substitution (L 64 I). In a survey of 15 cattle tick populations with known SP resistance status, sourced from Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, {{there was a strong}} relationship (r = 0. 98) between the proportion of ticks carrying the L 64 I homozygous resistant genotype and the survival percentage after exposure to a discriminating concentration of cypermethrin in the bioassay, as expected. However, among populations resistant only to <b>flumethrin,</b> the L 64 I homozygous genotype was not found. The sequence obtained for a 167 bp region including domain II S 4 – 5 linker in flumethrin-resistant ticks identified a G → T non-synonymous mutation at nucleotide position 214 that results in a glycine to valine substitution (G 72 V). The frequency of the G 72 V homozygous genotype in each population was found to be moderately related to the survival percentage at the discriminating concentration of <b>flumethrin</b> in the larval packet test (r = 0. 74).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{control of}} tick and flea burdens in {{dogs and cats}} has become {{essential}} to the control of important and emerging vector borne diseases, {{some of which are}} zoonoses. Flea worry and flea bite hypersensitivity are additionally a significant disease entity in dogs and cats. Owner compliance in maintaining the pressure of control measures {{has been shown to be}} poor. For these reasons efforts are continuously being made to develop ectoparasiticides and application methods that are safe, effective and easy to apply for pet owners. A new polymer matrix collar has recently been developed which is registered for 8 months use in cats and dogs. The basic properties of this collar have been investigated in several in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods The effects of imidacloprid, <b>flumethrin</b> and the combination were evaluated in vitro by means of whole cell voltage clamp measurement experiments conducted on isolated neuron cells from Spodoptera frugiperda. The in vitro efficacy of the two compounds and the combination against three species of ticks and their life stages and fleas were evaluated in a dry surface glass vial assay. The kinetics of the compounds over time in the collar were evaluated by the change in mass of the collar and measurement of the surface concentrations and concentrations of the actives in the collar matrix by HPLC. Hair clipped from collar treated dogs and cats, collected at various time points, was used to assess the acaricidal efficacy of the actives ex vivo. Results An in vitro isolated insect nerve model demonstrated the synergistic neurotoxic effects of the pyrethroid <b>flumethrin</b> and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. An in vitro glass vial efficacy and mortality study against various life stages of the ticks Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor reticulatus and against the flea (Ctenocephalides felis) demonstrated that the combination of these products was highly effective against these parasites. The release kinetics of these actives from a neck collar (compounded with 10 % imidacloprid and 4. 5 % <b>flumethrin)</b> was extensively studied in dogs and cats under laboratory and field conditions. Acaricidal concentrations of the actives were found to be consistently released from the collar matrix for 8 months. None of the collar studies in dogs or cats were associated with any significant collar related adverse event. Conclusion Here we demonstrated the synergism between the pyrethroid <b>flumethrin</b> and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, both provided in therapeutically relevant doses by a slow release collar matrix system over 8 months. This collar is therefore a convenient and safe tool for a long-term protection against ectoparasites. </p...|$|E

For these reasons efforts are continuously being made to develop ectoparasiticides and application methods that are safe, effective and easy to apply for pet owners. A new polymer matrix collar has recently been developed which is registered for 8 months use in cats and dogs. The basic properties of this collar have been investigated in several in vitro and in vivo studies. METHODS: The effects of imidacloprid, <b>flumethrin</b> and the combination were evaluated in vitro by means of whole cell voltage clamp measurement experiments conducted on isolated neuron cells from Spodoptera frugiperda. The in vitro efficacy of the two compounds and the combination against three species of ticks and their life stages and fleas were evaluated in a dry surface glass vial assay. The kinetics of the compounds over time in the collar were evaluated by the changed in mass of the collar and measurement of the surface concentrations and concentrations points, was used to assess the acaricidal efficacy of the actives ex vivo. RESULTS: An in vitro isolated insect nerve model demonstrated the synergistic neurotoxic effects of the pyrethroid <b>flumethrin</b> and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. An in vitro glass vial efficacy and mortality study against various life stages of the ticks Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor reticulatus and against the flea (Ctenocephalides felis) demonstrated that the combination of these products was highly effective against these parasites. The release kinetics of these actives from a neck collar (compounded with 10 % imidacloprid and 4. 5 % <b>flumethrin)</b> was extensively studied in dogs and cats under laboratory and field conditions. Acaricidal concentrations of the actives were found to be consistently released from the collar matrix for 8 months. None of the collar studies in dogs and cats were associated with any significant collar related adverse event. CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrated the synergism between the pyrethroid <b>flumethrin</b> and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, both provided in therapeutically relevant doses by a slow release collar matrix system over 8 months. This collar is therefore a convenient and safe tool for a long-term protection against ectoparasites. Bayer Animal Health GmbH, Monheim, Germany and Bayer CropScience[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Ticks are {{important}} vectors {{of a large}} number of pathogenic organisms. In the Netherlands, Ixodes ricinus is the most abundant tick species and the main vector for several Borrelia species that may cause Lyme borreliosis. Many chemicals have been developed for tick control. In this chapter, a few commonly used acaricides are discussed with the main aim to assess whether they could be both effective and environmentally safe enough for tick control in the field through application on large mammals. This method is currently still at the experimental stage and only limitedly applied. The focus was on amitraz, permethrin, <b>flumethrin,</b> deltamethrin and ivermectin. After a qualitative comparison of the pros and cons, it was concluded that the pyrethroids <b>flumethrin</b> and deltamethrin are potentially the most useful, despite their high toxicity to various other animals in the environment. Both compounds act as contact-acaricides and are not easily leached in the environment. Environmental hazards can therefore be minimised if they are applied correctly and thoughtful, and contamination of the aquatic environment is avoided. Nevertheless, all synthetic acaricides have a number of serious downsides and, when considering using them in field situations, the benefits always need to be weighed against all costs involved. More environmentally-friendly alternatives are being developed of which vaccines against ticks seem most promising...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{commonly}} used acaricides (amitraz, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, and <b>flumethrin)</b> on the eggs of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus collected from Ludhiana, Punjab, was evaluated by egg hatch assay (EHA). The regression graph of probit hatchability and per cent inhibition of hatching (IH%) of eggs was plotted against log values of concentration of various acaricides. All concentrations of <b>flumethrin</b> and amitraz caused complete inhibition of hatching, whereas a hatchability of 31. 0 ± 6. 1, 40. 0 ± 5. 2 and 19. 3 ± 1. 7 % was only recorded {{at the highest}} concentration of cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fenvalerate, respectively. An increase in the concentration of the acaricide showed {{a significant effect on}} the IH% of eggs for cypermethrin P< 0. 01 and deltamethrin P< 0. 05 but was nonsignificant for fenvalerate. The slope of the regression curve of IH% was utilized for the calculation of the dose of various acaricides causing inhibition of hatching for 95 % eggs (LC 95) and the discriminating dose (DD). Results indicated that maximum DD was recorded for fenvalerate (2. 136 %), followed by cypermethrin (0. 214 %) and deltamethrin (0. 118 %). The results of the current study will be helpful in formulating effective control strategies against ticks...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the influence of application site and sheep breed on the efficacy of a <b>flumethrin</b> (1 % m/v) solution for the control of 'bont'-legged (Hyalomma spp.) and red-legged ticks (Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi). This study was conducted from November 1996 to February 1997 on 3 farms in the southwestern Free State Province. Two trials were conducted on Dorper sheep and 2 on Merino sheep. For each specific application 30 sheep were selected and allocated to 3 groups of 10 animals each using randomisation through minimisation, with pre-treatment total tick count as only criterion. Groups consisted of an untreated control group, a group treated with 3 m of a <b>flumethrin</b> (1 % m/v) solution applied only to the anogenital region, and a group treated at a dose rate of 1 m <b>flumethrin</b> (1 % m/v) / 5 kg host body mass. The total dose volume for animals in the last group was divided into 3 equal parts and applied to the brisket/axillae, groin and anogenital regions respectively. Animals grazed under extensive farming conditions and were infested by ticks that occurred naturally in the environment. Ticks were counted and removed weekly over a 6 -week period. In all 4 trials, Rhipicephalus e. evertsi was the dominant tick species, followed, in 3 of the trials, by Hyalomma spp. Efficacy (%) of control against ticks for Dorper sheep, treated only on the anogenital region, was variable, ranging between 29. 5 and 97 %. In Merino sheep the efficacy values ranged between 23. 1 and 90 %. The site-spcific (anogenital region) efficacy of control against ticks infesting Merino sheep was in general 100 % or almost 100 %. In Dorper sheep the efficacy values were &gt; 80 % for 3 - 5 weeks. The efficacy (%) of control against ticks for sheep treated on the brisket/axillae, groin and anogenital regions was always higher compared to sheep treated only on the anogenital region. In Dorper sheep, efficacy of control was &gt; 80 % for up to 4 weeks and in Merino sheep &gt; 80 % for 6 weeks...|$|E
40|$|Background: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parasitic zoonotic diseases in the world. Do­mestic dogs are the main domestic reservoirs of VL in endemic foci of Iran. Various methods, including vaccination, treatment of dogs, detection and removal of infected dogs have different results around the world. General policy on control of canine visceral leishmaniasis is protection of them from sand fly bites. The aim of this study was evalua­tion of pour-on application of <b>flumethrin</b> on dogs against blood-feeding and mortality of field-caught sand flies. Methods: Once every 20 days from May untill September 2013, the treated and control dogs were exposed with field caught sandflies for 2 hours under bed net traps. After the exposure time, both alive and dead sand flies were trans­ferred in netted cups to the laboratory. The mortality rate of them was assessed after 24 hours. The blood-fed or un­fed conditions were determined 2 hours after exposure to the dogs under stereomicroscope. Results: The blood feeding index was varied from 12. 0 to 25. 0 % and 53. 0 to 58. 0 % for treated and control dogs respectively (P< 0. 0001). The blood feeding inhibition was 75. 0 – 87. 0 % and 41. 0 – 46. 0 % for the control and treated dogs (P< 0. 0001), respectively. The total mortality rate was 94. 0 – 100 % and 19. 0 – 58. 0 % respectively for the treated and control groups (P< 0. 001). Conclustion: Application of pour-on <b>flumethrin</b> on dogs caused 90 – 100 % mortality until 2. 5 month and inhibited the blood-feeding of sand flies.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Efficacy trials with <b>flumethrin</b> 1 % pour-on were {{conducted}} in 9 different areas in 3 southern and central African countries against Amblyomma hebraeum and A. variegatum on cattle. A dose volume of 10 ml/ 100 kg body mass applied at bi-weekly intervals provided excellent control of both tick species on their predilection sites, irrespective of locally and seasonally high tick pressure. The trial results demonstrate clearly that this new concept of tick control can be effectively applied in commercial and traditional cattle husbandry situations.
