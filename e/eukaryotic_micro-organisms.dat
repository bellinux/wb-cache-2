The addition of different nutrients and different incubation times were used to create phenotypically different biofilms. These in vitro models can be used to test novel strategies for maintaining oral health, test new components and identify relevant microbial interactions. In chapter 3 the effect of the introduction of the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organism</b> C. albicans in the biofilm is described. In this chapter, the complex cariogenic model is used to evaluate the effect of C. albicans on the phenotype and ecology of oral biofilms. Chapter 4 {{describes the}} effect of the artificial sweetener erythritol on gingivitis biofilms. Besides the fact that erythritol cannot be converted to acids by oral microbes, it is known to have other caries-preventive properties. It reduces total plaque levels, abundance of mutans streptococci, and organic acid levels in dental plaque. A study using dual-species biofilms shows that erythritol is possibly also effective against gingivitis by reducing the relative abundance of P. gingivalis compared to S. gordonii. In this chapter, the effects of erythritol on a gingivitis biofilm is studied. To get more insight in microbial interactions in the oral cavity, the effect of several quorum sensing inhibitors on complex oral biofilms is described in chapter 5. A panel of 3 quorum sensing inhibitors, and the precursor for AI- 2 (DPD) were tested. Pathology-related phenotypes of the treated and untreated biofilms are compared. One inhibitor significantly reduced lactic acid production of cariogenic biofilms without extensive inhibition of biofilm formation. Therefore, the effect of this quorum sensing inhibitor is described in more detail...|$|R
40|$|Dictyostelium discoideum is a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organism</b> with {{a unique}} life cycle. The amoebae live as haploid, {{free-living}} cells in the soil feeding on bacteria and dividing asexually. Under starvation conditions, the cells aggregate and undergo a process of differentiation into spores and stalk cells. We speculate that the stalk cells are sacrificed to help raise the spores above the substrate and to improve their dispersal and survival. In {{the case of a}} mix between two or more genetically different clones, a conflict may arise over which cells become spores and survive and which become stalk and die. One that differentiates more spores than its fair share in chimera is called a "cheater" and the other a "loser". Dictyostelium discoideum is a useful organism for studying the complexity of social behavior in microorganisms. Molecular tools have been developed allowing the study of genetic mechanisms that underlie this social behavior. To investigate the molecular basis of cooperation, several pools of knock-out mutants were generated using the REMI (R&barbelow;estriction E&barbelow;nzyme M&barbelow;ediated I&barbelow;ntegration) technique. To simulate evolutionary selection for cheaters, the different mutants were subjected to rounds of spore germination, growth and development in a mixed population. Only the spores were taken to the next generation. Real Time PCR confirmed that cheaters became over-represented in the evolving population because they contribute spores with a higher efficiency than the other mutants. Mutants expressing a normal phenotype were picked and isolated after 10 and 20 cycles of selection and mixed in pairwise experiments with the parental wild type. At least 35 mutants have been tested and 29 were cheaters. Analysis of the isolated genes suggested that several genetic pathways are involved in regulating or modulating the complex cooperation process in Dictyostelium discoideum. Finally we characterized one cheater mutant, called chtB, which shows apparently normal phenotype when plated clonally. The mutant is lacking in the expression of the gene chtB. In chimeras, this causes the reduction of the expression of the prespore marker cotB in the wild type strain, enabling the cheater to differentiate more spores than the parental strain...|$|R

This was confirmed by limited proteolytic peptide mapping. The beta subunit of nematode tubulin appeared almost identical to that of mammals.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of molecular genetic methods has caused {{confusion about the}} nature of microbial species. Environmental DNA extraction has indicated the existence of a vast diversity of genotypes, but how this relates to functional and phenotypic diversity has not been sufficiently explored. It has been implied that genetic distance per se correlates with phenotypic differentiation and thus reflects subtle (but undiscovered) adaptive fine-tuning to the environment, and that microbes may show biogeographic patterns at the genetic level. Here, we argue that no theoretically based species concept exists; species represent only the basic unit in the taxonomic hierarchy. The significance of naming species is that it organizes biological information. The reason why microbial species collectively represent large genetic differences is owing to huge absolute population sizes, absence of allopatric speciation and low extinction rates. Microbial phenotypes are, therefore, ancient in terms of the geological time-scale and have been maintained through stabilizing selection. These problems are discussed with special reference to <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms...</b>|$|E

MAAs are utilized {{in a wide variety}} of organisms including prokaryotes and <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> that inhabit aquatic, terrestrial, and marine environments. These features suggest that MAAs are stable and fundamental molecules that allow these organisms to live under UV irradiation.

Structurally different MAAs might have been developed in MAA-producing organisms during their environmental adaptation. Harmful irradiation directly damages biomolecules, including lipids, proteins and DNA, and induces oxidative stress through radical-propagating processes. Thus, MAAs are expected to play an additional role in the antioxidant system. This review focuses on MAAs with radical scavenging activities. To cover all the reported MAAs known thus far, we surveyed the CAS database and have summarized the structures and the chemical and physical properties of these MAAs, including their antioxidant activities...|$|E
40|$|A {{sampling}} procedure for quantitative metabolomics in Penicillium chrysogenum based on cold aqueous methanol quenching was re-evaluated and optimized to reduce metabolite leakage during sample treatment. The optimization study included amino acids and intermediates of the glycolysis and the TCA-cycle. Metabolite leakage {{was found to}} be minimal for a methanol content of the quenching solution (QS) of 40 % (v/v) while keeping the temperature of the quenched sample near - 20 º C. The average metabolite recovery under these conditions was 95. 7 % (± 1. 1 %). Several observations support the hypothesis that metabolite leakage from quenched mycelia of P. chrysogenum occurs by diffusion over the cell membrane. First, a prolonged contact time between mycelia and the QS lead to a somewhat higher extent of leakage. Second, when suboptimal quenching liquids were used, increased metabolite leakage {{was found to be}} correlated with lower molecular weight and with lower absolute net charge. The finding that lowering the methanol content of the quenching liquid reduces metabolite leakage in P. chrysogenum contrasts with recently published quenching studies for two other <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> This demonstrates {{that it is necessary to}} validate and, if needed, optimize the quenching conditions for each particular micro-organism.

A total of 387 taxa, including pro- and <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> seaweeds and invertebrates, {{have been found}} rafting on floating litter in all major oceanic regions. Among the invertebrates, species of bryozoans, crustaceans, molluscs and cnidarians are most frequently reported as rafters on marine litter. Microorganisms are also ubiquitous on marine litter although {{the composition of the}} microbial community seems to depend on specific substratum characteristics such as the polymer type of floating plastic items. Sessile suspension feeders are particularly well-adapted to the limited autochthonous food resources on artificial floating substrata and an extended planktonic larval development seems to facilitate colonization of floating litter at sea. Properties of floating litter, such as size and surface rugosity, are crucial for colonization by marine organisms and the subsequent succession of the rafting community. The rafters themselves affect substratum characteristics such as floating stability, buoyancy, and degradation. Under the influence of currents and winds marine litter can transport associated organisms over extensive distances. Because of the great persistence (especially of plastics) and the vast quantities of litter in the world’s oceans, rafting dispersal has become more prevalent in the marine environment, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species...|$|E

Soil micro-organisms are efficient bio-indicators of soil quality and plant health and are critical to the sustainability of soil-based ecosystem function and to successful plant growth. In this study, 18 S rRNA gene clone library analyses were employed to study the succession progress of soil <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> under continuous peanut cultivation. Eight libraries were constructed for peanut over three continuous cropping cycles and its representative growth stages. Cluster analyses indicated that soil micro-eukaryotic assemblages obtained from the same peanut cropping cycle were similar, regardless of growth period. Six eukaryotic groups were found and fungi predominated in all libraries. The fungal populations showed significant dynamic change and overall diversity increased over time under continuous peanut cropping. The abundance and/or diversity of clones affiliated with Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Glomerales, Orbiliales, Mucorales and Tremellales showed an increasing trend with continuous cropping but clones affiliated with Agaricales, Cantharellales, Pezizales and Pyxidiophorales decreased in abundance and/or diversity over time. The current data, along with data from previous studies, demonstrated that the soil microbial community was affected by continuous cropping, in particular, the pathogenic and beneficial fungi that were positively selected over time, which is commonplace in agro-ecosystems.

In this study we address {{the extent to which}} testate amoebae are used in palynological research, the key challenges to more widespread use, {{and the extent to which}} ecological information is retained in the testate amoeba assemblages of standard palynological slides. To achieve this we review the literature on the use of testate amoebae in palynology, compare testate amoeba records produced by palynological and water-based preparation methods and carry out simulations using previously-derived datasets. Our results show that testate amoebae are widely encountered in Quaternary palynological studies, primarily in peatlands, but the information which they can provide is undermined by limited taxonomic knowledge. Many taxa are destroyed in pollen preparations, but for taxa that are retained patterns of abundance parallel those determined using water-based preparation methods. Although the loss of sensitive taxa limits the ecological information contained in testate amoeba assemblages the information preserved is likely to be useful in a multiproxy approach to palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. To help improve taxonomic awareness and encourage the use of testate amoebae in palynology we present a basic introduction to testate amoeba taxonomy and a guide to the taxonomic literature...|$|E
40|$|Until now, {{descriptions}} of intracellular biomineralization of amorphous inclusions involving alkaline-earth metal (AEM) carbonates other than calcium have been confined exclusively to cyanobacteria (Couradeau et al., 2012). Here, we report {{the first evidence}} {{of the presence of}} intracellular amorphous granules of AEM carbonates (calcium, strontium, and barium) in unicellular eukaryotes. These inclusions, which we have named micropearls, show concentric and oscillatory zoning on a nanometric scale. They are widespread in certain eukaryote phytoplankters of Lake Geneva (Switzerland) and represent a previously unknown type of non-skeletal biomineralization, revealing an unexpected pathway in the geochemical cycle of AEMs. We have identified Tetraselmis cf. cordiformis (Chlorophyta, Prasinophyceae) as being responsible for the formation of one micropearl type containing strontium ([Ca,Sr]CO 3), which we also found in a cultured strain of Tetraselmis cordiformis. A different flagellated eukaryotic cell forms barium-rich micropearls [(Ca,Ba) CO 3]. The strontium and barium concentrations of both micropearl types are extremely high compared with the undersaturated water of Lake Geneva (the Ba/Ca ratio of the micropearls is up to 800, 000 times higher than in the water). This can only be explained by a high biological pre-concentration of these elements. The particular characteristics of the micropearls, along with the presence of organic sulfur-containing compounds—associated with and surrounding the micropearls—strongly suggest the existence of a yet-unreported intracellular biomineralization pathway in <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{claim that}} <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> have global {{geographic}} ranges, constituting a significant {{departure from the}} situation with macro-organisms, has been supported by studies of morphological species from protistan kingdoms. Here, we examine this claim by reviewing examples from another kingdom of eukaryotic microbes, the Fungi. We show that inferred geographic range of a fungal species depends upon the method of species recognition. While some fungal species defined by morphology show global geographic ranges, when fungal species are defined by phylogenetic species recognition they are typically shown to harbour several to many endemic species. We advance two non-exclusive reasons to explain the perceived difference between the size of geographic ranges of microscopic and macroscopic eukaryotic species when morphological methods of species recognition are used. These reasons are that microbial organisms generally have fewer morphological characters, and that the rate of morphological change will be slower for organisms with less elaborate development and fewer cells. Both of these reasons result in fewer discriminatory morphological differences between recently diverged lineages. The rate of genetic change, moreover, is similar for both large and small organisms, which helps to explain why phylogenetic species of large and small organisms show a more similar distribution of geographic ranges. As a consequence of the different rates in fungi of genetic and morphological changes, genetic isolation precedes a recognizable morphological change. The final step in speciation, reproductive isolation, also follows genetic isolation and may precede morphological change...|$|E
40|$|To {{appreciate}} the functional diversity of communities of soil <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> evaluated an experimental approach {{based on the}} construction and screening of a cDNA library using polyadenylated mRNA extracted from a forest soil. Such a library contains genes that expressed by each of the different organisms forming the community and represents metatranscriptome. The diversity of the organisms that contributed to this library was evaluated by sequencing {{a portion of the}} 18 S rDNA gene amplified from either soil DNA or reverse-transcribed RNA. More than 70 % of the sequences were from fungi and unicellular eukaryotes (protists) while the other most represented group was the metazoa. Calculation of richness estimators suggested that more than 180 species could be present in the soil samples studied. Sequencing of 119 cDNA identified genes with no homologues in databases (32 %) and genes coding proteins involved different biochemical and cellular processes. Surprisingly, the taxonomic distribution of the cDNA and of the 18 S rDNA genes did not coincide, with a marked under-representation of the protists among the cDNA. Specific genes from such an environmental cDNA library could be isolated expression in a heterologous microbial host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is illustrated by functional complementation of a histidine auxotrophic yeast mutant by two cDNA originating possibly from an ascomycete and a basidiomycete fungal species. Study of the metatranscriptome has the potential to uncover adaptations of whole microbial communities to local environmental conditions.

40|$|The {{microbial}} world {{contains a}} highly heterogeneous group of organisms sharing only one common characteristic, their small sizes. These organisms make up two (out of three) entire Domains {{of life on}} earth, the prokaryotic Bacteria and Archaea (Woese, 1987). Within the third Domain Eukarya, {{the majority of the}} phylogenetic diversity is contained within <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> such as protozoa, algae, and fungi. Micro-organisms are estimated to make up {{more than a third of}} Earth's biomass (Whitman, et al., 1998). Because culturing provided the platform for building the depth and detail of modern microbiological knowledge, for a long time microbiologists ignored the challenge to identify and characterize uncultured organisms. One of the indicators that cultured micro-organisms did not represent much of the microbial world was the oft-observed "great plate count anomaly" (Staley and Konopka, 1985). The discrepancy between the sizes of populations estimated by dilution plating and by microscopy is particularly dramatic in some aquatic environments, in which plate counts and viable cells estimated by acridine orange staining can differ by four to six orders of magnitude, and in soil, in which 0. 1 to 1 % of bacteria are readily culturable on common media under standard conditions (Torsvik and Ovreas, 2002).

40|$|The {{cellular}} slime moulds or dictyostelids, are a {{major group}} of edaphic (soil-dwelling) unicellular <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> which feed on bacteria in the humus layer of tropical and temperate soils. The extraordinary behaviour of dictyostelids where solitary, predatory amoebae become social, forming a multi-cellular spore-producing ‘organism’ when their food supply becomes limited has fascinated generations of researchers. Since their discovery the taxonomy of the cellular slime moulds has been largely based on morphological features, revised many times, but still remains unresolved and controversial. One focus of discussion is the controversial {{relationship between the two}} principal genera of Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium, which by virtue of a common amoeba type are placed in the same family - Dictyosteliaceae. Despite the current distinction between Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium it is impossible to definitively resolve these genera, or indeed the broader classification of cellular slime moulds, using only morphological features. Given that dictyostelids are both of major ecological importance and often used as a model eukaryotic system, it has become imperative to resolve these taxonomic uncertainties and to finally establish the validity of one or two genera. This study used two PCR based techniques: (1) direct sequencing of the ITS 1 and ITS 2 regions of the rDNA complex together with (2) ISSR-PCR, a standard molecular technique but rarely applied to the dictyostelids. The latter requiring the development of a working protocol before it could be implemented. The sequence data from 51 different dictyostelid species and isolates was aligned with CLUSTAL and analysed via PAUP. This study clearly demonstrates that molecular markers cannot distinguish Dictyostelium (sensu stricto) from Polysphondylium (sensu stricto) : indeed it presents evidence to support the existence of a single genus. The implications of these results are unequivocal: the current systematics of cellular slime moulds, based on morphological characters, must be revised...|$|E
40|$|Fungi are {{a diverse}} group of <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> {{particularly}} suited for comparative genomics analyses. Fungi are important to industry, fundamental science {{and many of them are}} notorious pathogens of crops, thereby endangering global food supply. Dozens of fungi have been sequenced in the last decade and with the advances of the next generation sequencing, thousands of new genome sequences will become available in coming years. In this thesis I have used bioinformatics tools to study different biological and evolutionary processes in various genomes with a focus on the genomes of the Dothideomycetefungi Cladosporium fulvum, Dothistroma septosporumand Zymoseptoria tritici. Chapter 1 introduces the scientific disciplines of mycology and bioinformatics from a historical perspective. It exemplifies a typical whole-genome sequence analysis of a fungal genome, and focusses in particular on structural gene annotation and detection of transposable elements. In addition it shortly reviews the microRNA pathway as known in animal and plants in the context of the putative existence of similar yet subtle different small RNA pathways in other branches of the eukaryotic tree of life. Chapter 2 addresses the novel sequenced genomes of the closely related Dothideomyceteplant pathogenic fungi Cladosporium fulvumand Dothistroma septosporum. Remarkably, it revealed occurrence of a surprisingly high similarity at the protein level combined with striking differences at the DNA level, gene repertoire and gene expression. Most noticeably, the genome of C. fulvumappears to be at least twice as large, which is solely attributable to a much larger content in repetitive sequences. Chapter 3 describes a novel alignment-based fungal gene prediction method (ABFGP) that is particularly suitable for plastic genomes like those of fungi. It shows excellent performance benchmarked on a dataset of 7, 000 unigene-supported gene models from ten different fungi. Applicability of the method was shown by revisiting the annotations of C. fulvumand D. septosporumand of various other fungal genomes from the first-generation sequencing era. Thousands of gene models were revised in each of the gene catalogues, indeed revealing a correlation to the quality of the genome assembly, and to sequencing strategies used in the sequencing centres, highlighting different types of errors in different annotation pipelines. Chapter 4 focusses on the unexpected high number of gene models that were identified by ABFGP that align nicely to informant genes, but only upon toleration of frame shifts and in-frame stop-codons. These discordances could represent sequence errors (SEs) and/or disruptive mutations (DMs) that caused these truncated and erroneous gene models. We revisited the same fungal gene catalogues as in chapter 3, confirmed SEs by resequencing and successively removed those, yielding a high-confidence and large dataset of nearly 1, 000 pseudogenes caused by DMs. This dataset of fungal pseudogenes, containing genes listed as bona fide genes in current gene catalogues, does not correspond to various observations previously done on fungal pseudogenes. Moreover, the degree of pseudogenization showing up to a ten-fold variation for the lowest versus the highest affected species, is generally higher in species that reproduce asexually compared to those that in addition reproduce sexually. Chapter 5 describes explorative genomics and comparative genomics analyses revealing the presence of introner-like elements (ILEs) in various Dothideomycetefungi including Zymoseptoria triticiin which they had not identified yet, although its genome sequence is already publicly available for several years. ILEs combine hallmark intron properties with the apparent capability of multiplying themselves as repetitive sequence. ILEs strongly associate with events of intron gain, thereby delivering in silico proof of their mobility. Phylogenetic analyses at the intra- and inter-species level showed that most ILEs are related and likely share common ancestry. Chapter 6 provides additional evidence that ILE multiplication strongly dominates over other types of intron duplication in fungi. The observed high rate of ILE multiplication followed by rapid sequence degeneration led us to hypothesize that multiplication of ILEs has been the major cause and mechanism of intron gain in fungi, and we speculate that this could be generalized to all eukaryotes. Chapter 7 describes a new strategy for miRNA hairpin prediction using statistical distributions of observed biological variation of properties (descriptors) of known miRNA hairpins. We show that the method outperforms miRNA prediction by previous, conventional methods that usually apply threshold filtering. Using this method, several novel candidate miRNAs were assigned in the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegansand two human viruses. Although this chapter is not applied on fungi, the study does provide a flexible method to find evidence for existence of a putative miRNA-like pathway in fungi. Chapter 8 provides a general discussion on the advent of bioinformatics in mycological research and its implications. It highlights the necessity of a prioriplanning and integration of functional analysis and bioinformatics in order to achieve scientific excellence, and describes possible scenarios for the near future of fungal (comparative) genomics research. Moreover, it discusses the intrinsic error rate in large-scale, automatically inferred datasets and the implications of using and comparing those...|$|E
40|$|Periodontal {{diseases}} are highly prevalent in population of all ages. Initiated by bacterial accumulation at the interface of bone and soft tissue, they {{lead to the}} loss of gingival tissue adherent to the root surface and, eventually, to tooth loss. Regenerative approaches to treat periodontitis offer exciting possibilities; guided tissue/bone regeneration (GTR/GBR) approaches are promising because, through the insertion of a physical barrier, they can exclude unwanted epithelial and gingival connective tissue cells from the healing area and allow bone tissue cells to repopulate the bony defect. Different resorbable and non-resorbable membranes have been developed. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes are the "gold standard" for GTR/GBR applications but they are non-resorbable and they need a second surgical operation to repair dehiscence. Biodegradable synthetic membranes avoid a second surgical operation but they show drawbacks concerning the capacity of space maintenance, early/late absorption, mechanical properties and bacterial infection during degradation. Collagen membranes have advantages related to collagen biological properties but are characterized by low mechanical strength. The "ideal" membrane for use in periodontal regenerative therapy has yet to be developed. The main purpose of this thesis was the design of biologically active products, with improved osteoconductive and antimicrobial properties, for GTR/GBR applications in periodontal diseases. In a more traditional approach, a commercially available membrane (based on PTFE) was surface modified by environmentally friendly technique to allow rapid bone re-growth and exert antimicrobial action. Binding ability of 3, 4 -dihydroxy-DL-phenylalanine (DOPA) to samples of any type, size and shape was exploited to improve PTFE surface properties. In particular, a hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAp) coating was applied by DOPA self-polymerization on PTFE surface in the presence of HAp nanoparticles, to promote the bone re-growth properties of PTFE films. Chemical composition analysis demonstrated the successful deposition of polyDOPA and HAp on coated films. Morphological and topographical characterizations further confirmed the total surface coverage causing an increase in surface roughness (39. 8 ± 5. 2 nm for PTFE films vs 236. 5 ± 12. 0 nm for polyDOPA/HAp coated films) and wettability (110. 8 ± 2. 8 ° for PTFE films vs 46. 1 ± 12. 4 ° for polyDOPA/HAp coated samples). A discontinuous HAp coating was still present after 14 days of incubation of coated PTFE films in phosphate buffered saline. Pre-osteoblastic MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells cultured on polyDOPA/HAp coated films showed a pronounced increase of cell proliferation and adhesion. Regarding the antimicrobial action, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been selected due to their good antimicrobial efficacy against bacteria, viruses and other <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> The successful deposition of AgNPs on PTFE surface, through the functional groups of DOPA, has been demonstrated by physico-chemical and morphological analyses. Nanoparticles exhibited a diameter around 68 nm and were homogeneously distributed on the surface. In vitro cell tests with fibroblast NIH 3 T 3 cells showed an inhibition of cells proliferation on AgNPs functionalized films after 3 days of culture, while good cell adhesion was observed with cells randomly distributed on sample surface and extensively spread. The antimicrobial efficiency was demonstrated against S. aureus and Ag release was sustained for at least 14 days. The mussel-inspired coated PTFE membrane could find potential application as GTR/GBR strategy for the treatment of periodontal diseases. In a highly innovative approach, a bi-layered bioabsorbable membrane was developed, by the assembly of a compact and a porous layer. GTR/GBR membranes can be considered an interface-implant between gingival connective tissue/epithelium and alveolar bone tissue. Developing a multi-component structure membrane with compositional and structural gradients that meet the local functional requirements could represent a challenge. Binary blends of poly(DL-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) and poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) with various compositions (100 / 0, 75 / 25, 50 / 50, 25 / 75, 0 / 100 wt/wt) were prepared by solvent casting technique as compact layer of the bi-layered membrane. Morphological analysis did not evidence phase separation between PLCL and PLGA and the behavior of blend glass transition temperatures as a function of composition suggested some degree of blend compatibility. However, blends elastic modulus showed a negative deviation from the additive law of mixture. In vitro cell tests with fibroblast NIH 3 T 3 cells showed improved cell adhesion and growth on PLCL/PLGA 25 / 75 blend. Due to its biocompatibility, its superior mechanical properties (E= 10. 2 ± 0. 6 MPa, σmax= 0. 8 ± 0. 0 MPa, and εmax= 548. 8 ± 57. 9 %) and compatibility between the components, PLCL/PLGA 25 / 75 blend was selected for this application. Compact films were then surface modified via layer-by-layer (LbL) technique to enhance fibroblast cell response and confer antibacterial efficacy. A surface priming treatment (aminolysis) was optimized before depositing LbL coating. The following parameters were used: C= 0. 08 g/mL, t= 8 min and T= 37 °C. Then, multilayered chondroitin sulfate/chitosan (CHS/CH) coatings were deposited on the aminolysed films. The feasibility of multilayer coating was confirmed by QCM-D analysis. Further confirmations derived from water contact angle measurements (contact angle jumped alternatively between 45 ° and 65 ° depending on the outmost layer component) and FTIR-ATR analysis (appearance of absorbance peaks characteristics of CHS and CH). FTIC-labelled CH was also employed to follow LbL built up by fluorescence microscopy analysis. In vitro cell tests demonstrated the ability of coated samples to improve NIH 3 T 3 fibroblast adhesion and proliferation. Biocompatibility properties increased with increasing the layer number and were superior in the case of CH-terminating layers but no antibacterial activity was observed for films coated with 16 layers. Three dimensional sponge-like composite membranes fabricated by freeze-drying, with a composition similar to natural bone, and based on β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) dispersed in a chitosan/gelatin (CH/G) network cross-linked with genipin (GP) and disodium phosphate salt (DSP) were developed as porous layer of the bi-layered device. Three membranes were developed (CH/G, CH/G+GP-DSP and CH/G/TCP+GP-DSP) and characterized. Successful double cross-linking of CH/G network was confirmed by Kaiser test, chemical and thermal analysis. All membranes showed a typical foam-like morphology with interconnected pores having an average diameter of 100 - 200 μm. Both cross-linking and TCP presence caused a marked increase of membrane stability in water solution, as well as of tensile modulus and maximum tensile strength (respectively, 14. 9 ± 5. 1 MPa and 0. 6 ± 0. 0 MPa for CH/G, and 29. 4 ± 2. 7 MPa and 0. 8 ± 0. 1 MPa for CH/G/TCP+GP-DSP.). Compared to CH/G samples, CH/G+GP-DSP and CH/G/TCP+GP-DSP membranes showed improved MG- 63 human osteoblast-like cells response, in terms of cell viability and morphology. The assembly process of the compact and porous layer was developed based on the insertion of an intermediate adhesive layer composed by a polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyethylene glycol 70 / 30 wt/wt blend. Preliminary characterizations were carried out. Morphological analysis did not show changes in compact and porous layer structure due to the presence of the adhesive. The final device showed an elastic modulus of about 61 MPa in dry condition that markedly decreased in wet state (to about 5 MPa). Qualitative analysis of membrane manageability revealed its ability to adapt to mandible conformation after immersion in physiological solution. Despite the need for additional tests, the bi-layered membrane appeared promising for GTR/GBR application...|$|E
