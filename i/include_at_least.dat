5|$|Israel granted Wallenberg honorary {{citizenship}} in 1986 and honored {{him at the}} Yad Vashem memorial {{as one of the}} Righteous Among the Nations. Other tributes to Wallenberg in Israel <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five streets named after him. On Raoul Wallenberg Street in Tel Aviv, a statue identical to one in Budapest was installed in 2002 (see below), made by the sculptor Imre Varga.|$|E
5|$|Nematodes {{are among}} the largest animal phyla and <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 12,000 known species that are parasites of vertebrates. In Kinsella's 1988 study in Florida, species {{diversity}} was higher in the saltwater marsh (Cedar Key) than the freshwater marsh (Paynes Prairie), but nematodes at Paynes Prairie occurred more commonly and made {{up the bulk of}} the parasites found in rice rats there.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{depicted}} {{many important}} {{figures of the}} Polish Renaissance period including taking the liberty to <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one who were not actually present at the event. In a similar vein, although the event portrayed took place in 1525, Matejko painted fragments of the Sukiennice in Renaissance style, a form that dates from the year 1555, after a fire which destroyed the building in its original Gothic style. St. Mary's Basilica is visible in the background.|$|E

5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi, {{which cause}} disease in insects, <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 14 species that attack aphids. Beauveria bassiana is mass-produced {{and used to}} manage {{a wide variety of}} insect pests {{including}} whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E

Dynamic gate biasing is {{provided for the}} third n-channel and p-channel cascode transistors to prevent voltage overstress of the cascode transistors. The level shifter circuit <b>includes</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one pseudo N-MOS inverter including an input transistor, a protective cascode stack <b>including</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one n-channel cascode transistor, and a load transistor.

5|$|Worldwide Saturn sales <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> the {{following}} amounts in each territory: 5.75 million in Japan (surpassing the Genesis' sales of 3.58 {{million in the}} country), 1.8 million in the United States, 1 million in Europe, and 530,000 elsewhere. With lifetime sales of 9.26 million units, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure, although its install base in Japan surpassed the Nintendo 64's 5.54 million. Lack of distribution has been cited as a significant factor contributing to the Saturn's failure, as the system's surprise launch damaged Sega's reputation with key retailers. Conversely, Nintendo's long delay in releasing a 3D console and damage caused to Sega's reputation by poorly supported add-ons for the Genesis are considered major factors allowing Sony to gain {{a foothold in the}} market.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also <b>include</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living forms, as well as elephant birds and Malagasy hippopotamuses, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether the two species lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between the two species is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and mongooses found in the same areas, suggesting that the two species may have been able to occur together.|$|E
