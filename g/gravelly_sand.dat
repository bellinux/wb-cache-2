2500|$|The Wahluke Slope AVA was {{established}} in 2006 and produces, on average, around 20% of the state's wine grapes. Of the region's , nearly [...] were planted as of 2008. Located among the foothills south of the Saddle Mountains, the Wahluke Slope {{is one of the}} warmest and driest regions in the state. The Columbia River forms the western and southern boundaries of the AVA with the Hanford Reach National Monument bordering the appellation on the east. The vintage characteristics of Wahluke slope are very consistent year to year due to the area's reliably dry, warm climate and uniform coarse <b>gravelly</b> <b>sand</b> soils that drain water well. More than three-quarters of the area's production is in red wine grapes—particularly Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. As of 2007, more than 50 wineries purchased grapes from the Wahluke Slope, with many of them featuring the AVA or one of its 20 vineyards on wine labels.|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as the}} washing-trough {{was brought}} up from Sharmá, we opened {{operations}} by digging a trench, at least twelve feet deep, in the re-entering angle of the bed close to the Mimosa tree. The sand, pink above and chloritic yellow below, ended in a thick bed of water-rolled pebbles, not in ground-rock; nor did it show the couch of excellent clay which usually underlies the surface, and which, I have said, is extracted through pits to make sun-dried brick, swish, and other building materials. We also secured some of the blood-red earth from the eastern tail of the northern [...] "Shigh," [...] the manganese-stained Tauá and the <b>gravelly</b> <b>sand</b> washed out of the Cascalho-gravel, the latter very promising. The result of our careless working, however, was not successful; the normal ilmenite, black sand of magnetic iron, took the place of gold-dust. And this unlooked-for end again made us suspicious of my old friend's proceedings: the first occasion was that of his notable [...] "malingering." [...] Had he bought a pinch of [...] "Tibr" [...] (pure gold) from the Bedawin, and mixed it with the handful of surface stuff ? Had the assayer at Alexandria played him a trick ? Or had an exceptionally heavy torrent really washed down auriferous [...] "tailings"? I willingly believe the latter {{to have been the}} case; and we shall presently see it is within the range of possibility. Traces of gold were found by Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. Ross, through his pyrological process, in the sandy clays brought from the mouth of Wady Makná.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and <b>gravelly</b> <b>sands.</b> In certain situations <b>gravelly</b> <b>sands</b> may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in <b>gravelly</b> <b>sands</b> was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|R

40|$|The stratigraphic {{relationships}} between the deposits of the Hinuera Formation and the Taupo Pumice Alluvium are described over a 16 ha plot of land known as the 'Asparagus Block' at Horotiu. The Hinuera Formation is exposed at the surface {{at the southern end}} of this block, and is overlain by a wedge of Taupo Pumice Alluvium which increases in thickness from 0 to 8 m northwards across the block. Lithofacies in the Hinuera Formation are dominated by trough cross-bedded <b>gravelly</b> <b>sands</b> (lithofacies AI), with common cross-laminated sands (lithofacies B) and massive to horizontally laminated silts (lithofacies D). The pumice content of these deposits is mainly 70 %. Lithofacies in the Taupo Pumice Alluvium are dominated by horizontally to inclined (tabular cross-) bedded slightly <b>gravelly</b> <b>sands</b> and sands (lithofacies G 1 / 2), with common occurrences of horizontally bedded to massive sandy silts (lithofacies D). The pumice content of these Taupo deposits is high, typically > 80 %. Cross-sections are presented showing an interpreted subsurface distribution of these lithofacies from south to north through the 'Asparagus Block'. The estimated reserve of extractable pumice sand from the block is of the order of about 400, 000 to 450, 000 m³...|$|R

40|$|The Clay {{core wall}} sand dams are mostly {{constructed}} on the tremendously thick covering layers with the base built with <b>gravelly</b> coarse <b>sand</b> and the {{upstream and downstream}} built with sanded shell into which <b>gravelly</b> coarse <b>sand</b> by manpower. The structures of these dams are generally loose and are presumably thereby considered not {{to meet the requirements}} against earthquake. In order to perform further safety analysis and liquefaction judgment with these dams in relation to their anti-seismic capacity, a typical dam with clay core and sanded shell was chosen and experiments were carried out to observe the dynamic behaviors of the dam, including the dynamic strength, the dynamic deformation and the dynamic pore pressure of the dam base and its upstream sanded shell. The results showed that the vibration stress ratio of <b>gravelly</b> coarse <b>sand</b> decreased with the increment in vibration frequency and increased with the increment in consolidation ratio, that the elastic modulus of <b>gravelly</b> coarse <b>sand</b> decreased with the increment in strain, and that the damping ratio of <b>gravelly</b> coarse <b>sand</b> increased with the increment in strain. In conclusion, the denser the dam material is, the better the anti- seismic behavior is, the sand used in the dam is non-linear in nature, The model of vibration pore water pressure growth is characterized by simplicity in expression, convenience in application, and being able to used in widespread way, etc. It reveals what inherent in the relationship of the increment of residual pore pressure with multiple factors, and hence can be used in the dynamic analysis of effective stress.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{penetration}} resistance depends on the grain size of soils and that fines-containing sands have smaller SPT N values than clean sands. When correlating the SPT blow count and relative density of sandy soils, {{it is essential to}} offer a proper interpretation for these effects. This paper presents an empirical correlation between N and Dr that allows for the important effects of grain-size and fines content of soils, and is therefore applicable to various kinds of sandy soils, including clean sands, sands with fines and <b>gravelly</b> <b>sands.</b> The proposed correlation is based on data of high-quality undisturbed samples secured by means of the ground freezing technique and measured SPT resistance of natural sandy soil deposits in Japan...|$|R
