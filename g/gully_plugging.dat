40|$|Soil surface {{treatments}} {{consisting of}} <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and contour furrows were constructed {{as a means}} of reducing erosion and holding sediment on site. To measure the effectiveness of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and furrows, angle iron stakes and profile transects were installed to measure soils loss and accompanying change in the soil profile. The profile transects gave a reliable measure of the change in the height of the soil surface in constructed pits and across contour furrows. Because of the shrinking and swelling of the soil, the change in height of the angle iron stakes was found to be much more than the reduction in soil surface caused by erosion. High intensity thunderstorms, occuring mostly during July, August, and September, cause most of the erosion from the semi-arid land. The <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and contour furrows were effective in holding runoff and sediment on site, but the life expectancy of the treatments is only about fifteen years...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{microclimate}} of erosion control treatments {{was carried out in}} two habitat types in a semiarid southeastern Utah, salt desert shrub area. The soils are highly eroded Mancos shale and support a low density of salt desert shrub species which offers little protection against high intensity summer convectional rainstorms. <b>Gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and contour furrows had been installed by the Bureaus of Reclamation and Land Management to prevent runoff of soil laden water which results from these summer rainfalls. Formerly this sediment was carried to the Colorado River and deposited in Lake Powell. The purpose to t he study was to measure some parameters that influenced establishment and survival of seedlings which would stabilize the structures and increase the productivity of the area. Mature, indigenous species close to the structures had greater vigor and provided a larger, more constant seed source. This seed source was important since original seedlings of introduced grasses have failed to establish and stabilize the structures. Following favorable late winter and early spring precipitation, high numbers of seedlings emerged, but few survived into mid-summer. Those that did survive were found only at or near the high water line of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and in the bottom of contour furrows. To aid in the explanation of the differential seedling survival, soil surface moisture following rainstorms, physical and chemical soil characteristics, net radiation, soil surface temperature, and evaporation were investigated. Sampling of the 15 centimeter soil surface in the environs of the structures showed that two days after either heavy or light rainfalls, essentially no available water remained on the sloping throw positions of the structures. The bottom of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> remained flooded for several days. As a result, the seedlings were drowned. Only at the high water line of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and in the bottom of furrows was there enough water to support seedling growth in summer. Runoff water from summer storms carried fine material into the structures, which covered and destroyed seedlings, plus lowered infiltration and permitted much of the water to be lost through evaporation. The runoff water also carried salts brought to the surface by the desert shrubs or by the upward movement of water during evaporation from the soil surface. Sampling of soil in the environs of the structures showed no substantial build up of salt, indicating that leaching had occurred, or still was occurring. This does not mean that a build up will not result in the future. Seasonal salt distribution showed that lowest salinity levels did not always coincide with springtime when seedlings generally emerged. Established seedlings were also exposed to a harsh environment of high soil surface temperatures (over 60 C) and high soil water evaporation rates that were detrimental to their survival. In summary, the study showed that the erosion control structures have created a microenvironment much different from the undisturbed soil, which only permits the establishment of species with much different tolerances from the indigenous species...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{erosion and}} {{environmental}} degradation are serious problems facing food security in Haiti. In 1999, the annual soil loss due to erosion {{was estimated at}} 36 million m 3 tons. The government of Haiti has been aware of these deteriorating conditions and has sought international assistance to reduce these problems. In 1993, the United States Agency for International Development implemented a soil conservation project {{and millions of dollars}} were spent on the encouragement of adoption of soil conservation measures; yet the problems of soil degradation is still menacing food security in Haiti. Hence the need to evaluate the impact of soil conservation in Haiti is important. A survey of 951 farmers, who adopted soil conservation techniques in Haiti, was conducted. The survey participants were composed of 83. 6 % males and 16. 2 % females. About 53. 3 % were illiterate and 42. 9 and 4. 0 % received up to eight years schooling and primary education, respectively. The age group range included 8. 5 % who were less than 30, 30. 8 % who were between 30 and 45 years old and 32. 6 % who were between 45 and 60, and 28. 1 % who were above 60 years old. The results showed that the soil conservation techniques most commonly adopted by farmers were crop bands, alley cropping, rock walls, and <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> Most farmers were satisfied with the soil conservation techniques adopted and they were aware of the benefits of these techniques. There {{was no significant difference in}} income per ha for the soil conservation techniques: alley cropping, rock walls and <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> The net income per ha for crop bands was superior to that of alley cropping, rock walls and <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> All models had a good fit as shown by a relatively high adjusted R 2 and a low mean square error. The model results showed in general the number of plots, the elevation, the number of trees greater than 10 centimeters in circumference, the evaluation of the soil by farmers as fertile and the number of crops unique to the soil conservation technique positively influence the net revenue per ha. The average age of head of household negatively influenced the net income per hectare.

40|$|Abstract The Bosque River Watershed in Texas {{is facing}} a suite of water quality issues {{including}} excess sediment, nutrient, and bacteria. The sources of the pollutants are improperly managed cropland and grazing land, dairy manure application, and effluent discharge from wastewater treatment facilities. Several best management practices (BMPs) have been proposed for pollution reduction and watershed protec-tion. The overall objectives {{of this study were}} to demonstrate a modeling approach using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate various BMPs and assess their long-term impacts on sediment and nutrient loads at different spatial levels. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated for long-term annual and monthly flows at Valley Mills and for monthly sediment, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) at Hico and Valley Mills monitoring locations. The BMPs including streambank stabilization, <b>gully</b> <b>plugs,</b> recharge structures, conservation tillage, terraces, contour farming, manure incorporation, filter strips, and PL- 566 reservoirs were simulated in the watershed areas that met the respective practice’s specific criteria for implementation.

40|$|Watershed {{management}} is an emerging concept for the {{efficient use of}} rain run-off {{in the rural areas}} of India. The approach to watershed {{management is}} participatory in nature, people friendly, location specific, processed based and geared to cater to the problems and needs of the rural communities. Operation of watershed management is ideal where the rainfall pattern is very short, uneven and there is no support of major and minor irrigation systems to enhance agricultural production. The principle of watershed management is the proper management of all the precipitation by way of collection, storage and efficient utilisation of run-off water and use of groundwater. The re-harvesting of run-off in the study area of watershed management is achieved by managing 25 % of the total rainfall and 25 % of the run-off to generate crop-growing area, through four re-harvesting mechanisms such as tanks, farm ponds, contour bunds and structures such as <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and surface detention in depression. Participatory watershed management adopted in the study area promoted agriculture and allied operation and socio-economic development by achieving overall development of the villages...|$|R
30|$|The {{classification}} of landforms {{on the basis}} of hydrogeomorphic characteristics is further validated with the hydrogeochemistry and subsurface geology. Both the studies validate the hydrogeomorphic {{classification of}} landforms studied through field work and remote sensing techniques. The hydrogeochemistry of denudational landforms reveals that the quality of water is good, but replenishment during monsoon is very small. Hence, these landforms have to be preserved from deterioration and are ideal target for artificial recharge for a better tomorrow in Mumbai Island. Continuous contour trenches (CCT), loose boulder structures (<b>gully</b> <b>plugs)</b> are the most suitable structures for hilly area as these structures will function initially as soil conservation structure and subsequently improve the soil moisture retention and also enhance the recharge to groundwater. These structures will also improve sustainability of springs thereby improving water supply scenario in the small hamlets situated in hilly areas. But fluvial landforms have good potential to hold water and the quality of water is usually good. This landform is the feeder for domestic supply of water to {{the majority of the population}} in the city and has to be protected from deterioration. Marine landforms have good storativity, but are frequently invaded by seawater.|$|R

The watershed planning was based on Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and the technologies are being executed for development of watershed in participatory mode through watershed committee. Out of 682. 5 ha watershed area, about 460 ha has been treated with silt retention masonry check dams, water storage check dams, masonry spillways, masonry <b>gully</b> <b>plugs,</b> graded bunds with loose boulder waste weirs, leveling and small farm pond. A total of 538 ha cm surface runoff was harvested by constructing two small farm ponds on community land, and three small earthen and two masonry check dams on private waste lands to recharge ground water/drinking water otherwise going waste. It was observed that silt retention behind stone masonry check dams in upper, middle and lower reaches of the watershed was 59. 6, 16. 7 and 9. 9 t/(ha yr) respectively and 618. 27, 23. 49 and 1, 775. 81 kg of available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were arrested.

40|$|The {{main problem}} of {{agricultural}} {{activities in the}} steep slope upland area if without adequate soil conservation practices {{is that it will}} results in soil erosion. Soil erosion causes agricultural land degradation which reduces the physical, chemical, and biological soil roperties and decreases land productivities. Soil erosion is very harmful to agricultural land productivities, because loss of the fertile topsoil in a relatively short time causes decrease of fertility and productivity of the soils. The role of conservation techniques are the way of soil conservation, which have three principles of definitions, i. e. a) to protect the soil against soil degradation, b) to improve the degraded soil, and c) to make the soil more fertile. Soil conservation practice in the field have used two methods i. e. mechanical conservation methods and vegetative conservation methods. Mechanical conservation method is the earth embankments constructed across the slope to intercept surface run off and to protect soil erosion (soil cultivation along the contour, terraces constructed, contour bank, waterways ditch, drop structure, silt pit, checkdam, <b>gully</b> <b>plug,</b> etc). While the vegetative methode are reducing the kinetic energy of the raindrops on the soil surface, reducing the run off velocity, increasing infiltration rate and reducing soil water contents. The effectiveness of soil conservation techniques in uplands area on the the soil erosion and the land productivity is different in each location. This is because of the difference of the land capability (site specific, soil behavior and properties, and the climate).

40|$|The University of Windsor and BAIF Development Research Foundation {{worked with}} the tribal and rural people of Akole Taluka to design a {{strategy}} for access to a year-round water supply. Three villages, comprising 494 households, were selected as partners. Participatory management and evaluation were essential components of the project. Water-harvesting and-spreading technologies {{were put in place}} at demonstration sites over an area of 1, 000 ha. Fourteen masonry check-dams and 3 ferrocement gabions provided about 73, 000 cu m of water for the partner villages and outlying areas. Twenty-six households utilized roofwater-harvesting systems. Up to 20 percent of households took water from six developed springs. Several dug wells were deepened and existing bore wells received workovers. The increase in water availability during the pre-monsoon period was about 750 l/d per capita. Runoff was diverted into shallow aquifers, by means of expanded terracing of hillsides, combined with systems of contour trenches and soil bunds, as well as 19 farm ponds. Infiltration pits were excavated, most notably on unterraced hillslopes. Soil conservation in support of water-resource management involved the use of 75 gabions, 75 drystone bunds and 6, 550 <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> These measures averted erosion losses of up to 150 tonnes of soil per hectare. Grasses, such as vetiver, also were used as barriers across some slopes. Productive, multipurpose tree species and shrubs were planted on agricultural lands, along selected soil bunds. Areas of wasteland were converted to pasture. The demonstration sites satisfied the domestic water needs of the people. The increased soil moisture brought improvements to agricultural production. The project results are sustainable. The lessons learned were incorporated into workshops on watershed management for BAIF personnel, working in other parts of India...|$|R

40|$|The Bosque River Watershed {{is located}} in the Brazos River Basin in central Texas and is facing a suite of water quality issues {{resulting}} in sediment, nutrient and bacteria loading. These loadings are potentially derived from improperly managed cropland and grazing land, land-applied dairy waste, and effluent discharge from eight wastewater treatment plants. The first phase of the project developed an effective methodology for determining priority areas in the watershed where best management practice (BMP) implementation would likely yield the greatest improvements in water quality. The objectives of this project (Phase II) are to apply the Soil and Watershed Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate and evaluate the impacts of implementing several best management practices (a) in the entire watershed, and (b) at incremental levels in high, medium, and low priority areas of the watershed, identified using three different impact indices. Initially, the SWAT model was calibrated for long-term annual and monthly flow at a USGS gaging station located in the lower portion of the watershed for the period from 1980 through 2005 and was validated at the same location for the period 1960 through 1979. The model was also calibrated, at a monthly time step, for water quality parameters including sediment, organic and mineral nitrogen, and phosphorus at two locations, Hico and Valley Mills. Model performance statistics (coefficient of determination and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency) indicated that model performance was satisfactory and could be used for evaluating the impacts of alternative management scenarios to reduce nonpoint source pollution. BMPs including streambank stabilization, <b>gully</b> <b>plugs,</b> recharge structures, conservation tillage, terraces, contour farming, grazing management, manure incorporation, edge-of-field filter strips, and PL- 566 reservoirs were simulated as being implemented in the watershed areas that met the respective practice?s specific criteria for implementation. These BMPs were simulated individually and the resulting farm level (HRU level), subwatershed level, and watershed outlet level impacts were quantified for each BMP. Reductions in sediment load at the watershed outlet, as a result of implementing these BMPs individually, was as much as 37 percent while reductions in total nitrogen (TN) ranged from 1 percent to 24 percent and total phosphorus (TP) varied from a 3 percent increase to a 30 percent decrease. The 3 percent increase is indicative of conservation tillage and is likely caused by the lack of soil inversion and mixing, which yields an accumulation of dissolved (mineral) phosphorus in the soil?s surface layer. At subwatershed levels, reductions brought about by implementing the BMPs were relatively greater as compared to the watershed outlet reductions. Reductions in sediment were as high as 47 percent and reductions in TN and TP were 37 percent and 32 percent, respectively. Subwatersheds were categorized into ?high,? ?medium,? and ?low? priority based on calibrated simulation results. Considering sediment, TN, and TP (as pollutants), three types of total impact indices were estimated. The ?Concentration Impact Index? is based on pollutant concentrations (SWAT output values extracted from the ?reach output file?), considers contributions from the subwatershed as well as the entire upstream watershed, and is effective in determining priority areas for addressing localized pollution problems in low and high flow conditions. The ?Load Per Unit Area Impact Index? is based on the total pollutant load coming from a specific area (SWAT output values extracted from the ?subbasin output file?), considers contributions from an individual subwatershed, and is used to effectively assign a priority to each subwatershed. The ?Load Impact Index? is based on pollutant loads from subwatersheds and upstream areas (SWAT output values extracted from the ?reach output file?) and portrays the cumulative effects of pollutant loading throughout the entire watershed. Priority areas in the watershed varied based on which impact index was used in the evaluation; therefore, the areas where BMP implementations were evaluated differed between simulations. Despite varying BMP implementation sites, all BMPs were modeled incrementally, first on high priority subwatersheds followed by medium and low priority subwatersheds. BMPs considered for implementing in prioritized subwatersheds included streambank stabilization, recharge structures, conservation tillage, terracing, grazing management, and manure incorporation. When comparing the reductions achieved from implementation of BMPs using the three impact indices, load per unit area criteria typically yielded higher pollutant reductions. This outcome is likely a result of the majority of BMPs simulated in this study addressing upland pollutant reductions rather than in-stream reductions. Therefore, these BMPs resulted in larger pollutant reductions because they targeted local upland areas that typically generate higher pollutant loads. Implementing these BMPs in the entire watersheds resulted in sediment, TN, and TP load reductions of 73 percent, 43 percent, and 68 percent, respectively...|$|R
