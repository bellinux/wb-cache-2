The {{tradition of}} Baghbheta has disappeared gradually, so has the Forest. Also the number of tiger has declined incredibly. Killing a tiger has become illegal. But {{there used to be}} terror of tiger and other wild animals in Jamugurihat and the other places to the east of river Jia-Bharali. <b>Folks</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> started facing this challenge very strongly and started coming out voluntarily to kill and drive away tigers from their habitat places. This purpose helped the citizens of the eastern parts of river Jia Bharali to come united and it soon embodied to be a festival in those places. In those days it was not a crime to kill a tiger.To catch tigers, people from those villages used to prepare jute rope. In case a tiger is traced the village messenger would spread the news to all the villages in the locality. People were swift enough to come out spontaneously with nets and other instruments to catch a tiger.|$|E

40|$|LaTeX is a {{beautiful}} programming language. One sometimes wants to write in an easy and quick way various documents, such as letters, papers, reports, theses, and so on. Here, “one” can be a new student, an old professor, or even somebody who is not linked at all with any academic stuff. We often want special constructs in our documents. This is more difficult than basic typesetting, especially using LaTeX when you are not experienced. On one hand, scientists do not always {{have the time to}} learn another programming language, especially if they are making a PhD, or doing something else which asks for a lot of time. Using direct and working programming tricks can speed up your productivity, and make you learning better. But where can they be found? On the other hand, everybody wants to make nice documents, if possible. A nicer document attracts the reader. Evidently, “a nice document” is a subjective notion. By “nice document,” we want to speak about a document which 1. is structured in an unambiguous way, and has a clear presentation, 2. is read with pleasure, if possible. The beginner, whoever he is, often faces strange errors because he tries to teach LaTeX to do what he wants it to do. It is difficult to learn the advanced notions about LaTeX, even in an average period of time. The good books have to be found. But that is often the moment where you lack of time and that you are happy to find complete solutions. That is a moment where you tell to yourself “Is <b>there</b> no <b>folk</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to give me such a trivial tip?” but nobody hears it. The aim of this book, is to avoid you these problems: you do not need to write everything from scratch, ask on various forums or Usenet groups, or even read heaps of books just to make a simple script. That is my goal. You can now continue writing your document in LaTeX’s philosophy: concentrating on your document’s content, at the place of its appearence. These reasons justify the presence of this book. I have tried to pack the most useful tricks which can enhance your documents’ content in a concise way. The aim is not to teach LaTeX programming, but to give a quick reference to all the tips and tricks that can be used if you are encountering a (difficult) problem, or simply facing a question which you cannot find the answer to. I consider that the reader is familiar with basic LATEX programming. It can be learnt from various sources (given in this book's bibliography), and many others. I hope this will give you new ideas about advanced ways to typeset text and to make different processes automatic, thus giving you more time for other activities.

5000|$|After the series' cancellation, the Speedball {{character}} primarily {{appeared in}} New Warriors and its related comics, written primarily by Fabian Nicieza.

During his run on New Warriors, Fabian Nicieza commented, I hope everyone has realized that I love Speedball. He's one of the few spandex <b>folks</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that really enjoys what he's doing. Through Speedball, I get to make pointed comments and references to what's going on around him, which is great fun, using his cockiness and his arrogance, but playing on his insecurity at the same time.

5000|$|This {{second book}} in the series premiered in September 2009 at the Washington Visitor Center, hosted by the author and his wife. [...] The film uses words of Samuel Adams, John Adams, Patrick Henry, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to support its argument. It explores “the role of {{religion}} in early States of America and the belief that ‘our Creator’ is the source of our liberty, prosperity, and survival as an exceptional nation. From the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown in 1607, through the American Revolution, {{to the end of the}} Civil War in 1865, this film tells the story of the deep faith that motivated and sustained our great leaders, and dramatically presents our nation’s belief in religious freedom.” In contrast to the first film, they are careful to talk about religion in general rather than privileging one faith. [...] David Bossie of Citizens United called the film [...] "a record correction, if you will, to the political correct <b>folks</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who want to eliminate God from America" ...|$|E
5000|$|A silent film {{produced}} by Paramount Pictures, The Covered Wagon (1923), was partly filmed on Antelope Island where a scene requiring a buffalo hunt and a buffalo stampede were needed. At the time, the bison herd on Antelope Island was possibly the largest herd of bison in the US. After much effort, about 350 {{of the animals}} were herded into a stampede which was then filmed {{under the direction of}} James Cruze. The movie is considered by some people to be the first great [...] "Western Epic" [...] and it established some of the clichés that persist in 'Western' movies, such as circling the wagons in time of danger or attacks. During the movie, seven buffalo were shot and killed for the hunting scenes. [...] "Don't grow sentimental over the seven," [...] said Cruze, the director of the film. [...] "The <b>folks</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> would like {{to get rid of the}} whole herd and they would, but for the sentimental hubbub that is always raised when they talk of rounding out the buffalo. The animals are worthless- there isn't worse meat on earth to eat - and they ruin the whole territory for cattle grazing purposes. So the buffalo remain - sentimental reminders of the America of the past." ...|$|E
