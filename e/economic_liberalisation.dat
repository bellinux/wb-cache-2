5|$|The BJP's {{economic}} policy has changed considerably since its founding. There {{is a significant}} range of economic ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist export policy. However, it supported internal <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisation,</b> and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} development in India followed socialist-inspired politicians {{for most of its}} independent history, including state-ownership of many sectors; India's per capita income increased at only around 1% annualised rate in the three decades after its independence.

40|$|Despite {{over three}} decades of Liberalisation {{policies}} in Africa, income-inequality has stayed persistently high. Using updated panel data of 26 African countries spanning the period 1996 - 2010, this study examines the effect of liberalisation policies with particular focus on financial, trade, institutional, political and <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisations</b> on income-inequality. We find: that financial liberalisation has a levitated income-redistributive effect with {{the magnitude of the}} de jure measure (KAOPEN) higher than that of the de facto measure (FDI); that exports, trade and ‘freedom to trade’ have an equality incidence on income-distribution; and that institutional and political liberalisation has a negative impact and we also find that, economic freedom has a negative income-redistributive effect possibly because of the weight of its legal component. The impact of these policies implications are discussed in detail in this study. ...|$|R

He also set up five other special economic zones. During the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring, including a cut in its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December 2014, Modi {{announced}} that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was {{a legacy of the}} Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisation</b> of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.|$|E
50|$|The state's {{economic}} recovery gathered momentum after <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisations</b> {{were introduced in}} the mid-1990s by the central government.

Although the state's GDP has risen significantly since the 1990s, West Bengal's economy has remained affected by political instability and bad governance. The state continues to suffer from regular bandhs (strikes), substandard healthcare services, a lack of socio-economic development, poor infrastructure, political corruption, unemployment, poor educational facilities, and civil violence.|$|R

5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisation</b> supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E

40|$|India has {{experienced}} transformation from {{the regime of}} regulated economic development to competitive regime since the liberalisations of 1991. The main thrust of these liberalisations has been on industrial delicensing and openness, that is, import liberalisation and removing barriers to exports for accelerating growth. In this paper, an attempt {{has been made to}} analyze the effect of <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisations</b> on pattern of sources of growth of output of Indian manufacturing industry from a demand side perspective. The analysis has been based on Chenery’s factor decomposition approach based on input-output framework. It decomposes output growth into its four sources: domestic demand expansion, export expansion, import substitution and intermediate demand expansion due to change in input-output coefficient. The basic data used for this study has been the input-output tables for 1983 - 84, 1989 - 90 and 1997 - 98. The analysis has been done separately for the pre-liberalisation period, 1983 - 84 to 1989 - 90, and the post-liberalisation period, 1989 - 90 to 1997 - 98, to examine the changing pattern in the sources of growth of output as a result of policy liberalisation and structural reform...|$|R

The growth rate for the economy has been abysmal. Key sectors like agriculture in many parts still suffer from inefficiency and lack of technology.

25|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisation</b> in India {{refers to}} the <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisation,</b> {{initiated}} in 1991, of the country's economic policies, {{with the goal of}} making the economy more market and service-oriented and expanding the role of private and foreign investment. Specific changes include a reduction in import tariffs, deregulation of markets, reduction of taxes, and greater foreign investment. Liberalisation has been credited by its proponents for the high economic growth recorded by the country in the 1990s and 2000s. Its opponents have blamed it for increased poverty, inequality and economic degradation. The overall direction of liberalisation has since remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet solved a variety of politically difficult issues, such as liberalising labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. There exists a lively debate in India as to what made the economic reforms sustainable.|$|E

25|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{of economy}} {{was intended to}} end the government subsidiaries and to reduce {{the role of the}} government in national economy. Successful attempts were carried out by Sharif to expand the role of the private sector, and to redress the imbalances in social services. From 1990 to 1993, the private and foreign investments were greatly relaxed. This was followed by the liberalisation of the foreign exchange which was readily free, and at the same time, the interest rates were substantially liberalised, credit subsidies were cut, and energy prices were moved much closer to costs. The <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisation</b> and structural reform measures were necessary and had been overdue at that time. However, instead of being pursued with even greater vigor and effectiveness, the liberalisation programme could not substitute for adequate stabilization efforts and macroeconomic stability. By the end of 1993 which was the year of ousting the government of Nawaz Sharif, the benefits from <b>economic</b> <b>liberalisation</b> were seriously limited in the absence of reduction of effective macroeconomic policies. As it grappled with the ongoing foreign exchange crisis in early 1993–97, Pakistan’s most urgent economic need was to raise both national savings and exports.|$|E
