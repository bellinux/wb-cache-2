50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|E
40|$|Peripheral milling is a {{metal cutting}} {{operation}} {{in which the}} cutter produces a machined surface parallel to the axis of rotation of cutting. This is approached either by upmilling or downmilling methods. The fundamental difference among these modes of milling shows a marked variation in the magnitude of cutting forces during the process, chip formation {{and the quality of}} metal cutting. This work examines the difference brought out on the resultant component/part in terms of surface finish and hardness on aircraft grade precipitation hardenable Aluminum 2124 T 851 alloy. Other cutting parameters like feeedrate, depth of cut, spindle speed, tool over hang length, tool diameter, number of flutes etc., are maintained identical on both types of milling. This study is examined on finishing operation of Aluminum plates of different aspect ratio in attaining a defined thickness on all the specimens. Metal cutting is carried using three different types of cutters for both upmilling and <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> strategies. The surface texture, surface finish and hardness are evaluated and the results are presented. The results indicate that hardness values are relatively high in <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> strategy for the same machining variables as against the case of upmilling and the surface roughness is higher in case of <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> compared to upmilling operations...|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper In this study, {{the effects}} of cutting speed, milling direction (<b>down</b> <b>milling,</b> up milling), coating layer (TiAlN and TiAlN-TiN) {{and the number of}} inserts of tool holder on the surface roughness and tool life in dry milling of Inconel 718 superalloy were investigated. In the first place, {{the effects of}} control factors on the tool life were studied at the cutting speeds of v = 50 m/min and v = 100 m/min. The alternation of flank wear depending on the cutting time was examined. The types of wear and wear mechanisms were determined by examining the optical images of worn tools. In {{the second part of the}} study, for the purpose of investigating the effects of control factors on the surface roughness, L 16 Taguchi Technique was used and the optimal control factor levels, giving the lowest value of the average surface roughness parameter (Ra) were determined. The effect of cutting speed on the tool life was more than the effects of the milling type and number of inserts. <b>Down</b> <b>milling</b> resulted in longer tool life compared to up milling method. In up milling, longer tool life was obtained with 2 inserts at low cutting speeds and with 4 inserts at high cutting speeds. TiAlN-TiN coated tools exhibited twice as long tool life than the TiAlN coated tools. For both milling methods, the most effective wear types were flank wear and nose wear...|$|E

However, in processing anisotropic materials such as wood, these geometrical aspects imply relevant differences when machining.

In this paper, tests performed when processing Douglas Fir with different depths of cut and grain orientations are described. The cutting forces were measured, and the dependence of the cutting forces with respect on the cutting geometry are analysed and discussed...|$|E

This paper presents an experimental study of the tool wear propagation and cutting force variations in the end milling of Inconel 718 with coated carbide inserts.

In this paper, research efforts are focused on the dynamic behavior of milling processes under different cutting condition parameters such as different radial immersions, feed directions, feeds per tooth and helix angles. To improve the prediction accuracy of stability lobe, the combined influences of feed rate and cutter runout on the stability lobes are also taken into account. The basic principle of the method presented in one existing work is applied to examine the asymptotic stability trends for both <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> and up milling. Some new phenomena for certain combinations of cutting parameters are shown and explained in detail.

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{discussing}} chatter characteristics {{performed by}} a one-dimensional milling system having positive process stiffness and negative process stiffness. In this study, a dynamic model of the milling system is established first. An analytical form showing the critical chatter conditions including axial depth of cut, chatter frequency, critical spindle speed, etc. is formed. The analysis of process function shows that positive process stiffness occurs under most cutting conditions. However, process stiffness becomes negative when a one-dimensional milling system carries out low radial depth of cut {{in the direction of}} the feed (<b>down</b> <b>milling)</b> or semi-groove milling in the direction against the feed (up milling). Further analysis is made to explore chatter characteristics performed by the milling systems with positive process stiffness and negative process stiffness respectively. Finally, the prediction equation calculating critical chatter conditions of these two types of milling system, the range of rotation speed with high cutting stability and the range of rotation speed with low cutting stability is proposed...|$|E

The experimental activity consisted of micromilling tests, conducted on presintered and green materials, by means of a dedicated micromill. As output variables, part surface quality was analyzed in terms of surface roughness and surface damage. Results show that the most affecting factors on the part surface quality are material conditions (green or presintered) and milling approach (up milling or <b>down</b> <b>milling).</b> Parameters traditionally affecting surface quality, such as cutting speed and feed, are in this case less influent than expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of coated tool wear mechanisms in milling is central for explaining the film failure and selecting the appropriate cutting strategy and conditions. The described tool wear investigations in up and <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> {{were carried out}} for various cutting conditions, by coated cemented carbide inserts fixed on tool holders of different diameters. The variable stress, strain and strain rate fields developed in the tool during cutting, affect the filmsubstrate deformation {{and in this way}} the resulting coating's loads and its fatigue failure. The effective tool life, up to a certain flank wear width was experimentally determined and correlated to the cutting edge entry impact duration (CEEID) into the workpiece material. Using a commercial CAD/CAM system, the geometry of the chip and of the contact between the cutting edge and workpiece was calculated in various milling cases and the corresponding tool wear evolution predicted. The latter converges with CEEID and with the associated film fatigue critical force, affected by the coating strain rate...|$|E

40|$|As a metal {{machining}} process, {{end milling}} {{is the most}} widely used processes in industry. One of the most important indicators of success in finishing operation is the estetic quality of the surface that is directly connected to the maximal height of uneven surfaces, namely rougness. In process of milling the quality of the machined surface depends of many factors, for example, tool geometry, cutter parallel axis offset and cutter axis tilt, tool deflection due to cutting forces, tool and work piece vibrations etc. This paper presents the development of mathematical model for the determination {{of the quality of the}} machined surface topography. The model starts from an ideal trochoid point trajectory on the cutting edge tooth end mill, and then inserts the deviations due to cutter parallel axis offset and cutter axis tilt and gives instructions for the input of other factors that influence on the machined surface quality.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{conventional}} drilling process and a circular milling process are compared {{with respect to}} delamination and fiber protrusion when machining carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). The tool design (tool orthogonal clearance, drill-point angle) and the parameters (feed rate, cutting speed) are varied when drilling. The axial feed force and the spiral angles of the cutting edges can cause damages to the CFRP when circular milling. In this study, the possibilities to reduce those errors by the application of end mills with no spiral {{angle at the circumference}} cutter and no feed in axial direction are investigated. This milling process requires pre-drilled holes, and the final rivet hole dimension is then machined by circled movements without any motion in axial direction. For this special circular milling process, the tool design (rake angle of the circumference cutters) as well as the setting parameters (depth of cut, feed rate, cutting speed, up and <b>down</b> <b>milling)</b> are varied. The machining quality of both processes is compared. This is done by measuring the delaminations using an optical microscope.

40|$|The {{machining}} parameters affect {{surface quality}} and usually, wood planing process is {{heavily influenced by}} external parameters. External parameters concern mainly the machining process parameters such as: the feeding speed, the depth of cut, the cutting tool diameter and geometry, the cutting geometry, the cutting technique (up or <b>down</b> <b>milling).</b> This study was carried out to determine the planing properties of naturally grown Melunak (Pentace sp.), Dark Red Meranti (Shorea sp.) and Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis). Some machining defects such as fuzzy grain, torn grain and chip marks often occur in lumbers at the planing process and it decreases the machining yield. To understand and optimize the planing characteristics of this wood species, a series of experiments were carried out using a weinig Unimate 23 E moulder (cutter-head rpm of 6000, cutter diameter 120 mm) to produce machined surface with differing depth of cut ranging from 0. 8 to 2. 4 mm, by altering the feed rate from 8 to 16 m min - 1 according to ASTM D 1666 - 87. Based on the preliminary results of this study, the best results were obtained at 0. 8 mm of depth of cut and feed rate of 8 m min - 1 for Dark Red Meranti. While, the poorest results was on Melunak wood at 2. 4 mm of depth of cut and 16 m min - 1 of feed speed.

40|$|Abstract. Titanium alloys are {{attractive}} materials for aerospace industry {{due to their}} exceptional strength to weight ratio that is maintained at elevated temperatures and their good corrosion resistance. Major applications of Titanium alloys were military aerospace industry, but since last decade the trend has now shifted towards commercial industry. On the other hand Titanium alloys are notorious for being poor thermal conductor that leads to them being difficult materials for machining. In this experimental study brazed carbide end mill of grade 5 is used for rough <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> of Ti 6 Al 4 V for large depth of cut under different combinations of parameters and application of high pressure coolant. The machining performance was evaluated in terms of tool wear, tool life, thermal crack and tool breaking. The tool wear was mostly observed at the tool tip and at bottom part of tool thermal cracks were observed which propagated with respect to time. Flank wear due to scratching of the cutting chips and diffusion wear because of high thermal stresses were observed specially {{at the bottom of}} the cutting tool. At cutting speed of 38 m/min tool wear couldn’t be observed due to tool failure because of fracture under high thermal stresses. It was found that maximum tool life is obtained at the speed of 25 m/min, feed rate of 150 mm/min and depth of cut of 10 mm. In the end it was concluded that machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V is a thermally dominant process which leads to high thermal stresses in machining zone that results in increasing tool wear rate and fracture propagation...|$|E
