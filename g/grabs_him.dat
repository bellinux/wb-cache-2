25|$|The kids finally {{reveal to}} Bethany {{the events that}} are taking place. Ricky then breaks up with Bethany because she always talks about {{feelings}} and family and leaves. The five of them rescue Jake, but Skip succeeds in using the enlarging machine, growing to 30 feet tall, and calls the Zirkonian invasion ships. They defeat him and shrink him again. Tazer and Razor flee, while Skip is shrunk to a tiny size by the machine. Sparks calls off the invasion and returns home. The rest of the vacation goes back to normal, except the kids grew closer to each other during their adventure. In the distance, Skip appears, bent on revenge, but meets his demise when a crow flies over and <b>grabs</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stan later flirts with Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), {{and offers}} her a loan when he learns {{that she is}} {{struggling}} for money. When Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) suffers an epileptic fit, Stan and Shirley unite to help her and successfully deal with the issue. Wanting to reconcile with Shirley further, Stan calls Dean to The Vic. However, the reunion does not go well and Mick ends up punching Dean when he turns nasty with Shirley. Shirley blames Stan for the situation and threatens to throw him out, but he tells her if she does that he will reveal that it was her, not Shirley's mother Sylvie, that tried to drown Mick when he was very young. When the Carters decide to re-paint the exterior of The Vic, Tina tells Mick that she can remember when they were decorating and when Mick nearly drowned in a bath, and that their mother Sylvie was not present. Mick believes that Stan was the culprit who tried to drown him, and orders him to leave The Vic immediately. Mick later violently <b>grabs</b> <b>him</b> and taunts him with drowning in the bath, although Shirley stops with the truth. Stan helps Linda allow her son, Johnny (Sam Strike), some independence after he reveals he is gay. Stan grows closer to Cora when he holds her a late birthday celebration as everyone forgets the date. He refuses to believe Mick is guilty of soliciting a prostitute when he arrested for the crime, despite his plea in court. Cora reveals the offence to the whole pub, and distances herself from Stan. He is suspicious and realises when speaking to Cora's granddaughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) that Cora knows the prostitute involved. Cora apologises to the Carters when her daughter Rainie (Tanya Franks), the prostitute, confesses that she lied about Mick.|$|E

After Logan kills Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan {{in the head with}} adamantium bullets, {{rendering}} Logan unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she <b>grabs</b> <b>him</b> and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed. Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He notices his dog tags read [...] "Logan" [...] on one side and [...] "Wolverine" [...] on the other.

500|$|For combat, in {{addition}} to using his fists (the first Silent Hill game where unarmed combat is possible), Travis accumulates a range of weapons throughout the town: firearms, melee weapons, and one-shot items usable in close combat; the latter two are breakable. Although one-shot items {{can be used to}} quickly kill some of the monsters encountered early on, Travis is vulnerable while performing this action to damage from quick enemies or those with long-ranged attacks. Origins also introduces the [...] "grapple" [...] system, a quick time event activated when a monster <b>grabs</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Should he escape, no damage is done to either him or the monster. The status of his [...] "health" [...] is indicated in the inventory, since the game does not feature a heads-up display; however, when his health is critical, the edges of the screen throb red, and his heartbeat is heard.|$|E
500|$|At the pentagram's {{center is}} an old cowboy cemetery, which Azazel forces Jake to go to by {{threatening}} his family. The Winchesters, Bobby, and Ellen are there to meet him, but Jake, having given in to his demonic side, develops mind-control abilities and orders Ellen to put her gun to her head. Everyone is forced to lower their weapons, giving Jake time to use the Colt {{as a key to}} open a mausoleum. However, Sam then shoots Jake in the back, and finishes him off with multiple shots as he begs for mercy. As the mausoleum doors begin to open, they realize that it is a Devil's Gate—a doorway to Hell. A rush of demons then escape and break the iron railway lines of the devil's trap, allowing Azazel to enter. As Ellen and Bobby try to close the gateway, Sam and Dean take the Colt to confront Azazel. Unfortunately, the demon catches them by surprise and takes the gun. After taunting Dean about his demonic pact and questioning if what came back was [...] "one hundred percent pure Sam", Azazel prepares to kill them. To his surprise, the escaped spirit of John Winchester (Morgan) <b>grabs</b> <b>him,</b> distracting him long enough for Dean to take back the Colt and shoot him in the heart, finally killing him. As Bobby and Ellen manage to close the gates, John's spirit moves on. Knowing that they now have to face an army of demons, Sam promises to try to free Dean from his deal.|$|E

[...] / A hand {{promptly}} <b>grabs</b> <b>him</b> by the shoulder – a policeman is standing right behind him! / [...] "Your papers!" [...] he barks. The hapless person surrenders his official papers. / The policeman opens them, reads, and nods to his partner: [...] "Write him a citation for slandering the Soviet Militsiya, Vasya". (A version of this joke involves a third policeman whose sole job is in turn to watch over these two dangerously literate intellectuals.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he is now}} on {{a closer}} social {{standing}} to Blackadder than before, he still receives the same (and possibly more) level of abuse as his Elizabethan ancestor. Blackadder punches him; kicks him; breaks a milk-jug over his head; smashes a huge turnip on his head; roasts {{him for a few}} minutes on a spit; <b>grabs</b> <b>him</b> by the shirt collar; threatens to cut him up into strips and tell the prince that he [...] "walked over a very sharp cattle grid in an extremely heavy hat"; and promises five minutes of hellish tortures involving a small pencil, surpassing anything possible from Beelzebub over all eternity. However, he does seem to have a higher level of friendship with Blackadder than the other series.|$|E
2500|$|Tom, Hal, Karen, Dai and Mike go to find Ben. Tom and Mike {{hide behind}} rubble. Mike sees {{his son and}} runs toward him, despite {{the danger of the}} Mechs and Skitters. Mike grabs his son and Tom destroys a Mech. Another Mech, however, blows up a car, which knocks Tom out. Dai <b>grabs</b> <b>him</b> and takes him in their vehicle, leaving Hal and Karen behind. Later, in a dark alley, Tom wakes up with Dai, Mike and his son. Dai tells Tom that Hal and Karen were left behind. Tom goes to find them and is {{attacked}} by a Skitter, but Tom shoots two of its legs off with a shotgun and beats it half-to-death. Tom returns to the school with the Skitter and deems it a [...] "Prisoner of War".|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a phone call}} from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, <b>grabs</b> <b>him,</b> and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami. She goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a [...] "monster", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood. Realizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him. Yutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night. Yutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho. However, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance. Though Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyway and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho. [...] It is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat. At the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow. Seeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process. Yuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka. Miho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and {{make their way to the}} local bath house. Just before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand. The pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.|$|E

2500|$|Bella awakens {{from her}} {{transformation}} from human to vampire, {{aware of her}} new abilities, but unaware of changes within the coven, such as Jacob having imprinted on her child, Renesmee. While inside the house, the Cullens and Jacob are standing around Renesmee, when Bella approaches. Jacob grows fearful and attempts to grab Renesmee. Bella is extremely suspicious of Jacob's odd possessiveness of Renesmee. Jacob tells Bella of {{the one thing that}} neither he nor his pack has control and says [...] "it's a Wolf thing." [...] Bella becomes extremely agitated and tells Edward to take the child out of the room. Bella then grabs Jacob by {{the back of his neck}} and drags him outside. She throws him into the field and a heated conversation starts. Bella demands that Jacob stays away from Renesmee. Jacob says [...] "You know I can't do that." [...] Bella then punches him near a patch of trees. This move triggers the appearance of the Clearwaters, Seth and Leah both in wolf form. Jacob tells them that everything is fine. Jacob reminds Bella of the times they had in the past and asks her if she rejects to which she does. Jacob claims that there was a major reason why he imprinted on their child, because he and Renesmee were meant to be together but accidentally called Renesmee [...] "Nessie". This angers her even more when she notices that he nicknamed her after the [...] "Loch Ness Monster". When Bella attempts to attack Jacob again, Seth Clearwater lunges at her. She <b>grabs</b> <b>him</b> and throws him into a tree, slightly injuring him, as his wolf form absorbed most of the impact. Bella apologizes to Seth for injuring him. Jacob then rushes to check on him. It also appears that Bella's father, Charlie, has been attempting to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's illness. They intend to tell him she didn't survive, which requires that they move away from Forks, Washington to protect their identities. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, tells Charlie that Bella is in fact alive and well. He explains that Bella had to change in order to survive. Charlie, now confused about his daughter, wonders why she had to change. Jacob morphs into a wolf, revealing his tribe's shape-shifting power, but does not tell Charlie about vampires as this would put him in danger and become a target for the Volturi or Charlie might spread word across Forks.|$|E
