40|$|The Netherlands is an {{important}} producer of eggs and egg products. Outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI), especially when a high pathogenic virus is detected, can result in massive destruction of poultry and large economic losses. Free range poultry farms have a 11 fold chance of getting an AI infection, compared to poultry farms without an outdoor area. In the light of an ongoing project, which aims to attract more poultry to the outdoor area through the planting of biomass crop (willow and miscanthus) or fruit trees, it was questioned to what extent this vegetation would attract (extra) wild birds and whether this would {{increase the risk of}} AI virus infection compared to poultry farms with an outdoor area (free range poultry farms). This literature study aimed to find an answer to this question. From large scale studies, in which thousands of wild birds belonging to many bird species were tested <b>for</b> <b>AI</b> <b>viruses,</b> a list of risk species was made by Veen et al. (2007). This list included several bird species (mostly water birds or shore birds) that were classified as high risk species (HRS), due to the prevalence of HPAI H 5 N 1 (a highly virulent virus subtype) detected in individuals of these species. Selection of the other risk species was mainly based on their potential to act as bridge species between these water birds and poultry farms; their gregariousness; colonial breeding; predatory and/or scavenging behaviour. Former studies on bird abundance at willow coppice; orchards and mis-canthus were reviewed, specifically with regard to the birds listed as risk species. Comparison with the bird abundance found on or near free range poultry farms showed that most of the HRS seen on or near these poultry farms were absent at the miscanthus and willow plantations. In addition, willow coppice and miscanthus held distinctively less other risk species compared to free range poultry farms. The amount of HRS and other risk species at orchards varied depending on the presence of ditches and windbreaks. It was suggested that region; surrounding environment; design of the plantation and other management factors (such as weed control) might also have contributed to differences in bird density and/or species diversity between willow coppice and miscanthus studies. In addition, there was indication that the presence of a poultry farm might influence the species diversity of the surrounding fields. From the results of the comparative analyses, it was concluded that there was a strong indication that cultivation of the outside enclosure on free range poultry farms with willow coppice; orchards or miscanthus might decrease the risk of AI infection. It was further estimated that the overall risk of initial AI infection would be very low and fairly equal for all three vegetation types, with miscanthus estimated as having the lowest risk and orchards as having the highest risk of all three vegetation types. However, it was emphasized that this risk can be highly influenced by co-factors, such as the presence of open patches; wind breaks; water bird areas and weediness. Based on the risk analyses and the fast growing character of miscanthus, and hence their supposedly quick impact on the bird abundance of the plantation, it was indicated that miscanthus might be the best plant species of all three vegetation types...|$|E

Ten duck eggs were collected every month from 10 randomly selected markets in Hanoi from April 2010 to March 2012. The HI test was performed using low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses (H 3, H 4, H 6, H 7, H 9, and H 11 subtypes) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (H 5 N 1 clade 2. 3. 4 and 2. 3. 2. 1) as antigens. HI testing for H 3, H 6, and H 9 was 29 % positive in November 2010, 50 % positive in October and November 2010, and 12 % positive in June 2011.

Procedures: Cloacal, oropharyngeal and faecal (environmental) swabs were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) <b>for</b> the <b>AI</b> type A matrix gene. Positive samples underwent virus culture and subtyping. Serum samples were analysed using a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for influenza A virus nucleoprotein. Results: No highly pathogenic <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> were identified. However, 164 PCR tests were positive <b>for</b> the <b>AI</b> type A matrix gene, 46 of which were identified to subtype. A total of five viruses were isolated, three of which had a corresponding positive PCR and subtype identification (H 3 N 8, H 4 N 6, H 7 N 6).

A diagnostic network for the Caribbean, including technology transfer and <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> molecular diagnostic capability in Guadeloupe (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction <b>for</b> the <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> matrix gene), was developed. Between 2006 and 2009, 627 samples from four Caribbean countries were tested for three circumstances: importation purposes, following a clinical suspicion of AI, or through an active survey of wild birds (mainly waders) during the southward and northward migration periods in Guadeloupe. None of the samples tested were positive, suggesting a limited role of these species in the <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> ecology in the Caribbean. Following low pathogenic H 5 N 2 outbreaks in the Dominican Republic in 2007, a questionnaire was developed to collect data for a risk analysis of AI spread in the region through fighting cocks. The infection pathway of the Martinique commercial poultry sector by AI, through introduction of infected cocks, was designed, and recommendations were provided to the Caribbean Veterinary Services to improve cock movement control and biosecurity measures.

40|$|Purpose - Avian {{influenza}} (AI) {{has prompted}} widespread poultry culls and retail changes. Traditional live poultry sales can increase risk <b>for</b> <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> transmission. Attitudes and risk perceptions regarding these sales influence policy. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to report Hong Kong risk perceptions and attitudes regarding live poultry sales and central slaughtering illustrating population reactions to inform policy. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 25 healthy Hong Kong adults completed grounded theory qualitative interviews regarding perceptions of live chicken sales and acceptability of central slaughtering. Taped interviews were transcribed and translated in to English and coded in parallel by the authors working independently, using grounded theory approaches. Findings - The paper finds that hygiene efforts reflected confusion between bacterial contamination and influenza. Hand-transmission was not recognized as a transmission pathway. Opposition to central slaughtering was based on concerns about loss of freshness, flavor, traditions and employment, and meat safety. However, opponents supported policy if it reduced infectious disease risk. Supporters emphasized improved food hygiene. There was considerable scope for further educational efforts. Opposition focused on losses rather than gains, consistent with theory. Supporters emphasized health benefits. AI transmission routes were confused, indicating need for clearer information about personal protective practices. Research limitations/ implications - The paper is a qualitative report and awaits confirmation using a quantitative exploration. The data identified a number of barriers to acceptance of a central slaughtering policy, many of which were based on incorrect or limited understanding. Education can help remedy this. Originality/value - The paper describes perceptions among Chinese people towards a public health initiative, revealing many objections are based on misunderstandings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The estimated true prevalence of <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> (AIV) antibodies was 27. 2 % [95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 24. 6 - 29. 5]. Age of the ducks was identified as the only risk factor for AIV seropositivity. Ducks older than one year {{were more likely to be}} seropositive compared to ducks less than six months of age [Odds Ratio= 2. 17 (95 % CI: 1. 07 - 4. 39) ]. This study provided baseline information about seroprevalence of AIVs in Kathmandu that will benefit further research to differentiate the subtypes of AIVs circulating in Kathmandu. We also evaluated alternatives to the current control program (CCP) for HPAI in Nepal. The considered alternatives were: (i) absence of control measures (ACM) and (ii) vaccinating 60 % of the domestic poultry flock twice per year. Cost-benefit analysis approach was used to evaluate the economic feasibility of the programs. In terms of the benefit-cost ratio, our findings indicated that there is a return of 1. 96 dollars for every dollar spent in the CCP compared to ACM. The net present value of the CCP versus ACM was US$ 989, 918. The vaccination program yielded a return of 2. 41 dollars for every dollar spent when compared to the CCP. The net present value of vaccination versus implementing the CCP was US$ 13, 745, 454. These results support a continued investment into the CCP rather than ceasing to implement government regulated control measures and suggest that vaccination may be an even better control alternative. In summary, our studies have highlighted the value of epidemiologic and economic analysis in research of AI.

Our results indicate that larger amounts of viruses can be isolated for a longer time from feathers than from swabs. Therefore, feathers can be considered useful samples for surveillance or diagnostic examination of <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> (H 5 N 1) in domestic ducks. The epidermis, the outer layer of the feather, is a tissue that has poor host immune response against viral replication (8). As has been observed in virus isolation, viruses may be able to survive longer in differentiated epidermal tissue such as contour feathers. The sensitivity of the rapid test was not adequate for swabs, a finding similar to that of other studies (9, 10). However, positive results for rapid tests of feather samples only may shed light on the on-site field detection of AI (H 5 N 1) in asymptomatic domestic ducks. When virus shedding from domestic ducks is maintained at a low level of viral load during the infection, selecting the sample with higher viral load and antigens in tissues, such as feathers, can increase the detection rate obtained from on-site examination.

40|$|In Denmark and Greenland, {{extensive}} {{surveillance of}} avian influenza (<b>AI)</b> <b>viruses</b> in wild bird populations {{has been conducted}} from 2007 through 2010. In Denmark, the surveillance consisted of passive surveillance of wild birds found dead or sick across Denmark and active surveillance of apparently healthy live birds in waterfowl reservoirs and along migratory flyways, birds living in proximity to domestic poultry, and hunted game birds. Dead birds were sampled by oropharyngeal swabbing. Healthy live wild birds were captured with nets, traps, or by hand and were sampled by swabbing of the oropharyngeal and cloacal tracts, or swabs were collected from fresh fecal droppings. Hunted game birds were delivered to game-handling establishments, where each bird was sampled by oropharyngeal and cloacal swabbing. During the 2007 – 10 period, a total of 11, 055 wild birds were sampled in Denmark, of which 396 were birds that were found dead. In Greenland, samples were collected mainly from fecal droppings in breeding areas. Samples from 3555 live and apparently healthy wild birds were tested. All swab samples were tested by pan-influenza reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR), and the positive samples were further tested by H 5 /H 7 specific RT-PCRs. H 5 /H 7 -positive samples were subjected to hemagglutination cleavage site sequencing for pathotyping. In addition, all RT-PCR– positive samples were subjected to virus isolation, and the virus isolates were subsequently subtyped. In Denmark, low pathogenic (LP) H 5 viruses were detected throughout the period, {{in addition to a}} few LPAI H 7 and several other subtypes. In Greenland, very few samples were positive <b>for</b> <b>AI.</b> None of them were found to be of the H 5 or H 7 subtypes by RT-PCR. Isolation of these viruses in eggs was unsuccessful; thus, they were not subtyped further. The findings did, however, demonstrate the presence of LPAI viruses in Greenland. For several water bird species overwintering in North America and northwest Europe, respectively, Greenland constitutes a common breeding area. This raises the possibility that viruses could be transmitted to North America via Greenland and vice versa. In Denmark, the screenings <b>for</b> <b>AI</b> showed LPAI <b>viruses</b> to be naturally occurring in the wild bird population, particularly in waterfowl. The occurrence of <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> in the wild bird population may pose a risk <b>for</b> <b>AI</b> infections in Danish poultry...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry have raised {{interest in the}} interplay between avian influenza (<b>AI)</b> <b>viruses</b> and their wild hosts. Studies linking virus ecology to host ecology are still scarce, particularly for non-duck species. Here, we link capture-resighting data of greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons albifrons with the <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> infection data collected during capture in The Netherlands in four consecutive winters. We ask what factors are related to <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> prevalence and whether there are ecological consequences associated with <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> infection in staging white-fronted geese. Mean seasonal (low pathogenic) <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> prevalence ranged between 2. 5 and 10. 7 per cent, among the highest reported values for non-duck species, and occurred in distinct peaks with near-zero prevalence before and after. Throat samples had a 2. 4 times higher detection frequency than cloacal samples. <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> infection {{was significantly related to}} age and body mass in some but not other winters. <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> infection was not related to resighting probability, nor to maximum distance travelled, which was at least 191 km during the short infectious lifespan of an <b>AI</b> <b>virus.</b> Our results suggest that transmission via the respiratory route could be an important transmission route of <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> in this species. Nearzero prevalence upon arrival on their wintering grounds, in combination with the epidemic nature of <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> infections in white-fronted geese, suggests that white-fronted geese are not likely to disperse Asian <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> from their Siberian breeding grounds to their European wintering areas...|$|R
40|$|Our survey {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} avian influenza (AI) and Newcastle disease (ND) prevalence and risk factors in three areas of Mali {{at risk for}} occurrence of H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza. Blood samples and cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 1470 birds between February 2007 and May 2008 and were tested by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies and real-time reverse-transcription (rRT) -PCR to detect virus. Risk factors associated with seropositivity or positive rRT-PCR were identified by random effect logistic regression. AI seroprevalence was significantly lower in birds from commercial farms (0 %) than in village backyard birds (3. 1 %). For backyard birds, no individual risk factors (species, age, sex) were identified, but birds in the Mopti area in the Sahelian zone, where millions of wild birds migrate, were more seropositive than in the Sikasso area in the Sudano-Guinean zone (odds ratio [OR] ?=? 2. 0, P ?=? 0. 051). Among backyard birds nonvaccinated against ND, ND seroprevalence was 58. 4 %, and the odds of seropositivity was 2. 0 higher in chickens than in ducks, 1. 7 higher in females than in males, 3. 1 higher in adults than in young birds, and 3. 0 higher in poultry from the Sikasso area than from the Mopti area (P < 0. 01 in all cases). Prevalence established by rRT-PCR was low <b>for</b> both <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> (1. 1 %) and ND virus (2. 6 %) and was associated with no risk factors <b>for</b> <b>AI</b> but was higher in chickens than in ducks (OR ?=? 5. 3, P ?=? 0. 05) and in the Sikasso area than in the Mopti area (OR ?=? 3. 4, P ?=? 0. 027) <b>for</b> ND. <b>For</b> <b>AI</b> and ND, prevalence assessed by serology or rRT-PCR varied over time, although seasonal and interannual variation could not be clearly distinguished. The intracluster correlation coefficient for serologic data was low <b>for</b> <b>AI</b> (0. 014) and higher for ND (0. 222). These results are useful to optimize surveillance and control strategy for notifiable avian diseases in African countries with similar agroecological and resource-limited contexts.

40|$|In {{aquatic bird}} populations, {{the ability of}} avian {{influenza}} (<b>AI)</b> <b>viruses</b> to remain infectious in water for extended periods provides a mechanism that allows viral transmission to occur long after shedding birds have left the area. However, this also exposes other aquatic organisms, including freshwater invertebrates, to <b>AI</b> <b>viruses.</b> Previous researchers found that AI viral RNA can be sequestered in snail tissues. Using an experimental approach, we determined whether freshwater snails (Physa acuta and Physa gyrina) can infect waterfowl with <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> by serving {{as a means of}} transmission between infected and naı¨ve waterfowl via ingestion. In our first experiment, we exposed 20 Physa spp. snails to an <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> (H 3 N 8) and inoculated embryonated specific pathogen–free (SPF) chicken eggs with the homogenized snail tissues. Sequestered <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> remain infectious in snail tissues; 10 % of the exposed snail tissues infected SPF eggs. In a second experiment, we exposed snails to water contaminated with feces of AI virus–inoculated Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to evaluate whether ingestion of exposed freshwater snails was an alternate route of <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> transmission to waterfowl. None of the immunologically naı¨ve Mallards developed an infection, indicating that transmission via ingestion likely did not occur.

40|$|Rapid and {{specific}} detection of avian influenza (<b>AI)</b> <b>virus</b> is urgently needed with the {{concerns over the}} outbreaks of highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 avian influenza in animal and human infection. Aptamers are artificial oligonucleic acid that can specifically bind to target molecules. They show comparable affinity for target virus and better thermal stability than monoclonal antibodies. Those advantages make aptamers promising candidates in diagnostic and detection applications. The goal {{of this research was}} to use DNA 2 ̆ 6 ndashaptamer as the specific recognition element in a portable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor <b>for</b> detection of <b>AI</b> H 5 N 1 virus in poultry. A SPR biosensor was fabricated using the selected aptamers based on streptavidin 2 ̆ 6 ndashbiotin method. Streptavidin was directly adsorbed onto the surface of a gold waveguide in the SPR biosensor. Then, biotinylated aptamers were immobilized on the sensor surface via streptavidin 2 ̆ 6 ndashbiotin binding. The immobilized aptamers captured AI H 5 N 1 virus in a sample solution, causing an increase in refraction index (RI). Performances of the aptamer 2 ̆ 6 ndashbased SPR biosensor were studied in streptavidin modification, aptamer immobilization and virus detection. The optimal concentrations of streptavidin and aptamers were determined to improve the sensitivity of the biosensor. The response of the aptamer 2 ̆ 6 ndashvirus interaction was shown to be virus titer 2 ̆ 6 ndashdependent, and a linear range for the titers of AI H 5 N 1 was found between 0. 128 and 1. 28 HA unit. The aptamer 2 ̆ 6 ndashbased SPR biosensor could detect the H 5 N 1 virus at a titer greater than 0. 128 HA unit within 1. 5 h. No significant interference was observed from non 2 ̆ 6 ndashtarget subtypes such as AI H 7 N 2, H 9 N 2, H 2 N 2, H 1 N 1 and H 5 N 2.

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study to monitor prevalence and incidence of antibodies against Newcastle disease (ND) virus and prevalence of antibodies against Avian Influenza (<b>AI)</b> <b>virus</b> in scavenging village chickens {{was conducted in}} 20 villages within 4 districts of Timor-Lesté. A total of 3600 blood samples was collected from 1674 individual birds in 300 household chicken flocks during three sampling periods (December 2008 -February 2009, March-May 2009, and June-August 2009). The mean interval between household visits was 101. 6 ± 1. 9 days. None of the birds enrolled {{in the study was}} vaccinated against ND or AI. A haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was used to determine antibody titres against ND virus and a competitive ELISA and HI tests were used to detect antibody against <b>AI</b> <b>virus.</b> The bird-level ND seroprevalence pooled across all samplings (adjusted for clustering by households) was 4. 4 % (95 % CI 3. 5 - 5. 2). The bird-level ND seroprevalence {{in each of the three}} sampling periods (adjusted for clustering by household) was 3. 0 % (95 % CI 2. 0 - 4. 0), 6. 6 % (95 % CI 5. 1 - 8. 0) and 3. 6 (95 % CI 2. 5 - 4. 6), respectively. A total of 12. 6 % individual birds tested ND seropositive at least once over the total study period (95 % CI 10. 5 - 14. 7). The flock-level ND seroprevalence (at least one bird tested had antibodies against ND virus) pooled across all samplings was 15. 9 % (95 % CI 13. 5 - 18. 3). A total of 35. 3 % flocks had a minimum of one bird being ND seropositive at least once over the study period. The bird-level incidence rate for the period between the first and the second sampling and between the second and the third sampling was 5. 6 (95 % CI 4. 1 - 7. 5) and 0. 5 (95 % CI 0. 5 - 3. 8) per 10, 000 bird-years-at-risk, respectively. A total of 1134 serum samples from the last sampling period between June and August 2009 was tested <b>for</b> antibodies against <b>AI</b> <b>virus.</b> Only 4 samples tested Influenza A positive, indicating a bird-level seroprevalence level for Influenza A of 0. 4 % (CI 0. 0 - 0. 7 %). These Influenza A positive samples were further tested for HI antibodies against <b>AI</b> <b>virus</b> subtypes of H 5 N 1, H 5 N 3, H 7 N 3 and H 9 N 2, but all tested negative, suggesting that the influenza antibodies in those four birds resulted from exposure to low pathogenic <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> of different H subtypes. Our results indicate that village chickens in Timor-Lesté are exposed to ND virus; there was a higher risk of infection during the early months of 2009 than either immediately prior or subsequent to this.

Currently, the only available hemagglutinin (HA) subtyping primer set that can subtype H 1 through H 15 is not fully evaluated and, since it only targets HA 1, is unavailable for molecular pathotyping of <b>AI</b> <b>viruses.</b> Our preliminary experiments found that these primer sets were cross-reactive and missed some recent <b>AI</b> <b>viruses.</b> In this study, we developed new primer sets against HA cleavage sites for subtyping H 1 to H 15 genes and for molecular pathotyping. Our primer sets were subtype specific and detected 99 % of previously identified HA genes (115 / 116, 1949 to March 2006), and the correct amplifications of HA genes were confirmed by sequence analyses of all 115 PCR products. The primer sets successfully subtyped most of the recent <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> isolated in Japan (96 % [101 / 105], October 2006 to March 2007). Taken together, our primer sets could efficiently detect HA genes (98 % [216 / 221]) of both previously and recently identified HA genes or of both American (29 / 29) and Eurasian (187 / 192) lineages. All 38 H 5 and 13 H 7 viruses were molecularly pathotyped by sequencing analyses of the HA cleavage site. In contrast, despite efficient detection of previously identified strains (98 % [114 / 116]), the published primer sets exhibited lower specificity and lower detection efficiency against recent <b>AI</b> <b>viruses</b> (80 % [84 of 105]).
