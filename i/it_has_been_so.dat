25|$|First Law: In every animal {{which has}} not passed the limit of its development, a more {{frequent}} and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and enlarges that organ, and gives it a power proportional {{to the length of}} time <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> used; while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly weakens and deteriorates it, and progressively diminishes its functional capacity, until it finally disappears.|$|E
500|$|The story {{contains}} many autobiographical elements, {{and the character}} of Olivero owes much to Read's experiences as {{an officer in the}} British Army during the First World War. The novel was positively received, although some commentators have considered it to be [...] "inscrutable", and one has suggested that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> differently and vaguely interpreted by those who have given it serious study that it may lack the form and content to justify the praise it has received.|$|E
25|$|The delays {{became so}} great that even ABC mocked the {{lateness}} with an ad campaign showing network executives waiting impatiently {{for the arrival of}} new episodes at ABC's corporate headquarters.

50|$|Tsotsitaal <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a {{model for}} Iscamtho, due to the {{cultural}} prestige of Sophiatown. But the youth abandoned it in the 1970s, when Afrikaans came {{to be no more}} associated with the power of the state, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> far, but <b>was</b> recognized as the language of apartheid and oppression (especially after the 1976 Soweto Uprising). Iscamtho then became the one youth language in Soweto.|$|R
5000|$|The song <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{frequently}} {{used in a}} number of media, including commercials, movies, trailers and television shows. In 2015, it charted for several weeks in France.

So when I told her my {{character}} {{was going to be}} mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'". Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town."

2500|$|As <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> long {{taken for}} granted that Mr. Garrison was the {{originator}} and prime leader of the Antislavery conflict, I will, before giving a sketch of The Pioneer of [...] "Antislavery" [...] in America, present to the public {{a copy of a}} letter addressed to the writer by Mr. Garrison in 1858. It was written currente calamo, in answer to the writer of the African Civilization Society, [...] "to promote the Christian civilization of Africa," [...] and [...] "the cultivation of cotton there by free labor." [...] In this beautiful panegyric Mr. Garrison renders ample testimony to the friend and preceptor from whom he derived his doctrines, his enthusiasm, and who animated his courage for his lifelong work of abolition.|$|E
2500|$|The group's media-avoidance {{policy has}} been {{characterized}} in various ways. The Economist described it in 1988 as a [...] "select and shadowy gathering {{of some of the}} city's top business and professional people", [...] "perating on the old-boy network". In 1997, reporter Bradford McKee called the organization [...] "secretive" [...] and [...] "a shadow chamber of commerce and phantom government..." [...] In 2014, Jonathan O'Connell at The Washington Post called it [...] "historically insular". Other descriptions of the group's publicity shyness have been more positive. Washington Post columnist Colbert I. King has dismissed theories that the organization is [...] "a clandestine outfit", noting it merely [...] "work quietly behind the scenes on city issues". This view is echoed by Post reporters Yolanda Woodlee and Ashlee Clark. Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein has argued that the organization's avoidance of publicity {{has been one of the}} reasons <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> successful.|$|E
