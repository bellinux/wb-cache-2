40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy logic approach {{to select the}} best crane type in a construction project from the main crane types, namely, mobile, tower <b>and</b> <b>derrick</b> <b>cranes.</b> Each factor of the project is classified as being dynamic or static according to whether the factor does or {{does not depend on}} the particular project. Linguistic information about the suitability of each crane type with respect to each factor of the project is translated into either fuzzy sets (for static factors) or fuzzy if-then rules (for dynamic factors). The fuzzy rules are then aggregated into a fuzzy relation between the space of factor property and the space of crane efficiency. In a particular project the experts describe the property as well as the relative importance of each factor. The rules are then fired using the max-min extension principle, and the resulting efficiencies are aggregated with their importance weights. The process identifies the best crane as the one with the highest expected overall efficiency. ...|$|R
50|$|Haulotte {{was formed}} in 1924 in L'Horme by Arthur Haulotte, the company being Ateliers de Construction A. Haulotte. They {{specialised}} {{in the production of}} aerial platforms, <b>derricks</b> <b>and</b> mobile <b>cranes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The masonry and {{abutments}} {{were constructed}} between 1777 and 1778, and the ribs were lifted into {{place in the}} summer of 1779 by the use of wooden <b>derricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranes.</b> The bridge first spanned the river on 2 July 1779, and it was opened to traffic on 1 January 1781.|$|R
50|$|School House Lane was {{the first}} {{terminus}} of the North East railway, opened as a temporary terminus as the girders for the Goulburn River bridge had not yet arrived from England. Located at 59 miles, 20 chains (95.4 kilometres) from Spencer Street it was open for public services between April 18 to August 28, 1872, and was provided with passenger and goods platforms, an engine shed, ash pit, water supply, <b>and</b> a <b>derrick</b> <b>crane.</b> A station building was provided, {{as well as a}} tent with brick chimney for the station master. After the line was extended into Seymour station, School House Lane was closed.|$|R
50|$|Many other steamers {{worked on}} the river—these were dredges, <b>derricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranes.</b> In the early years, dikes, docks, and jetties needed to be built and so barge based steamers were put to work. Later many bridges, {{airports}} and factories were built and thus needed cranes and dredges. Fraser River Pile and Dredge was one company as was Dinsmore Dredge. <b>Derricks</b> <b>and</b> snagboats also worked the river.|$|R
50|$|A final fire {{destroyed}} Johnston's sawmill in 1963, {{and this}} time it was not rebuilt. The railway to Mount Molloy closed on 30 April the following year. In 1973 a timber shed still existed around the boiler, along with a small shed over the Walkers steam winch, <b>and</b> the <b>derrick</b> <b>crane</b> was still extant. Another shed existed to the southeast of the steam engine, set at a lower level. The buildings and the crane have since been removed. Two other steam engines that were present in 1973 are no longer on site - a Tangye, Birmingham single cylinder vertical engine and a Thompson & Co., Castlemaine, Victoria, single cylinder horizontal engine no.242 (earlier used by Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company). A Pickering type governor was also present in 1973 on top of the Marshall steam engine, but this has since been removed.|$|R
50|$|D. Boon and Friends is a music CD {{compiling}} various jam {{session and}} live recordings featuring Minutemen guitarist and frontman D. Boon. The album is the inaugural {{release of the}} Hermosa Beach, California-based label Box-O-Plenty Records, started by Boon's one-time roommate Richard Derrick. Most of the tracks are living-room jam sessions (on guitars, bass and cheap keyboards) done by Boon, <b>Derrick,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crane,</b> who had previously contributed backing vocals and trumpet parts to the Minutemen's Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat and Project: Mersh 12-inch EP's.|$|R
50|$|<b>Derrick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crane</b> {{continued}} performing together, and in 1987, {{after several}} attempts with different musicians, they began {{working as a}} duo under the name Another Umbrella, which utilized extended delay guitar loops, pre-recorded instruments, slide shows, and {{a strong emphasis on}} improvisation. This went against the grain of what was popular in Los Angeles clubs at the time, but they did perform regularly around town and on radio, most notably at The Museum Of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles. Other musicians who performed with Another Umbrella include keyboardist Paul Roessler and flutist/vocalist Emily Hay.|$|R
2500|$|Misoa was one {{of three}} shallow-draught oil tankers built by the Furness Shipbuilding Company of Haverton Hill-on-Tees in 1937 to operate in Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. She was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in December 1940, along with her sister ships Tasajera and Bachaquero, for {{conversion}} to a tank landing ship. Her oil tanks were removed to form a tank deck, and two large hatches <b>and</b> two 50-ton <b>derrick</b> <b>cranes</b> fitted to lift vehicles from the tank deck to the upper deck. Her bows were cut off square and a heavy steel door fitted. A hinged extension, together with the door, provided a [...] ramp to unload vehicles. Steel armour plate was fitted to the bridge and wheelhouse, and the ship was armed with a single 40mm gun, six 20mm anti-aircraft guns, three Lewis machine guns, and a smoke mortar. There was accommodation for up to 217 troops, and for a crew of 98. She could carry eighteen 30-ton tanks, or twenty-two 25-ton tanks, or 33 heavy trucks. After refitting was complete she was commissioned in August 1941.|$|R
50|$|The {{small size}} of the {{railroad}} obviates the need for high running speeds, as do the short distances spanned. Operating speeds are therefore low as compared to longer railroads. The maximum speed for both passenger and freight trains on the “main line” of the Mulberry Island and James River Subdivisions therefore was 25 mph with the maximum speed on the Industrial Subdivision being 15 mph. On all subdivisions, the maximum speed through sidings, within yard limits, on spurs and through switches was also 15 mph. There were more restrictive maximum speeds specified for dead engines (engines not under power while being towed), which were 15 mph, rail mounted <b>derricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranes</b> run between 5 mph and 10 mph, and track motor cars travel to about 2 mph and 15 mph.|$|R
