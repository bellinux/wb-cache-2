500|$|Diet {{studies have}} shown {{alligator}} gar to be opportunistic piscivores, and even scavengers depending {{on the availability of}} their preferred food source. They occasionally ingest sport fish, but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on forage fishes such as <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> as well as invertebrates, and water fowl. [...] Diet studies have also revealed fishing tackle and boat engine parts in their stomachs.|$|E
500|$|Fish {{account for}} about 80% of the diet of the common loon. It forages on fish of up to [...] in length, {{including}} minnows, suckers, <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad,</b> rock bass, alewife, northern pike, whitefish, sauger, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, burbot, walleye, bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, rainbow smelt, and killifish. The young typically eat small minnows, and sometimes insects and fragments of green vegetation. The freshwater diet primarily consists of pike, perch, sunfish, trout, and bass; the saltwater diet primarily consists of rock fish, flounder, sea trout, herring, Atlantic croaker, haddock, and Gulf silverside. When there is either a lack of fish or they are difficult to catch, it preys on crustaceans, crayfish, snails, leeches, insect larvae, molluscs, frogs, annelids, and occasionally aquatic plant matter such as pondweed, roots, moss, willow shoots, seeds, and algae. It has also been known to eat ducklings.|$|E
500|$|The State of Florida {{implemented}} a program named Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) in 1987 {{to assist with}} river cleanups, particularly with nonpoint source pollution, or chemicals that enter the river by soaking into the ground, as opposed to direct piped dumping. SWIM assists local jurisdictions with purchasing land for wetlands restoration. The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) is charged by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with restoring the river. The first step in restoration, particularly in the upper basin, is the purchase of public lands bordering the river; ten different reserves and conservation areas have been implemented for such use around the St. Johns headwaters. Around Lake Griffin in the Ocklawaha Chain of Lakes, the SJRWMD has purchased [...] of land that was previously used for muck farming. More than [...] have been purchased along Lake Apopka to restore its wetlands, and the SJRWMD has removed nearly [...] of <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> (Dorosoma cepedianum), a fish species that stores phosphorus and adds to algae problems. The SJRWMD has also set minimum levels for the lakes and tributaries in the St. Johns watersheds to monitor permitted water withdrawals and declare water shortages when necessary.|$|E
500|$|The {{bald eagle}} is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore {{with the capacity}} to consume {{a great variety of}} prey. Throughout their range, fish often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. In Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch) and, more locally, sockeye salmon (O. nerka), with chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), due to their large size ( [...] average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus). In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were largescale suckers (Catostomus macrocheilus) (17.3% of the prey selected there), American shad (Alosa sapidissima; 13%) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio; 10.8%). Eagles living in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland were found to subsist largely on American <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> (Dorosoma cepedianum), threadfin shad (D. petenense) and white bass (Morone chrysops). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on catfish, most prevalently the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and any species in the Ictalurus genus as well as mullet, trout, needlefish, and eels. Wintering eagles on the Platte River in Nebraska preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught live by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.|$|E

50|$|The <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> is planktivorous in {{its early}} life, feeding mainly on phytoplankton, before {{switching}} to a diet of zooplankton when it becomes older. Their consumptive demand is so heavy it can cause collapses in the zooplankton community, which has far-reaching effects through the ecosystem {{they are a part}} of. They can switch to diets containing detritus, but their growth rates are decreased and they only do so when density of conspecifics is high and the zooplankton population has been depleted. Daphnia and other crustaceans make up a large portion of some <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> diets. <b>Gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> feed mainly during the day, with minimal activity at night.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> (Dorosoma cepedianum) is {{a member}} of the [...] herring family of fish, and is native to large swaths of fresh and {{brackish}} waters of the United States of America. The adult has a deep body, with a silvery-green coloration above fading to plain silver below. The <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> commonly resides in freshwater lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and streams but can reside in brackish waters, as it does on the Atlantic coast of the United States. Their range is across most of the continental United States, although they typically go no further north than New York and no further west than New Mexico. They are large parts of many of the ecosystems they inhabit, and can drive changes in [...] phyto- and zooplankton, thereby indirectly affecting other planktivorous fishes. The <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> has been widely used as a food source for game fish, with varied success in management and effectiveness.|$|E

5000|$|Harvest <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad.</b> From 1993 through December 2010, removed {{more than}} 58 {{metric tons of}} {{phosphorus}} and 175 metric tons of nitrogen in fish tissue from the lake ...|$|E
50|$|The fish {{targeted}} for upstream passage at the Rahway River Water Supply Dam are alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> (Dorosoma cepedianum), white perch (Morone Americana) and the endangered American eel (Anguilla rostrate). Alewife and blueback herring are collectively {{referred to as}} river herring due to their similarity in appearance, range, and life histories. River herring, <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad,</b> and white perch are all anadromous (adults spawn in freshwater; juveniles migrate to saltwater); whereas American eel are catadromous (adults spawn in the ocean; the young migrate to freshwater habitats).|$|E
50|$|Removing <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> {{from the}} lake removes the {{phosphorus}} contained in the shad’s bodies as well as reduces the internal recycling of phosphorus within the lake. This improves water clarity by {{reducing the number of}} algae, which depend upon phosphorus for growth. Harvesting shad from other lakes has resulted in an improved food web, reduced algae, improved water clarity and improved conditions for game fish populations. This procedure may produce the same results in Lake Apopka. Through the fall of 2011, <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> harvesting has removed about 8,400 metric tons (18.5 million pounds) of fish {{from the lake}}. This equates to removing about 58 metric tons (129,000 pounds) of phosphorus and 175 metric tons (387,000 pounds) of nitrogen via fish tissue, directly from the lake. In addition, the projected nutrient recycling reduction to the lake from <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> feeding impacts is about 146 metric tons (322,000 pounds) of phosphorus and about 862 metric tons (1.9 million pounds) of nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|Species {{of fish in}} the {{reservoir}} include walleye, sauger, smallmouth bass, channel catfish, and white bass. Walleye are the primary gamefish in the lake, and <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> are the main food source for the walleye.|$|E

50|$|The {{threadfin}} shad (Dorosoma petenense) {{is a small}} {{pelagic fish}} common in rivers, large streams, and reservoirs of the Southeastern United States. Like the American <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad,</b> the threadfin shad has an elongated dorsal ray, but unlike the <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> its mouth is more terminal without projecting upper jaw. The fins of threadfin shad often have a yellowish color, especially the caudal fin. The back is grey to blue with a dark spot on the shoulder. D. petenense is more often found in moving water, and is rarely found deep in the water column. It occur in large schools, sometimes with <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad,</b> and {{can be seen on}} the surface at dawn and dusk. The threadfin shad may reach lengths of 8 inches, but only rarely. This fish is very sensitive to changes in temperature and dissolved oxygen, and die-offs are frequent in late summer and fall, especially when water temperature reaches 42 °F. The threadfin shad is a favorite food for many game fishes including striped bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and catfishes. This fish is widely introduced throughout the United States as a forage for game fish.|$|E
50|$|Balmorhea Lake {{has been}} stocked with {{species of fish}} {{intended}} to improve {{the utility of the}} reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish that are present in Balmorhea Lake include largemouth bass, sunfish, European carp, mirror carp, grass carp, quillback, channel catfish, black bullhead, and <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The gizzard shad's {{dorsal fin}} starts behind the {{insertion}} of the pelvic fins, and the last ray is greatly lengthened in adults {{but not in the}} young. They have a long anal fin, with 25 to 36 long soft-rays on the fin. The mouth of the <b>Gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> has a short, wide upper jaw with a deep notch along the ventral margin, and a weak, relatively smaller lower jaw. The mouth itself is [...] subterminal to inferior (on the lower portion of the head), and the adults possess no teeth. The <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> also has 90 to 275 gill rakers along the lower limbs. Their ventral (pelvic) fins are in the thoracic position, or in the chest region of the fish. The <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> can range from millimeter and milligram size when fry to a maximum recorded length of 477 mm and maximum weight of 1.56 kg. The average length is typically larger in northern waters, and ranges from 284 mm mm at age three years to 399 mm at age 10. They have a highly reduced lateral line system, a feature shared by other members of the [...] herring family. To compensate for this reduction in their mechanical sensory system, they have developed other methods of sensing movement.|$|E
