25|$|A {{projection}} system with two CRTs {{was better than}} three, but still not practical for a <b>home</b> <b>receiver.</b> Baird continued to consider other solutions. One used a single conventional CRT with the two images displayed in a single frame, with {{the top half of}} the image containing the image for one color and the bottom the other. Lens systems focused on the display were positioned to see only the top or bottom image, passed them through filters, and then recombined them on a screen. There were drawings showing a similar system with three frames. Like many similar efforts from other experimenters, Baird abandoned this approach.|$|E

50|$|In the {{beginning}} {{there was a}} very definite reason for the decision of Desilu Productions to put I Love Lucy on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network. The company was not satisfied with the quality of kinescopes. It saw that film, produced especially for television, was the only means of ensuring top quality pictures on the <b>home</b> <b>receiver</b> as well as ensuring a flawless show.|$|E
50|$|The term audio/video <b>receiver</b> (AVR) or <b>Home</b> Theater <b>Receiver</b> {{is used to}} {{distinguish}} the multi-channel audio/video <b>receiver</b> (<b>home</b> theater <b>receiver)</b> from the simpler stereo receiver, though the primary function of both is amplification.|$|R

50|$|As with <b>home</b> <b>receivers,</b> it {{was further}} {{recommended}} that studio monitors incorporate similar color correction circuits so that broadcasters would transmit pictures encoded {{for the original}} 1953 colorimetric values, in accordance with FCC standards.|$|R
50|$|The {{output stages}} of both devices are similar, but the input stages are quite different. There is no {{baseband}} audio or video input to the translator. The translator receives an over-the air RF input signal {{by means of}} an antenna, just like a <b>home</b> <b>receiver.</b> Since received signal is already modulated {{there is no need for}} a modulator. Instead an input mixer or down-converter shifts the radio-frequency (RF) signal down to an intermediate-frequency (IF) signal. A second mixer (known as output mixer or up-converter) shifts the IF signal back up to the FM or TV band output signal frequency.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Peter Goldmark joined CBS Laboratories in 1936. On September 4, 1940, {{while working}} at the lab, he {{demonstrated}} the Field-Sequential Color TV system. It utilized a mechanical color wheel on both the camera and on the television <b>home</b> <b>receiver,</b> but was not compatible with the existing post-war NTSC, 525-line, 60-field/second black and white TV sets {{as it was a}} 405-line, 144-field scanning system. It was the first color broadcasting system that received FCC approval in 1950, and the CBS Television Network began broadcasting in color on November 20, 1950. However, no other TV set manufacturers made the sets, and CBS stopped broadcasting in field-sequential color on October 21, 1951.|$|E

The SX-28 was notable for audio that sounded better than many expensive <b>home</b> <b>receivers.</b> It is still easy to find today, and remains a favorite of collectors.|$|R
5000|$|Ekran ("Экран", [...] "Screen") was a Soviet-Russian type of {{geostationary}} satellite, {{developed for}} a national system of Direct-To-Home television.The first satellite of Ekran series was launched in 1976. Each satellite in the Ekran series was designed to provide one TV and 2 radio program channels to cable TV systems throughout the USSR and to individual <b>home</b> <b>receivers</b> in northern Siberia. Ekran's downlink is in the UHF range.|$|R
50|$|After Held's death, the {{controlling}} stock became available and was eventually bought in 1930 by Standard Elektrizitätsgesellschaft, {{a subsidiary of}} the American corporation International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT); Lorenz as a firm, however, continued to operate independently. In 1932, development of a new type of radio navigation system - soon known worldwide as the Lorenz beam - gave a major extension of their aircraft radio business. Lorenz patented the ferrite antenna in 1935, and thereafter it was used in most <b>home</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Lorenz had grown to about 3,000 {{employees}} and was a major supplier to the German military of land-line telephone and telegraph equipment and had also entered the wireless field. For this expansion, a large factory {{was built in the}} Tempelhof district of Berlin, and by 1918, the headquarters and research operations also occupied this facility. When World War I ended, Lorenz greatly decreased in size and turned to producing home radios, broadcast transmitters, and aircraft communications sets. In 1919, Lorenz initiated radio broadcasting (transmitting voice and music) in Germany, and their first <b>home</b> <b>receiver,</b> the Liebhaber-Empfänger, was introduced in 1923. Throughout the 1920s, radios and associated valves (vacuum tubes), were major products manufactured by Lorenz. In this, the firm was a primary competitor of Telefunken.|$|E
40|$|Project {{goal was}} the {{development}} of an IC set for an HDTV <b>home</b> <b>receiver</b> and its evaluation in a prototype receiver set. The project has been terminated at an earlier date, hence this report will describe the Siemens activities in the period between 01. 10. 1991 and 30. 09. 1993. Starting from the activities in Eureka 95 for defining a european transmission standard a HDTV <b>home</b> <b>receiver</b> has been defined within the europroject Jessi AE- 10. Siemens has defined and investigated motion adaptive and motion vector based methods for flicker reduction in TV sets. There have been works at an On-Screen-Display-System to be used in HDTV applications. RF and IF components, a field memory and a video post-processing component with interpolation and DACs have been designed. In addition there has been defined a flexible digital deflection controller for HDTV. (orig.)

2500|$|Some ballast {{resistors}} {{have the}} property of increasing in resistance as current through them increases, and decreasing in resistance as current decreases. Physically, some such devices are often built quite like incandescent lamps. Like the tungsten filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp, if current increases, the ballast resistor gets hotter, its resistance goes up, and its voltage drop increases.

Therefore, the ballast resistor reduces variations in current, despite variations in applied voltage or changes {{in the rest of}} an electric circuit.
