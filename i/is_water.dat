50|$|One puzzling {{consequence}} of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators <b>are</b> necessary. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' {{pick out the}} same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed <b>is</b> that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O, but conditionally, if <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it <b>is</b> true), then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O.|$|R
