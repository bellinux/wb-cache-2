In recent times, it has been {{explored}} for use in cosmetic and skin care products.It has a high content of omega-3 and {{is used as a}} food supplement by some cultures. In the United States the Food and Drug Administration has not rated the oil for human consumption yet. False flax belongs to the Brassicaceae (mustard and cabbage) family, which also contains many other seed oil plants, such as rapeseed oil. It contains 1-3% erucic acid.|$|E

Wheat (emmer) and six-row barley formed the basic crops, together with millet, rye and oats, peas, broad beans, lentils, and <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> (Camelina sativa). Flax was grown, and remains of domesticated apples, pears, and plums have been found. Cattle and pigs {{were the most}} important domestic animals, followed by sheep, goats, horses, and dogs. Pictures on Iron Age urns from Silesia attest horse riding, but horses were used to draw chariots as well. Hunting was practiced, as bones of red and roe deer, boar, bison, elk, hare, fox, and wolf attest, but did not provide much of the meat consumed. The numerous frog bones found at Biskupin may indicate that frogs' legs were eaten as well.|$|E

The conglomerates showed no mixing with each other, as they were almost pure flax and <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> respectively. Together with other archaeobotanical data from the site, they provide new evidence on the use, processing and cultivation of these two plants in early Iron Age in Scandinavia. Metric analyses were applied to flax seeds from both conglomerates and other contexts at this site, and compared to seed assemblages from other Roman Iron Age sites in Europe. The comparison showed that the flax cultivation at UppAyenkra 2 : 25 was intended {{for the production of}} oil-rich seeds. The contextual relationship indicates that both flax and <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> seeds were processed in a similar way and used for oil. Furthermore, the pure seed conglomerate of <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> suggests that this plant was not a weed, but rather an intentionally grown crop which was cultivated separately from flax...|$|E

S. to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance cyproconazole in mustard seed and <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure.</b> In order to accommodate for the intended use of cyproconazole in France, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs in these crops to 0. 4 mg/kg. France drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the proposed extrapolation of residue data from rape seed to mustard seed and <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> is acceptable and a sufficient number of residue trials has been submitted to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 4 mg/kg in the crops under consideration. The submitted residue trials data support the NEU use only. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of cyproconazole on mustard seed and <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. EFSA emphasizes that the above assessment does not take into consideration triazole derivative metabolites (TDMs). Since these metabolites may be generated by several pesticides belonging to the group of triazole fungicides, EFSA recommends that a separate risk assessment is performed for TDMs as soon as the confirmatory data requested for triazole compounds in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 have been evaluated and a general methodology on the risk assessment of triazole compounds and their triazole derivative metabolites is available...|$|E

40|$|Camelina (Camelina sativa), {{a member}} of the mustard family, is a summer annual oilseed plant. Winter hardy types also exist. False flax and <b>Gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pleasure</b> are the popular common names for the crop. The crop was widely grown in Eastern Europe and Russia up to the early 1940 ’s but was {{replaced}} with the introduction and widespread use of oilseed rape. The revival of interest in camelina oil is due to its high linolenic acid (38 %) content. Linolenic acid is one of the OMEGA- 3 fatty acids which are generally found in substantial quantities only in linseed and fish oils. Camelina offers an opportunity to supply the growing demand for high quality edible oils rich in OMEGA- 3 fatty acids. A three year study established that camelina is a very suitable crop to grow in Ireland, producing 2. 5 t/ha of high quality seed (42 - 47 %) with no agrochemical inputs required. The oil contains 35 to 40 % linolenic acid compared to 8 % in rape and soya oils. The oil does not deteriorate during refining or storage and {{can be used in a}} number of oil based products such as spreads and salad dressings.

40|$|Abstract: What is the {{contrary}} <b>of</b> <b>pleasure?</b> “Pain ” is one common answer. This paper argues that pleasure instead has two natural contraries: unpleasure and hedonic indifference. This view is defended by {{drawing attention to}} two often-neglected concepts: the formal relation of polar opposition and the psychological state of hedonic indifference. The existence of mixed feelings, it is argued, does not threaten the contrariety <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> and unpleasure. What is {{the contrary}} <b>of</b> <b>pleasure?</b> “Pain ” is one common answer. This paper argues that pleasure instead has two contraries: unpleasure and hedonic indifference. This view is defended by drawing attention to two often-neglected concepts: the formal relation of polar opposition and the psychological state of hedonic indifference, here called “indolence”. Section 1 introduces the concepts <b>of</b> <b>pleasure,</b> pleasantness, contrariety, and contradiction, and argues that the contradictories <b>of</b> <b>pleasures</b> do not constitute a natural kind. Section 2 introduces the concept of polar opposition and argues that the real polar opposite <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> is unpleasure. Section 3 maintains that indolence is the neutral opposite <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> and argues (i) that indolences do exist, (ii) that they are sui generis episodes, and (iii) {{that they do not}} necessarily stand directly {{in the middle of the}} pleasure/unpleasure continuum. Section 4 addresses an objection to the project of identifying the contraries <b>of</b> <b>pleasure,</b> to the effect that mixed feelings entail that pleasure and unpleasure are independent orthogonal dimensions of experience. 1.

40|$|Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, (Brassicaceae), {{commonly}} known as false flax, leindotter and <b>gold</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleasure,</b> is a fall or spring planted annual oilcrop species (Putman et al. 1993). This versatile crop has been cultivated in Europe since the Bronze Age. Camelina seed {{was found in the}} stomach of Tollund man, a 4 th century bce mummy recovered from a peat bog in Denmark (Glob 1969). Anthropologists postulate that the man’s last meal had been a soup made from vegetables and seeds including barley, linseed, camelina, knotweed, bristle grass, and chamomile. The Romans used camelina oil as massage oil, lamp fuel, and cooking oil, as well as the meal for food or feed. Camelina, like many Brassicaceae, germinates and emerges in the early spring, well before most cereal grains. Early emergence has several advantages for dryland production including efficient utiliza-tion of spring moisture and competitiveness with common weeds. In response to the resurgent interest in oil crops for sustainable biofuel production, the Montana State Uni-versity (MSU) Agricultural Research Centers have conducted a multi-year, multi-specie oilseed trial. This trial included nine different oilseed crops (sunflower, safflower, soybean, rapeseed, mustard, flax, crambe, canola, and camelina). Camelina sativa emerged from this trial as a promising oilseed crop for production across Montana and the Northern Great Plains. Evaluation parameters included input costs, production costs, harvest costs, and yield. Camelina sativa was not always the highest yielding oilseed crop but it was the most economical crop to produce due to minimal input requirements. GREAT NORTHERN GROWER COOPERATIVE MSU worked with Montana Producers to establish a grower cooperative to produce, process, and distribute camelina. As a result of this collaboration camelina production in Montana rapidly escalated from 0 commercia...|$|E

40|$|One common {{answer to}} the {{question}} of the unity <b>of</b> <b>pleasures</b> is to try to define pleasantness by appealing to a kind of mental states whose unity is less questionable. Desires have been conceived as the best candidates for this unifying role.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to investigate the concept <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> as developed by Nasir-i Khusraw, a prominent Isma'ili philosopher and theologian of the fifth century hijrah. This concept {{seems to be one}} of the central themes of Nasir's thought system. From Nasir's works, it appears that according to him the concept <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> is not simply an ethical problem but a cosmic principle active and functional on all the existential levels. Every being experiences pleasure in its specific way by performing the function assigned to it. Through this function or activity every being perpetuates its existence and preserves its well-being. On the sub-human levels i. e. mineral, vegetative and animal, the principle <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> is a driving force which enables these levels to preserve their respective well-being. However, from the human level till the level of the Universal Soul this principle gains an increasingly epistemological character as it is connected with the soul's activity of acquiring knowledge. Nasir has extensively quoted and criticised Muhammad-i Zakariyya-yi Raji's views on pleasure. This situation has called for a comparative study of their concepts <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> in their respective metaphysical and historical contexts. This comparative study reveals that Nasir and Razi's concepts <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> are ultimately grounded in their metaphysical principles, and their interpretations <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> are influenced by Aristotelian and Platonic interpretations respectively, as these models suited their respective metaphysical world-views...|$|R
