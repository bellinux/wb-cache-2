Data were collected from trawler and longliner fleets targeting hake off the Spanish ports of La Coruña, Burela, and Celeiro. Main factors in the models created include a factor for <b>engine</b> <b>Horse</b> <b>Power,</b> to adjust for characteris-tics that determine fishing power; Year and Month factors for La Coruña’s trawler fleet; and the factors Month, Year, Vessel, and Fishing Days for the Spanish longliner fleet as a whole. Moreover, both models indicate that interactions between the Year and Month factors also {{had a significant impact}} on hake catch rates. The total proportions of variance explained by these models were 55 % for La Coruña’s trawler fleet, and about 48 % for Spanish longliner fleet. The results showed sim-ilar patterns comparing nominal and standardized catch rates...|$|E

40|$|In {{proceedings}} of the conference held 13 - 17 January 2014, National Harbor, Maryland. Click on the DOI number to access this conference paper (may not be free). This paper presents some issues encountered while flight testing a Model Reference Adaptive dynamic inverse controller (MRAC), on a General Aviation (GA) fly-by-wire test bed. Adaptation was replaced with a Modified State Observer (MSO) method which shows promising results in simulation. The flight test results of the MRAC summarized in this paper show PLA surging issues due to adaptation during the commanded flight path angle and airspeed. To overcome this problem, MSO based adaptation methodology is adopted to control the longitudinal dynamics of a typical general aviation aircraft. The advantage of MSO is that it adapts to estimation error, not modeling or tracking error. The controller performance is evaluated for elevator and engine dynamics along with the thrust saturation limits. The elevator model considered in this study deals with a very large delay (200 msec) in the elevator servo. The thrust saturation depends on <b>engine</b> shaft <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> limits that simulate the flight test condition. A controlled flight simulation is carried out including the turbulence effects observed during flight. Controller design using the saturated thrust is used in flight test conditions, where the thrust generated by the engine is not an observable state. The simulation results showing the controller adaptability to flight path angle and airspeed commands are promising. The random PLA surge seen during the simulation and flight test of the baseline MRAC controller is not observed in the simulation results of MSO adaptation controller. Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) Ground Tests and Flight test of MSO based controller is scheduled in the near future.

50|$|Stanley Spencer soon {{directed}} his energies {{to the construction}} of a larger and more powerful airship. The envelope was 88 feet (27 metres) long, with a capacity of 26,000 cubic feet (736 cubic metres). The gondola was an open frame of ash wood spars, on which mounted a Thomas Green & Son <b>engine</b> of 35 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> that drove a pair of wooden propellers, designed by Hiram Maxim. The controls were activated by means of Bowden cables, the first time that these had been used on an airship. On 11 July 1903, the new airship was prepared for its first flight at the Ranelagh Club in Barnes, Surrey. However, it slewed sideways during take off and one of the propellers was smashed against the ground. Nothing daunted, Spencer proceeded to dismount the engine and the airship was flown as an unpowered balloon, landing three hours later near Ongar, Essex. He later reverted to a single propeller and carried advertising for the London Evening News. On 17 September 1903, Spencer attempted to circumnavigate the dome of Saint Paul's; the streets below were crowded with expectant spectators. Despite breaking some telephone cables on take off at Crystal Palace, the airship arrived at Saint Paul's at about 700 feet (213 metres) and flew a semi circle to the east but was unable to turn back towards the south due to the wind. After several attempts, he gave up the struggle and turned away to the north, eventually landing near New Barnet.|$|R

50|$|Writing in 1935, J. Holland Walker reports At the {{northern}} end of Trent Bridge, about on the site now occupied by the Town Arms Hotel, stood the old water works of Nottingham, which were such a charming feature of the landscape forty or fifty years ago, but which have now completely disappeared. A tall brick chimney, mellowed from its first rawness by age, and a grove of well-grown trees marked the old pumping station. There was a great settling tank, or reservoir, receiving water from the river Trent, which reservoir occupied both sides of the road, and a faint echo of which remains in the gardens between Messrs. Turney's works and the river. After this water had passed the filter-bed it was pumped to the reservoir on the eastern side at the upper end of Park Row. For many years this reservoir was open, and surrounded by trees, and was an extremely picturesque object, but some forty or fifty years ago it was covered over by a great concrete roof, which has remained until 1925, when it was broken with considerable difficulty, and the site devoted to the erection of an out-patients' department for the Nottingham General Hospital. These waterworks at Trent Bridge and also the reservoir on Park Row, were erected in 1831, and we are informed that the water was forced through the mains from Trent Bridge by an <b>engine</b> of forty <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> at the rate of ten hogsheads per minute. The reservoir is a hundred and thirty feet above the Trent, and in 1850 the water distributed from it through about twelve miles of pipe to the neighbouring districts.|$|R
