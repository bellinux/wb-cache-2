5|$|For a long time, it was {{uncertain}} if Światło was dead or still alive. Information on him {{was protected by}} the US witness protection program; there were rumours that {{he died in the}} late 1960s, 1975 or 1985. In 2010, United States government stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> on 2 September 1994. Documents relating to him are still classified in the United States and not available to researchers.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{the heirs}} of Venancio Sanchez {{filed a lawsuit}} against James Deering, {{claiming}} an undivided half interest in his Cape Florida property. This brought development of the resort on Cape Florida to a halt. After many legal battles, the suit was finally decided in Deering's favor by the United States Supreme Court in 1926. The decision came too late for Deering; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> the previous year.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November 2011, British citizen Neil Heywood {{was found}} dead in his Chongqing hotel room. At the time, local {{authorities}} declared <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> from alcohol over-consumption, though his family noted that he was not a heavy drinker. The official cause of death was not scrutinized until several months later, when revelations emerged that Heywood's death was a homicide, and Bo Xilai was implicated.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 1952, despite {{advice from}} {{those close to}} him, the King went to London Airport to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via Kenya. On the morning of 6 February, George VI {{was found dead in}} bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> from a {{coronary}} thrombosis in his sleep at the age of 56. His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E

5|$|For both offices, the Republicans {{nominated}} regulars. The incumbent treasurer, Francis D. Pastorius, defeated William M. Paschall and Gibson, with 71,364 to Pastorius, 41,244 to Paschall, and 10,464 to Gibson. The Democrats nominated Joseph F. Vogt without opposition, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in April, a {{month before}} the May primary. (Vogt's was the only name on the ballot.) In September, the Democratic City Committee nominated State Representative Granville E. Jones in Vogt's place. For coroner, the nominations followed a similar pattern. The Hamilton-Meade faction nominated Edward E. Holloway, who defeated Meehan man Roger J. Soens and independent Vincent E. Costello for the Republican nomination. The Democrats renominated the incumbent, Joseph Ominsky, over challenger Gust G. Tatlas.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1615, however, {{it emerged}} that Overbury had been poisoned. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> on 15 September 1613 in the Tower of London, {{where he had}} been placed at the King's request. Among those convicted of the murder were Frances and Robert Carr, the latter having been {{replaced}} as the king's favourite in the meantime by Villiers. James pardoned Frances and commuted Carr's sentence of death, eventually pardoning him in 1624. The implication of the King in such a scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished James's court with an image of corruption and depravity. The subsequent downfall of the Howards left Villiers unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1619.|$|E
5|$|Meksi did {{not live}} to see the 1827 {{publication}} of his translation of the New Testament; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.|$|E

Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.|$|E

5|$|Wiesenthal {{claimed to}} have {{information}} that placed Mengele in several locations: on the Greek island of Kythnos in 1960, Cairo in 1961, in Spain in 1971, and in Paraguay in 1978, the latter eighteen years after he had left. In 1982, he offered a reward of $100,000 for Mengele's capture and insisted as late as 1985—six years after Mengele's death—that he was still alive. The Mengele family admitted to authorities in 1985 that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in 1979; the body was exhumed and its identity was confirmed. Earlier that year Wiesenthal had served {{as one of the}} judges at a mock trial of Mengele, held in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1560 the new Confession of Faith {{was adopted}} and ten dioceses were created anew, with the Isles shared between Ross and Argyll. Monro {{converted}} to Protestantism and {{was admitted to}} the new ministry for the parish of Kiltearn, to which he later added the adjacent Lemlair and Alness. He is said to have lived at Castle Craig, commuting across the Cromarty Firth to preach on Sundays. At Lammas 1563 he became one of three special Commissioners under the Bishop of Caithness responsible for creating new kirks. The duties were arduous but he retained his position for 12 years, despite occasional criticism by the General Assembly. The last record of him is dated 1574 and it is assumed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> by 1576 when new ministers were appointed for Kiltearn, Lemlair and Alness. He never married and no extant stone marks his burial at Kiltearn, his written work being his sole monument.|$|E

Midway through the series, she and Adam start a brief love affair, which ends in the {{penultimate}} episode. In the fifth series, particularly in its later episodes, Adam suffers from several mental breakdowns following the loss of Fiona. He has recurring nightmares that involve his being wounded and unable to return home to his son, and in the eighth episode, he has a panic attack after learning that Wes has briefly run away from home; this attack jeopardises his life during an operation.

5|$|John Manners died in 1402, {{probably}} {{leaving the}} castle to his son, Robert, {{who in turn}} left the property to his own son, another John Manners. John {{was involved in a}} long-running feud with the neighbouring Heron family, who owned the neighbouring Ford Castle, and on 20 January 1428 there was a fight between the two sides outside Etal Castle, in which William Heron died. The precise events are unclear and formed the basis of a subsequent lawsuit, but John argued that William had assaulted the castle, during which attack <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> and that John had no direct involvement in his death. William's widow blamed John and his eldest son, also called John, for William's death and demanded compensation. After arbitration by the Church, eventually John agreed to pay for 500 masses for William's soul, and to give 250 marks to his widow.|$|E

Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, Taher Jalil Habbush, handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a medical report that said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a change of clothes, he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.|$|E
