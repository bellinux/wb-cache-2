The story of not one, but two relationships was told, several time lines intersected and a new and rather frightening enemy was vanquished without The Doctor ever coming face to face with them". Ross Ruedinger of Slant Magazine believed that the episode was not just the best Doctor Who episode, but also a great episode of the science fiction and horror genre that could allow it to stand alone. He also praised the fear-inducing concept of the Weeping Angels as well the [...] "tenderness of the story and the characters" [...] which were [...] "quite intricate given how much is going on in these 45 minutes".

40|$|Becoming {{a general}} {{practitioner}} {{is too much}} a matter of chance. The curriculum 'walks in through the door'. This is informal and unlikely to be comprehensive. Cognitive, not behavioural skills predominate. Many tutors have little or no grounding in adult education. The career intentions of trainees tend to be overshadowed by their immediate service role. This essay explores the integrated structure of general practice training. The author draws on his experience of 10 years as tutor in Sydney suburban and Tasmanian country practice, and now as State Director of training. He is a student in the University Centre for Education. Four essentials to be considered are: a highly motivated vocational trainee, a comprehensive negotiated curriculum emphasizing behaviour, a wealth of selected experience in refined training positions, and skilled tutors. The essay makes no attempt at an exhaustive analysis of becoming a general practitioner. The purpose is to address these critical <b>featurs</b> of training, and to argue for an approach in tune with the trainee's vision; comprehensive, valid and reliable; not a matter of chance.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 95 - 107. Two {{clusters}} of pans and associated lunette dunes are distinct landscape <b>featurs</b> in the Swartland and Agulhas Plain {{regions of the}} southwestern Cape of South Africa. While occurring in geographic proximity within the Winter Rainfall Region, each of the pan-lunette clusters is hosted by different substrates, subjected to different coastal climate regimes and exhibits different morphology, orientation of features, and sedimentological characteristics. Not only are geomorphic characteristics at variance between regions, but also the alignment of lunettes on the leeside of pans, parallel within the cluster, is at variance with predominant modern wind direction and seasonality of precipitation at both sites, although the difference is more pronounced at Agulhas. In order to elucidate the occurrence and formational processes of these features, a dual-scale approach was employed: a regional cartographic study coupled with detailed local sedimentological analyses. The geomorphic characteristics of these features were quantified using aerial photography and orthophotographic maps. Dry season palaeo-wind direction was inferred from the regional analysis; in Agulhas, winds must have been blowing from WSW during the dry season, similar to modern wet season winds...|$|R

40|$|Extent: 10 p. Composite {{supernova}} remnants (SNRs) {{constitute a}} small subclass of {{the remnants of}} massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observed from both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) located inside of the SNR. These systems represent a unique evolutionary phase of SNRs where observations in the radio, X-ray, and γ-ray regimes allow {{the study of the}} co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. In this article, we report results from observations of the shell-type SNR G[*] 15. 4 + 0. 1 performed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H. E. S. S.) and XMM-Newton. A compact TeV γ-ray source, HESS[*]J 1818 − 154, located in the center and contained within the shell of G[*] 15. 4 + 0. 1 is detected by H. E. S. S. and <b>featurs</b> a spectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of − 2. 3 ± 0. 3 stat ± 0. 2 sys and an integral flux of F(> 0. 42 TeV) = (0. 9 ± 0. 3 stat ± 0. 2 sys) × 10 - 12 [*]cm- 2 [*]s- 1. Furthermore, a recent observation with XMM-Newton reveals extended X-ray emission strongly peaked in the center of G[*] 15. 4 + 0. 1. The X-ray source shows indications of an energy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 [*]keV and more extended emission that fills the entire region within the SNR at lower energies. Together, the X-ray and VHE γ-ray emission provide strong evidence of a PWN located inside the shell of G[*] 15. 4 + 0. 1 and this SNR can therefore be classified as a composite based on these observations. The radio, X-ray, and γ-ray emission from the PWN is compatible with a one-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside the emission region. An unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which is thought to power the PWN, has been detected neither in radio nor in X-ray observations of G[*] 15. 4 + 0. 1. H. E. S. S. Collaboration, A.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Adolescence {{is one of}} the main stage of growth and {{development}} in human. The growth characteristics at this period of life can be predisposing for the onset of various behavioral disorders, delinquency, drug abuse and mental disorders. Considering the increase of adolescents and young adults in population of Iran, immediate recognition of such disorders and their proper management is very significant. Therefore, in this study mental status of the students studying at Sari high schools in 2002 - 2003 was assessed. Materials and methods : This was a descriptive-analytical study done on 1068 high school students of Sari city. Demographic questionnaire consisting of personal <b>featurs</b> and standard tests of GHQ- 28 and SCL- 90 -R were used. Results : Based on the results of this study and GHQ- 28 test, 39. 1 % of the students were suspected of having mental disorder. Also, based on SCL- 90 -R, 58. 8 % of the students were suspected of mental disorder. The prevalence of types of mental disorder based on the SCL- 90 -R test in the cases under study were in the following order: paranoid thinking, inter relation sensitivity, compulsion, aggression, depression, anxiety, psychosis, somatic complain and sickness phobia. Also, the results showed significant difference between mental health of the students with gender, demographic indexes, feeling the need for consultation and education level at all of the 9 -category test. No significant difference was observed between mental health of the students and other indexes considered in this study such as age, place of residence, accommodation, father’s occupation, average of the previous year, mean score of the previous term and the number of the family member. Also, statistically significant correlation was noted between the results of the two tests used in this study. Conclusion : Considering the results of this study and the rate of the individuals suspected for mental disorder, more attention of the authorities and extention of activities in the studentship consultation center is needed in order to solve the mental health problems of the students. Camprehensive programming in order to provide psychiatric consultation services and performance of regular plan and continuous education of the students for mental health and also, considering certain mental health issues on the text could be useful to promote student’s mental health...|$|R

It's ne'ssary {{to take a good}} confident tone With the public; but here, jest amongst us, I own [...] 60 Things look blacker 'n thunder. Ther' 's no use denyin' We're clean out o' money, an' 'most out o' lyin'; Two things a young nation can't mennage without, Ef she wants to look wal at her fust comin' out; For the fust supplies physickle strength, while the second Gives a morril advantage thet's hard to be reckoned: For this latter I'm willin' to du wut I can; For the former you'll hev to consult on a plan,-- Though our fust want (an' this pint I want your best views on) Is plausible paper to print I.O.U.s on. [...] 70 Some gennlemen think it would cure all our cankers In the way o' finance, ef we jes' hanged the bankers; An' I own the proposle 'ud square with my views, Ef their lives wuzn't all thet we'd left 'em to lose. Some say thet more confidence might be inspired, Ef we voted our cities an' towns to be fired,-- A plan thet 'ud suttenly tax our endurance, Coz 'twould be our own bills we should git for th' insurance; But cinders, no matter how sacred we think 'em, Mightn't strike furrin minds ez good sources of income, [...] 80 Nor the people, perhaps, wouldn't like the eclaw O' bein' all turned into paytriots by law. Some want we should buy all the cotton an' burn it, On a pledge, when we've gut thru the war, to return it,-- Then to take the proceeds an' hold them ez security For an issue o' bonds to be met at maturity With an issue o' notes to be paid in hard cash On the fus' Monday follerin' the 'tarnal Allsmash: This hez a safe air, an', once hold o' the gold, 'ud leave our vile plunderers out in the cold, [...] 90 An' might temp' John Bull, ef it warn't for the dip he Once gut from the banks o' my own Massissippi. Some think we could make, by arrangin' the figgers, A hendy home-currency out of our niggers; But it wun't du to lean much on ary sech staff, For they're gittin' tu current a'ready, by half.|$|R
