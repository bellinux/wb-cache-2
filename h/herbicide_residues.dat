If iron deficit chlorosis is suspected then check the pH of the soil with an appropriate test kit or instrument. Take a soil sample at surface and at depth. If the pH is over seven then consider soil remediation that will lower the pH toward the 6.5 - 7 range. Remediation includes: i) adding compost, manure, peat or similar organic matter (warning. Some retail blends of manure and compost have pH in the range 7 - 8 because of added lime. Read the MSDS if available. Beware of <b>herbicide</b> <b>residues</b> in manure. Source manure from a certified organic source.) ii) applying Ammonium Sulphate as a Nitrogen fertilizer (acidifying fertilizer due to decomposition of ammonium ion to nitrate in the soil and root zone) iii) applying elemental Sulphur to the soil (oxidizes {{over the course of}} months to produce sulphate/sulphite and lower pH). Note: adding acid directly e.g. sulphuric/hydrochloric/citric acid is dangerous as you may mobilize metal ions in the soil that are toxic and otherwise bound. Iron can be made available immediately to the plant by the use of iron sulphate or iron chelate compounds. Two common iron chelates are Fe EDTA and Fe EDDHA. Iron sulphate (Iron(II)_sulfate) and iron EDTA are only useful in soil up to PH 7.1 but they {{can be used as a}} foliar spray (Foliar_feeding). Iron EDDHA is useful up to PH 9 (highly alkaline) but must be applied to the soil and in the evening to avoid photodegradation. EDTA in the soil may mobilize Lead, EDDHA does not appear to.|$|E

Wood samples from trees treated with 2, 4 -D [2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid], dicamba [3, 6 -dichloro-oanisic acid], dichlorprop [2 -(2, 4 -dichlorphenoxy) propionic acid], picloram [4 -amino- 3, 5,dtrichloropicolinic acid], and triclopyr (3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyri dinyl) oxy acetic acid contained variable amounts of parent compound residues at 4, 8, and 12 months after application. At {{the time of}} the latter sampling, residues of 2, 4 -D, dicamba, and picloram were ~ 2. 1 mg/kg on a fresh weight basis. Mean residue concentrations of triclopyr and dichlorprop were somewhat higher at 3. 5 and 13. 0 mg/kg, respectively. In a laboratory experiment, samples with known amounts of <b>herbicide</b> <b>residue</b> were subjected to either slow or rapidly burning conditions in a tube furnace. During slow combustion, relatively stable compounds such as 2, 4 -D, dicamba, and dichlorprop were released in significant amounts.

A well-developed fire in a wood stove or fireplace, with active flaming combustion, where temperatures commonly reach 800 - l,OOO”C, should result in greater than 95 % thermal decomposition of the herbicides examined in this study.

Plants containing pesticides residues may then reach the soil during the crop cycle or after harvest. However, the fate in soil of pesticides residues in plants is unknown. Two commonly used foliar herbicides, glyphosate and sulcotrione, 14 C-labeled, were applied on leaves of oilseed rape and/or maize, translocation was studied, and then soil incubations of aerial {{parts of plants}} containing <b>herbicides</b> <b>residues</b> were performed. Soil treated directly with herbicides was used as control. The effects of adjuvants on herbicide plant-absorption and subsequent soil-degradation were also investigated comparing herbicides application as active ingredients and as commercial formulations. The fate in soil of <b>herbicides</b> <b>residues</b> in plants was {{different from that of}} control, and different for glyphosate and sulcotrione. Mineralization in soil of glyphosate in crops decreased compared to control, and amounts of 14 C-extractable residues, mainly composed by the metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and non-extractable residues (NER) increased. In contrast, mineralization in soil of sulcotrione in maize increased compared to control, with a decrease in the 14 C-extractable residues and an increase in NER. The fate of both herbicides was influenced by the type of plant organ in which herbicide was incorporated, because of differences in herbicides bioavailability and organs biodegradability, but not by adjuvants. Absorption of both herbicides in plant delays their subsequent soil-degradation, and particularly, glyphosate persistence in soil could increase from two to six times.

This study is the third step from a series of studies aim to develop bioassay technique to detect the present and quantity of herbicides in soil and water. In this study, bioassay was used to detect movement of paraquat and 2, 4 -D herbicides in soil. Study was carried out using soil column method. Treatments were arranged factorially in a completely randomized block design with 3 replicates. Two ultisol soil types: Podsolik Merah Kuning (PMK) and Latosol Coklat (LC) and 2 post emergence herbicides: paraquat and 2, 4 -D, were tested. To calculate the amount of herbicide using bioassay, each standard curve for paraquat and 2, 4 -D were developed. Using these standard curves, the amount of paraquat and 2, 4 -D was calculated based on the growth rate of caisim as indicator plant. Results showed that bioassay method can be utilized to detect herbicide movement in soil. The amount and the rate of herbicide movement were determined by soil and herbicide types. In PMK, paraquat reached the depth of 20 - 30 cm at 2 weeks after application (WAA), however, after that the amount of paraquat found was very limited. In LC, the movement of paraquat was more limited compared to its movement in PMK. Paraquat reached soil depth of 10 - 20 cm at 2 WAA, afterward paraquat was only detected in soil depth of 0 - 10 cm.

Inappropriate clearing, and also the dieback of large stands of A. marina associated with pollution, have created an interest in methods for revegetation and also {{the need for a}} better understanding of the species physiological tolerances including to <b>herbicide</b> <b>residue.</b> Eco-toxicological studies have so far been exclusively on seedlings because of perceived difficulties cultivating mature plants in controlled environments. Reforestation projects are often associated with low rates of establishment, because of the susceptibility of propagules, seedlings and saplings to wind and wave erosion, as well as flooding and desiccation associated with the natural inter-tidal environment. We report onthe successful excavation, and cultivation in containers with an automated irrigation system of eight mature A. marina plants. It is possible to transplant mature mangroves and achieve significant vegetative growth and also flowering and fruiting within the first year. It is difficult to compare the likely costs of transplanting a more limited number of mature plantsto many propagules. However, we suggest that in situations where reforestation with young propagules, seedlings or saplings has failed because of excessive wash, drowning or smothering, the transplanting of mature mangroves could be a better option...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Three {{experiments}} whose {{objectives were}} to investigate cover crop kill by winter freeze, weed suppression by 'Micah' barley and other spring cereals, and allelopathic potential of cereal covers were {{conducted at the}} Vegetable Research Farm and in the greenhouse and growth chamber facilities at OSU in 1989 / 90. Kill by winter freeze failed under the warm winter of Corvallis in 1989 / 90. Complementary usage of <b>herbicides</b> and <b>residues</b> for weed control is suggested. <b>Residues</b> of <b>herbicide</b> killed 'Micah' barley suppressed (79 - 88...|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} {{substantial}} equivalence [23] {{is used by}} regulators and industry scientists to validate GM-crop quality. Comparative analysis of composition and comparative testing in animal feeding trials are still the two fundamental methods in use for assessment of substantial equivalence of products from herbicide-tolerant crops and other genetically modified biomass intended for consumption. Guidelines for such analysis and testing aim {{to ensure that the}} new varieties are as safe and nutritious as conventional plants. Therefore, such testing includes risk assessments which anticipate potentially adverse effects stemming from qualitative differences or undesirable constituents [23, 24]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) established the Codex Alimentarius commission in 1963 to develop harmonized international food standards, guidelines and codes of practice to protect the health of the consumers. The aim of the Codex regulation is to anticipate not only direct risk, but also indirect/unanticipated risk [25]. Thus, {{it is interesting to note}} that the Codex Alimentarius commission in 1999 – 2001 had protracted evaluations on the possibility of establishing specific and unique standards for <b>herbicide</b> <b>residue</b> levels in herbicide-tolerant GM crops [26]. The reports of this regulatory process document that this question was seen relevant at that time. However, the result of this process was a decision not to establish separate residue limits for herbicide-tolerant cultivars.|$|R
