500|$|Although {{the town}} of Birjand was small, it had a Russian consulate. Niedermayer {{correctly}} guessed additional British forces were present. He therefore had {{to decide whether to}} bypass the town by the northern route, patrolled by Russians, or the southern route, where British patrols were present. He could not send any reconnaissance. His Persian escort's advice that the desert north of Birjand was notoriously harsh convinced him that this would be the route his enemies would least expect him to take. Sending a small decoy party south-east to spread the rumour that the main body would soon follow, Niedermayer headed for the north. His feints and disinformation were taking effect. The pursuing forces were spread thin, hunting for what they believed at times to be a large force. At other times they looked for a second, non-existent German force heading east from Kermanshah. The group now moved both day and night. From nomads, Niedermayer learnt the whereabouts of the British patrols. He lost men through exhaustion, defection, and desertion. On occasions, deserters would take the party's spare water and horses at gunpoint. Nonetheless, by the second week of August the forced march had brought the expedition close to the Birjand-Meshed road, eighty miles from Afghanistan. Here the Kaiser's bulkier and heavier gifts to the Emir, including the German wireless sets, were buried in the desert for later retrieval. Since all caravans entering Afghanistan must cross the road, Niedermayer assumed it was watched by British spies. An advance patrol reported seeing British columns. With scouts on the lookout, the expedition crossed under the cover of night. Only one obstacle, the so-called [...] "Mountain Path", remained before they were clear of the Anglo-Russian cordon. This heavily patrolled path, thirty miles further east, was the site of Entente telegraph lines for maintaining communication with remote posts. However, even here, Niedermayer escaped. His group had covered 255 miles in seven days, through the barren Dasht-e <b>Kavir.</b> On 19 August 1915 the expedition reached the Afghan frontier. Mahendra Pratap's memoirs describe the group as left with approximately fifty men, less than half the number who had set out from Isfahan seven weeks earlier. Dr. Becker's camel caravan was lost and he was later captured by Russians. Only 70 of the 170 horses and baggage animals survived.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kavir</b> Buzurg, meaning Great <b>Kavir</b> (great salt marsh), lies in {{the center}} of the Dasht-e <b>Kavir,</b> which is a desert located in the middle of the Iranian plateau. The <b>Kavir</b> Buzurg covers an area of about 320 km by 160 km. It is {{separated}} from the neighboring kavirs by a surrounding ring of sandy hills. This is located in a rain shadow desert that receives little moisture. When water evaporates from the salt marshes, it creates crusts of salt that covers a dark saline mush. These crusts are easily penetrated by a traveler, making journeying across the <b>kavir</b> dangerous. This region is nearly uninhabited, with humans primarily dwelling on the surrounding hills and mountains.|$|E
