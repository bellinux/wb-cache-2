5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> {{of humans and}} other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{refers to}} an {{experimental}} and numerical evaluation of a polyurea coating layer influence on the dynamic behaviour of OL 50 specimens. Mechanical quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests were performed in axial loading conditions, for 2 [*]mm steel plate specimens. Several metallic specimens have been previously coated with 1. 5 [*]mm and 3 [*]mm respectively thickness polyurea layer and tested <b>in</b> traction. <b>The</b> findings {{results indicate that the}} presence of polyurea changes the loading pattern of metallic material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>necking</b> area. <b>In</b> terms of polyurea coated metal specimens fracture, there was clearly observed a change of fracture limit.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
