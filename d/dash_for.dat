5|$|Saint Kitts and Nevis {{had seven}} {{participants}} at the 2016 Summer Olympics, led by team captain Antoine Adams. At 40 years old, Kim Collins was the first 40-year old to run a sub 10 second 100 meter <b>dash,</b> <b>for</b> his fifth consecutive Olympic Games. He was the oldest sprinter at these Games. Collins advanced the furthest of any Saint Kitts and Nevis athlete, reaching the semifinals of the 100 meter dash. He finished sixth in his heat {{with a time of}} 10.12 seconds and did not advance to the finals.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming <b>dash</b> <b>for</b> the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. They were {{part of a group of}} about 40 people that had made a <b>dash</b> <b>for</b> an iron gate that had been left open. After this breach, stand-by officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people had turned up to protest against Griffin.|$|E
5|$|The event's fifth leg saw a {{breakaway}} succeed; {{the group}} began with five riders and {{was reduced to}} three riders – Erik Breukink, Filippo Casagrande, and Rolf Sørensen – before the finish. Casagrande won the three-man sprint to the line to take the day. The sixth stage resulted in a field sprint that was won by Nicola Minali. The seventh stage featured an undulating stage profile, with a slight uphill finish. On the race's final incline, Rominger attacked but his move was marked by several general classification contenders. Maurizio Fondriest managed to edge out Rominger in a <b>dash</b> <b>for</b> the line which saw him gain four seconds on Rominger due to time bonuses. The eighth stage featured the first summit finish of the race, to Massiccio del Sirino. The day's breakaway was established {{early on in the}} day and managed to reach the final climb before the pursuing peloton. Stage winner Laudelino Cubino attacked with eight kilometers to go and rode solo until the finish; the time he gained during the stage allowed him to move into third overall.|$|E

5|$|General Sun led {{the charge}} against Cao Qin right outside Donghua Gate, while Ma Ang {{approached}} Cao Qin's forces from the rear in a flank. Cao was forced to withdraw and set up temporary camp at Dongan Gate. By midday, Sun Tang's forces had killed two of Cao Qin's brothers (Sun personally shot the second with an arrow after Cao Qin's brother led cavalry charges against imperial troops). Sun's forces had also severely wounded Cao Qin in both his arms; his forces took up position in the Great Eastern Market and Lantern Market northeast of Dongan Gate, while Sun deployed artillery units against the rebels. Cao lost his third brother, Cao Duo (曹铎), while attempting to flee out of Beijing by the Chaoyang Gate. Cao made another <b>dash</b> <b>for</b> the northeastern gates of the capital (Anding Gate and Dongzhi Gate), {{and then back to}} Chaoyang Gate, all of which remained closed. Finally, Cao fled with his remaining forces to fortify his residential compound in Beijing. Ming troops under Sun Tang and the newly arrived Marquis of Huichang, Sun Jizong (孙继宗), stormed the residence. To avoid arrest and execution, Cao Qin committed suicide by throwing himself down a well. Imperial troops recovered his body and then decapitated it.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, the {{supporting}} British armour {{was nowhere to}} be seen and the artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising the degree to which his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his <b>dash</b> <b>for</b> help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were {{particularly interested in the}} work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In {{the last days of the}} war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a <b>dash</b> <b>for</b> Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E

25|$|Either an {{ellipsis}} or an em dash can indicate aposiopesis, {{the rhetorical}} device {{by which a}} sentence is stopped short not because of interruption, but because the speaker is too emotional or pensive to continue.
