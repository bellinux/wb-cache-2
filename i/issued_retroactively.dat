50|$|For a {{very brief}} period from 1979 until early 1981, {{issuance}} of the G-1 to new USN, USMC, and USCG flight crew personnel (i.e., officer flight students and newly designated enlisted Naval Aircrewman) was discontinued as a budgetary economy action, with those personnel being issued summer weight green Nomex flight jackets identical to those issued to their U.S. Air Force counterparts. Replacement of worn-out G-1 jackets for extant Naval Aviation personnel was also discontinued during this period. This action was reversed by Secretary of the Navy action in early 1981, and those USN, USMC, and USCG flight-crew personnel who had not received G-1 jackets were <b>issued</b> one <b>retroactively.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Flight Time & Big Easy were {{initially}} checked in 3rd; however, they were <b>retroactively</b> <b>issued</b> a 30-minute penalty when Ron & Christina told Phil that the Globetrotters {{had taken their}} fanny pack by accident and did not return it to them. Ron & Christina were moved up to 3rd, and Kisha & Jen, who checked in within the half-hour penalty period, were checked in for 4th, ultimately dropping the Globetrotters to 5th.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} for countries and educational institutions located outside of the European Higher Education Area to realize that Diploma Supplements cannot be <b>retroactively</b> <b>issued,</b> hence why students who graduated before their institution's country became signatory to the Bologna Convention cannot possibly have a diploma supplement for that degree. Consequently, requesting a Diploma Supplement from a student who graduated from a European university in 1995 or earlier is nonsensical since the Bologna Process was not even in place before that date.|$|R
500|$|The last {{of these}} four stories, [...] "Metamorphosis", was {{published}} as a spin-off limited series between May and August of 1997, {{as a result of}} a request Norm Breyfogle made to DC Comics for employment following the comic book crash of the mid-1990s. [...] Darren Vincenzo suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in, among them an Anarky mini-series written by Alan Grant, which was eventually the project decided upon. The Anarky limited series was received with positive reviews and sales, and was later declared by Grant to be among his [...] "career highlights". With the continuation of the series as an ongoing monthly in 1999, these four <b>issues</b> were <b>retroactively</b> categorized as the first Anarky volume. [...] Both volumes of Anarky are unique as the only comic books ever thematically based on the philosophy of Neo-Tech.|$|R

5000|$|With six holes {{remaining}} {{in the final round}} on Sunday, Thompson was notified by officials that she had been <b>retroactively</b> <b>issued</b> two penalties on her third round score. The first was a two-stroke penalty for incorrectly placing a marked ball on the 17th green, and the second for subsequently signing an incorrect scorecard, also two strokes, raising her 54-hole score from 203 (−13) to 207 (−9). The review was prompted by a report from a television viewer via the LPGA website on Sunday. The ruling was widely criticized for having allowed the outcome of the major championship to be affected by a [...] "called-in" [...] infraction, and the infraction itself being having moved the ball less than an inch away from the mark.|$|R
5000|$|As of September 2014, the District of Columbia has a [...] "May-Issue" [...] {{licensing}} policy, {{like many}} states, where applicants {{are required to}} show [...] "good reason" [...] for needing a concealed carry permit. The District of Columbia had bans in place for both open and concealed carry, which were ultimately struck down as unconstitutional on July 24, 2014. The lawsuit {{that led to this}} decision was originally filed on August 6, 2009, to compel the district to issue permits to carry weapons. Judge Frederick Scullin, the United States District Judge who considered the case, initially didn't issue a stay of his ruling, effectively legalizing permitless open and concealed carry in the District. However, on July 29, 2014 Scullin <b>issued</b> an order <b>retroactively</b> staying his initial order until October 22, 2014.|$|R
40|$|On September 29, 2009, Treasury <b>issued</b> {{regulations}} <b>retroactively</b> {{extending the}} six-year limitations period for income tax deficiencies resulting from basis overstatements. In its May 6 Intermountain decision, the Tax Court unanimously invalidated those regulations, but on divided rationales. The government has appealed. lntermountain is a must-read for tax academics and practitioners. It {{is among the}} richest decisions on the procedural and substantive validity of tax regulations. Moreover, the opinions in the case, subsequent cases on the issue,. and commentary on these opinions and cases present genuine opportunity for improvement of the law. This report has five sections. Section I sketches the growing significance of administrative law in tax law. The days of comfortable insularity are drawing to a close. To maintain dexterity {{in the years to}} come, tax practitioners and tax scholars will increasingly need to possess competence in broader principles of administrative law. Intermountain is a harbinger of that growing necessity. Section II describes the background of the case, summarizes the three opinions rendered in it, and evaluates the result reached. I think that the Intermountain result is correct but (in terms of the arguments in the opinions) only on the procedural ground advanced by two concurring judges: that the regulations violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for failure to satisfy the notice-and-comment requirements. Sections III, IV, and V address some important aspects of Intermountain. My treatment is selective. Leaving some material for future discussion, I delve into three of the interesting veins of the case, including issues appearing in the opinions as well as issues omitted from them. Section Ill discusses whether the regulations at issue in the case are legislative or interpretive in nature. This matters to the APA argument. Unless another exception applies (and none does in Intermountain), legislative regulations must go through notice-and-comment, but interpretive regulations need not. I conclude that the challenged regulations are legislative, and I urge tax practitioners to refine their definitions of legislative and interpretive regulations. Section IV examines the light shed by Intermountain on the Brand X rule as to when agency rulemaking may displace prior judicial interpretations of statutes. I conclude that Intermountain and similar cases may help at one level: whether “magic words” must appear in the judicial interpretations. However, they are unlikely to help at two other levels: what should be done if the precedents’ characterizations are unsupportable, and whether the Brand X analysis of the underlying statute turns on the statute’s language or also embraces pertinent legislative history. Section V explores two arguments that weren’t considered in the Intermountain opinions but that might be brought against the temporary regulations in future cases. One such argument is that the temporary regulations have not gone through the notice-and-comment process, and Chevron deference is rarely accorded to administrative rules and interpretations that were not subject to this process. This argunent is of short-term significance. It will evaporate after the regulations in their proposed form complete the process. The other argument has to do with whether Congress explicitly or implicitly authorized Treasury to promulgate regulations extending section 6501 (e) to overstated basis situations. The explicit authorization argument involves a contention I will develop at greater length in a future article. Briefly, the statutory authority under which the temporary regulations were promulgated allows Treasury to “prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of” the code. It is arguable – although far from certain – that this language authorizes only rules that implement code provisions, not rules that extend code provisions to situations beyond the provisions’ original scope. If Congress did not explicitly authorize the rules at issue, it probably did not implicitly authorize them, either. Section 6501 is a highly detailed and articulated statute; courts usually are disinclined to allow other, extrinsic rules to be read into such statutes to modify them...|$|R
