5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could <b>do</b> <b>except</b> alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
25|$|National {{military}} service is mandatory for any Israeli {{over the age}} of 18, {{with the exception of the}} Arab Muslim and Christian population (currently estimated at around 20% of the Israeli population) and many ultra-Orthodox Jews (currently estimated at around 8% of the Israeli Jewish population and rising steeply). Druze and Circassian men are liable, by agreement with their community leaders. Members of the exempted groups can still volunteer, but very few <b>do,</b> <b>except</b> for the Bedouin where a relatively large number of men have tended to volunteer. The Israeli Jewish population and especially the secular Israeli Jewish population, is currently the only population group in Israel that has a mandatory military conscription for both men and womenâ€”a fact that has caused much resentment from within the Jewish community towards the non-serving population, some of which are demanding that all the Israeli citizens share an equal amount of responsibilities, whether in the Israeli army or as part of Sherut Leumi.|$|E

500|$|The year 2001 was {{a disappointing}} one for Mukerji. In a review {{for her first}} release of the year, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, a drama based on {{surrogate}} childbirth, film critic Sukanya Verma found Mukerji to be [...] "handicapped with a role that doesn't give her much scope besides weeping and sobbing" [...] and preferred the [...] "meatier" [...] role of her co-star Preity Zinta. In Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai and , films that failed to garner praise, Mukerji played the love interests of Abhishek Bachchan and Anil Kapoor respectively. In a review for the latter, Sarita Tanwar wrote that [...] " [...] has very little to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> being part of some magnificently picturised songs".|$|E
500|$|Koubek's {{architectural}} {{philosophy has}} been described as cosmetic and practical.

[...] "There is nothing left for the architect to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> apply the cosmetics," [...] Koubek said. Koubek limited his [...] "cosmetics" [...] to the needs and budgets of his clients, often falling back on the design aesthetics of Marcel Breuer, I. M. Pei, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. His work was described as restrained, and an unnamed D.C. city planning official once described Koubek's work as [...] "last year's Skidmore, Owings and Merrill." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy wrote [...] "following on {{from that}} game-changing two-part premiere, this week's Doctor Who {{provides}} us with a real change of pace, with a moody and atmospheric pre-titles sequence setting the scene for a far more traditional adventure." [...] Jeffery praised the performance of Bonneville, but was critical of Cole's role for her not being [...] "given much to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> float around and look ethereal," [...] but added [...] "the English model certainly looks the part, with well-judged special effects aiding her performance as the beautiful yet unsettling Siren." [...] Jeffery also thought that Amy's revival of Rory was [...] "well-acted by both Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill," [...] but criticised the series for the numerous [...] "Rory's dead" [...] scenes, negatively comparing Rory with the South Park character Kenny McCormick. Jeffery rated the episode three stars out of five for being somewhat underwhelming in comparison with [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] and [...] "Day of the Moon".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Saunders was determined to serve in the armed forces. Patriotism and his family's history of soldiering both played a major part in his decision. His father suggested that he wait six months; according to Reg, [...] "They were talking about this war being all over in six months with the Maginot Line and all the other garbage that we were told... But we waited six months and the duck season was over so there was no more shooting to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> go to war". Saunders enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 24April 1940, joining up with friends he had made while playing Australian rules football. [...] The armed forces later adopted a policy to accept only persons [...] "substantially of European origin or descent", but at the time Saunders encountered no barriers to his enlistment. He recalled that his fellow soldiers [...] "were not colour-conscious", and that during training in northern Queensland his white mates would sit alongside him in the [...] "Aboriginal" [...] section of movie theatres. His natural leadership qualities gained him temporary promotions in quick succession: within six weeks of enlistment he was a lance corporal, and after three months he made sergeant.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "Beneath the wobbly pratfalls and the scatological setpieces, there's {{no denying}} the film's mean-spirited kick, or its more-than-passing {{interest}} in what makes its women tick." [...] The Hollywood Reporter's critic Todd McCarthy said: [...] "It would have helped if director Nick Cassavetes had something resembling a sure hand at comedy." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film grade C-, saying [...] "All of a sudden, a spotted Great Dane squats {{in the middle of}} a Manhattan apartment and out plop several gleaming, glistening CGI turds. It's one of those cases where a Hollywood movie inadvertently summarizes itself in a single shot." [...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Line to line, it's fresher than any number of guy-centric [...] "Hangover"-spawned affairs, despite director Cassavetes' lack of flair for slapstick." [...] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr gave the film one out of four stars and said, [...] "It's [...] "The First Wives Club" [...] rewritten for younger, less demanding audiences, or a [...] "9 to 5" [...] with absolutely nothing at stake." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice said, [...] "The Other Woman doesn't give these actresses much to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> look ridiculous, if not sneaky and conniving." ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Ella Brown is {{the only child of}} a poor widower. Their home is {{in a small town in}} the Middle West, and Ella has never seen New York (City), although she has always wanted to go there. Her father, finding times hard, decides to take a chance in the gold fields of Alaska, and when the play opens, is about to start there. He leaves Ella in the care of an aunt, a sour old person who runs a boarding house, who promptly makes a drudge out of the girl. As she has no other relatives, there is nothing for her to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> submit. Sitting in her room one evening, tired after a day's hard work, she looks at her two treasured magazines, one showing views of her pet city and the other giving the latest fashion. The girl is filled with a longing to travel and wear pretty clothes, and falls asleep. In her dream she is transported to New York, where she finds enough money to enable her to buy all the pretty things she admires. Ella greatly enjoys her visit, and is extremely unhappy when she wakes up. But she finds that her dream will become reality before long, for her father has returned from the gold fields with a fortune and a desire to fulfill all the wishes of his pretty daughter." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E

2500|$|Titus Flavius Josephus, a {{contemporary}} historian, sometime high-ranking {{officer in the}} Roman army, and commander of the rebels in the Jewish revolt, describes the Roman people {{as if they were}} [...] "born ready armed." [...] At the time of the two historians, Roman society had already evolved an effective military and had used it to defend itself against the Etruscans, the Italics, the Greeks, the Gauls, the maritime empire of Carthage, and the Macedonian kingdoms.

If you don't like the genre, Bayonetta will not change your mind." [...] GameSpot's video review lamented duller graphics and inconsistent frame rates for its PS3 port. The Associated Press review opined that [...] "Bayonetta feels like a game that would have blown me away 15 years ago. (It even pays tribute to Sega arcade classics like Space Harrier and Hang-On.) While it introduces an exotic new vision, it doesn't give us anything to <b>do</b> <b>except</b> fight, and its strictly linear story prevents you from exploring its distinctive universe.

2500|$|Because {{of their}} native environment, the cattle are very hardy and can survive the Scottish winters, which are {{typically}} harsh, with snowfall and storms. Cows typically weigh [...] and bulls weigh [...] Calves are usually born smaller than is acceptable for the market, so crossbreeding with dairy cattle {{is needed for}} veal production. The cattle are naturally polled and black in colour. They typically mature earlier than other native British breeds such as the Hereford or North Devon. However, {{in the middle of}} the 20th century a new strain of cattle called the Red Angus emerged. The United States does not accept Red Angus cattle into herd books, while the UK and Canada <b>do.</b> <b>Except</b> for their colour genes, there is no genetic difference between black and red Angus, but they are regarded as different breeds in the US. However, there have been claims that black angus are more sustainable to cold weather, though unconfirmed.|$|E
2500|$|In simply {{narrative}} terms, Roquentin's nausea {{arises from}} his near-complete detachment from other people, his not needing much interaction {{with them for}} daily necessities: [...] "the fact of his alienation from others is important; as his own work ceases to entertain and to occupy him, Roquentin has nothing that could distract him from the business of existing in its simplest forms." [...] As a practical matter, he could solve his problem by getting a job; but, as a device for developing the novel's theme, his aloneness {{is a way of}} making him (and the reader) recognize that there is nothing inherent in the objective nature of the world that would give any necessary meaning to whatever actions he chose, and therefore nothing to restrict his freedom. [...] "is perception of the world around him becomes unstable as objects are disengaged from their usual frames of reference," [...] and he is forced to recognize that freedom is inescapable and that therefore creating a meaning for his life is his own responsibility. [...] "Nothing makes us act the way we <b>do,</b> <b>except</b> our own personal choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dawn of {{the second}} day blasted the hopes of the defenders.

(Somehow a ship {{was able to get}} in, but rather than bringing in more troops she carried away some of the wounded.) The fleet initially kept in motion, but they soon found that they were out of range of the guns in the fort. After that, the ships did not alter their positions, but poured their fire into the fort with no danger of reply. There was nothing the men in the forts could <b>do</b> <b>except</b> endure. After about three hours, Barron called a council of the officers, and they decided to seek terms, even though casualties had been quite light.
