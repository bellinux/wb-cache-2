5|$|The {{abundance}} of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or <b>heavy</b> <b>spar),</b> a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
60|$|Sure enough, Oliver {{appeared}} at the moment, dragging a <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> behind him. Several of the men {{appeared at}} the same time, staggering through the bushes, with various loads of wreckage, which they flung down, and noisily began discussing their experiences as they lighted the fires and prepared breakfast.|$|E

60|$|After {{the coal}} was landed they loaded loose {{ironwork}} and towed <b>heavy</b> <b>spars</b> ashore, and Walthew held out somehow until darkness fell, when he paddled {{back to the}} Enchantress with a swarm of mosquitos buzzing round his face.|$|R

60|$|Jimmy {{moved the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>spar,</b> the boat lifted one side {{an inch or}} two, and Moran, lying on the deck, leaned down toward the water. Jimmy, {{dropping}} down beside him, saw a rough, white line traced along the planking where the water had lapped the hull. It {{looked as if it}} had been made by a blunt saw.|$|E
60|$|The natives {{had watched}} the {{proceedings}} with great interest. Quite a crowd of canoes gathered round the ship, and were greatly surprised at seeing the <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> raised by the sheers and dropped into its place; and they replied to the hearty cheers that rose from the crew and passengers when this was accomplished by wild yells and cries and the sounding of their horns.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, the {{bowsprit}} {{went with}} the strain when she rose, having buried herself halfway up the waist; and the topmast snapped like a carrot, a moment later. That was the worst dive we made. There {{is no doubt that}} getting rid of the leverage of the bowsprit, right up in her eyes, eased her a good bit; and as the topmast was a pretty <b>heavy</b> <b>spar,</b> too, that also helped." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{captain of}} the Bonito had lashed {{together}} some <b>heavy</b> <b>spars</b> and thrown them overboard, having fastened a strong rope to them, and was riding head to the waves by means of this sea anchor, {{at a distance of}} about half a mile from the conflict. A cry of grief and rage had arisen when the crew saw that one of their galleys was disabled, and their excitement became intense when they saw the unequal struggle which Pisani was maintaining.|$|R
50|$|Cantilever wings {{require a}} much <b>heavier</b> <b>spar</b> than would {{otherwise}} be needed in cable-stayed designs. However, as {{the size of an}} aircraft increases, the additional weight penalty decreases.Eventually a line was crossed in the 1920s, and designs increasingly turned to the cantilever design.By the 1940s almost all larger aircraft used the cantilever exclusively, even on smaller surfaces such as the horizontal stabilizer, with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E of 1939-41 being one of the last World War II fighters in frontline service to have bracing struts for its stabilizer.|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked at}} the craft, which was a {{half-decked}} boat, evidently fitted with a center-board, of the broad-beamed shallow type common on the American coast. She carried no bowsprit, her lofty mast was stepped almost in her bows, and the combination of <b>heavy</b> <b>spars,</b> short body, and wide, flat stern, presaged difficulties for an unskilled helmsman when running before any strength of breeze. [...] "I think you have some reason for your misgivings," [...] I said. [...] "If the wind freshens much I should almost recommend you to camp here all night." ...|$|R
60|$|They slacked another rope, {{making the}} gaff sink farther down, {{after which they}} tied up about a yard of the inner bottom corner of the sail {{to the foot of}} the mast. This was {{comparatively}} easy, but it was different when, standing in the water on the lee deck, they grabbed the tackle beneath the boom and endeavored to pull the leach, or outer edge, of the mainsail down. It would not come, and the <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> struck them as it jerked in board, flinging Frank off into the well.|$|E
60|$|Out of {{the ruin}} of the cabin {{appeared}} Margaret and Betty, the former very pale and frightened, and the latter muttering prayers, but, as it chanced, both uninjured. Clinging to the tangled ropes they crept forward, seeking refuge in the waist of the ship, for the <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> still worked and rolled above them, resting on {{the wreck of the}} cabin and the bulwarks, whence presently it slid into the sea. By the stump of the broken mainmast they halted, their long locks streaming in the gale, and here it was that Margaret caught sight of Peter lying upon his back, his face red with blood, and sliding to and fro as the vessel rolled.|$|E
60|$|She swung {{on before}} the sea {{as he put}} up his helm, {{followed}} close by a comber that reared its crest astern, her boom flung on end with the patch of wet mainsail swelling like a balloon. Moran and Bethune were desperately busy with the sheet, for safety depended on their speed. Jimmy moved his wheel another spoke, and sail and <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> swung over, while the Cetacea, coming round, buried her lee deck in the sea. With a wild plunge she shook off the water, and, while Bethune and his comrade flattened in the sheets, drove out to windward away from the dangerous shoal. Since they could not reach the bight, she would be safer in open water.|$|E
60|$|After a stay {{of about}} two weeks, the Irrawaddy had her <b>heavy</b> Indian <b>spars</b> {{replaced}} with Canadian pine, and her kayar shrouds with hempen ones. She then mustered her pagans, and hoisted sail for London.|$|R
60|$|Greenly made no answer, {{though he}} {{perfectly}} {{understood that the}} loss of a mast would almost certainly ensure the loss of the ship, did one of his own <b>heavier</b> <b>spars</b> go. But this was Sir Gervaise's greatest weakness as a commander, and he knew it would be useless to attempt persuading him to suffer a single ship under his order to pass the enemy nearer than he went himself in the Plantagenet. This was what he called covering his ships; though it amounted to no more than putting all of them in the jeopardy that happened to be unavoidable, as regarded one or two.|$|R

60|$|The craft {{was coming}} round with her stern to the wind, {{and as she}} did so the canoe came up {{on the top of a}} sea and struck her with a crash. Frank had, however, no thought to spare for her. He was {{dragging}} at the mainsheet as the big boom tilted up into the darkness above his head, while the sloop rolled heavily. Then the upper part of the bagging sail swung over with a bang and he whipped the rope around something as the <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> followed it. The sloop rolled at the same time until half her deck was in the sea, the sheet was torn furiously through his hands, and the canoe hit her with another heavy thud as she swayed up again. Then it drove astern, and Frank had space to gather his breath and look about him as they swept on into smoother water.|$|E
60|$|No sooner was the spar {{alongside}} than {{a couple}} of sailors lowered themselves down and passed ropes round it. These ropes were then passed through blocks and taken to the capstan. The bars were fitted and seized by a dozen men. The boatswain's whistle sounded, and starting their anchor song the men tramped round and round, the ropes tightened, and the <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> was parbuckled up on to the deck. No sooner was it got on board than the four chiefs who had before visited the ship came alongside. There was another talk, and they were presented with a considerable number of presents for themselves and followers as a reward for their service in sending off the spar. Mr. Atherton and Wilfrid did not approach the group of passengers round the chiefs, keeping their attention vigilantly upon the boats, from which the danger, if it existed, would come.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, sir, how was I to {{know that}} any one in the ship would think a lugger could be seen eight or ten leagues? That's a long bit of water, sir; {{and it would take}} a <b>heavy</b> ship's <b>spars</b> to rise high enough for such a sight." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of April 11, 1809 Cochrane floated in on the flood-tide aboard the {{foremost}} explosion vessel with the other explosion ships following. Once he had reached the boom, Cochrane lit the fuse of the vessel {{and he and his}} handful of men swarmed into their boat, only to discover that they had left their pet dog behind, which they went back to rescue. They managed to escape with their dog just in time. The explosion ships succeeded in breaking the mile-long boom of <b>heavy</b> <b>spars</b> and chains the French had placed to block the British ships from engaging the French. Unable to see clearly in the smoke, the panicked French gunners fired into the line of protecting frigates. Anchor cables were hastily cut to escape the surge of flame, and without sails, the ships piled up on the shoals.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} mineral deposits are the ores blue lead (galena), zincblende (sphalerite), fools gold (pyrite), arsenical iron (arsenopyrite), argentiferous {{grey copper ore}} (freibergite), dark-red silver ores (Pyrargyrite), and silver glance.

5000|$|... #Caption: A {{portion of}} a model {{depicting}} a manual capstan in use. The sailors would coordinate the rhythm of their movements by singing {{a particular type of}} sea shanty as they walked around the capstan.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{disadvantages}} to a tall rig. Firstly, {{it makes the}} boat less stable. If the sails are tall, the wind tends to push the boat over (the center of effort of the sail pushes sideways higher on the mast). A boat is also more tippy {{if it has a}} taller mast or <b>heavy</b> <b>spars</b> high up (such as the gaff on a gaff rig). An outrigger, ballast, and/or a long keel is needed to keep the boat upright. Secondly, a taller rig makes it harder to hold the mast onto the boat (with the standing rigging). Generally, taller rigs are more highly stressed structures than shorter rigs. This makes them more expensive and more fragile for a given strength of material. Stronger, cheaper modern materials are one reason why shorter, squarer rigs are becoming rare.|$|R
60|$|Now {{commenced}} {{much the}} most laborious and {{critical part of}} the service that Captain Truck had undertaken, if we except the collision with the Arabs--that of towing all the <b>heavy</b> <b>spars</b> of a large ship, in one raft, in the open sea, near a coast, and with the wind blowing on shore. It is true he was strong-handed, being able to put ten oars in the launch, and four in all the other boats; but, after making sail, and pulling steadily for an hour, {{it was discovered that}} all their exertions would not enable them to reach the ship, if the wind stood, before the succeeding day. The drift to leeward, or towards the beach, was seriously great, every heave of the sea setting them bodily down before it; {{and by the time they}} were half a mile to the southward, they were obliged to anchor, in order to keep clear of the breakers, which by this time extended fully a mile from shore.|$|R
50|$|Roberts served aboard Penelope until 26 May 1807, when Captain William Robert Broughton took {{command of}} , a larger 74-gun Ship of the Line. How {{many members of}} his crew Captain Broughton took with him to Illustrious is not known; that Roberts, {{at the age of}} 18, was one of them, is proof that his Captain valued his service. Upon joining Illustrious, Roberts was made a Master's mate. Roberts was again on a ship that was to enter into combat. On the night of 11 April 1809, a British fleet of 25 ships {{attacked}} a powerful squadron of French ships anchored in the Basque Roads, a sheltered bay on the Biscay shore of France, bounded by the Ile d’Oléron to the west and Île de Ré to the north. The Battle of Basque Roads was initiated when the British sent several explosion ships into the Roads to blow holes in a mile-long boom of <b>heavy</b> <b>spars</b> and chains the French had placed to prevent enemy vessels from reaching their warships.|$|R
50|$|The {{birth of}} a small scale iron {{processing}} industry {{in the district of}} Olpe, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany was favoured by deposits of iron ore and <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> as well as an abundance of water and woods. Wendener Hütte was founded in 1728 close to the village of the same name near Wenden at a stream of the name Bigge.The founders where Peter and Johann Ermert from Betzdorf to whom the Elector Clement August, Archbishop of Cologne, had given a concession.Some years later Wendener Hütte came into possession of the Remy family which counts among the pioneers of the German iron industry.|$|E
50|$|A {{difficulty}} with a thin, high aspect ratio wooden wing {{is that a}} very strong and therefore <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> is needed, {{with the result that}} the Spillo had the highest wing loading of any glider of its time. It used a single double box spar with thick laminated wood flanges and three vertical plywood webs. There were poplar ribs; the wing, including the ailerons was skinned with plywood, carefully smoothed and filled to follow accurately the NACA non-laminar flow airfoil. Upper surface hinged ailerons reached the wing tip and occupied about 36% of the span, though they were later slightly extended. In plan the wings were straight tapered, with a tip to root chord ratio of 0.30, ending with small, streamlined bodies known as salmons. Initially there were no flaps, but quarter span long gapless spoilers extended below the wing at mid-chord.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} development of the area depended mostly on iron ore and <b>heavy</b> <b>spar</b> deposits {{as well as an}} abundance of wood and water. In 1855 there were 7 smelting works in the district of Olpe, 5 of which lay in the Wenden municipal area. While most smelting works produced pig iron, the Wendener Hütte, a mill founded by Johannes Elmert in 1728, made crude steel. Like others which fired their blast furnaces with locally produced charcoal, the Wendener Hütte lost out to the developing coal-based steel industry in the Ruhr Area. The Wendener Hütte closed down in 1866. In the years after World War II the majority of the local population was working in agriculture. But when farming changed to more intensive farming with larger farms specialising in cattle and dairy farming, most small farmers gave up. People shifted out of farming and sought employment in manufacturing in neighbouring Olpe and the Siegerland.|$|E
60|$|Billy Byrne had {{not been}} {{scrapping}} with third- and fourth-rate <b>heavies,</b> and <b>sparring</b> with real, live ones for nothing. The mate's fist whistled through empty air; the blear-eyed hunk of clay that had seemed such easy prey to him was metamorphosed on the instant into an alert, catlike bundle of steel sinews, and Billy Byrne swung that awful right with the pile-driver weight, that even The Big Smoke himself had acknowledged respect for, straight to the short ribs of his antagonist.|$|R
25|$|As designed, the R.VI {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines were mounted internally in the fuselage, and transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of tailwheels. The fuselage was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft. The Maybach engines had been a never-ending source of trouble on the R.II, R.III, and R.IV, and during 1916, the engines of the R.III, R.IV, R.V, and R.VI were replaced with Benz Bz.IV engines either at the factory or in the field, while the R.II received the more powerful Mercedes D.IVa. The latter powerplant was also selected for the R.VII, still under construction at the time. Apart from the new engines, the R.VII also received extensive modifications while still at the factory, including overall strengthening to take the greater weight of the heavier Mercedes engines, as well as changes to the fuel tanks, propellers, and undercarriage. The wings were completely redesigned to incorporate <b>heavier</b> <b>spars</b> and a new rib section and gained two extra bays, to provide a greater span.|$|R
