5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep <b>driving</b> <b>while</b> looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, {{those used in}} harness, and those destined for meat production. Horses may be {{automatically}} registered if at least 87.5 percent of their ancestors (seven out of eight) were registered Norman Cobs. Purebred stallions may not be bred more than 70 times per year. Foals produced through artificial insemination and embryo transfer may be registered, but cloned horses may not. In general, breeders look to produce horses with good gaits and an aptitude for <b>driving,</b> <b>while</b> keeping the conformation that makes the Norman Cob one of nine French draft breeds.|$|E

50|$|Texting <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> {{received}} {{greater attention}} in the late 2000s, corresponding to {{a rise in the}} number of text messages being sent. Over a year approximately 2,000 teens die from texting <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> Texting <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> attracted interest in the media after several highly publicized car crashes were caused by texting drivers, including a May 2009 incident involving a Boston trolley car driver who crashed while texting his girlfriend. Texting was blamed in the 2008 Chatsworth train collision which killed 25 passengers. Investigations revealed that the engineer of that train had sent 45 text messages while operating.|$|R

25|$|In DPP v Harper (1997) it {{was held}} that {{insanity}} is not generally a defense to strict liability offences. In this instance, the accused was driving with excess alcohol.

25|$|The civil {{standard}} {{is also used}} in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to drunk in charge {{that there was no}} likelihood of the accused <b>driving</b> <b>while</b> still over the alcohol limit). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only raise the issue and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence).|$|E
25|$|The Mavericks {{returned}} to the playoffs in 1989â€“90 with a 47â€“35 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for <b>driving</b> <b>while</b> intoxicated and resisting arrest. The team started 5â€“6 and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs, but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and last playoff appearance until 2001.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} the psychological influences of hands-free and hand-held mobile phone use <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> Participants were 796 Australian drivers aged 17 - 76 years who owned mobile phones. A cross-sectional survey assessed frequency of calling and text messaging <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> (overall, hands-free, hand-held) {{as well as}} drivers' behavioural, normative, and control beliefs relating to mobile phone use <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> Irrespective of handset type, 43 % of drivers reported answering calls <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> on a daily basis, followed by making calls (36 %), reading text messages (27 %), and sending text messages (18 %). In total, 63. 9 % of drivers did not own hands-free kits and, of the drivers that owned hand-free kits, 32 % did not use it {{most or all of}} the time. Significant differences were found in the behavioural, normative, and control beliefs of frequent and infrequent users of both types of handset <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> As expected, frequent users reported more advantages of, more approval from others for, and fewer barriers that would prevent them from, using either a hands-free or a hand-held mobile phone <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> than infrequent users. Campaigns to reduce mobile phone use <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> should attempt to minimise the perceived benefits of the behaviour and highlight the risks of this unsafe driving practice.

40|$|The National Safety Council (2010) {{estimates}} {{that at least}} 100, 000 car crashes every year involve drivers who are texting.

In order to effectively deter drivers from text messaging, it is imperative to understand why drivers engage in this behavior. This study surveyed college students regarding texting <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> behaviors (initiating texts, replying to texts, reading texts, or not texting <b>while</b> <b>driving)</b> and texting frequencies. The study measured participant's locus of control, need for affiliation, and Big Five Factor affinities, as well as their perceived risk of texting <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> Locus of control orientation, extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, openness to experience, and perceived risk were found to be related to texting <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> Â Â M.

25|$|By the mid-20th century, {{most major}} vice {{activities}} were being actively targeted {{by law enforcement}} in the state. Though alcohol sale and consumption was legalized, in many areas it was still substantially restricted and, even today, some counties in the state remain dry or retain significant restrictions. Most other activities went underground and have remained largely hidden. In 1969, major legislation was enacted directed at alcohol and narcotics. The Implied Consent law was passed requiring that drivers agree to breath tests when arrested for suspicion of <b>driving</b> <b>while</b> intoxicated. Statutes against narcotics were strengthened giving police and prosecutors more ability to target offenders.|$|E
25|$|RenÃ© RamÃ³n SÃ¡nchez, a legal Dominican Republic {{immigrant}} to the US, {{was arrested}} on July 15, 1995, {{on a charge of}} <b>driving</b> <b>while</b> intoxicated. His fingerprints were mistakenly placed on a card containing the name, Social Security number and other data for one Leo Rosario, who was being processed at the same time. Leo Rosario had been arrested for selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. On October 11, 2000, while returning from a visit to relatives in the Dominican Republic, RenÃ© was misidentified as Leo Rosario at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and arrested. Even though he did not match the physical description of Rosario, the erroneously cataloged fingerprints were considered to be more reliable.|$|E
