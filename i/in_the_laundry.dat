40|$|The case of <b>the</b> Magdalene <b>Laundries</b> {{illustrates}} how <b>the</b> Irish state has shaped cultural narratives {{of gender and}} facilitated a persistent gendered violence toward women formerly incarcerated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laundries.</b> <b>The</b> vital role of cultural memory in constructing these gendered identities is considered in light of how shared silences and the restriction of archival material have omitted the Magdalene women from Ireland's dominant historical narrative, rendering them “invisible. ” This championing of one version of events (in this case, one that silences Magdalene women) has implications for survivors. We argue that survivor oral histories (for example, those gathered {{as part of the}} Waterford Memories Project) provide a way to understand the meaning of what happened to the Magdalene women, establish an openly accessible record of these narratives, and validate survivors' experiences...|$|R

25|$|Madeleine's body {{is found}} by her blind {{mother and the}} Abbé <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> vat. The Abbé is devastated by Madeleine's death and Bouchon is {{captured}} and imprisoned inside an iron dummy. The Abbé blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, {{only to be told}} she had died a virgin. The Abbé has the Marquis' tongue cut out as punishment for his involvement, but is riddled with remorse and physically punishes himself. The Abbé then has a dream in which Madeleine comes alive and they have sex, but ultimately it ends with him holding her corpse. The Marquis' health declines severely, but he remains perverse as ever, decorating his dungeon with a story, using faeces as ink. As the Marquis lies dying, the Abbé reads him the last rites and offers him a crucifix to kiss. The Marquis defiantly swallows the crucifix and chokes to death on it.|$|E
25|$|Alcatraz Citadel, {{also known}} as Fort Alcatraz, was the {{original}} military defense and prison on Alcatraz Island. The citadel was built in 1859 as a U.S. Army military defense, and began function as a war camp in 1861 and long-term military prison in 1868. During the American Civil War, the citadel and its batteries provided an important line of defense. The island continued to develop in the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1893, the first hospital on Alcatraz opened. A new upper prison was built in 1904, but after the citadel ceased function as a military defense in 1907 and the original citadel collapsed the following year, a $250,000 concrete military prison was erected between 1910 and 1912. In 1933–1934, the building was modernized and became the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. It incarcerated some of America's most dangerous criminals between 1934 and 1963. During its time as a Penitentiary, 8 people were murdered at the prison by inmates; a guard was murdered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> room in the late 1930s, two died during the ill-fated 1946 escape attempt, and five inmates were killed in random attacks. Five prisoners committed suicide, {{and at least a}} dozen died in total trying to escape.|$|E

500|$|New {{workshops}} {{built in}} 1901 allowed prisoners {{to work in}} bootmaking and tailoring, and from 1904, printing. Only {{a small fraction of}} prisoners were allocated to the workshops – 35 out of an average of 279 prisoners in 1902. In 1908, there were still few men employed in the workshops, 20 in tailoring, 15 in bootmaking, and 12 in mat making, with only half of these working at a time, and little improvement by the 1911 Royal Commission. The 20th century saw little change in the work prisoners did. There were similar workshops, with the addition of metal work, and similar jobs around the prison complex, including <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laundry,</b> in the kitchen, and cleaning the prison. In 1984, 90% of prisoners were reported to be employed, either full-time or part-time. The meaningfulness of the work was nominal, as work was viewed as [...] "a management option rather than [...] production", but security concerns and discipline restricted the rehabilitative value of the work, and limited much of the work to jobs non-existent outside of prison.|$|E
500|$|According to an MTV News staff report, as of July 2006, {{more than}} two {{thousand}} people had signed an online petition addressed to Beyoncé's record label, Columbia, demanding a reshoot for the video. By the end of August 2006, 5000 additional fans had signed it. The petition requested the clip to be taped again because it {{was considered to be}} [...] "an underwhelming representation of the talent and quality of previous music-video projects of Ms. Beyoncé". Included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> list of offenses were [...] "a lack of theme, dizzying editing, over-the-top wardrobe choices, and unacceptable interactions" [...] between Beyoncé and her now-husband, Jay-Z. Beyoncé's dance moves were also called into question by the petition, qualifying them [...] as [...] "erratic, confusing and alarming at times". Additionally, fans complained about sexual theme depicted in the video, describing that some scenes as [...] "unacceptable interactions [...] " [...] while also complaining of a [...] "non-existent sexual chemistry" [...] between the two. The music video was awarded Best Video at the 2006 MOBO Awards. It also received two nominations for Sexiest Video and Best Hook-Up at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|The {{three women}} plot their {{strategy}} ("Gaie Comari di Windsor" [...] / [...] "Merry wives of Windsor, {{the time has}} come!"). They are in high spirits, but Alice notices that Nannetta is not. This is because Ford plans to marry her to Dr Caius, a man {{old enough to be}} her grandfather; the women reassure her that they will prevent it. Mistress Quickly announces Falstaff's arrival, and Mistress Ford has a large laundry basket and a screen placed in readiness. Falstaff's attempts to seduce Alice with tales of his past glory ("Quand'ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk" [...] / [...] "When I was page to the Duke of Norfolk I was slender") are cut short, as Mistress Quickly reports the impending arrival of Ford with a retinue of henchmen to catch his wife's lover. Falstaff hides first behind the screen, and then the women hide him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> basket. In the meantime Fenton and Nannetta hide behind the screen. The men hear the sound of a kiss behind it. They assume it is Falstaff with Alice, but instead they find the young lovers. Ford orders Fenton to leave. Inside the hamper Falstaff is almost suffocating. While the men resume the search of the house Alice orders her servants to throw the laundry basket through the window into the River Thames, where Falstaff endures the jeers of the crowd.|$|E

500|$|Prisoners {{would be}} woken at 6:30 am, {{and sent to}} breakfast at 6:55. After {{returning}} to the cell, inmates then had to tidy their cell and place the waste basket outside. [...] At 7:30 work started in the shifts for those privileged enough to do so, punctuated by a whistle, and prisoners {{would have to go}} through a metal detector during work shifts. If assigned a job, prisoners had to accept that line of work; prisoners were not permitted to have money in their possessions but earnings went into a prisoner's Trust Fund. [...] Some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and foremen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Laundry,</b> Tailor Shop, Cobblers Shop, Model Shop etc. and in gardening and labor. Smoking, a privilege, was permitted in the workplace providing there wasn't any hazardous condition, but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work. Lunch was served at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked in for the night at 16:50, and lights went off at 21:30. After being locked in for the night, 6 guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks.
