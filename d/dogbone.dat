5|$|East of I-405, SR522 enters Woodinville {{and follows}} Little Bear Creek {{as it turns}} north away from the city's downtown, {{intersecting}} SR202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues in a stairstep pattern, moving north and east with sharp turns to parallel the Eastside Rail Corridor, through a predominantly rural area In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a <b>dogbone</b> interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR522 to eastbound US2.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{state funds}} {{were used for}} the first stages of the SR522 {{corridor}} project, including the addition of median rumble strips and improved pavement markers in 1995, which helped reduce head-on collisions. The city of Monroe replaced the eastern half of SR522 interchange with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with a roundabout, the first to be built in Snohomish County, in 2001. The first stage of the corridor project was completed in 2001 and widened a section between SR9 and Paradise Lake Road (SR524) in Maltby, at a cost of $22 million. The second stage, a new single-point urban interchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was completed in 2006 at a cost of $37 million. The third stage of the SR522 corridor project was completed in 2014, widening the highway to four lanes across the Snohomish River and through Monroe to US2, where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in 2012. A new roundabout at the 164th Street Southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project, completing the <b>dogbone</b> interchange.|$|E
25|$|The first layout in {{the space}} was started in July 1962, with the framing and scenery built before the track was laid, and the first spike driven on August 30, 1962. This layout was 27 by 55 feet in size, and was of a {{double-track}} folded <b>dogbone</b> design, built with traditional square tabletop framing, plaster scenery, and relay control. Eventually it grew to have over 4000 linear feet of track, in both standard and 3-foot gauges, with some dual gauge mixed in. It existed through to January 1999, when it was torn down due to growing problems with accessibility and electrical characteristics. Many of the original structures and switches have been saved, for eventual inclusion on the new layout. Most notable of these is a 1940s train station model which had previously been salvaged from the layout at the PMRC location on Chestnut Street.|$|E

40|$|In orogenic zones the {{geometric}} occurrence of specific tectonic structures {{can often be}} related to contrasting rheological properties of rock materials. One of such tectonic structures is layer-perpendicular naturally fractured layers with vein infill that underwent subsequent deformation. Internal deformation by coaxial extension of these segmented layers, with host-rock material less competent than the vein material, {{gives rise to the}} development of bone-shaped structures (i. e. <b>dogbones).</b> In this paper, the formation of such <b>dogbones</b> is modelled using finite element techniques. A parameter sensitivity analysis of the model demonstrates that the degree of extension of the host-rock segments, their initial aspect ratio and the competence contrast between vein material and host-rock are the controlling parameters for the final shape of the <b>dogbones</b> during coaxial extension. The results, moreover, suggest that the specific geometry of the <b>dogbones</b> can serve to quantify competence contrasts between the host-rock and vein material during flow at geological strain rates.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the precise {{control of the}} size, shape and surface {{morphology}} of Au-Pt nanocatalysts (cubes, blocks, octahedrons and <b>dogbones)</b> synthesized via a seed-mediated approach. Gold 'seeds' of different aspect ratios (1 to 4. 2), grown by a silver-assisted approach, were used as templates for high-yield production of novel Au-Pt nanocatalysts at a low temperature (40 C). Characterization by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), UV-Vis spectroscopy, zeta-potential (surface charge), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to better understand their physico-chemical properties, preferred reactivities and underlying nanoparticle growth mechanism.

40|$|This {{definitive}} published {{version of}} this article is available from: [URL] simulations have been carried out to study the effects of material choice, drug eluting coating and cell design on the mechanical behaviour of stents during deployment inside a stenotic artery. Metallic stents made of materials with lower yield stress and weaker strain hardening tend to experience higher deformation and stronger <b>dogboning</b> and recoiling, but less residual stresses. Drug eluting coatings have limited effect on stent expansion, recoiling, <b>dogboning</b> and residual stresses. Stent expansion is mainly controlled by the radial stiffness of the stent which is closely associated with the stent design. In particular, open-cell design tends to have easier expansion and higher recoiling than closed-cell design. <b>Dogboning</b> is stronger for slotted tube design and open-cell sinusoidal design, but reduced significantly for designs strengthened with longitudinal connective struts. After deployment, the maximum von Mises stress appears to locate at the U-bends of stent cell struts, with varying magnitude that depends on the materials and severity of plastic deformation. For the artery–plaque system, the stresses, especially in the plaque which is in direct contact with the stent, appear to be distinctly different for different stent designs and materials in terms of both distribution and magnitude. The plaque composition also strongly affects the expansion behaviour of the stent–artery system and modifies the stresses on the plaque...|$|R
