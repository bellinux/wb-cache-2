40|$|Considering {{features}} of vehicle license plate location method which commonly used, {{in order to}} search a consistent location for reference images with license plates feature in multidimensional parameter space, a new algorithm of geometric location is proposed. Geometric location algorithm main include model training and real time search. Which not only adapt the <b>gray-scale</b> <b>linearity</b> and the gray non-linear changes, but also support changes of scale and angle. Compared with the mainstream locating software, numerical results shows under the same test conditions that the position deviation of geometric positioning algorithm is less than 0. 5 pixel. Without {{taking into account the}} multidimensional parameter space, Geometric positioning algorithm position deviation is less than 1. 0 pixel and angle deviation is less than 1. 0 degree taking into account the multidimensional parameter space. This algorithm is robust, simple, practical and is better than the traditional method...|$|E
