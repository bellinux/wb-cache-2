25|$|Steam distillation: Steam from {{boiling water}} is {{passed through the}} raw material, which drives out their {{volatile}} fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a Florentine flask. This allows for the easy separation of the fragrant oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and oils from the raw material is called <b>hydrosol</b> and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as flowers, leaves, and stems.|$|E
25|$|The {{lowland area}} of Cavite is {{generally}} composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam. It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while {{those in the}} upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant {{in the southern part}} of Bacoor and Imus bordering Dasmariñas. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. <b>Hydrosol</b> and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of Rosario, Tanza, Naic and Ternate are lined with Guadalupe sand.|$|E
2500|$|An aerosol {{is defined}} as a {{colloidal}} system of solid or liquid particles in a gas. An aerosol includes both the particles and the suspending gas, which is usually air. [...] Frederick G. Donnan presumably first used the term aerosol during World War I to describe an aero-solution, clouds of microscopic particles in air. This term developed analogously to the term <b>hydrosol,</b> a colloid system with water as the dispersing medium. Primary aerosols contain particles introduced directly into the gas; secondary aerosols form through gas-to-particle conversion.|$|E
40|$|Several TiO 2 <b>hydrosols</b> with {{point of}} zero charge (pzc) ranging from 2. 8 to 6 were {{prepared}} {{depending on the}} method of synthesis. The ionic adsorption sequences at the different interfaces were deduced from the critical coagulation concentrations of the corresponding <b>hydrosols.</b> The general behavior can be summarized as follows: on positively charged surfaces, the structure-maker anions are always more adsorbed than the structure-breakers; on negatively charged surfaces, for "high pzc" <b>hydrosols,</b> the cationic sequence {{is the same as}} that observed for the anions, whereas, for "low pzc" <b>hydrosols,</b> the reverse sequence is found. The model based on the generalization to the ion-surface interactions of the Gurney concept of the ion-ion interactions, as proposed by Gierst, is used to explain the observed properties of the different <b>hydrosols.</b> © 1990.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to produce 3 D sponges based on enzymatically {{modified}} lysozyme selected polysaccharides and assess their physicochemical properties. The alginate/chitosan sponges were formed from polymers <b>hydrosols</b> in different proportions at a final concentration of 1 % polysaccharides. <b>Hydrosols</b> were modified by lysozyme addition of 1000 U. <b>Hydrosols</b> without or with enzyme were analyzed for their reducing sugar content, rheological properties and ability to scavenge free radicals. Sponges formed from <b>hydrosols</b> were tested for solubility and compressive properties. Only chitosan was hydrolyzed by lysozyme. The morphology of sponges was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was proven that the antioxidant properties of <b>hydrosols</b> are dependent on the concentration of chitosan. It was also shown that the addition of lysozyme negatively affected the free radical scavenging ability of single <b>hydrosols</b> of alginate and chitosan, and their mixtures. The Ostwald de Waele as well as Herschel–Bulkley models of rheological properties fitted the experimental data well (R 2 is between 0. 947 and 1. 000). Increase in textural features values of sponges was observed. Sponges with pure alginate and pure chitosan were almost completely soluble. The enzyme addition significantly changed the characteristics of the cross-section structure of sponges, and made the surface smoother...|$|R
50|$|Because <b>hydrosols</b> are {{produced}} at high temperatures and are somewhat acidic, {{they tend to}} inhibit bacterial growth but not fungal growth. They are not sterile.

2500|$|Very high {{temperatures}} {{are required to}} dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen. A catalyst is required to make the process operate at feasible temperatures.

[...] Hydrosol-2 is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almería in Spain which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200°C to heat water. <b>Hydrosol</b> II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept. As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to the megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to heliostat fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} usage of acidic electrolyzed water (AEW) with different sodium chloride concentration (0. 001 %, 0. 01 %, and 0. 1 %) for the preparation of carrageenan and gelatine <b>hydrosols</b> and hydrogels. To determine physiochemical properties of <b>hydrosols,</b> the pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), available chloride concentration (ACC) and rheological parameters such us gelation and flow temperatures were measured. The samples were also characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IR) and texture profile analysis (TPA). Additionally, the article contains an analysis of antibacterial activity of carrageenan and gelatine <b>hydrosols</b> incorporated with acidic electrolyzed water, against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The FT IR spectra demonstrated that the structure of gelatine and carrageenan are not significantly affected by electrolyzed NaCl solution components. Furthermore, TPA analysis showed that the use of AEW did not cause undesirable changes in hydrogels layer. The microbiological analysis confirmed inhibition of bacterial growth by <b>hydrosols</b> to about 2. 10 log reduction. The results showed that the range of reduction of microorganisms depends on the type AEW used. This might be {{explained by the fact that}} the lowest pH and the highest ACC values of <b>hydrosols</b> were obtained for samples with the longest period of exposure to electrolysis (10 min) and the highest amount of NaCl (0. 1 % w/v). These results suggest that hydrogels and <b>hydrosols</b> incorporated with AEW may be used for food preservation...|$|R
