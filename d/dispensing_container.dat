40|$|A {{medication}} take-back {{event was}} held in Lansing, MI, USA, for four hours in September 2013. The objective was to quantify medication waste by determining the ratio of medication units remaining versus dispensed and to identify therapeutic classes with greater ratios of remaining medication units. Drug name, strength, quantity remaining, quantity dispensed, dispensary source, and brand or generic were recorded from the label of each medication container returned. Out of the over 3600 medication containers collected, this study analyzed 2459 containers, which included 304 controlled substances. On average, 66 percent of the medications <b>dispensed</b> in these <b>containers</b> were unused, and therefore wasted. Immunologic medications had the lowest quantity of waste at 54 %, while geriatrics/miscellaneous therapeutic class yielded the highest quantity of waste at 79 %. The most common therapeutic classes collected were pain/spasm, cardiovascular, and mental health. Greater emphasis on patient education regarding medication adherence and health care professionals’ judicious prescribing habits is warranted to reduce the frequency of unused medications. The increased accessibility to medication return sites may alleviate the prevalence of medication accumulation, environmental damage, and medication misuse...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{substantial}} evidence of poor dispensing practices with inadequate {{packaging and labelling}} of medicines, and limited advice on their usage in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We examined the labelling and packaging of medicines identified during a survey of 1322 households in six regions of Sri Lanka between 2010 and 2013 conducted using the World Health Organization (WHO) methodology for household surveys. We compared medicines obtained from public and private sources and asked interviewees if they understood how to take the medicines. Methods: Packaging was considered adequate when the primary package was an envelope or closable container holding only one medicine. Adequate labels were legible and included medicine name, dose and expiration date. Interviewers assessed whether respondents knew how to take the medicines. Results: Of 1322 households, 1253 households (94. 8 %) {{had at least one}} medicine; 84 % were classified as western medicines and 16 % traditional medicines. Of 5756 western medicines identified, 82. 1 % were adequately packaged, 43. 3 % adequately labelled and 41. 4 % both adequately packaged and labelled. Participants stated that they understood the label and knew how to take 96 % of the medicines. Private medicine sources had more adequately packaged medicines than public sources (87. 7 % vs 73. 5 %; OR 2. 58, 95 % CI 2. 23, 2. 99) and more adequately labelled medicines (52. 2 % vs 27. 4 %; OR 2. 90, 95 % CI 2. 57, 3. 26). Conclusions: Inadequate packaging and labelling of medicines remain a concern in Sri Lanka. Commitment to Good Pharmacy Practices, investments in staff education and training and adequate <b>dispensing</b> resources (<b>containers</b> and labels), particularly in the public sector, are needed to address sub-optimal dispensing practices. Ageing populations with more chronic diseases requiring polypharmacy and complex medicine regimens increase the need for appropriately packaged and labelled medicines...|$|R
40|$|Coxsackie viruses are {{frequently}} {{found in the}} throat washings or feces of patients having the symptoms of poliomyelitis (1 - 4). On numerous occasions both poliomyelitis and Coxsackie viruses {{have been found in}} the same specimens (4 - 6) and the simultaneous appearance of humoral antibodies for both has been reported (7). It is not known whether the two influence one another, whether the Coxsackie virus infection mitigates or perhaps intensifies the effects of poliomyelitis.

40|$|The {{ability of}} 50 {{rheumatoid}} arthritis patients with hand involvement and 50 normal control subjects {{to open a}} range of reclosable tablet containers and unit dose packs was tested. Child-resistant containers, particularly the clic-loc type, proved the most difficult for patients and control subjects to open. Smaller containers were less easy to open than comparable ones of a larger size. Only 54 % patients were able to remove a suppository from its wrapping. Blister packs and conven-tional screw-capped tablet bottles were easiest to open. Dispensing of drugs for rheumatic patients in child-resistant containers {{should be limited to}} those without hand involvement. BY agreement between the medical and pharmaceutical professions it was recommended that from 2 March 1981 all solid-dose oral medicines should be dispensed in reclosable child-resistant containers (CRCs) or in unit-dose packaging. Exceptions include the elderly or handicapped patient. However, we are aware that many rheumatic patients still receive <b>dispensed</b> drugs in <b>containers</b> which {{they may not be able}} to open, often because it is a relative or friend who collects the prescription from the pharmacy. Although both the elderly (1) and the arthritic (2) patient have difficulty in opening CRCs, only a limited range of containers has been tested amongst these patients...|$|R
40|$|Penicillin {{was first}} {{produced}} by cultivation of the fungus Penicillium notatum Westling {{on the surface}} of a liquid nutrient, such as Czapek-Dox glucose medium. Such a method of cultivation is very laborious, costly, and time-consuming when practiced on a large scale. Huge numbers of bottles or pans must be washed and sterilized, relatively small volumes of nutrient media must be <b>dispensed</b> into individual <b>containers,</b> and each container with its allotment of medium must be sterilized and inoculated. The incubation period for such cultures is usually 6 to 12 days, and, {{at the conclusion of the}} fermentation, considerable hand labor is required to remove the penicillin-containing liquors from the numerous fermentation vessels and from the fungus mycelium. It was obvious that a more economical fermentation process would result from growing the mold submerged and uniformly distributed in vats or tanks such as are used in other fermentation industries. Submerged mold fermen-tation processes have been previously used for the production of gallic acid (Calmette, 1902), gluconic acid (Moyer et at., 1940), and lactic acid (Ward et al., 1938), and the adaptation of this method to the cultivation of P. notatum appeared to offer a means of decreasing the labor involved, of decreasing the fermentation time, and of increasing the penicillin yield. This paper deals with the selection of a strain of P. notatum Westling suitable for the production of penicillin in submerged culture, and with investigations of nutrient media and culture conditions as nearly optimal as possible for this procedure. 3 (P. notatum NRRL 832 was originally selected and evaluated for submerged penicillin production by the senior author. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVaccines are {{biological}} {{products made}} from living organisms. The natural complexity of biological molecules {{along with the}} inherent uncertainties of product manufacturing introduces the likelihood that random alterations can impact {{the quality of the}} vaccine each time it is made. The factors that can affect the final product are often unknown. Testing for potency of vaccine bulk or product <b>dispensed</b> into final <b>containers</b> was designed with the hope of ensuring that a vaccine is effective when used during its approved dating period and that its protective activity was not inadvertently altered during any phase of production. Ideally, potency testing measures a biological or biochemical property of the vaccine that is related to its ability to elicit protective immunity in the target population and provide some assurance that consistent clinical benefit is derived from each lot of product. Potency methods vary depending on the nature and composition of the vaccine. In vivo potency testing might entail immunizing groups of laboratory animals and then challenging them directly to measure survival, or involve serological potency assays in which sera from immunized laboratory animals are tested for the ability to neutralize pathogens or toxins. In the U. S., diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid potency tests have customarily involved a serological method. This approach uses fewer animals than would have been required using a direct challenge method, while providing satisfactory evidence that each toxoid lot could induce protective immunity. This paper will discuss the details of the original U. S. test method for diphtheria and tetanus toxoid potency and present issues that must be considered when developing and validating non-animal-based approaches to refine or replace these tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} patient compliance is especially crucial {{in evaluating the}} efficacy of a new treatment. Because of {{the problems associated with}} parenteral desferrioxamine, the development of a safe, effective, and convenient iron chelator is of high priority. The high morbidity and mortality associated with iron overload requires careful evaluation of the ability of any new agent to promote long term effective iron chelation. Patients' compliance with an orally available chelating agent, 1, 2,-dimethyl- 3 -hydroxypyrid- 4 -one (L 1), that has been demonstrated to induce in vivo iron excretion equivalent to that of desferrioxamine during supervised short term administration, was examined. Compliance was assessed in seven patients by patient interview, by daily diaries reviewed monthly with each patient, and {{with the use of the}} Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) standard pill bottles with microprocessors in the cap that record the timing and frequency of bottle openings. L 1 was <b>dispensed</b> in MEMS <b>containers</b> to the patients, who, unaware of their significance, recorded compliance using a daily diary. Overall compliance rate (% of prescribed doses taken) measured by MEMS was 88. 7 +/- 6. 8 %. When 'doubling of doses' was accounted for, significantly poorer compliance with L 1 was noted by MEMS (91. 7 +/- 7. 4 %) than by patients' diaries (95. 7 +/- 5. 2 %). There was no significant difference in patient compliance recorded between the first and last 30 day period of drug administration. MEMS can eliminate the confounding variable of erratic patient compliance in the evaluation of a new drug's efficacy. As MEMS cannot distinguish a missed dose from one doubled at the next bottle opening, the use of patient diaries is a useful adjunct to the accurate assessment of compliance and should be combined with the use of MEMS...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{exposure}} {{of man to}} increasing amounts of metals has occurred rather generally from industrial contamination and variably from intake of dietary mineral supplements. Adverse effects of individual metals can be markedly altered by dietary levels of other essential and nonessential inorganic elements, essential organic nutrients and other nonessential dietary components. Experimental diets for establishing baseline responses to excess elements should be formulated to meet the animal's requirements only. These reference diets can then be modified to mimic man's average dietary intake as well as meal patterns. Improved animal models should provide better data for assessing hazards of excess metal intake by man. Metal Toxicity Problems in Man Until recently, metal toxicities in man were con-sidered to be almost entirely problems for industrial workers except for episodes of acute metal poison-ing caused by acidic beverages <b>dispensed</b> from metal <b>containers.</b> Today, we recognize existing and potential health hazards {{to the general population}} arising from excess intakes of several elements via air, water, and food. To some extent, this reflects better insight into old conditions, but primarily it represents new problems deriving from expanded use of metals and their ultimate environmental dis-sipation. Fertilization of crops sometimes permits toxic amounts of metals to enter into the food chain, especially if sewage sludges are used. A new type of problem for man is emerging from the burgeoning use of dietary supplements of inor-ganic elements. All inorganic elements are toxic at some level above required or typical intake and for man the minimal toxic intakes are not known. Die-tary intake of other inorganic elements and organic nutrients can markedly influence the toxicity of each element. Except for children under 12 years of age and for pregnant and lactating women, there are no legal restraints in the United States to regulate the content of mineral supplements to levels that are nutritionally valid (1). Rather, restrictions of min...|$|R
