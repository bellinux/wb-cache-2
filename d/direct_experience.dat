5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God's grace. Symeon believed that <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually {{becoming one of the}} central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E
5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's teachings and writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God in deep contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not as unique to himself, but as the norm for all Christians. He taught that the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks {{to take on the}} traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E

5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} themes running through the {{different}} discourses. One is the traditional theme of the early hesychasts and mystical theologians of the Christian East, especially the practices of faith (praxis) and asceticism (askesis) that they frequently taught as the way to reach <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God (theoria). Specific practices discussed by Symeon include: repentance, detachment, renunciation, mercy, sorrow for sins, faith, and contemplation.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Usama was {{the second}} of four boys and raised by his nurse, Lu'lu'a, who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama's own children. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to memorize the Qur'an, and was also tutored by scholars such as Ibn Munira of Kafartab and Abu Abdullah al-Tulaytuli of Toledo. He {{spent much of his}} youth hunting with his family, partly as recreation and certainly as warrior (faris) training for battle as part of furusiyya. He also had much <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of battle, against the neighbouring crusader County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch, hostile Muslim neighbours in Hama, Homs, and elsewhere, and Hashshashin who had established a base near Shaizar.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} on previous art works, rather than on <b>direct</b> <b>experience.</b> There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E
5|$|Symeon often {{taught that}} all {{followers}} of Christ {{could have the}} <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God, or theoria, just as the early church fathers experienced and taught. In that context he frequently described his own experiences of God as divine light. He preached to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also the doctrine of the hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting oneself under the complete guidance of a spiritual father.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Differences {{with regard}} to the {{effectiveness}} of health information and attitude change are suggested be-tween people with <b>direct,</b> behavioral <b>experiences</b> with a health topic and people with indirect, nonbehavioral ex-periences.

40|$|Within the {{personnel}} selection context, {{the importance of}} justice perceptions has been documented extensively (seeHausknecht, Day, & Thomas, 2004). Recently, several authors suggested that these perceptions of justice may not only depend on what applicants experience during the selection process, but also on what they bring {{with them to the}} selection encounter (Brockner, Ackerman, & Fairchild, 2001; Shapiro & Kirkman, 2001). Specifically, applicants’ may enter the selection procedure with certain expectations and these expectations will influence the way the selection encounter is perceived and reacted to. The current study will focus on expectations and will more specifically explore antecedents of justice expectations. Bell, Ryan and Wiechmann (2004) propose a model on how justice expectations are formed. According to these authors, all expectations are derived from beliefs, or our knowledge and ideas about how the world operates. Further, these authors argue that this knowledge is based on three sources, namely <b>direct</b> <b>experiences,</b> indirect experiences and existing beliefs such as belief in a just world (see Boyce, 2003) and general beliefs in testing (Chan et al., 1998). In general, these three sources of beliefs are considered equally influential in the formation of justice perceptions, although a study of Kray and Lind (2002) suggests that indirect information about fairness is interpreted in light of one’s <b>direct</b> <b>experiences.</b> In this study, it is suggested that <b>direct</b> <b>experiences</b> influence the impact of general beliefs (i. e., belief in a just world and belief in tests) on justice expectations. Specifically, it is hypothesized that general beliefs have a stronger impact on justice expectations in the absence of <b>direct</b> <b>experiences.</b> When no <b>direct</b> information is available, people will rely on general beliefs in the formation of their justice expectations. However, when they already passed through the same selection procedure, they will rely on this information to form justice expectations and the influence of general beliefs will diminish or even disappear. The results of moderated hierarchical regression analyses (N = 1073 applicants for the job of prison guards) showed a significant interaction effect between general beliefs and <b>direct</b> <b>experiences</b> on distributive justice expectations. However, this effect was not always in line with our expectations and was not found with respect to procedural justice expectations. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings will be discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|The treatises cover a {{wide range}} of topics, {{including}} Symeon's defense against Stephen regarding his own views on the unity of the Holy Trinity. He also presents his doctrine on mysticism, the necessity of faith, the possibility of <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of God, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and more. The last four treatises were written during his exile, and discuss living a holy life while on earth, salvation through faith and good works, and the need for solitude if one wants to become a channel of divine grace to others.|$|E
5|$|King Francis II died on 5 December 1560, of {{a middle}} ear {{infection}} that led to an abscess in his brain. Mary was grief-stricken. Her mother-in-law, Catherine de' Medici, became regent for the late king's ten-year-old brother Charles IX, who inherited the French throne. Mary returned to Scotland nine months later, arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561. Having lived in France {{since the age of}} five, Mary had little <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of the dangerous and complex political situation in Scotland. As a devout Catholic, she was regarded with suspicion by many of her subjects, {{as well as by the}} Queen of England. Scotland was torn between Catholic and Protestant factions, and Mary's illegitimate half-brother, the Earl of Moray, was a leader of the Protestants. The Protestant reformer John Knox preached against Mary, condemning her for hearing Mass, dancing, and dressing too elaborately. She summoned him to her presence to remonstrate with him unsuccessfully, and later charged him with treason, but he was acquitted and released.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} {{to calls for}} developing an instrument to measure public diplomacy outcomes, this paper introduces the Relationship Assessment of Diplomatic Interaction Outcome (RADIO) scale. Developed based on the Organisation–Public Relationship Assessment (OPRA) scale in public relations, the RADIO scale measures relationship between a country and its foreign publics as public diplomacy outcome. It classifies relationships into two types: experiential (characterised by <b>direct</b> <b>experiences</b> with a country) and reputational (those without <b>direct</b> <b>experiences).</b> Two macro- dimensions (i. e. interactional bilateralism and power mutuality) and two micro-dimensions (i. e. trust and empathy) are proposed for both relationship types. Relational satisfaction and relational continuance are proposed as micro-dimensions for experiential relationships. Relational attentiveness and relational curiosity are proposed as micro-dimensions for reputational relationships. Implications of the RADIO scale also are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In 1950, No. 38 Squadron was {{selected}} to form part of the Australian force assigned to the Commonwealth Far East Air Force. As an element of this force, the Australian Government agreed for the unit to be tasked with courier flights across Asia and providing support for the British-led counterinsurgency operations in Malaya. The squadron's advance party arrived at RAF Changi in Singapore on 19 June 1950, {{and all of its}} personnel and eight Dakotas were operational there by 6 July. While in Malaya the squadron came under the command of No. 90 (Composite) Wing, along with the Avro Lincoln-equipped No. 1 Squadron. Half the squadron's aircrew were veterans of the Berlin Airlift, but none had any <b>direct</b> <b>experience</b> of tropical environments. No. 38 Squadron began flying transport missions in Malaya in early July, with British and New Zealand pilots accompanying its aircrews during {{the first two weeks of}} operations to help them become familiar with local conditions. From July 1950 until February 1951, No. 38 Squadron's main task was to conduct courier flights to Borneo, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines, and these remained an important responsibility throughout the period it was based at Singapore. Following the outbreak of the Korean War, the squadron flew British troops and supplies from Singapore to Japan and Korea, and four of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were transferred to No. 30 Communication Unit in Japan during November 1950.|$|E
