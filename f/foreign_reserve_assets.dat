40|$|The {{countries}} of the European periphery are experiencing a balance of payments crisis stemming from persistent current account deficits and sharply lower private capital inflows, a condition known as a sudden stop. In countries with fixed exchange rates, sudden stops typically drain foreign reserves, forcing currency depreciation which eventually shifts the current account from deficit to surplus. However, the sudden stop has not prompted the European periphery countries to move toward devaluation by abandoning the euro, in part because capital transfers from euro-area partners have allowed them to finance current account deficits. A balance of payments crisis typically arises when a country can’t finance its foreign transactions. A country’s balance of payments can be separated into two main parts: the current account, which reflects the trade balance in goods and services; and the financial account, which reflects the balance on net international financial transactions. In turn, the financial account {{can be broken down}} into, one, the balance on international private capital flows; and, two, changes in official holdings of <b>foreign</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>assets,</b> such as gold, foreign currency, and foreign sovereign debt.

40|$|The world {{distribution}} of current account balances {{has been steadily}} drifting away from “normality” since 1997. This puzzling development has occurred in parallel with large scale accumulation of official <b>foreign</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> in emerging Asia and commodity exporting countries, and a growing role of portfolio flows in financing the US external deficit. The theoretical toolbox {{that was used to}} understand “old puzzles” of international macroeconomics may still be relevant to address these new puzzles, {{to the extent that it}} focuses more specifically on liquidity aspects: uneven supply of liquid assets, borrowing constraints, and externalities related to financial infrastructures that foster market liquidity. The paper discusses how these various features have been introduced in the most recent literature on global imbalances. One aspect that may require further examination is the role of fi nancial market liquidity as a “public good externality”: in the absence of appropriate provision of such a public good in emerging economies, reserve accumulation may be seen as an attempt to import the “public services” benefi ts of holding liquid “risk-free” assets. This may in turn possibly result in a form of “congestion” if US dollar reserve accumulation outpaces the issuance of US Treasuries or equivalent securities. Large reserve holders have thus turned to a wider range of asset classes, including asset-backed securities whose liquidity has all but vanished in the course of recent fi nancial market turbulences. These developments could therefore affect the fi nancing conditions of the US current account deficit, and undermine some of its structural determinants. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of central bank balance sheets in emerging Asia: {{what are the}} risks? 1 Central bank balance sheets in emerging Asia expanded rapidly {{over the past decade}} because of the unprecedented rise in <b>foreign</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>assets.</b> The corresponding {{expansion of}} the central banks ’ liabilities has created dangers – risks of inflation and financial instability and financial market distortions – that require attention. JEL classification: E 58, E 61. What risks arise from the rapid expansion of central bank balance sheets in emerging Asia? This question has been attracting great interest in recent years because of the past decade’s rapid increase of balance sheets to record levels. Most of the balance sheet growth has been in foreign exchange reserve assets, which to some extent reflects efforts to bolster such reserves {{in the aftermath of the}} late 1990 s Asian financial crisis. Increasingly, however, the foreign reserve accumulation has been the by-product of resistance to appreciation of the domestic currency. Central banks have funded this asset accumulation in a variety of ways, including the extensive use of required reserves and remunerated excess reserves and the issuance of central bank paper. This special feature explores whether the expansion of central bank balance sheets may contribute to risks of inflation and financial instability and to financial market distortions. The first section highlights the salient trends in central bank assets and liabilities in emerging Asia. The second discusses some of the policy risks that the expansion of central bank balance sheets may pose for the region. The third considers the policy challenges ahead.

Third, in the long term, when the US Federal Reserve decreases money supply to control inflation, the US economy might enter another recession, hurting China's exports further.
