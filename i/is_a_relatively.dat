5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E
