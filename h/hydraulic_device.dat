25|$|Two early ALF raids led to {{the closure}} of several {{university}} studies. A May 28, 1984 raid on the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic caused $60,000 worth of damage and saw the removal of 60 hours of tapes, which showed the researchers laughing as they used a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device</b> to cause brain damage to baboons. The tapes were turned over to PETA, who produced a 26-minute video called Unnecessary Fuss. The head injury clinic was closed, the university's chief veterinarian was fired, and the university was put on probation.|$|E
25|$|One notable case {{led to a}} 26-minute {{film that}} PETA {{produced}} in 1984, Unnecessary Fuss. The film was based on 60 hours of researchers' footage obtained by the ALF during a raid on the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic. The footage showed researchers laughing at baboons as they inflicted brain damage on them with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device</b> intended to simulate whiplash. Laboratory animal veterinarian Larry Carbone writes that the researchers openly discussed how one baboon was awake before the head injury, despite protocols being in place for anesthesia. The ensuing publicity led to the suspension of funds from the university, the firing of its chief veterinarian, {{the closure of the}} lab, and a period of probation for the university.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Duane Barry's abduction, they had a [...] "film run out" [...] which, {{according}} to Carter, gave the scene a [...] "very eerie effect". Shooting that scene was a [...] "real test" [...] according to Carter. Carter {{was pleased with the}} outcome, saying he was able to show viewers what he wanted out of The X-Files, which he felt he was [...] "very successful" [...] at. The visual effects' crew had to hang a [...] "giant light" [...] over the house where Barry was being abducted. It took the course of 45 minutes to shoot the scene. According to Carter, much teamwork was required to film that particular scene. As Carter puts it, he was actually forced to stay [...] "behind the camera" [...] to see the end results. For the experiments, Railsback was put in a plaster model of his back as he was lifted by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device,</b> and had water squirted on his mouth for the dental drill.|$|E

2500|$|Deborah Blum {{writes that}} [...] "it is {{difficult}} to put into words just how ugly [...] brief movie is." [...] The film shows at least one sedated but not anesthetized baboon with his wrists and ankles tied, strapped to an operating table, his shaved head secured with dental cement inside a helmet. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device</b> known as Penn 2 slams the baboon's head from behind, pushing it forward at a 60-degree angle with a force of what the researchers said was up to 1000 g, apparently intended to simulate whiplash.|$|E
2500|$|While one baboon {{was being}} injured on the {{operating}} table by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device,</b> the camera panned to a brain-damaged, drooling monkey strapped into a high chair {{in a corner of the}} room, with the words [...] "Cheerleading in the corner, we have B-10. B-10 wishes his counterpart well. As you can see, B-10 is still alive. B-10 is hoping for a good result," [...] followed by laughter. In another sequence, one researcher is heard to say: [...] "You better hope the ... anti-vivisection people don't get a hold of this film." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the mid to}} late 19th century, <b>hydraulic</b> and {{pneumatic}} <b>devices</b> {{were able}} to power various mechanical actions, such as positioning tools or work pieces. [...] Pile drivers and steam hammers are examples for heavy work. In food processing, pneumatic or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>devices</b> could start and stop filling of cans or bottles on a conveyor. Power steering for automobiles uses hydraulic mechanisms, as does practically all earth moving equipment and other construction equipment and many attachments to tractors. Pneumatic (usually compressed air) power is widely used to operate industrial valves.|$|R

50|$|A {{basket press}} {{consists}} of a large basket filled with the crushed grapes. Pressure is applied through a plate that is forced down onto the fruit. The mechanism to lower the plate is often either a screw or a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device.</b> The juice flows through openings in the basket. The basket style press was the first type of mechanized press to be developed, and its basic design has not changed in nearly 1000 years.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, Chin {{graduated}} from Peabody College in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly after, in 1976, Chin created See/Saw: The Earthworks for Hermann Park in Houston, Texas, where the artist manipulated two {{sections of the}} park’s surface to create a kinetic, minimalist earthwork. In this mimic of a childhood pastime, Chin altered the landscape with an underground <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device</b> that allowed the participant to shift large sections of earth with their body weight. The title also questions psychological perception of what is above and below an object's surface. This piece addressed three of the major art trends of the time: minimalism, conceptualism, and earthworks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{geometric}} {{models of}} the <b>hydraulic</b> turnover <b>device</b> are constructed by using three-dimensional modeling software UG, and then they are induced into simulation software ADAMS by a sharing data format. By using ADAMS, models are further simplified and the virtual prototype is established. By using the associated model, the simulation of the <b>hydraulic</b> turnover <b>device</b> is analyzed in ADAMS. Compared with the traditional methods of using physical prototypes, the movement processes and relevant parameters of the <b>hydraulic</b> turnover <b>device</b> can be effectively obtained by means of this method. Furthermore, {{the quality of the}} constraint relations between the parts is very important in terms of the accuracy of the model simulation analysis. This simulation results accord with the practical situation, which indicates that the operation is stable and the efficiency is high. It provides a theoretical basis for the practical design of the <b>hydraulic</b> turnover <b>device,</b> which shows that the combination of ADAMS and UG works well...|$|R

50|$|The {{eccentrically}} mounted {{handle of}} the rotary quern-stone in fifth century BCE Spain that spread across the Roman Empire constitutes a crank. The earliest evidence of a crank and connecting rod mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD Hierapolis sawmill in the Roman Empire. The crank also appears in the mid-9th century {{in several of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>devices</b> described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{invented the}} [...] "Dowty retarder" [...] {{for use in}} railway {{classification}} yards, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device</b> that regulates the speed of rail cars as they roll down an inclined track. The devices are built for a specified speed, set at the factory. If the rail car is below the set speed, the device offers no resistance. If the car speed is at or greater than the speed setting, an internal valve is activated to provide a resistance to the wheel, thus slowing the car. This keeps cars rolling within a relatively narrow range of speeds.|$|E
5000|$|A typical {{helicopter}} {{has three}} flight control inputs—the cyclic stick, the collective lever, and the anti-torque pedals. [...] Depending on {{the complexity of}} the helicopter, the cyclic and collective may be linked together by a mixing unit, a mechanical or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>device</b> that combines the inputs from both and then sends along the [...] "mixed" [...] input to the control surfaces to achieve the desired result. The manual throttle may also be considered a flight control because it is needed to maintain rotor speed on smaller helicopters without governors. The governors also help the pilot control the collective pitch on the helicopter's main rotors, to keep a stable, more accurate flight.|$|E

50|$|Only in {{some cases}} there is a {{built-in}} device protection in form for instance of a fusible in electrical devices (for instance in a halogen lamp to prevent damage from use of too high power bulbs) or in form for instance of a pressure relief valve in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>devices</b> (e.g. a pressure cooker); many others have no protection (most hair-dryers) and the user realizes that the duty short time is over after for example the overheating has already damaged the device.|$|R
50|$|A brake {{controller}} is usually an OEM or aftermarket installed device or module. It is mounted to the tow vehicle's driver's-side dashboard area, and engages a trailer’s electrical braking system either time delayed, or {{in proportion to}} the tow vehicle's brake engagement when slowing down or coming to a halt. A {{brake controller}} is not needed with a trailer surge braking system unless using modern electric over <b>hydraulic</b> <b>devices.</b> The trailer in this case usually has either electric friction brakes or electric-hydraulic trailer brake actuators.|$|R
40|$|Taking {{advantage}} {{of the existence of}} a few traditional masonry 1 - 2 storey buildings abandoned after the 1998 Azores earthquake, several in situ tests were performed in various cases.
