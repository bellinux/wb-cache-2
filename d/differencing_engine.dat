WBAdmin uses a clever <b>differencing</b> <b>engine</b> to update the backup files.

50|$|To deliver this {{reduction}} {{in the size of}} the required data updates across a portal, geo-replication systems often use <b>differencing</b> <b>engine</b> technologies. These systems are able to difference the content of each portal server right down to the byte level. This knowledge of the content that is already on each server enables the system to rebuild any changes to the content on one server, across each of the other servers in the deployment from content already hosted on those other servers. This type of differencing system ensures that no content, at the byte level, is ever sent to a server twice.|$|E
