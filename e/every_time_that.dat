500|$|Media {{response}} to Fantasy Black Channel was highly favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 81% based on 18 critical reviews. AllMusic's K. Ross Hoffman described the album as [...] "glorious and galvanising" [...] and labelled it [...] "a convoluted construction crammed {{with so many}} immediately gratifying moments that it takes multiple listens to extricate them all". John Burgess of The Guardian explained that a new favourite song, riff, or wayward moment can be found <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the album is listened to. Tim Chester of NME [...] concluded, [...] "It takes {{a certain kind of}} mind to make this. While others whinge about living and dying in cul-de-sac towns shackled by cul-de-sac imaginations, LOTP's vision is housed on Dubai's 'The World' island-creation project." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson dislikes {{saying his}} character's catchphrase ("I don't believe it!") and only {{performs}} {{the line for}} charity events for a small fee. This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode [...] "The Mainland", where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how [...] "tasteless and wrong" [...] {{it would be to}} lean forward to him <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do. This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars, in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as [...] "Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson".|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, Carroll faced Republican Robert E. Gable, a coal company owner. The main {{issue of the}} {{campaign}} was the imposition of desegregation busing on the city of Louisville. Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not [...] "doing something about it". In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using {{what he called a}} [...] "truth bell". Gable rang the bell <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he perceived that Carroll was not telling the truth. Eventually, the moderator of the debate, newspaper publisher Al Smith, ordered Gable to put the bell away, and Gable's credibility suffered in the eyes of voters. Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 to 277,998, representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor's race. He carried every congressional district including Jefferson County, where a Democrat had not won a race in 20 years. His separately selected running mate, Thelma Stovall, became the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.|$|E

500|$|For most {{applications}} of hashing, {{it is necessary}} to compute the hash function for each value <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> it is hashed, rather than once when its object is created. In such applications, random or pseudorandom numbers cannot be used as hash values, because then different objects with the same value would have different hashes. And cryptographic hash functions (which are designed to be computationally indistinguishable from truly random functions) are usually too slow to be used in hash tables. Instead, other methods for constructing hash functions have been devised. These methods compute the hash function quickly, and can be proven to work well with linear probing. In particular, linear probing has been analyzed from the framework of -independent hashing, a class of hash functions that are initialized from a small random seed and that are equally likely to map any -tuple of distinct keys to any -tuple of indexes. The parameter [...] {{can be thought of as}} a measure of hash function quality: the larger [...] is, the more time it will take to compute the hash function but it will behave more similarly to completely random functions.|$|E
