50|$|In 1993 Mike joined jazz <b>keyboard</b> <b>icon</b> Chick Corea in the Elektric Band II {{to record}} the Grammy-nominated album “Paint the World.” On this recording, Corea said: I wanted {{to go for a}} much less thought-out, produced, {{composed}} music. I wanted less written notes, varying tempos of songs… there was no effort in making it, and it’s exactly what we played.” The Elektric Band II toured the world {{for a year and a}} half, giving Miller an opportunity to play with Corea in an extended situation.|$|E
2500|$|... iOS 7.1 was {{released}} on March 10, 2014. The update included improvements to the Touch ID fingerprint technology, support for CarPlay, and a fix for a home screen crash issue. It also brought visual updates for the shift and caps lock keys on the <b>keyboard,</b> refined <b>icons</b> for several of Apple's standard apps, and a redesign for {{some aspects of the}} Phone dialer and shutdown screens.|$|R
5000|$|GUI {{buttons and}} menu items : In Swing and Borland Delphi programming, an [...] is a command object. In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} perform the desired command, an Action may have an associated <b>icon,</b> <b>keyboard</b> shortcut, tooltip text, and so on. A toolbar button or menu item component may be completely initialized using only the Action object.|$|R
50|$|Appetizer is an {{open source}} dock for Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7, which allows {{organizing}} the user's shortcuts and applications. It can be customized via skins and plugins and is available in 25 languages. Various other features are available including support for <b>keyboard</b> shortcuts, custom <b>icons</b> and tray icon support. Appetizer also features a function to automatically launch certain applications when it starts.|$|R
5000|$|During {{its early}} days, the Macintosh could be {{converted}} to the Dvorak pattern by making changes to the [...] "System" [...] file: this was not easily reversible and required restarting the machine. This modification was unofficial, but it was comparable to many other user modifications and customizations that Mac users made. Using the [...] "resource editor", ResEdit, users could create <b>keyboard</b> layouts, <b>icons,</b> and other useful items. A few years later, a third-party developer offered a utility program called MacKeymeleon, which put a menu on the menu bar that allowed on-the-fly switching of keyboard layouts. Eventually, Apple Macintosh engineers built the functionality of this utility into the standard system software, {{along with a few}} layouts: QWERTY, Dvorak, French (AZERTY), and other foreign-language layouts.|$|R
40|$|What {{will be the}} {{equivalent}} of mouse and <b>keyboard,</b> windows and <b>icons</b> [...] the ubiquitous components of the GUI in the post-desktop era? To explore this question, we have developed a toolkit and framework called iStuff that facilitates experimentation with multiple technologies, modalities, and metaphors for user interfaces in a ubicomp environment. Our domain is explicit interaction with a room sized environment consisting of displays of many sizes, plus support for wireless technology of various types, integrated using a common middleware. Our goal is to allow multiple, co-located users to fluidly interact with any of the displays and applications in the room, using for input any devices conveniently at hand...|$|R
50|$|A mobile device, (or {{handheld}} computer), is a {{computing device}} {{small enough to}} hold and operate in the hand. Typically, the device has a either flatscreen display with a small numeric keypad or alphanumeric keyboard, or a touchscreen providing a virtual <b>keyboard</b> and buttons (<b>icons)</b> on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery. Mobile devices may run mobile operating systems that allow third-party apps specialized for said capabilities to be installed and run.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to touchscreen interface, there are physical and silkscreen buttons {{that can be}} used to activate programs or functions. On the silkscreen there are eight buttons: four large icons and four on the edges of the silkscreen writing area. With the factory default settings the large icons activate the following functions: [...] "home" [...] (House Icon) takes the user to the home applications menu, [...] "menu" [...] (pulldown icon) activates the pulldown menu, HotSync (the two arrows icon) connected the computer and the Palm Pilot and syncs information between the two, [...] "find" [...] (magnifying glass icon) brings up a search dialogue which allows the user to search all files on the handheld. The four smaller buttons are at each corner of the writing area and have the following default functions: Clock (clock icon) brings up the Date and Time briefly, then reverts to the current program, Contrast (Circle icon: half black, half white) allows the user to adjust the contrast and brightness of the display, <b>Keyboard</b> (ABC <b>Icon)</b> brings up an on-screen keyboard that allowed the user to [...] "type" [...] using the stylus, Number Board (123 icon) brings up the keypad on-screen keyboard which is used in much the same way as the letters keyboard.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{location}} of screen taps on modern smartphones and tablets can be identified from accelerometer and gyroscope readings. Our findings have serious implications, as we demonstrate that an attacker can launch a background process on commodity smartphones and tablets, and silently monitor the user’s inputs, such as <b>keyboard</b> presses and <b>icon</b> taps. While precise tap detection is nontrivial, requiring machine learning algorithms to identify fingerprints of closely spaced keys, sensitive sensors on modern devices aid the process. We present TapPrints, a framework for inferring the location of taps on mobile device touchscreens using motion sensor data combined with machine learning analysis. By running tests on two different offthe-shelf smartphones and a tablet computer we show that identifying tap locations {{on the screen and}} inferring English letters could be done with up to 90 % and 80 % accuracy, respectively. By optimizing the core tap detection capability with additional information, such as contextual priors, we are able to further magnify the core threat...|$|R
5000|$|RISC OS 3 in 1991 {{introduced}} the Apps icon {{to the left}} and replaced the Task Managers Archimedes logo with the Acorn nut. Apps provided access to the ROM based applications and the functionality of TinyDirs was replaced by the OS command AddTinyDir. The Shift-F12 <b>keyboard</b> shortcut and <b>icon</b> grouping were also added, with the intention of simplifying the finding of desired icons.The whole of RISC OS, including the icon bar, was given a facelift in 1993 including replacement of the flat grey colour with a textured wallpaper. This was referred to as the 3D [...] "Look and Feel".In 1994, this 3D look was provided as standard with the release of RISC OS 3.5 on the [...] series.The [...] "nested Wimp" [...] introduced in 1998 (as a soft load for existing machines) added the feature to temporarily bring the icon bar {{to the front of the}} window stack by moving the pointer to the bottom of the screen (previously this required Shift-F12 on the keyboard).|$|R
