5|$|Unable {{to focus}} on {{research}} problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a <b>dinner</b> <b>plate</b> in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and attempted unsuccessfully {{to use them to}} formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E

It has been reportedly introduced to Chile, Australia and New Zealand, where it grows in Pinus radiata plantations. Popular places for collecting this mushroom, especially among the Polish community, are around Macedon in Victoria, and in the Oberon area in New South Wales, Australia, where they can grow {{to the size of}} a <b>dinner</b> <b>plate.</b> Many people of Italian, Polish, Ukrainian and other eastern European ancestry in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, Australia travel to collect these mushrooms after autumn rainfall around Easter time.|$|E

At Emma's house, Emma has taken Gold - and Hook's sword - since {{it was the last}} item that Gold touched when before he became the Dark One, which is what is needed to heal him. Emma wakes Gold up, by {{performing}} a healing spell, destroying the blade. She reveals that his heart is a blank slate and promises to make him the purest hero. She hints that she wants him to pull Excalibur out of the stone, in order to vanquish the light.|$|E

[...] In a review of the sixth season of The Simpsons, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes, [...] "Homer’s disdain for Marge’s sisters– and vice versa– has always led to terrific sparks, and “Vs.” provides another great round in their eternal battle. It’s hilarious to see Homer indebted to the Terrible Two..." ...|$|E

Desideria Ocampo died in Nize, France after Estrada Cabrera sent her there for treatment. Diego had {{contracted}} a venereal disease {{while he was}} studying in the United States. The treatment of this, and his previous excesses led to tuberculosis; [...] unable to cope with it, he killed himself. On November 8, 1912, Francisco Estrada, who had just returned to Guatemala from Europe where he was learning agricultural technology in Paris, {{found himself in a}} 4000 dollar debt after courting a French lady older than himself. When Estrada Cabrera found out about this, he put the receipt under his son's <b>dinner</b> <b>plate</b> and waited for his reaction.

2500|$|Many Italian staples {{and internationally}} {{recognized}} favorites were invented and refined during the Late Middle Ages {{and the early}} Renaissance; pasta was on everyone's <b>dinner</b> <b>plate</b> by the 13th century, though it was commonly made out of rice flour rather than durum wheat; pizza, the medieval Italian term for [...] "pie", and tortes came in many varieties {{with a wide range}} of toppings, ranging from marzipan, and custards to chicken, eel, or even hemp; polenta made from French green lentils or barley; risotto; and a myriad of local or regional variants of sausage and cheese which was eaten by more or less everyone. As early as the Middle Ages, the cheeses, in particular, appear to have been highly specialized, from a fresh Tuscan to an aged Milanese from Tadesca, wrapped and shipped in tree bark. Medieval Italians also used eggs to a higher degree than many other regions, and the recipe collections describe herb omelettes (herboletos) and frittatas. Grapes as tasty morsels and lemons as a cooking ingredient was ubiquitous and, of course, olive oil of every conceivable kind was the cooking fat of choice in all regions, including the north, for dressing salads, frying, seasoning, marinading and preserving meats.|$|E

The mutilated remnant of a huge planter statue, nearly dissolved by the rains of a century, and vaguely resembling a majestic female in Roman draperies, with a wreath in her hand, stands neglected amid the laurels. Such statues, though apparently works of art, grow naturally in Irish gardens. Their germination is a mystery to the oldest inhabitants, to whose means and taste they are totally foreign.|$|E
