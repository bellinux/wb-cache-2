40|$|Abstract: This article {{examines}} current <b>global</b> oral <b>health</b> initiatives to underserved dental populations and assesses {{the level of}} familiarity with these initiatives among dental students. The World Health Organization (WHO) ’s basic package of oral care (BPOC) is described, as well as successes and difficulties in <b>global</b> oral <b>health</b> initiatives. A survey was conducted of third-year dental students at a North American dental school to determine their familiarity with <b>global</b> oral <b>health</b> initiatives set out by the WHO and the World Dental Federation (FDI). The majority of the surveyed students (87 percent) expressed interest in volun-teering their professional services in international settings. However, none of the surveyed students knew about the BPOC or the FDI’s role in <b>global</b> oral <b>health.</b> The findings indicate that predoctoral dental public health courses in dental schools ought to include a course on <b>global</b> oral <b>health</b> to expose students to <b>global</b> oral <b>health</b> issues and equip them with interventions like the BPOC so they can provide better care to globally underserved dental populations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Global</b> Public <b>Health</b> is {{increasingly}} {{being seen as}} a speciality field within the university education of Public Health. However, the exact meaning of <b>Global</b> Public <b>Health</b> is still unclear resulting in varied curricula and teaching units among universities.

Though <b>Global</b> Public <b>Health</b> is readily understood as <b>health</b> of <b>global</b> population, it is mainly practised as health problems and their solutions set within low and middle income countries. Additional specialist competencies relevant to the context of low and middle income countries are needed to work in this field.

The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E

Pregnancy results in major changes in a girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and economically and jeopardises her transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl's lack of choices. or abuse. Child marriage (see below) is a major contributor worldwide, since 90% of births to girls aged 15–19 occur within marriage.|$|E
