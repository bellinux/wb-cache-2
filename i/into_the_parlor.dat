60|$|Yes, the King was at home; {{would he}} come <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> and sit down? So Peter went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> and sat down, {{and then the}} King came in, dressed all in his best dressing-gown, with silver {{slippers}} upon his feet, and a golden crown upon his head.|$|E
60|$|He {{followed}} her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> {{and closed the}} door behind them.|$|E
60|$|They {{both went}} {{together}} back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> {{to ask the}} question.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Thatcher, a tall thin woman, welcomed Rose in sober fashion, and led <b>the</b> way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>parlor,</b> {{which seemed}} {{incredibly}} elegant to the shy girl.|$|R

60|$|So, led {{by their}} fat little host, who waddled {{as he walked}} {{in a way that}} made Tot laugh, they went to the house and were ushered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>parlor.</b>|$|R
60|$|St. Clare {{carried her}} in his arms <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> and laid her on the sofa.|$|E
60|$|Euphemia met {{me at the}} door. She had Pomona's baby in her arms. We walked {{together}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor.</b>|$|E
60|$|Margaret heard Jean {{open the}} front door and speak to some person or persons whom she showed, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor.</b>|$|E
60|$|He waited half an {{hour before}} she came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boarding-house <b>parlor.</b> Fifty times he opened the book of {{photographs}} of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, fifty times he looked at the picture of the Court of Honor.|$|R
60|$|All were ushered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> squire's <b>parlor,</b> {{where he}} had a {{flat-top}} desk and several office chairs. The squire had heard of Captain Putnam, and knew of the fame of the academy, and he respected the Hall owner accordingly.|$|R
60|$|But if I {{was walking}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spider's <b>parlor,</b> {{it would be}} my own fault if I got hurt, for I was {{entering}} with my eyes open. I determined to be on my guard, and take nothing for granted.|$|R
60|$|The stranger, {{who was at}} once ushered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> {{was evidently}} disconcerted by the {{presence}} of the three women.|$|E
60|$|Hurrying <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> {{they found}} only Annon and the major, both looking startled, and both staring {{out of the}} windows.|$|E
60|$|Miss Ophelia, who seldom sat much in Marie's company, {{followed}} him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> having first carefully laid away the paper.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few days}} after his passing, actor Will Geer {{wrote in a letter}} to The New York Times Drama Editor, “It should be noted that Whitford Kane was an expert teacher and had a {{following}} as stout as any “studio” of the day. For fifty years he taught that an actor’s warmth must burst through the proscenium arch. Sometimes he would gallop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> with such Christmas horseplay as “St. George and the Dragon.” For he was always ready to tilt at sham or tinsel in the theatre of life. I can hear him today; Yes Virginia Rouns Patrick Dennis Tanner, there is a real Auntie Mame.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Barker {{a little}} impatiently, [...] "you didn't {{expect me to}} take him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> public <b>parlor,</b> where I was seeing visitors, did you? I sent him out with <b>the</b> nurse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower hall {{to play with the}} other children." ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting for}} his reply she went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>parlor,</b> and {{returned}} with pen, ink, and paper. Arranging a blotting-book on her knees, and looking a model of cheerful submission, she placed herself once more {{in front of her}} master's chair.|$|R
60|$|Alfred wiped 'is boots afore {{he thought}} of wot he was doing. Then he drew hisself up stiff agin and marched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Babbie ruefully. [...] "Think of something, Jean. But {{open the}} door now. Stop, let me <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He won't go away," [...] Babbie answered, [...] "You {{will have}} to let him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> Jean. Can she see the door from up there?" ...|$|E
60|$|Josephine led <b>the</b> way downstairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>parlor,</b> {{which was}} quite as uncomfortably {{beautiful}} as the bedroom. The vases and flowers, and simple pictures, and the piano, all {{seemed like the}} furnishings of the homes she had read about in stories.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} doors of {{entrance}} to the room. One, <b>the</b> door <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>parlor,</b> close at Magdalen's left hand. The other, <b>the</b> door <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>parlor,</b> situated behind her. Mrs. Lecount politely retired--through the open folding-doors--by this latter means of exit, {{so as not to}} disturb the visitor by passing in front of her. Magdalen waited until she heard the door open and close again behind her, and then resolved {{to make the most of}} the opportunity which left her alone with Noel Vanstone. The utter hopelessness of rousing a generous impulse in that base nature had now been proved by her own experience. The last chance left was to treat him like the craven creature he was, and to influence him through his fears.|$|R
60|$|After {{exploring}} the caverns {{we came up}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> again, and Miss S. showed me a Scottish album, in which were all sorts of sketches, memorials, autographs, and other such matters. What interested me more, {{she was making a}} collection of Scottish ballads, words and tunes. I told her that I had noticed, since I had been in Scotland, that the young ladies seemed to take very little interest in the national Scotch airs, and were all devoted to Italian; moreover, that the Scotch ballads and memories, which so interested me, seemed to have very little interest for people generally in Scotland. Miss S. was warm enough in her zeal to make up a considerable account, and so we got on well together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, she's yours by {{a fiction}} of law, then," [...] said St. Clare, {{as he turned}} back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> {{and sat down to}} his paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come,--don't cry; {{you shall}} have them!" [...] and, putting them together, he threw {{them into her}} lap, and drew Miss Ophelia with him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor.</b>|$|E
6000|$|We went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> and as {{we joined}} the dancers, despite all that {{confusion}} I heard her whisper: [...] "I've been a little beast to you." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{follows a}} side hall plan. The staircase from the entry hall has a turned newel and balusters with a detailed handrail. A four-paneled wooden door leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>parlor,</b> where a round-arched entryway opens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> oriel window. Many other {{rooms in the}} house are still decorated and finished as they originally were.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some time we must. It {{was such}} fun! And didn't {{you think we}} were {{fortunate}} to get such a pretty house? You must see both our parlors." [...] She jumped up, and her mother followed her with a bewildered look as she ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>parlor</b> and flashed up the gas.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked up}} past Whitehall with Gibbons and Ingleston, the others going in pairs, {{so as not}} to attract attention. As soon as they reached Ingleston's place, the latter told the man in the bar to put the {{shutters}} up, led <b>the</b> way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bar <b>parlor,</b> and mixed a large bowl of punch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess what?" [...] he asked, walking her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> {{with his}} arms round her. She kept her hands behind her when he {{released}} her, and they stood confronted.|$|E
60|$|I took Mr. Mason <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> a {{room that}} I hardly knew, {{although}} I {{had lived in the}} house about two years. Presently Gus came down the stairs.|$|E
60|$|And my wife, with {{thoughtful}} brow, {{looks over}} the plans, and considers how two feet more are to be got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> without moving any of the walls.|$|E
60|$|On {{this last}} point Lucy had her cunning projects, {{and when she}} and Maggie had made their {{dangerous}} way down <b>the</b> bright stairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> handsome <b>parlor,</b> where <b>the</b> very sunbeams seemed cleaner than elsewhere, she directed her manœuvres, as any other great tactician would have done, against the weaker side of the enemy.|$|R
60|$|We {{paused at}} <b>the</b> door leading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> big <b>parlor.</b> Couples were passing. Here I could {{scarcely}} distinguish {{the last words}} she said. She stood before me, eyes downcast, face flushed, as sweet and pretty a lass as man could want to see, and with her hand she twisted round and round a silver button on my buckskin vest.|$|R
50|$|Although the Academy {{was built}} as a {{boarding}} school, it always made room for day students who were few in those early days. By 1964, however, with increased population growth on Long Island, {{it became obvious that}} there was not so much a need for a boarding school as for day students. Dormitories were converted into classrooms, and dining rooms <b>into</b> cafeterias. <b>The</b> <b>parlors</b> still remain for meeting parents and guests, and providing meetings for special events.|$|R
