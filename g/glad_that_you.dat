500|$|... "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] was the album's {{official}} lead single. It {{was chosen}} as a single by Interscope after Manson played an instrumental version of the song to their artists and repertoire department, where an employee exclaimed: [...] "This is gonna be a hit!". Manson {{is reported to have}} responded: [...] "Well, I'm <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have no consideration for what I [...] put on top of it." [...] A heavily censored version of the profanity-laced track, re-titled to [...] "Arma... geddon", was serviced to radio in the US from April 13. It peaked at number 37 on Billboards Mainstream Rock, becoming their lowest-peaking single on that chart in the process. A music video, directed by Los Angeles-based filmmaker and photographer Delaney Bishop, premiered on the website of British music magazine NME on May 14. Delaney had previously directed the 2005 short film The Death of Salvador Dali, which starred Manson's ex-wife, Dita Von Teese.|$|E
2500|$|... "We're from America" [...] was {{released}} {{as a free}} download on the band's website on March 27, 2009, while a Hot Topic-exclusive CD single followed two weeks later. After playing an instrumental version of [...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] to Interscope's A department, it {{was chosen as the}} album's official lead single, with an employee telling Manson, [...] "This is gonna be a hit!". Manson then quipped to the employee, [...] "Well, I'm <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have no consideration for what I [...] put on top of it." [...] A heavily censored version of the profanity-laced track – re-titled to [...] "Arma... geddon" [...] – was serviced to radio from April 13, and peaked at number thirty-seven on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart, becoming their lowest-peaking single in the process. The album {{was released}} on May 26, 2009 and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 49,000 copies, their lowest opening week figure since The Last Tour on Earth debuted with 26,000 copies in 1999. It was supported by [...] "The High End of Low Tour". Rob Holliday did not rejoin the band, with former Wired All Wrong member Andy Gerold performing bass and Twiggy taking over on lead guitar.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{positive}} review came from Wolverhampton Express and Star: [...] "Slade haven't {{had a big}} hit for some time now, {{but it would be}} silly to write them off just yet, to judge by their new album Return to Base. There is definitely a Sixties feel to some of the songs, though others are vintage Slade. Most striking thing about the album is its variety, for Slade have loosened up a bit for this one and included much more variety of mood. It certainly pays off. Another striking factor is the guitar playing of Dave Hill, who has really been allowed to branch out on this disc. In all, it's an album which will please Slade's still huge army of fans, both for its fidelity to the Slade sound and for its inventiveness and freshness." [...] In May 1980, Jon Young of New York magazine Trouser Press reviewed the album and stated: [...] "On Return to Base, seven of the eleven cuts connect in every possible way, for a batting average of [...]636. If it had been released in 1973, the classic [...] "Nuts, Bolts and Screws" [...] would've easily topped the UK charts. Okay, there's nothing here quite as wonderful as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize". But whose fault is that? This kind of music isn't meant for a vacuum! It's meant to be enjoyed! Give Slade some encouragement! You will be <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did!!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Springer {{was elected}} to the Cincinnati city council in 1971. He {{resigned}} in 1974 after admitting to hiring a prostitute. The episode was uncovered when a police raid on a Fort Wright, Kentucky massage parlor found a check Springer had written pinned to a wall in their office with [...] "for services rendered" [...] written in the memo. Springer came clean at a press conference. Long-time Cincinnati newsman Al Schottelkotte pronounced Springer's career over, but Springer's honesty helped him win back his seat in 1975 by a landslide. In a post-election interview, Schottelkotte good-naturedly reminded Springer that he had declared Springer's career over. Springer told the newsman, [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were wrong." [...] In 1977, he was chosen to serve one year as mayor by the City Council. [...] Springer could only serve one year as mayor due to a political arrangement at the time (Cincinnati has since changed to direct election of its mayor) that required the Democrats to split the mayoral term with a local centrist group, the Charter Party, with whom the Democrats governed in an electoral alliance. [...] In the City Council, and as mayor, Springer supported changing the local election system so that council members would be elected by districts (thus better representing neighborhood interests) instead of [...] "9X" [...] at-large system, but his efforts (as well as those of everyone else, to date, who has supported such a change) did not meet with success.|$|E
