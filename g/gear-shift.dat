2500|$|Subsequent to {{completion}} of production car number one at Hethel, {{the company announced}} problems with transmission reliability.

The first production car was not delivered with this interim solution; P1 has both transmission gears enabled. According to the plan, the initial transmissions were to be swapped out under warranty when the finalized transmission, power electronics module (PEM), and cooling system became available.

30|$|The double-parameters {{balanced}} AMT <b>gear-shifting</b> strategy (BGS), which {{balances the}} dynamic <b>gear-shifting</b> (DGS) maneuver {{and the economic}} <b>gear-shifting</b> (EGS) maneuver, is employed. This strategy tends to dynamic or economic depending on the driving intention, which could be quantified by the designed fuzzy inference. Taking the effects of engine operating points for example, the full DGS ensures that engine might work on the external characteristic line, and the full EGS reflects that engine would work on the optimal operating line with the highest efficiency. According to the quantified driving intention, the AMT <b>gear-shifting</b> maneuver might be determined that the <b>gear-shifting</b> maneuver tends to DGS with urgent accelerating intention and conversely tends EGS with keep and normal accelerating intention. Therefore, the energy-efficient operation of PHEB without drivability loss might be fulfilled by the proposed <b>gear-shifting</b> strategy.|$|R

The purpose {{is to improve the}} energy efficiency, driving stability for an Utility Vehicle (UV) that is original equipped with a 500 cc internal combustion engine. The designed power train is consisted of two 5 kw brushless DC motors (BLDC) with the associated motor drivers, automatic manual transmission (AMT), AMT controllers, and 288 V 16 AH Lithium-ion battery pack. The works include power train specification design, mechanism and controller design for the clutchless AMT, optimal transmissions <b>gear-shifting</b> strategy design, and finally, power split strategy design for the 4 WD in terms of wheel slip ratio control. To guarantee AMT <b>gear-shifting</b> quality, the <b>gear-shifting</b> maps was applied in gear change process.

5000|$|A {{patent for}} the {{invention}} was never obtained before the inventor's untimely death. An abandoned Layland jeep was utilized for the invention {{and it is}} to this day, displayed at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Lagos during the said faculty's [...] "Engineering week". It basically consists of a jeep, with a second steering wheel built-in at the rear end that connects the axle. A <b>gear-shift</b> is also built here that connects, through a built-in mechanism, to the already pre-existing four gears, such that the hybrid vehicle can be driven on all four gears, in both forward and backward directions.

40|$|Independent <b>gear-shifting</b> {{actuation}} systems, {{which are}} based on linear electromagnetic actuators (LEMAs), have tremendous potential to minimize the shifting duration of automated mechanical transmission (AMT). A velocity estimator based on the measurements of current is designed to achieve sensorless control of the actuator by using only electrical subsystem, thus avoiding the use of a complete system model that contains mechanical uncertainties. The elimination of the position sensor simplifies the structure of the <b>gear-shifting</b> system and reduces the manufacturing cost. To enhance the robustness of the position control, model-assisted reduced-order extended state observer (ESO) based cascade controller is constructed, which take parameter uncertainties and external load force as the lumped disturbance to observe and compensate them dynamically. Finally, simulation and experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed velocity estimator and control method...|$|R
50|$|Housings for {{bicycles}} {{are made}} in two main diameters; most often 4 mm diameter is used for <b>gear-shifting</b> and 5 mm for brakes.

5000|$|An [...] "electronic <b>gear-shifting</b> system" [...] is {{a method}} of {{changing}} gears, which enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers.

5000|$|The {{freewheel}} segment, installed {{inside the}} rear differential, lets rear wheels rotate faster than front wheels without locking the viscous coupling and preventing ABS from applying brakes to each wheel independently. Because of the freewheel, torque {{can be transferred}} to rear axle only when the vehicle is moving forward. For four-wheel drive to work when reversing, a vacuum-actuated [...] "throttle control element" [...] is installed on the differential case. This device locks the freewheel mechanism when in reverse gear. The freewheel mechanism unlocks when the <b>gear-shift</b> lever is pushed to the right, past the third gear. The freewheel is not unlocked immediately after leaving reverse gear on purpose - this is to prevent the freewheel from cycling from locked to unlocked if the car is stuck and driver is trying to [...] "rock" [...] the car by changing from first to reverse and back.|$|E
50|$|FSO Syrena Sport was 2-door coupe with a {{fibreglass}} body on a steel chassis with strengthened floor panel. The {{engine was}} a new design 4-stroke 2-cylinder air-cooled boxer engine with aluminium block. The cast-iron cylinders, cylinder heads and pistons were from the S-03 engine of the Polish motorcycle Junak. The prototype engine was fitted with accessories (carburettor, ignition, etc.) from a French car Panhard Dyna Z. It had a displacement of 700 cc and developed around 35 bhp (26 kW) at 6000 rpm, which provided adequate performance for this light car (710 kg). The engine was {{placed in front of}} the front axle and powered front wheels through a 4-gear manual gearbox, identical with that of Syrena 100. The front suspension was not identical with that from the classic Syrena, but based on the same concept: independent with single transverse feathercoil, lower A-wishbones and hydraulic dampers. Single-circuit drum brakes were installed on all wheels. Specific for Syrena Sport was the independent rear suspension, with trailing arms, torsion bars and almost horizontal hydraulic dampers. Another difference was a floor <b>gear-shift</b> mechanism and hydraulic-operated clutch.|$|E

50|$|In bicycle applications, {{for both}} brakes and <b>gear-shifting,</b> the outer {{dimension}} of the cap or ferrule that terminates a housing, is selected to make a loose fit within the barrel-adjuster's end. In this way the barrel will slip on the ferrule as it is turned during adjustments. If the ferrule were to be jammed into the barrel end, then the cable would twist during fruitless attempts at adjustment.|$|R
50|$|The central {{processing}} unit powers a hydro-mechanical unit to either engage or disengage the clutch, which is kept in close synchronization with the <b>gear-shifting</b> action the driver has started. In some cases, the hydro-mechanical unit contains a servomotor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear actuator, which uses brake fluid from the braking system to impel a hydraulic cylinder to move the main clutch actuator. In other cases, the clutch actuator may be completely electric.|$|R
