In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>General</b> <b>Possibility</b> Theorem, Kenneth Arrow {{argues that}} if a {{legislative}} consensus can be reached through a simple majority, then minimum conditions must be satisfied, and these conditions must provide a superior ranking to any subset of alternative votes (Arrow 1963). A bill must be attractive to a legislator, or else he will not cast his vote for it. A vote, by the pure nature of the voting process, demonstrates explicit interest in whatever is voted upon. In logrolling, a superior ranking means that the marginal benefit of the vote is greater than any alternatives, so exchanging votes is worthwhile. The <b>General</b> <b>Possibility</b> Theorem necessitates that allocating one vote for another must constitute true utility and a sincere vote. Arrow's theory may place more restrictions and limitations on an individual voter's preferences than Buchanan and Tullock's; regardless, individuals will always choose the option they value most.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of minimal seesaw framework, we study the {{implications}} of Dirac and Majorana mass matrices in which two rigid properties coexist, namely, equalities among mass matrix elements and texture zeros. In {{the first part of}} the study, we discuss <b>general</b> <b>possibilities</b> of the Dirac and Majorana mass matrices for neutrinos with such hybrid structures. We then classify the mass matrices into realistic textures which are compatible with global neutrino oscillation data and unrealistic ones which do not comply with the data. Among the large number of <b>general</b> <b>possibilities,</b> we find that only 6 patterns are consistent with the observations at the level of the most minimal number of free parameters. These solutions have only 2 adjustable parameters, so that all the mixing angles can be described in terms of the two mass differences or pure numbers. We analyze these textures in detail and discuss their impacts for future neutrino experiments and for leptogenesis.
