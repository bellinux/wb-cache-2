5|$|In contrast, Roman {{expansion}} into Spain and Gaul occurred as {{a mix of}} alliance-seeking and military occupation. In the 2nd century BC, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of alliance-seeking, but {{this time in the}} face of major powers that could rival Rome. According to Polybius, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several Greek city-states seeking Roman protection against the Macedonian kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of destabilisation created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome could fill. This had some important similarities to (and <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> from) the events in Italy centuries earlier, but this time on a global scale.|$|E

5|$|Schubert's last sonatas mark a {{distinct}} change of compositional style from his earlier piano sonatas, with several <b>important</b> <b>differences.</b> The typical movement length has increased, {{due to the}} use of long, lyrical, fully rounded-off, ternary-form themes, the insertion of development-like passages within expositions, and the lengthening of the development section proper. Texturally, the orchestral grandeur of the middle-period sonatas gives way to a more intimate writing that resembles a string ensemble. New textures appear in the last sonatas – scale-like melodic elements, free counterpoint, free fantasia, and simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass, repeated chords, and ostinati; the orchestral unison texture, abundant in the preceding sonatas, has disappeared. The harmonic language has also changed: more distant key relationships are explored, longer modulatory excursions, more major/minor shifts of mode, and more chromatic and diverse harmonic progressions and modulations, using elements such as the diminished seventh chord. In general, the last sonatas seem to enact a return to an earlier, more individual and intimate Schubertian style, here combined with the compositional craftsmanship of Schubert's later works.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me.

Since its minimal <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> has never been established, {{our aim was to}} determine it using several approaches. Methods 88 COPD patients with FEV 1 ≤ 50 % predicted completed the HADS and other patient-important outcome measures before and after an inpatient respiratory rehabilitation. For the anchor-based approach we determined the correlation between the HADS and the anchors that have an established minimal <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire [CRQ] and Feeling Thermometer). If correlations were ≥ 0. 5 we performed linear regression analyses to predict the minimal <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> from the anchors. As distribution-based approach we used the Effect Size approach. Results Based on CRQ emotional function and mastery domain as well as on total scores, the minimal <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> was 1. 41 (95 % CI 1. 18 – 1. 63) and 1. 57 (1. 37 – 1. 76) for the HADS anxiety score and 1. 68 (1. 48 – 1. 87) and 1. 60 (1. 38 – 1. 82) for the HADS total score.

40|$|Objectives: Patient {{reported}} {{outcomes are}} increasingly {{used to assess}} outcomes after peripheral arterial disease (PAD) interventions. VascuQoL- 6 (VQ- 6) is a PAD specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument for routine clinical practice and clinical research. This study assessed the minimum <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> for the VQ- 6 and determined thresholds for the minimum <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> and substantial clinical benefit following PAD revascularisation. Materials and methods: This was a population-based observational cohort study. VQ- 6 data from the Swedvasc Registry (January 2014 to September 2016) was analysed for revascularised PAD patients. The minimum <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> was determined {{using a combination of}} a distribution based and an anchor-based method, while receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (ROC) was used to determine optimal thresholds for a substantial clinical benefit following revascularisation. Results: A total of 3194 revascularised PAD patients with complete VQ- 6 baseline recordings (intermittent claudication (IC) n ¼ 1622 and critical limb ischaemia (CLI) n ¼ 1572) were studied, of which 2996 had complete VQ- 6 recordings 30 days and 1092 a year after the vascular intervention. The minimum <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> 1 year after revascularisation for IC patients ranged from 1. 7 to 2. 2 scale steps, depending on the method of analysis. Among CLI patients, the minimum <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> after 1 year was 1. 9 scale steps. ROC analyses demonstrated that the VQ- 6 discriminative properties for a substantial clinical benefit was excellent for IC patients (area under curve (AUC) 0. 87, sensitivity 0. 81, specificity 0. 76) and acceptable in CLI (AUC 0. 736, sensitivity 0. 63, specificity 0. 72). An optimal VQ- 6 threshold for a substantial clinical benefit was determined at 3. 5 scale steps among IC patients and 4. 5 in CLI patients. Conclusions: The suggested thresholds for minimum <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> and substantial clinical benefit could be used when evaluating VQ- 6 outcomes following different interventions in PAD and in the design of Clinical trials...|$|R
