40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} {{is defined}} as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest and occurs in a majority of patients with heart failure. Diagnostic imaging targets the right ventricle and the pulmonary vasculature. Although <b>echocardiography</b> <b>is</b> <b>cost-effective</b> for screening and follow-up, right heart catheterization is still mandatory to differentiate pre- from post-capillary disease and to directly measure pressure and flow. An important goal is to rule out chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|SUMMARY Although {{echocardiography}} is {{more accurate}} than electrocardiography for detection of left ventric-ular hypertrophy, it is also more expensive, making it uncertain whether <b>echocardiography</b> <b>is</b> <b>cost-effective</b> for detection of this abnormality in hypertensive patients. Accordingly, the sensitivity of M-mode echocardiographic and electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy was determined in necropsied patients with anatomic hypertrophy of mild (n = 26), moderate (n = 21) or severe (n = 46) degree, and the prevalence of each degree of hypertrophy was determined in 561 hypertensive adults drawn from clinical and employed population samples. The sensitivity of echocardiographic left ventricular mass index criteria was 57 % in necropsied patients with mild hypertrophy and 98 % in patients with moderate or severe hypertrophy.

40|$|Abstract Background Stress <b>echocardiography</b> <b>is</b> a <b>cost-effective</b> {{tool for}} the modern noninvasive {{diagnosis}} of coronary artery disease. Several physical and pharmacological stresses are used in combination with echocardiographic imaging, usually exercise, dobutamine and dipyridamole. The safety of a stress is (or should be) a major determinant {{in the choice of}} testing. Although large scale single center experiences and multicenter trial information are available for both dobutamine and dipyridamole stress echo testing, complications or side effects still can occur even in the most experienced laboratories with the most skilled operators. Case presentation We decided to present a case collection of severe complications during pharmacological stress echo testing, including a ventricular tachycardia, cardiogenic shock, transient ischemic attack, torsade de pointe, fatal ventricular fibrillation, and free wall rupture. Conclusion We believe that, in this field, every past complication described is a future complication avoided; what happens in your lab is more true of what you read in journals; and Good Clinical Practice is not "not having complications", but to describe the complications you had. </p...|$|R

BackgroundStress <b>echocardiography</b> <b>is</b> an established, <b>cost-effective</b> technique for the detection of CAD. MethodsFrom the Echo Persantine International Cooperative–Echo Dobutamine International Cooperative data bank, 7, 333 patients (5, 452 males; 59 ± 10 years) underwent pharmacologic stress echocardiography with either high-dose dipyridamole (0. 84 mg/kg over 10 min) (n = 4, 984) or high-dose dobutamine (up to 40 μg/kg/ 3 min) (n = 2, 349) for diagnostic purposes. Patients were followed up for a mean of 2. 6 years (range 1 to 206 months). ResultsThe DET was positive for myocardial ischemia in 2, 854 (35 %) patients and negative in 4, 479 (61 %) patients. During the follow-up there were 161 cardiac deaths (sudden death and fatal myocardial infarction) (2. 1 % of the total population). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed a significantly better outcome for those patients with a negative pharmacologic stress echocardiography test compared with those with a positive test (92 vs. 71. 2 %, p = 0. 0000). ConclusionsPharmacologic stress echocardiography with either dipyridamole or dobutamine is effective in predicting cardiac death during a long-term follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Anti-cancer {{treatments}} markedly {{improved the}} prognosis of patients, but unfortunately might be hampered by cardiotoxicity. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic clinical forms of heart failure have been reported, which may be reversible or irreversible. The aim of this review is to {{provide an overview of}} the antineoplastic agents associated with cardiac toxicity and of the available diagnostic techniques. METHODS AND METHODS: This narrative review is based on material from MEDLINE and PUBMED up to November 2015. We looked at the terms antineoplastic drugs and cardiac toxicity in combination with echocardiography, troponins, cardiac magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Anthracyclines, monoclonal antibodies, fluoropyrimidines, taxanes, alkylating agents, vinka alkaloids were reported to induce different clinical manifestations of cardioxicity. Chest radiotherapy is also associated with various forms of cardiac damage, which are indistinguishable from those found in patients with heart disease of other etiologies and that may even appear several years after administration. Among diagnostic techniques, <b>echocardiography</b> <b>is</b> a non-invasive, <b>cost-effective,</b> and widely available imaging tool. Nuclear imaging and cardiac magnetic resonance may be used but are not so widely available and are more difficult to perform. Finally, some biomarkers, such as troponins, may be used to evaluate cardiac damage, but establishing the optimal timing of troponin assessment remains unclear and defining the cut-off point for positivity is still an important goal. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer treatments is associated with development of heart failure. Novel diagnostic tools might be relevant to early recognize irreversible forms cardiac diseases...|$|R

The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of alternative diagnostic strategies in low risk chest pain patients. Methods We evaluated direct and indirect downstream costs of 6 strategies: coronary angiography (CA) after positive troponin I or T (cTn-I or cTnT) (strategy 1); after positive exercise electrocardiography (ex-ECG) (strategy 2); after positive exercise echocardiography (ex-Echo) (strategy 3); after positive pharmacologic stress echocardiography (PhSE) (strategy 4); after positive myocardial exercise stress single-photon emission computed tomography with technetium Tc 99 m sestamibi (ex-SPECT-Tc) (strategy 5) and direct CA (strategy 6). Results The predictive accuracy in correctly identifying the patients was 83, 1 % for cTn-I, 87 % for cTn-T, 85, 1 % for ex-ECG, 93, 4 % for ex-Echo, 98, 5 % for PhSE, 89, 4 % for ex-SPECT-Tc and 18, 7 % for CA.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{compared}} the accuracy and cost implications of using exercise echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography for detection of {{coronary artery disease}} in women. Background. The specificity of exercise electrocardiography in women is lower than in men. Exercise echocardiography accurately identifies coronary artery disease in women, but its utility in place of exercise electrocardiography is unclear. Methods. One hundred sixty-one women without a previous Q wave infarction underwent exercise echocardiography and coronary angiography. Positive findings were a new or worsening wall motion abnormality on the exercise echocardiogram and ST segment depression > 0. 1 mV at 0. 08 s after the J point on the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG). Results. Coronary artery stenosis > 50 % diameter narrowing was present in 59 patients; the sensitivity (mean ± SD) of exercise <b>echocardiography</b> <b>was</b> 80 ± 3 %. In 48 patients with an interpretable ECG, the sensitivity of exercise <b>echocardiography</b> <b>was</b> 81 ± 4 %, {{and that of the}} exercise ECG was 77 ± 3 % (p = 0. 50). In 102 patients without coronary artery disease, the overall specificity of exercise <b>echocardiography</b> <b>was</b> 81 ± 4 %. In 70 patients with an interpretable ECG, the specificity of exercise echocardiography (80 ± 3 %) exceeded that of the exercise ECG (56 ± 4 %, p 80 %) or low (< 20 %) posttest probability group. In women without a previous exercise ECG, the specificity of exercise echocardiography continued to exceed that of exercise electrocardiography (80 ± 3 % vs. 64 ± 3 %, p = 0. 05).
