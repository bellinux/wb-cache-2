It was released on July 20, 2000 by Columbia Records as a double A-side with [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)". It was written by Carey and Snoop Dogg, and produced by the former and Damizza for Carey's seventh studio album, Rainbow (1999). It serves as the album's fourth single. It features Snoop Dogg throughout the songs bridge and is built around {{a sample of the}} 1988 song [...] "Piece of My Love," [...] originally performed by Guy and written by Teddy Riley, Aaron Hall, Timmy Gatling and Gene Griffin. Throughout the song, the protagonist reveals the struggles of dealing with insomnia and thoughts of a past relationship during the night, as she spirals out of control and declares [...] "I gotta <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> sleep." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Crybaby" [...] was {{recorded}} {{during the summer}} of 1999 in Capri, Italy. [...] The song is composed in common time in the key of D minor and features instrumentation from the guitar and piano. [...] The song moves at a tempo of 79 beats per minute. [...] Carey's vocal range throughout the song ranges from the low note of B2 to the high note of F5. [...] "Crybaby" [...] features a rap verse from Snoop Dogg, and incorporates heavy usage of background vocals. The song's lyrics find the protagonist struggling with insomnia due to thoughts of a past lover throughout the night, not allowing her to sleep. According to Carey, the song also has a more personal message, relating to the difficulty of getting rest with such a work-filled schedule. She claimed that through writing, recording and producing her music, as well as all the promotional appearances, it became increasingly difficult for her to unwind and sleep at night. At one point in the song, Carey sings [...] "I gotta <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> sleep," [...] before finishing the final chorus.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Martha; {{that was}} my unfailing {{obedience}} to the sacred laws of hospitality; I didn't expect to fall under their condemnation a second time, though." [...] Mrs. Braile did not answer, and by the familiar scent from within, Braile knew that his coffee must be nearly ready. As he dropped his chair forward, he heard a sound of frying, and [...] "Pshaw, Martha!" [...] he called. [...] "You're not <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> fresh bacon?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I was {{captured}} by a government spy, who wants to <b>get</b> from <b>me</b> <b>some</b> secret of the boomers. He is a bad-looking man, and I was awfully afraid of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah, {{you make}} me tired, Phil Lawrence!" [...] growled the prisoner. [...] "I don't think you'll {{be able to send}} me to prison; not for long, anyhow! My father's got plenty of money; he'll <b>get</b> <b>me</b> out <b>some</b> way." ...|$|R

6000|$|So {{they all}} three {{sat down to}} the table, but before they helped {{themselves}} the boy said, 'I am thirsty, mother; will you <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> milk?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Cecil, can you <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> writing things? We-—at least I—- {{ought to}} write and tell my tutor that I am sorry about that supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> somewhere," [...] said Tommy. [...] "If you don’t the cap’n ’ll {{have to come}} in these, and I’m sure he won’t like it." ...|$|E
60|$|When at last I reached our lodgings I {{was tired}} and sleepy, and glad enough to settle down again into the easy-chair, while Arthur hospitably went to his cupboard, to <b>get</b> <b>me</b> out <b>some</b> cake and wine, without which, he declared, he could not, as a doctor, permit my going to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon Pete will <b>get</b> <b>me</b> there <b>some</b> way, {{if he has}} to pack me on his back.

6000|$|... "Would you, my dear? That {{would be}} very kind of you! Do <b>get</b> <b>me</b> off <b>some</b> way; tell him I'm coming to see him very soon." [...] He went stupidly back to his writing, without looking to see whether his wife had meant all she said; and after a moment's {{hesitation}} she descended in fulfilment of her promise; or, perhaps rather it was a threat.|$|R
6000|$|... "O dear, no!" [...] she {{answered}} in surprise at a man's presuming to stir coffee; [...] "but {{you may go}} <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> water at the creek, if you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ann, <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> of your clothes, an' a sunbonnet--quick," [...] said Jean, {{forced out}} of his lethargy. [...] "I'll run out there disguised. Maybe I can go through with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have drawn}} {{it from the}} pool that is full of frogs and willows; you must <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> more.' So the woman set out again and walked still further to another lake.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} dreaming, citizen Tournefort," [...] {{the old man}} said, with a husky little laugh. [...] "Sit down, and let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> you <b>some</b> coffee--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that. Give me {{your arm}} and let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> supper. One always likes {{the idea of having}} done hard work, and one always likes to have been successful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will they? Ah--I do not know. But come, Harry; {{come and}} sit down, and let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> you <b>some</b> tea. There is no harm, I suppose, in having you here--is there ?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS: 'Don't speak, Edward! I KNOW {{there were}} two. On the Common. Not {{half an hour}} ago. As {{he was going to}} <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> rosebuds. In the midst of this terrible storm.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Making hats. I did one for Miss Horsfield, and {{afterwards}} friends of hers sent me some more to trim. She said she'd try to <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> work {{from one of}} the big stores." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{as soon as}} you can <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> groceries, I'll {{start for}} the rocks. Your uncle sent me along and stated you would help. You see, I'm Jimmy Leyland's partner and Miss Margaret's friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not very, thank goodness. Still, if he {{fell down}} {{he might not}} be able to get up again, {{especially}} if he'd hurt himself at all. Half a second. Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> on <b>some</b> boots, and I'll come out and look. Shan't be long.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is my hand, then." [...] So Johnny {{took her}} hand and pressed it, and held it a little while,--just long enough to seem to give a meaning to the action. [...] "You will <b>get</b> to {{understand}} <b>me</b> <b>some</b> day," [...] she said, [...] "and will learn that I do not like to be reckoned among the everybodies by those for whom I really--really--really have a regard. When I am angry, I am angry." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brody {{returns to}} the Swami {{and is about to}} pulverize him when he is asked {{precisely}} why he wants his luck to change. Taking Brody's answer literally ("So I can <b>get</b> <b>me</b> hands on <b>some</b> dough!"), Bugs sends him to 29 River Street, home of [...] "Grandma's Happy Home Bakery". When Brody arrives there and demands the [...] "dough" [...] at gunpoint, a baker (Bugs yet again) gladly obliges with [...] "a mess of dough" [...] which Brody gets stuck in and is baked into a pie.|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> bread?" [...] insisted Decoud. The child did not move; he saw {{her large}} eyes stare at him very dark from the corner. [...] "You're not afraid of me?" [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|Lance laughed. [...] "I was hungry. Look!" [...] he said, gayly tossing some silver {{into the}} air. [...] "Do {{you think you}} could <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> breakfast for that, and have enough left to buy {{something}} for yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Arthur put {{his hand}} up to his {{waistcoat}} buttons, and when Adam had unbuttoned it, he took a longer breath. [...] "Lay my head down," [...] he said, faintly, [...] "and <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> water if you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} {{anything}} now," [...] said Shirley. [...] "Give me a dram, and let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> on <b>some</b> dry clothes!

6000|$|... "Accommodate? Pray, {{no doubt}} you could {{accommodate}} me with a bosom-friend too, couldn't you? Accommodate! Obliging word accommodate: there's accommodation notes now, where one accommodates another with a loan, and if he don't pay it pretty quickly, accommodates him, with a chain to his foot. Accommodate! God forbid that I should ever be accommodated. No, no. Look you, as I told that cousin-german of yours, the herb-doctor, I'm now {{on the road to}} <b>get</b> <b>me</b> made <b>some</b> sort of machine to do my work. Machines for me. My cider-mill--does that ever steal my cider? My mowing-machine--does that ever lay a-bed mornings? My corn-husker--does that ever give me insolence? No: cider-mill, mowing-machine, corn-husker--all faithfully attend to their business. Disinterested, too; no board, no wages; yet doing good all their lives long; shining examples that virtue is its own reward--the only practical Christians I know." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{was only}} {{able to work with}} Professor Marsden for two years. However, I {{continue}} to learn from him well after his death. While it is obvious this research stands on his intellectual shoulders, there is a larger statement to be made in regards to his warmth. Upon Jerry’s passing I found myself caught by a supportive family of researchers. My new advisor, Mathieu Desbrun, has taken great care of me by providing useful advice on how to direct my research, while simultaneously supporting all of my ventures. Additionally, Melvin Leok and Hiroaki Yoshimura provided me with much-needed encouragement and moral support upon Jerry’s death. Secondly, I would like to thank Hiroaki Yoshimura, Tudor S. Ratiu, and Alan Weinstein. Each took substantial risk in adopting me as a collaborator, and {{spent a good deal of}} time reading early drafts of our work and <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> past <b>some</b> major obstacles in my research. Finally, I owe thanks to a variety of individuals who helped in ways big an...|$|R
