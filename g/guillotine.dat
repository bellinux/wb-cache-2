5|$|Saint-Just {{was arrested}} in the violent episode of 9 Thermidor and {{executed}} {{the next day with}} Robespierre and their allies. In many histories of the Revolution, their deaths at the <b>guillotine</b> mark the end of the Reign of Terror.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. The motif {{may have been}} borrowed from the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, who Bacon greatly admired and often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the cross into a <b>guillotine.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 1994, {{the student}} {{government}} dedicated a permanent {{memorial to the}} wall in Pfiefer Lounge (later a Starbucks and now the new Student Center) {{a few yards from}} the wall's edge.

5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson looking {{to close the}} {{distance}} early. Jackson immediately went for a double-leg takedown, and picked Silva up. Silva then locked his legs, creating a standing closed guard, and applied a <b>guillotine</b> choke. The two stayed in this position until Jackson loosened his own grip, taking the fight to the ground for the first time, with Silva holding onto the chokehold.|$|E
5|$|The twelfth season saw the UFC Welterweight {{champion}} Georges St-Pierre coach alongside former opponent {{and number}} one contender to the title, Josh Koscheck. The season saw {{the continuation of}} the wildcard format and 14-man tournament bracket. The show's number one pick was Marc Stevens, who would go on to lose in one of the quickest submissions (via <b>guillotine</b> choke) in the show's history. The wildcard slots went to Marc Stevens and Aaron Wilkinson, with Wilkinson handing Stevens his second successive <b>guillotine</b> choke loss. The show was dominated by Josh Koscheck's attempts to annoy Georges St-Pierre, with St-Pierre's paramedic getting involved in the arguments with Koscheck. The finale was a match between Jonathan Brookins and Michael Johnson on December 4, 2010 which resulted in Brookins winning via unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|This time Robespierre did {{not defend}} Custine. Custine's lovely daughter-in-law came daily to the {{courthouse}} to sit at his feet; eventually, the prosecutors accused the judges of postponing a verdict {{so that they could}} continue to gaze at her. The Revolutionary Tribunal convicted him of treason and he was executed by <b>guillotine</b> on the following day, 28 August 1793.|$|E

5|$|Until his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI. On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by <b>guillotine.</b> When the little boy Louis XVII, Louis XVI's 10 year-old-son, died in prison in June 1795, Louis XVIII, then in his 40th year, succeeded his nephew as titular King.|$|E
5|$|When Rich Attonito {{broke his}} hand, his {{spot in the}} quarter-finals became open. Due to the {{controversial}} loss to Ring, White selected McGee to fight in his place. In the quarter-finals, McGee was set to have a rematch with Ring, but Ring {{pulled out of the}} competition due to a knee injury. James Hammortree stepped in as Ring's replacement. Early in the second round, McGee submitted Hammortree with a rare standing <b>guillotine</b> choke.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez was a monarchist {{at heart}} and he despaired when King Louis XVI {{went to the}} <b>guillotine</b> on 21 January 1793. He found the {{political}} situation in Paris to be chaotic. He was appalled at the tendency of radicals to interfere with army commanders. Having already negotiated with the enemy, Dumouriez offered to treat and the Austrians sent Mack on 25 March. The French commander proposed to take the army and march on Paris. He would overthrow the National Convention, crush the Jacobins and restore the Constitution of 1791. For their part, the Austrians pledged to halt their advance while he carried out his coup. But Dumouriez moved too slowly. On 1 April, four commissioners and the War Minister Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville arrived at his headquarters to demand that the commander explain himself in Paris. They were seized and {{handed over to the}} Austrians.|$|E

5|$|Hughes {{made his}} mixed martial arts debut on January 1, 1998 at Joe Gaytia's JKD Challenge. He slammed his {{opponent}} {{to the ground}} in just fifteen seconds, winning via KO. The slam became his signature move. He won his next fight via submission due to strikes. Hughes fought three times at Extreme Challenge 21, on October 17, 1998 defeating Victor Hunsaker via TKO and future UFC Midleweight Champion Dave Menne via unanimous decision. In the third fight of that night he lost to then-undefeated Dennis Hallman by technical submission (<b>guillotine</b> choke) at 0:17 of the first round. The result was announced as a KO. In the process, Hallman handed Hughes his first professional defeat.|$|E
5|$|In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was {{initially}} unable {{to form a}} consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened. By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report {{in the name of}} the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the <b>guillotine</b> on 31 October 1793. Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} almost two full years {{until the first}} French Constitution was signed on 3 September 1791, and it {{required}} another popular intervention to make it happen. Louis attempted {{to work within the}} framework of his limited powers after the women's march but won little support, and he and the royal family remained virtual prisoners in the Tuileries. Desperate, he made his abortive flight to Varennes in June 1791. Attempting to escape and join up with royalist armies, the king was once again captured by a mixture of citizens and national guardsmen who hauled him back to Paris. Permanently disgraced, Louis was forced to accept a constitution more denuding of his kingship than any previously put forward. The spiral of decline in the king's fortunes culminated at the <b>guillotine</b> in 1793.|$|E

5|$|The event, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T, {{began with}} the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers' table with a powerbomb. The ladder was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near {{the end of the}} match, Barrett, Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring. Bryan put Rhodes in a <b>guillotine</b> choke submission hold on top of the ladder {{in the middle of the}} ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the ladder. After Bryan knocked Rhodes off the ladder, Barrett got Bryan onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off. Bryan countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett's head. Bryan then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics booklet {{features}} various images including Christian iconography, {{photographs of}} the gate at Dachau concentration camp and a plan of the gas chambers at Belsen concentration camp, a photograph of Lenin's corpse, an engraving depicting an execution by <b>guillotine</b> in Revolutionary France, {{a picture of an}} apple, a photograph of a woman with a parasitic twin, photographs of each of the Manic Street Preachers as children and a photograph of a group of British policemen in gas-masks. The booklet also contains a Buddhist saying from the Tripitaka alongside a dedication to the band's publicist, Philip Hall, who had died of cancer in 1993.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a handicap match- a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) and Shaniqua. During the match Hotty attempted a worm on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by clotheslining Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to flip over the top ring rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a Samoan drop. Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to retain the championships. Next was a Singles match, in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply the <b>guillotine</b> choke on Nidia. Noble won the match after he forced her to submit with this move.|$|E
50|$|At the {{exchange}} site, the Han and Shephards {{appeared in a}} display of unity and force, there to complete {{the exchange}} of prisoners when Haidu dispatched his rifle attack squadron on both the <b>Guillotines</b> and the Shepherds; Bai-Lan {{was killed in the}} attack. Shocked at the attack on his own teammates, Leng resisted Haidu in open defiance to the emperor's will, making him an enemy target as well; both the <b>Guillotines</b> and Shepherds survived the attack and escaped to safety. Confused as to what has happened, it was then Leng revealed his real identity to the <b>Guillotines.</b> The team was furious and wanted to know is Leng here to finish them off, however, he told his team to scatter and survive. Unfortunately, the <b>Guillotines</b> wouldn't live long.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Paine, {{considered}} too moderate {{by the powerful}} Jacobin wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped the <b>guillotine</b> by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door. When James Monroe, {{at that time the}} new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of The Age of Reason, despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence. (Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.|$|E
5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a <b>guillotine</b> overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} the main event from the SmackDown brand, a {{standard}} match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At {{the beginning of the}} match, Lesnar tried {{to walk away from the}} ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including DDT and Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a <b>guillotine</b> choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon, who had accompanied Lesnar to the ring, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.|$|E
