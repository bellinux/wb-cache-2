25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} found to be greater for adult mothers than <b>for</b> <b>adolescent</b> mothers. The level and quality of mind-mindedness, which refers to how prone the mother is to comment about the infant's mental activity during interaction, is higher in adult mothers, and has been related to greater maternal sensitivity. The comments made by adult mothers were found to be more positive than those made by adolescent mothers. Adolescent mothers used almost no positive comments, but instead negative comments. This causes the adolescent mother to be more insensitive to their baby's needs, possibly because of lack of need understanding, and therefore have lower maternal sensitivity and a less secure attachment to their infants.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{interconnections}} between Margaret Mahy's novels <b>for</b> <b>adolescents.</b> It argues that whilst interconnected networks infuse the oeuvre with appropriate material <b>for</b> <b>adolescents,</b> some textual elements exceed the limitations of all but the most sophisticated adolescents. After an introductory chapter, Chapter Two proposes a typology of structure in New Zealand novels <b>for</b> <b>adolescents.</b> It finds that Mahy's novels are archetypes of the hope-inducing structures identifiable in New Zealand novels <b>for</b> <b>adolescents</b> generally. It also finds that Mahy adapts structure to the stage of adolescence she is writing for. Chapter Three discusses the generic content and stylistics in the Mahy oeuvre. It argues that even though the content is eminently appropriate <b>for</b> <b>adolescents,</b> some elements of style are not. Chapter Four argues that knowledge of the various networks enriches response, guides interpretation and highlights Mahy's ability to pitch content at an appropriate level for adolescence, but again argues that some subtleties of style are too sophisticated <b>for</b> an <b>adolescent</b> audience. Chapter Five argues that understanding of each novel is expanded by identifying points which imply one reader at the expense of others. Hence, this thesis concludes that meaning and response multiply in Mahy's texts in proportion to (1) knowledge of Mahy's unique interconnecting textual elements and (2) the number of Mahy's implied readers inhering in the actual reader...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: AIDS is {{a leading}} cause of death among {{adolescents}} in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, legal, policy and social barriers continue to restrict their access to HIV services. In recent years, access to independent HIV testing and treatment <b>for</b> <b>adolescents</b> has gained increased attention. The 2013 WHO Guidance on HIV testing and counselling and care <b>for</b> <b>adolescents</b> living with HIV (WHO Guidance) calls for reviewing legal and regulatory frameworks to facilitate adolescents’ access to comprehensive HIV services. As of 31 March 2017, some 28 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have adopted HIV-specific legislation. But there is limited understanding of the provisions of these laws on access to HIV services <b>for</b> <b>adolescents</b> and their implication on efforts to scale up HIV prevention, testing, treatment and care among this population. Methods: A desk review of 28 HIV-specific laws in sub-Saharan Africa complemented with the review of HIV testing policies in four countries using human rights norms and key public health recommendations from the 2013 WHO Guidance. These recommendations call on countries to (i) lower the age of consent to HIV testing and counselling and allow mature adolescents who have not reached the age of consent to independently access HIV testing, (ii) ensure access to HIV counselling <b>for</b> <b>adolescents,</b> (iii) protect the confidentiality of adolescents living with HIV and (iv) facilitate access to HIV treatment <b>for</b> <b>adolescents</b> living with HIV. Results: Most HIV-specific laws fail to take into account human rights principles and public health recommendations for facilitating adolescents’ access to HIV services. None of the countries with HIV-specific laws has adopted all four recommendations for access to HIV services <b>for</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Discrepancies exist between HIV laws and national policy documents. Inadequate and conflicting provisions in HIV laws are likely to hinder access to HIV testing, counselling and treatment <b>for</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Conclusions: Efforts to end legal barriers to access to HIV services <b>for</b> <b>adolescents</b> in sub-Saharan Africa should address HIV-specific laws. Restrictive provisions in these laws should be reformed, and their protective norms effectively implemented including by translating them into national policies and ensuring sensitization and training of healthcare workers and communities. This study reiterates the need for action in all countries across Africa and beyond to review their laws and policies to create an enabling environment to accelerate access to HIV prevention, testing and treatment services <b>for</b> <b>adolescents...</b>|$|R
