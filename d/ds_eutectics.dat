40|$|Directionally {{solidified}} (DS) Al 2 O 3 /YAG eutectic composites with microstructures of three-dimensionally continuous {{networks were}} prepared using containerlessly directional solidification through an aerodynamic levitator. The morphological evolution of <b>DS</b> <b>eutectics</b> was studied {{at a large}} growth rate range. The <b>DS</b> <b>eutectics</b> present irregular "Chinese script" morphologies at growth rates of 9 mu m/s, transforming into complex regular eutectic morphologies with growth rates increasing to 68 mu m/s. At a superhigh crystal growth rate of 800 mu m/s, the <b>DS</b> <b>eutectics</b> showed regular lamellar morphologies. The indentation hardness and Young&# 39;s modulus of DS Al 2 O 3 /YAG eutectic composites at growth rates of 68 mu m/s are 22. 3 and 338 GPa, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a solidification sequence of graphite eutectic cells of A and D types, {{as well as}} globular and cementite eutectics. The morphology of eutectic cells in cast iron, the equations for their growth and the distances between the graphite precipitations in A and <b>D</b> <b>eutectic</b> types were analyzed. It is observed a critical eutectic growth rate at which one type of eutectic transformed into another. A mathematical formula was derived that combined the maximum degree of undercooling, the cooling rate of cast iron, eutectic cell count and the eutectic growth rate. One type of eutectic structure turned smoothly into the other at a particular transition rate, transformation temperature and transformational eutectic cell count. Inoculation of cast iron {{increased the number of}} eutectic cells with flake graphite and the graphite nodule count in ductile iron, while reducing the undercooling. An increase in intensity of inoculation caused a smooth transition from a cementite eutectic structure to a mixture of cementite and <b>D</b> type <b>eutectic</b> structure, then to a mixture of D and A types of eutectics up to the presence of only the A type of eutectic structure. Moreover, the mechanism of inoculation of cast iron was studied...|$|R
40|$|Dual beam FIB {{tomography}} {{was used}} to create a 3 D model of the percolating intergranular (a-Mg) -Mg 12 Ce eutectic in a Mg- 0. 51 at% Ce alloy and its tensile deformation behaviour assessed using finite elements. The eutectic itself was modelled as a fibre reinforced composite, with the elastic constants of the Mg 12 Ce intermetallic determined using a first principles approach. The 3 <b>D</b> <b>eutectic</b> network exhibited a very low structural stiffness, akin to that of bending-dominated cellular structures. Such high compliance implies that the 3 D structure may contribute to the alloy[U+ 05 F 3]s strength while sustaining limited damage by cracking, hence extending the reinforcing without compromising the ductility, up to strains in excess of 1 %. Elastic stretching of the 3 D network adds ~ 25 MPa to the overall strength of the alloy at 0. 2 % offset strain, a value comparable to the strengthening expected from a similar volume fraction of dispersed (isolated) elastic particles. Flash anneal of the alloy to break up the spatial interconnection confirmed that the strengthening introduced by the eutectic stemed from the combination of network reinforcement and dispersion hardening...|$|R

40|$|Directionally {{solidified}} eutectic rods of Al 2 O 3 -Y 3 −xErxAl 5 O 12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) composition {{have been}} grown using the laser floating zone method at processing rates of 25 mm/h and 750 mm/h. For all the samples the microstructure presents the same morphology, consisting of an interpenetrated 3 <b>D</b> <b>eutectic</b> network of both Al 2 O 3 and garnet phases, while eutectic interspacing strongly {{depends on the}} solidification rate. Optical absorption, luminescence and thermal emission have been investigated {{as a function of}} the growth rate and the erbium content. From the luminescence characterization it can be concluded that erbium ions are present in the eutectic only in the garnet phase. Near infrared thermal emission has been measured at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1500 °C. Selective emission consisting of an emission band at 1540 nm and a weaker line at 970 nm, ascribed to the radiative de-excitation of the thermally excited Er 3 + ions from the 4 I 13 / 2 and 4 I 11 / 2 multiplets to the 4 I 15 / 2 ground state respectively, has been detected in all the samples containing erbium. The influence of the erbium content, the microstructure and the temperature on the thermal emission has been investigated. The strongest selective emission has been obtained for samples with x= 3 although it does not increase proportionally to the erbium content. The thermal emission becomes more intense when the temperature is increased but the selective emission seems to saturate at temperatures higher than 1300 °C. This effect is especially noticeable for x= 3 and is attributed to thermally activated non-radiative de-excitation channels. It is suggested that these channels become effective through energy transfer among Er 3 + ions and towards killers. N...|$|R
40|$|Further {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} refractory wire reinforced nickel-base alloy composites is described. Emphasis was placed on evaluating thermal fatigue resistance {{as a function of}} matrix alloy composition, fabrication variables and reinforcement level and distribution. Tests for up to 1, 000 cycles were performed and the best system identified in this current work was 50 v/o W/NiCrAlY. Improved resistance to thermal fatigue damage would be anticipated for specimens fabricated via optimized processing schedules. Other properties investigated included 1, 093 C (2, 000 F) stress rupture strength, impact resistance and static air oxidation. A composite consisting of 30 v/o W-Hf-C alloy fibers in a NiCrAlY alloy matrix was shown to have a 100 -hour stress rupture strength at 1, 093 C (2, 000 F) of 365 MN/square meters (53 ksi) or a specific strength advantage of about 3 : 1 over typical <b>D.</b> S. <b>eutectics...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{competitive}} stochastic growth {{model is}} {{developed for the}} simulation of the 3 <b>D</b> morphology of <b>eutectic</b> silicon in Al-Si alloys, which represents the colonies of pairwise disconnected Si corals in an Al matrix. The model is based on ideas from stochastic geometry and multivariate time series analysis. The 3 D model is validated by comparing morphological characteristics computed for experimental 3 D FIB-SEM data, and for realizations drawn from the model. Good agreement between the simulation model and the experimental image data is shown confirming the efficiency of using the competitive stochastic growth model for the generation of virtual eutectic silicon morphologies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considered}} {{the use of}} urea eutectics as fast release solid dosage carrier forms for the acaricide N-methylbis (2, 4 -xylyliminomethyl) methylamine (AmitrazTM). Wettol D 2 and Arkopal N 090 were chosen as the wetting agent and dispersants respectively. Their optimum levels were determined as the surfactant concentrations that yielded a minimum in the dispersion viscosity of a concentrated (30 % m/m) Amitraz suspension. The optimum dosage levels {{were found to be}} ca. 2 % Arkopal N 090 and ca. 1 % Wettol <b>D</b> 2. <b>Eutectic</b> phase diagrams were obtained using the melting-cooling method. The components were ground together into a fine powder and heated in a glass tube immersed in a silicon oil bath. The liquid was allowed to cool down and solidify at ambient conditions. The time-dependant temperature change of the sample was tracked with a thermocouple. The data was captured in real time on a personal computer and analysed using an Excel spreadsheet programme. The melt-cast method was used to prepare eutectic mixtures. They were characterised using DSC, DTA, XRD and Light Microscopy. The XRD peaks showed the presence of the two separate crystal structures for the eutectic mixture constituents. The urea – CaBr 2. 2 H 2 O combination was initially considered as carrier for Amitraz. However, this eutectic system was found to be too hygroscopic. Small additions of PEG 6000 improved the tablet strength but decreased the dissolution rate. Urea and acetamide formed a eutectic at ± 46 oC with a composition of ca. 40 % m/m urea. Unfortunately acetamide is a suspected carcinogen. Therefore the urea - 1, 3 -dimethylurea was selected as Amitraz carrier system instead. The eutectic mixture comprised 40 % m/m urea and 60 % m/m 1, 3 -dimethylurea, which melt at ± 56 oC. The melt-press method was used to prepare Amitraz containing pellets measuring 5 mm thick and 33 mm ö and weighing about 5, 0 g. It was possible to suspend Amitraz powder in the eutectic melt mixture provided it remained in powder form. However, when liquefied (by melting), phase separation occurred. Thus the temperature of the eutectic mixture should be kept below the 80 oC melting point of Amitraz. The dissolution tests were performed in a 10 -liter Pyrex glass beaker with normal tap water (± 25 oC). The time taken for complete dissolution was measured with a stopwatch. These results were confirmed with turbidity tests. Starch-based super disintegrants were used in an attempt to enhance the dissolution rate of the pellets. Explotab® improved the dissolution rate of 30 % and 40 % m/m Amitraz formulations slightly. The best formulation obtained in this study had the following composition (in m/m) : 30 % Amitraz; 8 % CaCO 3; 1 % Wettol D 2; 2 % Arkopal N 090; 10 % Explotab® and 49 % urea – 1, 3 -dimethylurea eutectic. Such tablets disintegrated within 6, 5 minutes when suspended in water. Dissertation (MSc (Applied Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Chemical EngineeringMScunrestricte...|$|R
