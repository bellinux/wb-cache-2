40|$|The <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> {{design is}} the part of an {{electricity}} balancing market design that stimulates so-called Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) to balance their electricity production and consumption portfolio and to stick to their energy schedules by penalizing any deviations from these schedules with an imbalance price. There are numerous <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design options, each of which gives different incentives to BRPs. The aim of this work is to analyze the impact of the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design on BRP behaviour, and thereby on balancing market performance. For this purpose an agent based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> designs are analyzed. We conclude from the analysis results that it is generally a better strategy for BRPs to opt for a long position rather than a short position, and to opt for a small imbalance rather than a large one. Furthermore, different <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> designs will lead to different but still similar results, because of the balancing market equilibrium that emerges {{as a result of the}} dynamic feedback loop between BRP behaviour and balancing market outcomes. An exception is formed by two-price settlement, which leads to much higher imbalance costs. Finally, it was found that the imbalance costs for large BRPs are relatively higher, and that the choice of <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design has a greater impact on the behaviour of small BRPs.

40|$|Abstract—Imbalance {{settlement}} {{is a vital}} part of the balancing market, i. e. the institutional arrangement that establishes market-based balance management in liberalized electricity markets. We investigate the impact of the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design on the behaviour of Balance Responsible Parties and thereby on balancing market performance by means of a comparison of the German and Dutch <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> designs and balancing market results for the period May-December 2009. It is found that Germany has much higher activated balancing energy volumes, imbalance prices and actual BRP cost levels than the Netherlands, but these differences are perhaps rather caused by balancing energy market design differences and differences in intermittent generation shares than by <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design differences. The real-time publication of balance regulation in the Netherlands enables internal balancing by BRPs, which may reduce the size of system imbalances. Generally, BRPs will over-contract a little, because of the lower risk of having a negative individual imbalance and because of the evening out of imbalance costs over a longer time period.

40|$|Abstract — In liberalized power markets, balance {{responsibility}} and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> are two closely related elements {{that constitute the}} heart of a balancing market (which is actually an institutional arrangement establishing market-based balancing). This paper aims to compare balance {{responsibility and}} <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Nordic region, Germany, and the Netherlands. For this purpose, an overview is given of existing design variables and variable values in Northern Europe. Furthermore, the effects of different variables and values on four identified performance indicators have been rated with the support of a causal diagram of the balancing system.

40|$|This master thesis {{approaches}} the energy markets {{from the point}} of view of an electricity trader acting on the retail markets, in particular an electricity supplier to the end customers. The first part introduces the reader into the basic practices applied in the management process of the portfolio of end customers, which includes metering and evaluation of the real take-off, planning and prediction and, of course, final evaluation of the imbalances. Second part explains the principles of balance management in case of the entire ČEPS electrical grid, mechanics of the <b>imbalances</b> <b>settlement</b> and describes its actual setting with focus on the way it motivates the market participants for minimization of their own imbalances and therefore improvement of the overall electrical grid balance. The final part describes the basic construction of the risk surcharges, which the supplier adds to the commodity price to cover the costs caused by the existence of his end customers' imbalances. Furthermore, it is shown how the dependence on the system imbalance influences the size of the risk surcharge and the basic model is extended to include even this factor. Because the supplier does not set the surcharge at the level of individual end customer but for the entire portfolio, the functioning and power of the portfolio effect, which brings an extra savings in the <b>imbalances</b> <b>settlement</b> costs, is also explored in the final part. The possibility of dependence presence in the imbalances of individual end customers is also accounted for. For the first time in the Czech academic literature the economic problems that are faced by the electricity supplier to the end customers are examined and the analysis and solution of one important problem is provided in the full picture. However, the most important contribution of this master thesis lays in the opening of this topic to further examination on the academic ground...|$|R

40|$|The euro zone crisis {{illustrates}} the deficiencies of adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union {{characterized by a}} large heterogeneity. Exchange rate adjustments being impossible, they are very few alternative mechanisms. At {{the level of the}} whole euro zone the euro is close to its equilibrium parity. But the euro is strongly overvalued for Southern European countries, France included, and largely undervalued for Northern European countries, especially Germany. The paper gives a new evaluation of these exchange rate misalignments inside the euro zone, using a FEER approach, and examines the evolution of competitiveness. In a second step, we use a two-country SFC model of a monetary union with endogenous interest rates and eurobonds issuance. Three main results are obtained. Facing a competitiveness loss in southern countries due to exchange rates misalignments, increasing intra-European financing by banks of northern countries or other institutions could contribute to reduce the debt burden and induce a partial recovery but public debt would increase. Implementation of eurobonds as a tool to partly mutualize European sovereign debt would have a rather similar positive impact, but with a public debt limited to 60 % of GDP. Furthermore, eurobonds could also be used to finance large European projects which could impulse a stronger recovery in the entire euro zone with stabilized current account <b>imbalances.</b> However, the <b>settlement</b> of a European Debt Agency in charge of the issuance of the eurobonds would face strong political obstacles...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 30 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 11 - 14 July 2011 "Africa on the Move", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Municipalities across South Africa are challenged {{by the need to}} develop more sustainable cities and one of the means for doing this is to encourage, and plan for, the development of "compact cities" (i. e. higher density, diverse and public transport oriented and pedestrian oriented cities). All this is in the interests of achieving more efficient, more sustainable and more convenient living environments and more economically productive communities. The Ethekwini Municipality has recently explored an integrated approach to planning for the "compact city" through an urban development corridor project located in its northern metropolitan area called the Northern Urban Development Corridor (NUDC). The project was co-funded by the KwaZulu-Natal Corridor Development Programme and seeks to consolidate the infrastructure and other features of the emerging logistics platform of the City and the country which are located in this area, as well as, to redress the economic and social <b>imbalances</b> of historic <b>settlement</b> {{in this part of the}} municipal area. This paper outlines the project process that was followed, sketches the regional development context and highlights the integrated nature of the planning process. It describes the approach taken and strategies introduced by the project team to translate strategic level policy, aimed at achieving more sustainable settlement structure and form (i. e. "compact city"), into more realistic and achievable local level implementation plans. In so doing it outlines the various development and management strategies employed in the NUDC plan to achieve "compact city" objectives whilst focussing on the transportation planning techniques that were employed in the preparation of the plan.

Therefore, the flexibility needs with respect to unpredictable power generation are actually transferred to the gas market.

Cost recovery by means of non-market based settlement faces the problem of defining an appropriate unique penalty that covers the balancing costs and incentivizes shippers. Market based settlement relates the variable imbalance tariffs to the actual system imbalance and thus any factor that strongly impacts on the system state like unpredictability. However, this mechanism raises <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> tariffs for all unbalanced gas network users, even if {{the major source of}} unpredictability is the shipper with the wind power related gas demand; whereas these costs should be borne as much as possible by those effectively causing them...|$|E

Moving cloud shadows are the dominant reason for fast PV power fluctuations taking place typically within a minute between 20 to 100 % of the clear sky value roughly 100 times a day, on average.

40|$|As being {{applying}} {{to become a}} member of the European Union, Romania must, among many other things, accept the EU Electricity Directive from 1999 that stipulates how the energy shall be treated within the Union. In this Directive, it is clearly stated that all the countries within the European Union have to have a deregulated electricity market. The main objective of deregulating the wholesale electricity market around the world is to improve the efficiency of the electric power industry by encouraging competition. Or as it is written in the Directive; �To ensure the free movement of electricity while improving the security of supply and the competitiveness of the European economy. � [4] To be able to fulfil this mandatory task, the Romanian Market Operator OPCOM, has today contracted the French company AREVA T&D, who is in charge of the implementation of a new deregulated electricity market, with its main function being the Day-Ahead Market infrastructure (web-based bidding interface with market participants, matching process and settlement). This market is supposed to be taking into action during the summer of 2005. The scope of this training can be summarized in the following points, � Analyse the proposed national market rules of Romania. These rules integrate a Day- Ahead Market, a Balancing Market and Imbalance Calculation. � Analyze the formulation of the Settlement of these markets. The Settlement has the object to determine the payments for transactions made under the different markets by the market actors. � Develop a prototype / simulator of these Settlement rules that will allow verifying their consistence and that will be used in testing and demonstration environment. It is important to mention that the analyses above will be a theoretical analysis on the rules since the project is still in a developing phase and has not been tested in a real environment. The prototype / simulator will be implemented using AIMMS mathematical modelling language, where all settlement rules have to be implemented. The idea of the prototype is to simulate how the rules will behave and if the results are credible. To verify that the rules have been implemented in the right manners, the results given by AIMMS will then be compared with the results from the AREVAS�s e-terra settlement products, which is the simulator that is going to be used in the future market. Except for the settlement rules, the developed prototype will also include the matching process with its offer-acceptance algorithm to determine the cleared energy and price for each trading interval, and will serve to give feedback to the future matching process. It aims also to validate the results provided by the delivered algorithm. To be able to get a full vision, and as well to understand their implementation, the three different notions, Day-Ahead Market, Balancing Market and Imbalance Calculations studied under this project will be explained in detail, the role they play and why they are needed in a deregulated environment. Summarizing, this report will treat the following markets and areas; � Day-Ahead Market � Balancing Market � <b>Imbalance</b> Calculation � <b>Settlement</b> of these three processes Finally, some screenshot will be shown to visualise the prototype and how the results are presented to the customer together with some conclusions and the future work that can be done...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{transport}} connectivity, {{and finding}} {{innovative ways to}} pay for transport infrastructure, {{is essential to the}} future development of Australia’s cities and regions. The issues of concern that lead to this inquiry were the <b>imbalance</b> of <b>settlement</b> and its consequences; the deficit of infrastructure in our major cities and the resulting congestion; the constriction on growth that these cities produce through the lack of long term planning and timely construction of infrastructure; and the decline of the regions and lack of economic opportunity. These four core challenges defined our problem, and this Committee has searched for a suite of recommendations that will commence the process of how to address them. The enquiry heard from those with direct hands-on experience with how other countries have dealt with similar challenges and their outcomes. Australia’s settlement and the development of our cities has unfortunately been characterised by an absence of planning for both housing and essential infrastructure. The ad hoc nature, to this point, of planning infrastructure and the lack of process for the determination of land use has produced poor outcomes in terms of cost and current needs. As we continue to grow, this will have drastic consequences. One of our first conclusions is to address this need with a plan for our settlement and our cities with long term vision. Furthermore, it is essential that this planning take place through engagement across the three levels of government. The extremely high cost of land in our cities has made the cost of resuming land prohibitive, making the retrofitting of infrastructure difficult at best and impossible at worst. It has also regularly led to the decision to tunnel, but when tunnelling is too expensive nothing happens. This challenge is exacerbated by the pressure of growth that our cities shoulder. From this evidence, we have come to some inevitable conclusions as to what must occur to remedy this set of challenges. There must be put in place a plan of decentralisation to relieve our cities of the full burden of growth by providing regions with economic opportunity and prospects for settlement. This can be achieved through high speed connectivity to major urban areas. This respite will allow long term plans for the retrofitting of infrastructure attached to land use. This will allow us to rebuild our cities to world’s best practice models. In both scenarios of decentralisation or urban renewal, the combination of infrastructure and land use optimises land values—this is the essential ingredient to maximise funding through value capture. Value capture represents the most equitable method to fund infrastructure, with the added benefit of relieving demands on consolidated revenues. Long term master planning and sustainable funding through value capture can only be achieved through the alignment of the three tiers of government, land owners and developers. It is imperative that the three levels of government recognise that the opportunity to sustainably fund infrastructure depends on their ability to co-operate. They must be willing to forego individual revenues to ultimately maximise total revenues. Vision and innovation needs to replace debilitating political argument to look at these challenges that can be converted to opportunities to rebalance our settlement, rebuild our cities and undertake the facilitating infrastructure funded by the wealth it creates. The wealth that can be liberated by growth in our regions will come through ready access to the economic powerhouses of our major cities. This is the central purpose of High Speed Rail. Contrary to popular belief, High Speed Rail’s prime purpose is not an alternate mode of transport between capitals. Rather is it a tool to effect dynamic regional growth as land near regional stations will then compete with the most expensive land in the world, namely that of Sydney and Melbourne. Evidence claimed that the corridor between Melbourne and Sydney represents the greatest potential for uplift of land values anywhere in the world when connected with High Speed Rail; this can therefore provide the precondition for value capture to completely fund this major infrastructure. It is essential that the government establishes an Australian model of value capture that addresses our unique opportunities. The development of our value capture model should consider the private consortia that are committed to the development of High Speed Rail funded by profits of their privately held lands. A comprehensive Federal Value Capture Model, when partnered with private consortia highly motivated to play a critical role, should be facilitated by an appropriate government body that will determine when this national transformation can proceed. This plan of urban renewal and decentralisation, facilitated by strategic planning of infrastructure, will deliver an abundant affordable housing supply for generations to come. I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this inquiry. The Committee received a great deal of high quality evidence from people committed to the development of Australia. This report will hopefully see that commitment turned to action. I also thank my Committee colleagues and the secretariat for their hard work and enthusiasm during the inquiry and their contribution to the report. This report prescribes the solution to many of Australia’s current planning, financing and population problems. I look forward to its recommendations being accepted, and Australia returning to the fast track...|$|R

The system operator activates balancing energy to restore the balance of the system, using all balancing activation offers, including from balancing reserves. <b>Imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> implies bidirectional transactions between the system operator and power companies depending on the direction of their imbalance. A simulation of the model is performed by sequentially considering each time step and simulating actors’ decisions. The objective of this model is to understand the problems behind decisions of the actors within the short-term electrical system operation, to provide insights on how these problems can be solved through market design and to see how the decisions are linked together to shape a coherent system.

40|$|Electricity {{market design}} {{has a strong}} impact on the {{behavior}} of its participants. Some market designs induce the possibility of gaming whereas others could mitigate undesirable behaviors. Moreover, the market design is not static but it continuously evolves following the development of the system as well as the changes of the economic context. Therefore, careful analysis of a new market design proposal in term of its impacts on the economic system in general and on participants' behavior in particular is an important task. Following the direction of evaluating market designs which adapt to the new context and requirements of the European electricity sector, this thesis revisits the implementation of two balancing market designs: <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> mechanism (national level) and reservation of interconnection capacity for balancing services exchange (cross-border level). The balancing markets are of interest due to their importance to the system stability, especially in the context of massive penetration of wind energy and multinational integration as is the current development trend in European power systems. This thesis consists of two agent-based models, corresponding to studies of the two balancing market designs: one single- and one interconnected-system model. The markets simulated by these models are interrelated electricity markets between day-ahead and real time balancing markets and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement.</b> Generators are modeled as autonomous agents with sets of strategic trading behavior. Through an evaluation and learning process, agents explore the strategy to maximize their profits or minimize their real time imbalance costs. The evolution of generators' trading choices - based on their interaction with the market - provides the insight of the impact of a market design on participants' behavior. Especially, the influence on generators' market power, ignored in most academic work in this field, is the main focus of this research. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{facilitation}} of aggregator companies {{for the provision of}} flexibility services to the electricity system by using large numbers of dispersed and distributed resources of small capacities. This initiative by TenneT TSO and Utrecht University is about identifying potential barriers and proposing solutions and actions for enabling flexibility in power systems operations, from scheduling and operations, to verification and settlement, within the current systems of programme responsibility and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Netherlands. The project activities address the feasibility of new concepts for the provision of flexibility in the energy system by focusing on the market integration aspects. First, the procedures and requirements regarding the current systems of programme (balance) responsibility and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Netherlands were analysed, i. e., operational planning (nomination and scheduling of exchange, bidding for regulating, reserve and incident reserve power), operations (request for upward and/or downward power, and dispatch), and settlement (verification and financial settlement). Subsequently, different options for contributing to system balancing through the bid price ladder (active contribution), voluntary response (passive contribution), emergency power (contracted emergency capacity) and exchange of flexibility, from an aggregation of distributed resources, between market parties were analysed. Finally, regulatory, institutional and technical barriers for developing flexibility mechanisms through aggregator companies were identified, and potential solutions were explored for overcoming identified barriers and complying with technical requirements. This report provides a state-of-the-art review of the Dutch electricity market and highlights all relevant issues for advancing the market integration of aggregator companies within the Dutch system, and in line with the new European grid codes. Historical and emerging cases of demand response implementations through aggregators in Europe were reviewed and the organisational configurations of these implementations between aggregators and other actors in the electricity sector were documented. A set of characteristics is identified {{that can be used for}} describing the business model variations around the aggregator concept in Europe. The opportunities, challenges and possible solutions for enabling flexibility through aggregators are determined. The project results include a set of recommendations and actions to progress the market integration of aggregator companies within the current systems of programme responsibility and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement,</b> i. e. without major changes to the roles and responsibilities of market parties and grid operators, as well as the position of TenneT TSO regarding the integration of the aggregator role within the Dutch market model.

40|$|The subject {{addressed}} in this paper is the intra-hour scheduling of a distributed battery energy storage system (BESS). The case study is about a lithium-ion BESS integrated in a low voltage (LV) distribution system with residential customers and photovoltaic (PV) generation in the Netherlands. The BESS has been developed to enable field-testing and research of energy storage technologies in LV distribution grids, with emphasis on network support functions. As part of the research related to electricity markets, a proposal is presented about the economic optimisation of the BESS, whereas the simulation scenario addresses the passive contribution within the Dutch <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> system. Energy storage solutions can provide an attractive option for the integration of renewable energy sources {{and the establishment of}} efficient generation and delivery of electrical power. In the Netherlands, market parties have an incentive to assist the Transmission System Operator (TSO) in correcting system imbalances, largely attributable to the organisation of the system. The Dutch TSO publishes the system balance position and imbalance price close to real-time. This information can be used by market participants to voluntary contribute to the system balance by utilising non-contracted control power. This approach is called passive contribution and is believed to result in a substantial reduction in the required control energy. The <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Netherlands for passive balancing is based on the net volumes of provided control energy per settlement period. Therefore, market participants might try to minimise or maximise the net amount of energy per settlement period when the system state is explicitly short or long. Assuming certain predictions of the system state and imbalance prices, the formulation of the optimisation problem is the maximisation of a profit function, and is solved by utilising an internal model of the BESS to plan the future response of the charging and discharging process over a receding horizon. The results of the optimisation problem are charging and discharging schedules of the BESS, which can be further employed in real-time operations. The main contribution of this work is a proposal for the intra-hour scheduling of the BESS, whereas the outcome of simulations provides an economic evaluation of the specified application based on actual market data of the Dutch TSO...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the design of}} {{balancing}} markets in Europe taking into account an increasing wind power penetration. In several European countries, wind generation is so far not burdened with full balancing responsibility. However, the more wind power penetration, the less bearable for the system not to allocate balancing costs to the responsible parties. Given the variability and limited predictability of wind generation, full balancing exposure is however only feasible conditionally to well-functioning balancing markets. On that account, recommendations ensuring an optimal balancing market design are formulated and their impact on wind generation is assessed. Taking market-based or cost-reflective imbalance prices as the main objective, it is advised that: (1) the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> should not contain penalties or power exchange prices, (2) capacity payments should be allocated to imbalanced BRPs via an additive component in the imbalance price and (3) a cap should be imposed on the amount of reserves. Efficient implementation of the proposed market design may require balancing markets being integrated across borders. Electricity market design Balancing services Wind power integration...|$|E
40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} a {{day-ahead}} reserve market model that handles bids from flexible loads. This pool market model {{takes into account}} the fact that a load modulation in one direction must usually be compensated later by a modulation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction. Our analysis {{takes into account the}} gaming possibilities of producers and retailers, controlling load flexibility, in the day-ahead energy and reserve markets, and in <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement.</b> This analysis is carried out by an agent-based approach where, for every round, each actor uses linear programs to maximize its profit according to forecasts of the prices. The procurement of a reserve is assumed to be determined, for each period, as a fixed percentage of the total consumption cleared in the energy market for the same period. The results show that the provision of reserves by flexible loads has a negligible impact on the energy market prices but markedly decreases the cost of reserve procurement. However, as the rate of flexible loads increases, the system operator has to rely more and more on non-contracted reserves, which may cancel out the benefits made in the procurement of reserves.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{electricity}} sector liberalisation in Europe {{has contributed}} significantly towards {{the creation of}} competitive markets. The wholesale trading of electricity consists of a market-based segment often complemented by markets for ancillary services, including the provision of operating reserves. In this paper, the authors examine and classify operating reserves that are currently traded in the Netherlands. The principles, under which the provision of these reserves is verified by the Dutch Transmission System Operator (TSO), are illustrated, and inefficiencies of the current verification approach are identified. The verification process of the TSO takes into account specific conditions, but the criteria for assessing {{the quality of the}} service provision are not explicitly defined. Furthermore, {{only a limited number of}} cases can be assessed due to the non-automated nature of the process. Finally, a proposal is made for the development of an automated analysis tool for assessing the service provision of market parties. This proposal emphasises the need for more robust verification processes in line with the increasing integration of electricity markets in Europe.

40|$|The Greek Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE), {{in view of}} the {{initiation}} of the new wholesale electricity market on January 1 st 2009 as a Day-Ahead mandatory pool, undertook the design and implementation of a simulator for the market. The simulator consists of several interacting modules representing all key market operations and dynamics including day-ahead scheduling, natural gas system constraints, unplanned variability of loads and available capacity driven either by uncertain stochastic outcomes or deliberate participant schedule deviations, real time dispatch, and financial settlement of day ahead and real-time schedule differences. The modules are integrated into one software package. The intended use of the simulator is to elaborate on and allow RAE to investigate the impact of participant decision strategies on market outcomes. The ultimate purpose is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} Market Rules, whether existing or contemplated, in providing incentives for competitive behaviour and in discouraging gaming and market manipulation. In this paper the simulator is used to analyze market design aspects and rules concerning the co-optimization of energy and reserves in the Day-Ahead energy market and the efficiency of the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> procedure compared to real-time pricing. ...|$|E
40|$|Following several {{regional}} initiatives on the day-ahead and intra-day stage, integrating real-time balancing markets {{constitutes a}} logical {{next step in}} the process towards an Internal Electricity Market (IEM) in Europe. So far, real-time balancing market designs significantly differ between European countries and a coordinated approach for cross-border exchange of balancing services is non-existent. This paper aims to illustrate that the current lack of balancing market harmonisation – in combination with an increasingly integrated day-ahead and intra-day trade – can be profitably exploited by traders. More specifically, trading strategies taking advantage of structural design differences in the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> of two countries are identified and assessed. The paper analyses detailed data of the Belgian and French power system using statistics in order to verify the profitability of different trading strategies between both countries. Some of the identified trading strategies are found to be significantly profitable; others turn out to be loss-making. On average, France was the most attractive country for traders to be long in 2008; Belgium to be short. Profitable trading strategies can usally be carried out without any expense as cross-border capacities available at the intra-day stage are currently far from being used and no value is attributed to them. However, some profitable trading activities resulting from market design imperfections may induce economi...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{safeguard}} power system security, Transmission System Operators {{are obliged to}} continuously maintain the balance between demand and supply of electrical power. To this end, they procure so-called balancing services. This thesis studies the design and integration of markets for balancing services in Europe. Contrary to previous academic work in this field, it approaches balancing markets from a broad perspective  i. e. as comprising the procurement of balancing services and the settlement of imbalances  and {{takes into account the}} interrelationship between both components. The first part of this thesis focuses on the current  predominantly national  organisation of balancing markets in Europe. It identifies and analyses main design parameters and puts forward an appropriate market design based thereon. This design proposal ensures both market-based balancing service procurement prices and cost-reflective imbalance prices. The second part of this thesis considers the implementation of cross-border balancing markets. It first discusses different implementation proposals and qualitatively assesses the benefits and implementation costs they each may entail using a self-developed framework. It further proposes methodologies to quantitatively assess the welfare gains of implementing cross-border procurement as well as the welfare distorting impact of implementing cross-border settlement in case of structurally differing <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> methods. Both methodologies are applied to the Belgian-Dutch border. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{share of}} {{microgeneration}} (power generation {{at the level}} of households and small businesses) in the Dutch electricity system continues to grow. Over time, this development may pose a threat to the reliability and efficiency of the Dutch electricity balancing market. We investigated possible changes to the design of the Dutch balancing market that can maintain or even improve upon its current operational performance level. The first step of the research was an analysis of the existing Dutch balancing market. It consists of three main instruments: programme responsibility, the single buyer market for regulating and reserve power (RRP), and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement.</b> The balancing market currently functions satisfactorily. Subsequently, the effects of large-scale development of microgeneration in the Netherlands were evaluated with a qualitative scenario analysis. Four microgeneration scenarios and two methods for allocating the household electricity consumption and generation were considered. The four scenarios concerned large-scale penetration of PV, heat-led micro CHP, electricity-led micro CHP operated by the household consumer, and electricity-led micro CHP operated by the supply company. The last scenario was found to have the strongest positive net effect. Finally, six design options were identified for improving the Dutch balancing market design in case the share of microgeneration would increase substantially. Of these six options, adjusting the profile methodology and the regulation of smart meters are no-regret options that can be implemented immediately. The attractiveness of the other options depends upon the microgeneration portfolio that emerges, the manageability of large metering data flows, {{and the nature of the}} technical effects of large-scale microgeneration penetration.
