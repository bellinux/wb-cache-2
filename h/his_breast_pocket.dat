5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather holster of his pistol and a few pages of Bhagavad Gita in <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E

25|$|For years, Cordwainer Smith had {{a pocket}} {{notebook}} {{which he had}} filled with ideas about The Instrumentality and additional stories in the series. But while in a small boat in a lake or bay in the mid 60s, he leaned over the side, and his notebook fell out of <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket</b> into the water, where it was lost forever. Another story claims that he accidentally left the notebook in a restaurant in Rhodes in 1965. With the book gone, he felt empty of ideas, and decided {{to start a new}} series which was an allegory of Mid-Eastern politics.|$|E
500|$|Before {{leaving the}} [...] "Führerbau", Chamberlain {{requested}} a private conference with Hitler. Hitler agreed, {{and the two}} met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning. Chamberlain urged restraint {{in the implementation of}} the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed [...] "Anglo–German Agreement", which contained three paragraphs including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement [...] "symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again". According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected [...] "Ja! Ja!" [...] ("Yes! Yes!") as the Prime Minister read it. The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, [...] "Oh, don't take it so seriously. That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever." [...] Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket</b> when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, [...] "I've got it!" [...] Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters.|$|E

2500|$|Hughes {{was born}} at 1 Aspinall Street, in Mytholmroyd in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to William Henry and Edith (née Farrar) Hughes, and raised among the local farms of the Calder Valley and on the Pennine moorland. Hughes's sister Olwyn was two years older and his brother Gerald was ten years older. His mother could trace her ancestry back to William de Ferrières, who came to England with William the Conqueror in the 11th century. One of her {{ancestors}} had founded the religious community of Little Gidding in Cambridgeshire. Most of the more recent generations of his family {{had worked in the}} clothing and milling industries in the area. Hughes's father, William, a joiner, was of Irish descent and had enlisted with the Lancashire Fusiliers and fought at Ypres. He narrowly escaped being killed when a bullet lodged in a pay book in <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket.</b> He was one of just 17 men of his regiment to return from the Dardanelles Campaign (1915–16). The stories of Flanders fields filled Hughes's childhood imagination (later described in the poem [...] "Out"). [...] Hughes noted, [...] "my first six years shaped everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wyatt Earp recounted {{one event}} during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock were in Fort Griffin, Texas, {{during the winter}} of 1878, looking for {{gambling}} opportunities. Earp visited the saloon of his old friend from Cheyenne, John Shannsey, and met Holliday at the Cattle Exchange. The story of Holliday killing Bailey first appeared nine years after Holliday’s death in an 1896 interview with Wyatt Earp that was published in the San Francisco Enquirer. According to Earp, Holliday was playing poker with a well-liked local man named Ed Bailey. Holliday caught Bailey [...] "monkeying with the dead wood" [...] or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to [...] "play poker", which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday whipped out a knife from <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket</b> and [...] "caught Bailey just below the brisket" [...] or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter's Hotel.|$|E
