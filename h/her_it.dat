5|$|Marie Krøyer (1867–1940) {{came from}} an {{affluent}} German family who had moved to Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after private training she went to study in Paris where Krøyer began to court <b>her.</b> <b>It</b> is believed Marie was subsequently reluctant to paint as she looked up to Krøyer as a far more accomplished artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.|$|E
5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells <b>her</b> <b>it</b> belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
5|$|By 1830, {{because of}} {{difficult}} economic conditions in Britain that reduced {{the demand for}} fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning Georg Scharf to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, Duria Antiquior, portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to <b>her.</b> <b>It</b> became the first such scene from what later became known as deep time to be widely circulated. In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of {{a new type of}} plesiosaur, which sold for £200.|$|E

Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love <b>her,</b> <b>it</b> would make her existence unbearable.

Because she had a previous falling-out with McMahon, she opted not to stay with the company.

5|$|Matilda {{was born}} to Henry I, King of England and Duke of Normandy, and his first wife, Matilda of Scotland, {{possibly}} around 7 February 1102 at Sutton Courtenay in Oxfordshire. Henry was the youngest son of William the Conqueror, who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales. The invasion had created an Anglo-Norman elite, many with estates spread across {{both sides of the}} English Channel. These barons typically had close links to the kingdom of France, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king. Her mother Matilda was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, a member of the West Saxon royal family, and a descendant of Alfred the Great. For Henry, marrying Matilda of Scotland had given his reign increased legitimacy, and for <b>her</b> <b>it</b> had been an opportunity for high status and power in England.|$|E

5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking.
