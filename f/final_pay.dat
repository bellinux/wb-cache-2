5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the <b>final</b> <b>pay</b> {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School, at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to his extreme injuries suffered in Vietnam, {{he was in}} nearly constant pain, but he continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock's health began to deteriorate, and {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. And, just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his <b>final</b> <b>pay</b> grade had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines, because he felt as if the service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of shark fishing, which helped him overcome his depression.|$|E
25|$|Attila may {{not have}} needed any excuse to turn West, but he {{received}} one {{in the form of}} a plea for help from Honoria, the Emperor's sister, who was being forced into a marriage which she resented. Attila claimed Honoria as his wife and half of the Western Empire's territory as his dowry. Faced with refusal, he invaded Gaul in 451 with a huge army. In the bloody battle of the Catalaunian Plains the invasion was stopped by the combined forces of the barbarians within the Western empire, coordinated by Aetius and supported by what troops he could muster. The next year, Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome, but an outbreak of disease in his army, lack of supplies, reports that Eastern Roman troops were attacking his noncombatant population in Pannonia, and, possibly, Pope Leo's plea for peace induced him to halt this campaign. Attila unexpectedly died a year later (453) and his empire crumbled as his followers fought for power. The life of Severinus of Noricum gives glimpses of the general insecurity, and ultimate retreat of the Romans on the Upper Danube, in the aftermath of Attila's death. The Romans were without adequate forces; the barbarians inflicted haphazard extortion, murder, kidnap, and plunder on the Romans and on each other. So long as the Roman dominion lasted, soldiers were maintained in many towns at the public expense to guard the boundary wall. When this custom ceased, the squadrons of soldiers and the boundary wall were blotted out together. The troop at Batavis, however, held out. Some soldiers of this troop had gone to Italy to fetch the <b>final</b> <b>pay</b> to their comrades, and no one knew that the barbarians had slain them on the way.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{while the}} normal {{retirement}} age for Social Security, or Old Age Survivors Insurance (OASI), historically has been age 65 to receive unreduced benefits, it is gradually increasing to age 67. For those turning 65 in 2008, full benefits will be payable beginning at age 66. Public servants {{are often not}} covered by Social Security but have their own pension programs. Police officers in the United States are typically allowed to retire at half pay after only 20 years of service or three-quarter pay after 30 years, allowing people to retire in their early forties or fifties. Military members of the US Armed Forces may elect to retire after 20 years of active duty. Their retirement pay (not a pension since they can be involuntarily called back to active duty at any time) is calculated on total number of years on active duty, their <b>final</b> <b>pay</b> grade and the retirement system in place when they entered service. Allowances such as housing and subsistence {{are not used to}} calculate a member's retired pay. Members awarded the Medal of Honor qualify for a separate stipend, regardless of the years of service. Military members in the reserve and US National Guard have their retirement based on a point system.|$|E
2500|$|Another major {{personnel}} controversy {{erupted in}} December 2009 when the Washington Times reported that Deputy Chief Kenneth B. Ellerbe left {{the department to}} take a job in Sarasota County, Florida, but had secured a deal to receive a full pension. The pension agreement was apparently approved by Fire Captain Brian Lee, and Fire Chief Rubin did not learn about it until it was reported in the media. Ellerbe left DCFEMS in July 2009, although he would not be eligible to receive full pension benefits until he turned 50 years old on April 10, 2010. Under the terms of the deal, DCFEMS places Ellerbe on [...] "leave without pay", which kept him technically employed by the District of Columbia. Ellerbe agreed to resign from DCFEMS on April 11. Because Ellerbe remained on the force until he turned 50, he was then able to collect 80 percent of his <b>final</b> <b>pay</b> {{for the next five years}} (an amount equal to about $600,000). When he turned 55, he qualified for a full pension benefit (100 percent of his final salary). The agreement stated that the purpose of allowing Ellerbe to go to Florida was to give him the opportunity to [...] "acquire experience as a fire chief in a municipal fire department and thereby be better able to provide the experience of leadership in an executive manager's role". Ellerbe said it was mere coincidence that he agreed to resign on April 11, and the deal was not designed to keep him on the city payroll until he turned 50.|$|E

500|$|Due to UEFA {{regulations}} regarding {{standing at}} football matches, the Camp Nou's terraced sections were {{closed for the}} 1999 Champions League Final, reducing the capacity to approximately 92,000.

The remaining third was divided between fans of FC Barcelona (around 7,500 tickets), UEFA, and competition sponsors. After an initial announcement that the clubs would only receive 25,000 tickets each, the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA) called that figure [...] "ridiculous", claiming it would push black market prices to [...] "astronomical levels"; the group's spokesman, Lee Hodgkiss, suggested a figure closer to 50,000 would be more appropriate, given the stadium's usual capacity of around 115,000.
