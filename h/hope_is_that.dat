25|$|Open source {{provides}} flexibility {{not available}} in closed products. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> individuals make improvements to an open tool and will offer those improvements to the original developer and community at large. The give-and-take of the gift economy benefits the entire community.|$|E
25|$|Both insertions and deletions {{are fast}} {{as long as}} space is {{available}} on a block. If an insertion won't fit on the block, then some free space on some nearby block must be found and the auxiliary indices adjusted. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> enough space is available nearby, such {{that a lot of}} blocks {{do not need to be}} reorganized. Alternatively, some out-of-sequence disk blocks may be used.|$|E

25|$|The {{aim of the}} RLC was {{initially}} to provide regular fixtures for new clubs based outside the 'heartland' of rugby league, although as the playing standards increased, it also accepted teams from the 'heartlands'. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> {{at least some of}} these clubs, would eventually progress to become semi-professional clubs that could one day join the 'traditional' clubs in Championship 1; to date, London Skolars have done so with both Hemel Stags and Oxford Rugby League joining in 2013, Coventry Bears in 2014 and Nottingham Outlaws will join Championship 1 in the 2016 season.|$|E
25|$|Starting in January 2016, Austrian {{police forces}} will be trialling the use of body cameras, which {{will be used to}} film their {{interactions}} with civilians. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this will make the prosecution of any officers who are excessively violent or forceful a lot easier as there will be solid evidence, and also that it will deter officers from behaving violently in the first place, as they will know they are being monitored. It is unsure how long the trial will last, however as of July 2016 it is still ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of the new scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) fingerprinting technique, which makes no physical contact with the fingerprint and {{does not require the}} use of developers, has the potential to allow fingerprints to be recorded whilst still leaving intact material that could subsequently be subjected to DNA analysis. A forensically usable prototype was under development at Swansea University during 2010, in research that was generating significant interest from the British Home Office and a number of different police forces across the UK, as well as internationally. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this instrument could eventually be manufactured in sufficiently large numbers to be widely used by forensic teams worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Green {{biotechnology}} is biotechnology {{applied to}} agricultural processes. An {{example would be}} the selection and domestication of plants via micropropagation. Another example is the designing of transgenic plants to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. One <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> green biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional industrial agriculture. An {{example of this is}} the engineering of a plant to express a pesticide, thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides. An example of this would be Bt corn. Whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally friendly is a topic of considerable debate.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky {{explains}} {{his decision to}} focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway {{the population of the}} U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.|$|E
50|$|South African rugby league as it seemed, had a future. Part of this future, it <b>was</b> <b>hoped,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the nine}} teams {{located in the}} Johannesburg area would launch the 1963 season.|$|R

50|$|The idea went dormant again, {{but what}} gave Tucaković <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{whenever}} {{he mentioned the}} idea to film industry people at symposiums or film festivals it would always find a very receptive audience.|$|R
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Annette Sefton-Wilcox introduces Rosie Seymour to one of several flats she is minding for a few days. This flat belongs to a Joanna Rupelford, who never seems to be at home (to the point where the labels are still on the pans). In the conversation, it is disclosed that Rosie is an actress with little success behind her (her only role so far being a rabbit in a miserable touring children's production), and no boyfriend, and that she is openly desperate for both. Her one <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she is down to the last two for a big role as Jane Eyre, but just after Annette leaves, Rosie receives a call from her agent tell her the part went to the other girl.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{constitutional}} law scholar Erwin Chemerinsky {{participated in the}} same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and—from a First Amendment perspective—highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, {{that it could be}} seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that Morse v. Frederick is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.|$|E
60|$|The one <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Jake {{would succeed}} in finding his way back, for the thought <b>that</b> he might <b>be</b> {{captured}} was terrible, and they sat {{near the entrance}} listening intently to every sound.|$|R
50|$|Aston, the Royalist commander, {{refused to}} surrender. The {{garrison}} of Drogheda was critically short of gunpowder and ammunition. Their <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Ormonde, nearby at Tercroghan with some 4,000 Royalist troops, {{would come to}} their relief.|$|R
6000|$|His one <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Jane <b>was</b> still {{safe and}} with Rokoff. [...] If {{this was the}} case, it would be but a matter of {{an hour or more}} before {{he should be able to}} wrest her from the Russian.|$|R
25|$|The studio's {{official}} {{press release}} was presented on May 20, 2010 and confirmed that Smallville would be remaining at its Friday, 8 p.m. time slot. It {{also revealed that}} Smallville would be reteaming with Supernatural, a series that was originally slotted just behind Smallville on Thursday nights for four seasons. The press release did not list Mack {{in the list of}} stars. On May 21, 2010, Mack released a statement confirming that she would not return as a series regular, but would return for multiple episodes to wind up her storyline. However, at the 2010 Comic-Con, Peterson stated that, despite her long absence and limited episode count, Mack would remain a series regular. Mack stated that her <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the character of Chloe will hold on to her integrity as the writers close out her storyline. For the actress, watching as her character matured over the years—from sacrificing the things she wanted for the sake of her friends, to finally reaching a point where she can strive to satisfy her own needs and wants—has been important for her. Tom Welling, who served as a part-time producer for season nine, was announced as a full executive producer for season ten. Welling was also set to direct two episodes during the season, and Justin Hartley was contracted to direct another episode.|$|E
25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because {{they are likely to be}} in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E
500|$|The narrator {{comes to}} an {{understanding}} of nature while isolated with his thoughts. Nature becomes a comfort, however, the poet remembers the loneliness of childhood when he felt isolated from nature and other people, as if living in a world of strangers. His <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his own child, David Hartley, will experience an easier and more [...] harmonious life.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{slave owners}} adopted {{voluntary}} rules {{relating to the}} treatment of slaves; the <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> publishing these rules, they would remove the slave's fear of arbitrary and excessive punishments.

500|$|Along {{with this}} research, Fischbach {{and his colleagues}} at the Simons Foundation are {{studying}} diseases that have autistic features, such as Rett syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. [...] The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a better understanding of the central role of the synapse in autistic symptoms can be discovered as well as which specific regions of the brain are responsible for these behaviors. [...] Within the next decade, the ultimate goal of this research is to determine the precise neural circuitry involved in autism and how it translates to the autistic behaviors displayed.|$|E
500|$|Both episodes aired {{before the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, {{and were the}} last episodes to air before it. In November2007, Variety {{reported}} that MacFarlane had joined the strike and refused to complete more Family Guy episodes. A spokesperson for Fox said: [...] "Our <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he returns to work and completes his non-writing obligations on those episodes". Fox aired two new episodes during November2007. The following episode, [...] "Padre de Familia", {{was the first of}} these two episodes to air. The strike ended on February12,2008 and the series resumed airing regularly.|$|E
500|$|The {{non-profit}} Manzanar Committee, formerly led by Sue Kunitomi Embrey, {{has sponsored}} the Pilgrimage since 1969. The event is held annually {{on the last}} Saturday of April [...] with hundreds of visitors {{of all ages and}} backgrounds, including some former incarcerees, gathering at the Manzanar cemetery to remember the incarceration. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> participants can learn about it and help ensure that what is generally accepted to be a tragic chapter in American History is neither forgotten nor repeated. The program traditionally consists of speakers, cultural performances, an interfaith service to memorialize those who died at Manzanar, and Ondo dancing.|$|E
50|$|The Kinded {{involved}} {{created and}} distributed uniquely coded cards <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{to serve as}} 'licenses' to do kind acts. The <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this would start a chain of kind acts <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> publicly tracked by their unique code on an interactive online platform.|$|R
50|$|Sony {{could not}} {{duplicate}} the functionality of VHS-C camcorders, {{and seeing the}} rapid loss of market share, eventually introduced the Video8 format. Their <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Video8 could replace both Beta and VHS for all uses. For more information, see the article on camcorders.|$|R
5000|$|Former Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said of Bass's injury [...] "The impact {{his loss}} had {{on our program}} can't be {{measured}} because he could do so many things...Medically, what we're all <b>hoping</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he can lead a normal life, go play pickup basketball." ...|$|R
