25|$|When completed, the {{parabolic}} {{roof was}} clad in flat aluminium sheeting, folded over angled timber fillets which ran horizontally {{along the length}} of the roof. Panels of translucent corrugated fibreglass sheeting ran along the apex and in six vertical strips at the southern end. By 1968, problems with leaking led to the roof sheeting being replaced with corrugated aluminium. Repairs and changes have been made since and all of the original translucent sections of the parabolic roof have been replaced with opaque sheeting. Thus, internal features such as the side-lighting of the sanctuary wall and <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> along the apex of the parabolic ceiling have been lost.|$|E
2500|$|In Office at Night (1940), another [...] "couple" [...] painting, Hopper {{creates a}} {{psychological}} puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing {{on his work}} papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he {{is working hard to}} ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources, from a desk lamp, through a window and <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> from above. Hopper went on to make several [...] "office" [...] pictures, but none with a sensual undercurrent.|$|E

60|$|The strict {{dependence}} of writing, indeed, upon the material employed is nowhere better shown {{than in the}} case of the Assyrian cuneiform inscriptions. The ordinary substitute for cream-laid note in the Euphrates valley in its palmy days was a clay or terra-cotta tablet, on which the words to be recorded--usually a deed of sale or something of the sort--were impressed while it was wet and then baked in, solid. And the method of impressing them was very simple; the workman merely pressed the end of his graver or wedge into the moist clay, thus giving rise to triangular marks which were arranged in the shapes of various letters. When alabaster, or any other hard material, was substituted for clay, the sculptor imitated these natural dabs or triangular imprints; and that was the origin of those mysterious and very learned-looking cuneiforms. This, I admit, is a palpable digression; but inasmuch as it throws an <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> on the simple reasons which sometimes bring about great results, I hold it not wholly alien to the present serious philosophical inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|As {{changes in}} {{domestic}} breeds which take place so slowly {{are not to}} be noticed at any one period, whether due to the selection of individual variations or of differences resulting from crosses, are most important in understanding the origin of our domestic productions, and likewise in throwing <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> on the changes effected under nature, I will give in detail such cases as I have been able to collect. Lawrence (1/82. 'The Horse in all his Varieties, etc.' 1829 pages 230, 234.), who paid particular attention to the history of the foxhound, writing in 1829, says that between eighty and ninety years before [...] "an entirely new foxhound was raised through the breeder's art," [...] the ears of the old southern hound being reduced, the bone and bulk lightened, the waist increased in length, and the stature somewhat added to. It is believed that this was effected by a cross with a greyhound. With respect to this latter dog, Youatt (1/83. 'The Dog' 1845 pages 31, 35; with respect to King Charles' spaniel page 45; for the setter page 90.), who is generally cautious in his statements, says that the greyhound within the last fifty years, that is before the commencement of the present century, [...] "assumed a somewhat different character from that which he once possessed. He is now distinguished by a beautiful symmetry of form, of which he could not once boast, and he has even superior speed to that which he formerly exhibited. He is no longer used to struggle with deer, but contends with his fellows over a shorter and speedier course." [...] An able writer (1/84. In the 'Encyclop. of Rural Sports' page 557.) believes that our English greyhounds are the descendants, PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVED, of the large rough greyhounds which existed in Scotland so early as the third century. A cross at some former period with the Italian greyhound has been suspected; but this seems hardly probable, considering the feebleness of this latter breed. Lord Orford, as is well-known, crossed his famous greyhounds, which failed in courage, with a bulldog--this breed being chosen from being erroneously supposed to be deficient in the power of scent; [...] "after the sixth or seventh generation," [...] says Youatt, [...] "there was not a vestige left of the form of the bulldog, but his courage and indomitable perseverance remained." ...|$|E

40|$|Simulating <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> effects {{has been}} a {{challenging}} topic in many real-time rendering and design applications. This paper presents a novel method, based on precomputed radiance transfer, for rendering physically based, multi-bounce <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> in real-time. Our key idea is to represent both the direct lighting and precomputed diffuse indirect transfer using a spectral mesh basis set derived from an arbitrary scene model [KG 00]. The complete spectral basis set can approximate a spatially varying function to any degree of accuracy. For <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting,</b> we show that only 60 ∼ 100 sparse basis coefficients suffice to achieve high accuracy, due to the low-frequency nature of indirect illumination. This reduces the run-time computation of per-vertex diffuse <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> to simple inner products of two sparse vectors: one representing the dynamic direct lighting, and the other representing the precomputed direct to indirect transfer. The key advantage using {{this approach is that}} we are not restricted to parameterized models or any particular mesh topology. Our method simulates multiple diffuse interreflections {{while at the same time}} permitting dynamically changing surface albedos. In addition, we approximate the final bounce of glossy interreflection using a standard BRDF SH projection. Finally, we demonstrate high-quality <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> effects rendered at 15 ∼ 30 fps with dynamically changing lighting and materials.

It is especially wanted in video games, on fully dynamic scenes, where it greatly enhances the perceived realism. In this paper, we present a screen-space hierarchical algorithm for computing <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> for animated scenes. Our algorithm is fully compatible with deferred-shading rendering engines for video games, and computes <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> in less than 10 ms, leaving enough computation time for other gaming tasks, such as interaction and animation. Our algorithm works in two steps: first, we compute indirect illumination in screen-space at all possible scales, then we filter and combine together the illumination received at the different scales. We describe both the algorithm and its practical integration inside a commercial video-game rendering engine...|$|R
