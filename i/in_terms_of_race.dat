25|$|The SDS June 1969 Convention is best {{described}} as a clash between three major factions of the organization: the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM), the Worker Student Alliance (WSA) {{also known as the}} Progressive Labor Party (PL), and the Revolutionary Youth Movement II (RYM II). The three factions could be described with PL on one end, RYM on the other, and RYM II somewhere in between the two. PL (aka WSA) took a very strictly traditional Maoist-Marxist line. Lead by communist Jeff Gordon, PL saw themselves separate of the counterculture, and did not “smoke dope or wear their hair long”. This was something that RYM and RYM II disliked about the Maoist faction; the fact that SDS was of and for the counterculture was one of its most distinguishing traits, thus the two other factions felt that PL was disrespecting this feature of the college-based organization. WSA “saw race as divisive and promoted a staid and conservative view of the working class”. They did not back African-American nationalism as the RYMs did, and described their purpose as class struggle, appealing to the working class proletariat of America. PL’s platform centered around “the old left notion that black nationalism was a diversion from the all-important class struggle”. This was a stark contrast from RYM, who saw America’s faults <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> and imperialism. PL vied for control of SDS in order to expel these other schools of thought and bring in the working-classes of America. However, their conflict with RYM and RYM II at the convention was both poorly timed and not enough to size full control.|$|E
