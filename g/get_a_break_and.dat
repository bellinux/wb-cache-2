5000|$|The fourth track, [...] "Lenny Bruce", {{is about}} the subversive Jewish comedian of that name. An {{influential}} entertainer whose use of provocative language led to a famous obscenity trial, Bruce died of a drug overdose in 1966. Despite the secular tone of the lyrics, the music is [...] "anchored in the resolute cadences of piano gospel," [...] according to music critic Tim Riley. Often regarded as a bizarre tribute, the song portrays Bruce {{as some kind of}} martyr, even though its characterizations of Bruce have been described as peculiar and almost non-descript. When Dave Herman asked why, after so many years, Dylan chose to write a song about Lenny Bruce (July 2, 1981 interview), he answered, [...] "You know, I have no idea! I wrote that song in five minutes! I found it was a little strange after he died, that people made such a hero out of him. When he was alive he couldn't even <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> <b>And</b> certainly now, comedy is rank, dirty and vulgar and very unfunny and stupid, wishy-washy and the whole thing. ...

5000|$|Liston {{learned to}} {{box in the}} Missouri State Penitentiary while serving time for armed robbery. Later, he was re-incarcerated for assaulting a police officer. For much of his career, his {{contract}} was majority owned by Frankie Carbo, a one-time mob hit man and {{senior member of the}} Lucchese crime family, who ran boxing interests for the Mafia. The mob was deeply engaged in boxing at every level at the time, and Liston was never able to escape being labeled as the personification of everything that was unseemly and criminal in the sport, despite the fact that his criminality had been in the past. He distrusted boxing writers, and they paid him back, often depicting him as little more than an ignorant thug and a bully. He was typically described in thinly veiled racist terms—a [...] "gorilla" [...] and [...] "hands like big bananas". Author James Baldwin understood Liston perhaps better than anyone in the press and sympathized with him and liked him, unlike boxing writers. He said, [...] "Liston was the big Negro in every white man's hallway." [...] He was a man who, according to Ali biographer David Remnick, [...] "had never <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> was never going to give one".|$|R

5000|$|With {{regard to}} Mandy, Stapleton {{believed}} that, in 1993, she was her [...] "own worst enemy" [...] {{and that some}} of her misfortune was associated to her upsetting other characters: [...] "Mandy is constantly rubbing people up the wrong way, and upsetting them. Of course she has had a hard life, but she doesnt do herself any favours either. I would like to see her <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> a chance to finally make something of herself." [...] In 1993, the character was paired romantically on-screen with Aidan Brosnan, played by Sean Maguire. Aidan and Mandys romance was dubbed by EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake as one of 1993s [...] "major storylines", which ran throughout the year. Depicted as shy, naïve and impressionable, Aidan was quickly led astray by Mandy. In the storyline, Mandy introduced Aidan to alcohol and drugs and a swift decline for the couple culminated in them becoming homeless and sleeping on the streets or in abandoned squats. Aidan slipped into a depression, culminating in a suicide attempt, when in the Christmas Day 1993 episodes, he decided to jump off the top of a tower block. The producers original plan had been for Aidan to succeed in his suicide bid; however, in the book EastEnders: The First Ten Years, author Colin Brake has revealed that [...] "the powers-that-be" [...] at the BBC intervened in the storyline. They felt that a suicide on Christmas Day would be [...] "too depressing even for EastEnders", so they ordered for the scripts to be revised. In the revised version, Mandy arrived just in time to stop Aidan jumping to his death, her love for him convincing him not to end his life. 23 million viewers tuned in on Christmas Day 1993 to witness Aidans suicide attempt; it was the highest rated television programme of the day, trumping its biggest rival Coronation Street by 3 million viewers.|$|E
40|$|Rotational grazing in horse {{pastures}} is {{the main}} {{way to ensure that}} the fields of pastures stay fresh and green. Horses require maximum amounts of grazing each day to get the nutrients they need to stay healthy. The soil is ultimately {{one of the most important}} factors in growing good grasses. Continuous grazing on pastures can cause the grasses to die out and not grow back. Horses staying in one pasture all the time will cause degradation of the soils. These soils tend to have higher pH because of the loss of nutrients from the grasses (Waite, 2004). Continuous grazing also causes the soil to become compacted down and to stunt plant growth because of the major compaction of the soil. When horses are rotated about different fields, the soils <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> have time to grow and breathe with the changing pastures (Waite, 2004). Horses also enjoy the fresh long grasses that appear after that certain field has caught a break. This research project plans to focus on the effects continuous grazing on soils in the Western and Central parts of Kentucky. In this project, soil samples will be taken from two different locations, a farm located in Murray Kentucky and then a farm located in Lexington Kentucky. These two locations will give good indications of how continuous grazing effects the different soil types in Kentucky. The samples taken from the two locations can help give indication of what happens to soil as horses stay on the same pasture for numerous amounts of time. The information from this research will be beneficial for helping horse owners understand the importance of switching pastures every couple weeks. The data from this study will contribute to the study of soil science and helping the horse industry understand more about the benefits of good soil management...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method of predicting prosodic phrase breaks in Sinhala language {{in order to}} improve the quality of the existing TTS Sinhala voices. In a Text To Speech (TTS) system, quality of the synthetic voice is mainly dependent on, how well its prosodic model is implemented. The prosodic model adjusts the phrasing and the pitch of the voice while applying suitable durations and tones for words and diphones. Out of these, phrasing and pitch of the voice carries much importance since appropriate phrase breaking helps to clearly understand the synthesis voice. In a real world scenario, when we speak a sentence, we automatically divide it to small segments and apply pauses at those breaks. Also the pitch of the voice <b>gets</b> lowered near <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> increased in the other segments automatically. But in a TTS system, we do not have that advantage and therefore need to be précised with the phrase breaks. Otherwise it will create wrong meanings as well as producing unnatural speech...|$|R

Debutant screenwriter Ranjan Ghosh has worked the subject with passion, and after a particularly depressing break-up for the younger Mrinalini, Chintan Nair (played by Kaushik Sen, known in Bengali screen and stage) declares, [...] "A love that frees you is a love that has no expectations." [...] Flashbacks tend to confuse a bit at times since Mrinalini is all over (old and young), and with the grand parade of exquisite saris on display one is overwhelmed by the array of characters who walk into frames effortlessly.

NursingBibliography: leaves 156 - 177 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} factors associated with the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding among a select group of Newfoundland mothers. This was accomplished through a secondary analysis of a comprehensive study of infant feeding practices in Newfoundland and Labrador during the first six months of life. [...] A subset of the randomly selected sample from the primary investigation was chosen. It consisted of 265 Newfoundland mothers who were exclusively breastfeeding their infants at hospital discharge. In the primary investigation, data were collected prospectively during four structured interviews. Two questionnaires were used for data collection. [...] Descriptive statistics and the chi-square test were used to analyze the data. Results showed that at one month 36. 2 % of the mothers had discontinued exclusive breastfeeding. This percentage increased to 61. 1 % at four months, and to 72. 4 % at six months. The first week postpartum was the most common time reported for the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding, with 13. 2 % of mothers discontinuing at this time. At one month most mothers ceased exclusive breastfeeding because of difficulties with this method of feeding, because the baby was not satisfied with breastmilk, or to supplement <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> At four <b>and</b> six months the majority of mothers discontinued exclusive breastfeeding because they were returning to work, school, or university. Significant relationships between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and selected factors were identified when four different subgroups of women were compared. These were women who discontinued exclusive breastfeeding in the early, intermediate, and later postpartum period, and those who continued exclusive breastfeeding beyond six months. Significant factors included maternal age, education, living status, income, infant birth weight, introducing the infant to solid food at four and six months, previous experience with breastfeeding, and having had a prenatal discussion about infant feeding methods with one's mother, sister, or the public health nurse. [...] Findings revealed that most Newfoundland mothers discontinued exclusive breastfeeding long before the recommended time, and that the first month postpartum was especially difficult for mothers. Results can be used to target areas for future nursing intervention...|$|R
