25|$|The General Electric Company began {{developing}} three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse {{signed a}} cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 <b>horsepower</b> (<b>HP)</b> induction motor currently {{has the same}} mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897.|$|E
25|$|In {{pipeline}} compressors {{of natural}} gas to move the gas from the production site to the consumer. Centrifugal compressors for such uses may be one- or multi-stage and driven by large gas turbines. Standards set by the industry (ANSI/API, ASME) result in large thick casings to maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed an API-style. The power needed to drive these compressors is most often in the thousands of <b>horsepower</b> (<b>HP).</b> Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance {{of natural gas}} pipeline centrifugal compressors.|$|E
25|$|Three initial design {{concepts}} were {{developed for the}} Model 45, including one with the Bonanza's signature V-tail, but the final design that emerged in 1948 incorporated conventional tail control surfaces {{for the benefit of}} the more conservative military (featuring a relatively large unswept vertical fin that would find its way onto the Travel Air twin-engine civil aircraft almost ten years later). The Bonanza's fuselage with four-passenger cabin was replaced with a narrower fuselage incorporating a two-seater tandem cockpit and bubble canopy, which provided greater visibility for the trainee pilot and flight instructor. Structurally, the Model 45 was much stronger than the Bonanza, being designed for +10g and −4.5g, while the Continental E-185 engine of 185 <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp)</b> at takeoff (less than a third of the power of the T-6's engine) was the same as that fitted to contemporary Bonanzas.|$|E
50|$|Mona had {{a nominal}} <b>horsepower</b> of 160 <b>HP,</b> and this {{gave her a}} speed of 13 knots.|$|R
5000|$|The Karma's two [...] motors produce 1300 Nm of torque, {{giving the}} Karma a quoted <b>horsepower</b> of 403 <b>HP.</b> The Karma {{features}} a 125 mi/h km/h top speed and {{is capable of}} reaching 60 mph from a standstill in 6.3 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Insiders {{initially}} {{reported that}} the engine would come in four basic sizes (3.0L, 3.3L, 3.6L, and 4.0L), each offered {{in various states of}} tune. The 4.0L has been dropped from the list and a 3.2L added, while Fiat's investor website, as of December 2011, specifies the 3.0L with Fiat's MultiAir technology. The 3.6L engine itself has different horsepower ratings in different vehicles, and has higher <b>horsepower</b> (305 <b>hp)</b> and torque (268 lb-ft) as used in the Dodge Challenger ...|$|R
25|$|Like its predecessor, the BMD-4 {{is capable}} of {{parachuting}} from aircraft with the entire crew and passengers inside the vehicle which allows target engagement after landing to be instant. An Il-76 is able to transport two of these vehicles {{at a time in}} comparison to three BMD-1s and BMD-2s. Its engine is the 2V-06-2; the same as the BMD-3. This engine develops a total power of 450 <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp).</b> The BMD-4 is also fully amphibious with two water jets mounted {{on each side of the}} back of the hull and can swim at speeds of up to 10km/h in a Beaufort scale of 2. With a high power-to-weight ratio, the BMD-4 features superior acceleration in comparison to other infantry fighting vehicles. The maximum speed on a highway is 70km/h and the BMD-4 can maneuver on a 60° gradient and a 35° side slope. The BMD-4 can cross 1.8 m trenches and climb 0.8 m tall obstacles. This vehicle's suspension is hydropneumatic and giving an adjustable ground clearing of 130–530mm with the normal road clearance being 450mm. The clearance is changed by the driver and can be changed within 10 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The Junkers L2 (the L {{signifying}} a four-stroke {{petrol engine}} {{rather than a}} two-stroke diesel) had some features in common with their first petrol engine, the L1, both six-cylinder upright direct drive inline engines with four overhead camshaft driven valves per cylinder, but was water-cooled rather than air-cooled and had a much greater swept volume. [...] It initially developed a cruise power of 195 <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp)</b> (145kW) at 1,550rpm but was developed to 220hp (164kW).|$|E
2500|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{industrial use}} of steam power {{was due to}} Thomas Savery in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp)</b> and was used in numerous water works {{and in a few}} mines (hence its [...] "brand name", The Miner's Friend). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes. [...] Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was in fact}} {{replaced}} for 1914 by the 6.1-litre 30.6 tax <b>horsepower</b> Austin 30 <b>hp.</b> {{though the}} catalogue showed a new 20-hp described by the same pundits with the note [...] "20 hp is a very fair estimate of its ranking".|$|R
50|$|EMD E-units were {{a line of}} {{passenger}} train diesel locomotives built by the General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) and its predecessor the Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC). Final assembly for all E-units was in La Grange, Illinois. Production ran from May 1937, to December, 1963. The name E-units refers to the model numbers given to each successive type, which all began with E. The E originally stood for eighteen hundred <b>horsepower</b> (1800 <b>hp</b> = 1300 kW), {{the power of the}} earliest model, but the letter was kept for later models of higher power.|$|R
50|$|N&W 2156 is {{also one}} of the Y6a's that {{received}} a new firebox with an extended combustion chamber of the type used on the Y6b class, which increased drawbar <b>horsepower</b> from 4400 <b>hp</b> (3.3 MW) at 20 mph (32 km/h) to 5600 hp (4.2 MW) at 25 mph (40 km/h).|$|R
2500|$|In the U.S., the RTX trim {{was removed}} from the lineup and the RTS trim gained a power-adjustable lumbar, an {{auxiliary}} 3.5mm TRS stereo input jack, and a seven-pin trailer wiring harness. [...] The U.S. RTL trim gained the same seven-pin harness and received new [...] alloy rims and a 115V/100W AC inverter; if equipped with navigation, the U.S. RTL also received a rearview camera, Class 2 Bluetooth with Honda's HandsFreeLink system and a multi-data/multilingual information display. [...] For Canadians, a new lineup of trim levels were introduced that more closely resembled the U.S. and the top trim received XM Satellite Radio for the first time. [...] A new V6 engine (the J35Z5) was introduced that produced up to [...] more torque at lower revolutions per minute (rpm) than its predecessor with a slight <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp)</b> increase of [...] at the top of its rpm band. [...] The transmission was also revised with the greatest differences found in third and fourth gears providing approximately 5% lower ratios. [...] Additionally, Honda swapped four of its exterior color options in the U.S. and three in Canada for slightly different shades of the same base colors, leaving Canadians with two different black paints to choose from, while adding a light brown color, called [...] "Mocha Metallic," [...] to the exterior color palette for the U.S. and Canadian markets.|$|E

50|$|The various {{units used}} to {{indicate}} this definition (PS, cv, hk, pk, ks and ch) all translate to horse power in English, {{so it is}} common to see these values referred to as <b>horsepower</b> or <b>hp</b> in the press releases or media coverage of the German, French, Italian, and Japanese automobile companies. British manufacturers often intermix metric horsepower and mechanical horsepower depending on the origin of the engine in question. Sometimes the metric horsepower rating of an engine is conservative enough so that the same figure can be used for both 80/1269/EEC with metric hp and SAE J1349 with imperial hp.|$|R
5000|$|Italian for [...] "four-door," [...] the Maserati Quattroporte is a {{sporting}} luxury saloon. The sixth generation Maserati Quattroporte {{was introduced in}} 2013. The Quattroporte is currently available in S Q4, GTS and Diesel trim. The S Q4 has an advanced four wheel drive system, and a 404-horsepower twin-turbo V6. The GTS is rear wheel drive, and has a 523-horsepower V8. A Quattroporte Diesel model is offered on selected markets, making 275 <b>horsepower</b> (250 <b>hp</b> in Italy) and 442 ft-lbs of torque. The sixth-generation Quattroporte has grown in size {{in order to better}} compete with the roomier luxury saloons like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.|$|R
5000|$|The massive 40-120 (and later 140) HP engines {{were brought}} out in 1908 {{and their two}} stories height allowed the driver (engineer) {{to see over the}} cross-compound engine. They built engines in nominal <b>horsepower</b> sizes: 13 <b>hp,</b> 16 hp, 20 hp, 25 hp, 32 hp and 40 hp. The [...] "140" [...] {{referenced}} above was the [...] "brake horsepower." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first flight}} {{took place at}} 1907-05-07. The power plant was a 24-25 <b>horsepower</b> (<b>HP)</b> [...] Gaggenau {{automobile}} engine and allowed {{a top speed of}} 29 km/h.|$|E
50|$|<b>Horsepower</b> (<b>hp)</b> is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} of power (the rate at which work is done). There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is approximately 746 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.|$|E
50|$|The General Electric Company began {{developing}} three-phase induction motors in 1891.

50|$|The engine {{made its}} {{official}} debut at the Geneva Motor Show {{in the new}} 1962 Renault Floride S, replacing the 845cc 40 hp Dauphine Gordini. The 956cc capacity, which delivered a dozen additional <b>horsepower,</b> (51 <b>hp</b> SAE),a few months later {{was seen in the}} new R8 sedan. For racing and motorsport versions, Amédée Gordini was responsible for designing a hemispherical combustion chambered head allowing 85-90 hp for a 1000cc version as opposed to 70 hp for the previous 700cc Gordini engine. Gordini revealed some weaknesses in the rigidity of the block which could lead to blown head gaskets; this prompted Renault to stiffen the block slightly.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, the 402 <b>horsepower</b> ( [...] 408 <b>hp</b> Europe [...] ) V12 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} detuned to 389 horsepower {{to comply with}} tighter emission control regulations in the United States and Europe. The V8 models were tuned down from 322 horsepower to 315 horsepower. This de-tuning, among other changes, involved the deletion of the full-throttle enrichment circuit, which reduced output by 7 horsepower.|$|R
50|$|The G650GS {{received}} some upgrades over the F650GS of 2007: the engine now produces 3 additional <b>horsepower</b> (now 53 <b>hp)</b> {{and received a}} stronger 400 watt alternator. In the United States and Australia, ABS and heated grips are now standard equipment instead of additional cost options. An emergency services specific version of the G650GS, fitted with blue lights and sirens, is available from BMW Motorrad's Official and special duty vehicles division.|$|R
50|$|With {{a one-hour}} rating of 4,400 <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp),</b> the 86 class {{was the most}} {{powerful}} locomotive in Australia at the time. Although no longer in regular use, the class remains among the most powerful in the country. Despite their higher power rating, they were generally regarded as inferior to the Metropolitan-Vickers built 46 class, which dated from the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The MacGregor {{expedition}} {{took with}} them a 1933 model Waco biplane for surveying and exploration. The aircraft had a single, 210 <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp),</b> Continental air-cooled rotary engine. Schlossbach flew the Waco four times from Etah marking several memorable aviation accomplishments; the first solo flight over Ellesmere Island; the first landing on Ellesmere Island; and the refuting of Perry’s claim {{that there was another}} island northwest of Ellesmere Island.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example is}} a {{supercharger}}, which derives its power from the engine and creates more power for the engine. The power that the supercharger consumes is parasitic loss and is usually expressed in <b>horsepower</b> (<b>HP).</b> While the HP that the supercharger consumes in comparison to what it generates is small, it is still measurable or calculable. One of the desirable features of a turbocharger over a supercharger is the lower parasitic loss of the former.|$|E
50|$|The yacht {{has four}} main MTU engines with a {{combined}} power of 12,444 hp. The builder also installed a General Electric LM2500 gas turbine on board, which produces 30,843 hp. The total combined <b>horsepower</b> of 43,287 <b>hp</b> allows the yacht to reach a maximum speed of more than 30 knots. The maximum speed with only the diesel engines working is 25 knots. The cruising speed (diesel only) is 22 knots.|$|R
5000|$|In {{agriculture}} and fisheries very large horsepower AFPs are used to lift water for irrigation and drainage. In East Asia, millions of smaller <b>horsepower</b> (6-20 <b>HP)</b> mobile units are powered mostly by single cylinder diesel and petrol engines. They are used by smaller farmers for crop irrigation, drainage and fisheries. Impeller designs have improved as well bringing even more efficiency and reducing energy costs to farming there. Earlier designs were less than two meters long but nowadays they can be up to 6 meters or more {{to enable them to}} more safely [...] "reach out" [...] to the water source while allowing the power source (many times two-wheel tractors are used) to be kept in safer, more stable positions, as shown in the adjacent picture.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} Dynamic 130, Panhard et Levassor offered a Dynamic 140, which shared its engine with the (initially still in production) “CS Spécial” model. The engine size on this version was 2.861 cc (16 CV). Actual claimed <b>horsepower</b> was 75 <b>hp</b> (55 kW) {{and it was}} this “Dynamic 140” that was the most popular with customers, 2,230 having been {{produced}} by 1940 when war brought production to an end. By this time the car had become the last production sleeve-valve-engined car in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The head {{added by}} the pump (...) is a {{sum of the}} static lift, the head loss due to {{friction}} and any losses due to valves or pipe bends all expressed in metres of fluid. Power is more commonly expressed as kilowatts (103 W, kW) or <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp</b> = kW/0.746). The value for the pump efficiency, , may be stated for the pump itself or as a combined efficiency of the pump and motor system.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, five {{different}} <b>horsepower</b> (<b>hp)</b> {{models of the}} New Holland stationary engine were mass-produced by the New Holland Company. These five models started with the little 1½ hp engine and ranged upwards to a 16 hp model. The most popular seller among the line of stationary engines offered by New Holland was the 5 hp model. By 1911, sales of the 5 hp model New Holland stationary engine were up more than 253% over sales of the same engine in 1904.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced for the 2005 {{model year}} was the {{optional}} Competition Package. Included in the Competition Package were 17" [...] Gunmetal Painted Alloy Rims, Ladder Tachometer w/ shift lights, a Limited Slip Differential, and Optional Projector-beam Fog Lamps. [...] In mid-2006, GM released two Engine Kit upgrades for both the Ion Red Line and the Cobalt SS. The Stage 1 Kit retailed for around $500 USD, and included higher-flow fuel injectors and a recalibration to the ECU to increase the <b>Horsepower</b> by 31 <b>hp</b> to 236 hp and 205 lb·ft. of torque, up from the stock 205 hp and 200 lb·ft. The Stage 2 Kit retailed for around $750 and opens up {{the middle of the}} power curve to more power than the Stage 1 Kit alone. In addition to everything that the Stage 1 Kit comes with, the Stage 2 Kit includes a smaller drive belt and pulley for the supercharger, bringing the engine up to 241 hp and 218 lb·ft. of torque. GM did release a Stage 1 to Stage 2 Upgrade kit that retailed for $400. This Upgrade Kit is for a Red Line with the Stage 1 kit already installed. This Upgrade Kit adds the Stage 2 elements and increases the <b>horsepower</b> from 236 <b>hp</b> to 241 hp.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, JDM {{cars were}} limited by {{voluntary}} self-restraints among manufacturers to 280 <b>horsepower</b> (PS) (276 <b>hp)</b> {{and a top}} speed of 180 km/h, limits imposed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) for safety. The horsepower limit was lifted in 2004 but the speed limit of 180 km/h remains in effect. Many JDM cars have speedometers that register up to 180 km/h (111.8 mph) (certain Nissans go up to 190 km/h, and the GT-R has a mechanism that removes the speed limiter on a track) but all have speed limiters.|$|R
5000|$|It {{produces}} 101 horsepower (75 kW) at 3400 rpm and [...] {{of torque}} at 1600-2400 rpm with 4 speed Automatic ECT transmission without intercooler and 191.7 lb·ft (200 N·m) of torque at 1600-3600 rpm with manual transmission without an intercooler and 118 hp (88 kW) at 3400 rpm and 239.85 ft·lbf (325 N·m) of torque at 1600-3600 rpm for the intercooled version. Toyota Thailand, however, has updated the turbocharger to variable nozzle turbo (VNT) with intercooler. This increased the <b>horsepower</b> to 142 <b>hp</b> (106 kW) at 3400 rpm and torque to 343 Nm at 1600-2800rpm.|$|R
