25|$|McLaren secured fifth place. Following {{their first}} season without a podium finish in 2013, the team saw Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button finish {{second and third}} in Australia. Both drivers {{recorded}} points finishes in Malaysia, but were {{forced out of the}} Bahrain Grand Prix with clutch issues, and failed to score points in China and again in Spain. The team managed to recover in Monaco, with Button finishing sixth and Magnussen tenth after contact with Räikkönen. Button finished fourth in Canada after a string of late-race retirements helped him move up the order. Magnussen used his recent knowledge of the circuit to finish seventh in Austria, while Button's attempt at a different strategy failed, leaving him in eleventh. Button and Magnussen were fourth and seventh respectively in Britain. Button finished eighth in Germany, ahead of Magnussen, who was involved in a first-lap altercation with Massa. Button finished tenth in Hungary, while Magnussen was outside the points. In Belgium, Magnussen finished sixth ahead of Button, but was given a twenty-second time penalty after the race, demoting him to twelfth. In Italy, Magnussen and Button originally finished seventh and ninth respectively, but Magnussen received another time penalty—this time for five seconds—demoting him to tenth, while Button promoted to eighth. Magnussen took the final point in Singapore, while Button was forced out when his engine shut <b>down.</b> <b>Button</b> finished fifth in Japan, while Magnussen was outside the points. The team took fourth and fifth place in Russia, with Button finishing in front of Magnussen. Magnussen took eighth in the United States, while Button failed to score points. Button finished fourth in Brazil whilst Magnussen finished ninth. In Abu Dhabi, Button finished fifth, while Magnussen finished outside the points.|$|E

50|$|The navi-roller {{was used}} {{in place of the}} {{familiar}} up and <b>down</b> <b>buttons,</b> allowing the user to rapidly scroll through lists of options; depressing the roller selected the currently highlighted option.|$|R
50|$|You {{can move}} left or right, or jump between {{levels of the}} current step by {{pressing}} up or <b>down.</b> <b>Button</b> 1 performs kicks, while button 2 performs a shorter kind of jump (for more direct attacks and for clearing certain gaps) Further, pressing the kick button during either kind of jump will deliver a flying kick, which awards more points for an enemy defeated by it. You can also gain more points by knocking out multiple enemies with a single kick.|$|E
50|$|It {{is notable}} {{that the game}} has a third {{dimension}} despite being a side-scrolling one. Most levels consist of several parallel planes that the player character can move between. Having noticed a door or a window with another room in it, a player can make him run through it into that room with the up button. In that room, {{there will be a}} platform extending from the floor. From there, pressing the <b>down</b> <b>button</b> would make the character slip back into the room he came from.|$|E
50|$|While the Natural Interaction {{discussion}} {{does not}} go specifically into touch, the Apple iPod wheel interface {{is a prime example}} of a more human centric input system for a product that previously presented serious user interaction challenges. Prior digital music players generally required the user to hold an up or <b>down</b> <b>button</b> and wait as the screen scrolled through perhaps hundreds of artists or thousands of songs. The iPod wheel scroll system used a capacitive touch and acceleration implementation that was so pleasing some even described it as a somewhat addictive motion for the thumb.|$|E
50|$|Two new options {{have been}} added. The first are HIDDEN+ and SUDDEN+, which are {{alternate}} versions of HIDDEN and SUDDEN {{that can be}} activated using the up and <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> on the cabinet. The second is the RISKY option, which gives the player one life bar (like in ENCORE EXTRA STAGE); it is only available when playing SINGLE or DOUBLE mode. If the player missteps, the stage will end and skip to the next stage. This is useful for the players who want to achieve higher scores. In addition, SPEED can also be adjusted using the up and <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> on the cabinet.|$|R
50|$|Holding <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> while {{moving the}} mouse can be awkward and {{requires}} some practice, since the downwards action increases friction for the horizontal motion. An optical mouse {{would be less}} susceptible to changes in behavior than a ball mouse with increased friction because the sensor does not rely on mechanical contact to sense movement; a touchpad provides no added friction with all its <b>buttons</b> held <b>down</b> with a thumb. However, it was also argued that muscular tension resulting from holding <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> could be exploited in user interface design as it gives constant feedback that the user is in a temporary state, or mode (Buxton, 1995).|$|R
50|$|The 3410 is a compact, but {{somewhat}} heavy phone (weight:114 g, battery included). It employs up and <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> for menu navigation. The on/off/profile button is a stiff black button {{located on}} the top of the phone.|$|R
50|$|The season {{concluded}} with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Hamilton took 2nd {{in a critical}} race for him, with Button in 4th. Button jumped Alonso at the start, which was good for Hamilton, who needed to win with Alonso out of the points and Vettel and Webber both well <b>down.</b> <b>Button</b> led during the pit stops, but when everything was settled down, {{they were still in}} the same order, 2nd and 3rd behind Vettel, who went on to take the race and the title. Hamilton was eventually fourth, 16 points off Vettel, while Button was 5th, a further 26 behind. McLaren held on to second in the Constructors', 44 behind Red Bull and 58 ahead of Ferrari in 3rd.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Animas Ping {{which has}} a locking feature that is undone by {{pressing}} both {{the up and down}} arrow buttons, the Deltec Cozmo had a number locking feature. The purpose of this feature was somewhat defeated by pump trainers encouraging the use of 14 as the code number. The Deltec Cozmo also used a different scrolling mechanism than the Animas Ping. On the Ping pump holding down the up or <b>down</b> <b>button</b> causes a change in one number then increments by five and on the Ping meter the numbers slowly climb to 5 then abruptly change speed, going from 5 to 110 in the same time it took to go from 0-5; on the Cozmo the scrolling speed slowly accelerated the longer the button was held down. This allowed the pumper to get to high values relatively fast and then still get to the exact value they wanted.|$|E
50|$|The last red-roofed village flashes below me, and the target, {{a pyramid}} of white barrels, is just visible {{at the end}} of its run-in line. Five hundred knots. Switch <b>down,</b> <b>button</b> pressed. Timers begin their timing, {{circuits}} are alerted for the drop. Inch down to treetop altitude. I do not often fly at 500 knots on the deck, and it is apparent that I am moving quickly. The barrels inflate. I see that their white paint is flaking. And the pyramid streaks beneath me. Back on the stick smoothly firmly to read four G on the accelerometer and center the needles of the indicator that is only used in nuke weapon drops and center them and hold it there and I'll bet those computers are grinding their little hearts out and all I can see is sky in the windscreen hold the G's keep the needles centered there's the sun going beneath me and WHAM.My airplane rolls hard to the right and tucks more tightly into her loop and strains ahead even though we are upside down. The Shape has released me more than I have released it. The little white barrels are now six thousand feet directly beneath my canopy. I have no way to tell if it was a good drop or not. That was decided back with the charts and graphs and the dividers and the angles. I kept the needles centered, the computers did their task automatically, and the Device is on its way.|$|E

50|$|Japanese {{developments}} in bridgeless zithers include the one-stringed koto (ichigenkin) and two-stringed koto (nigenkin or yakumo goto). Around the 1920s, Goro Morita {{created a new}} version of the two-stringed koto; on this koto, one would push <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> above the metal strings like the western autoharp. It was named the taishōgoto after the Taishō period.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] akkordolia is a zither from Germany and Austria, {{consisting}} of a long box, with the strings being pressed against the fretboard by pressing <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> from above, similar to the Japanese taishogoto.

5000|$|Northern District Baseball Club inc. was {{established}} in 1969 with the merger of Prospect Baseball Club (Est 1936) and Enfield Baseball Club (Est 1954), for the new format of the summer Baseball season.Since {{the formation of the}} club the uniform has maintained the colours of Red and White in several combinations. The 1995/96 season saw the introduction of the uniform being predominately white with top marked with red piping around the collar and <b>down</b> <b>button</b> row with 1’’ red bands on sleeve ends and Norths printed down the left hand front panel. The trousers have a red band down the sides and a red belt. This is finished off with a red hat with white lettering ‘ND’ on the front, and red socks The red and white colour combination is the base colour for most northern Adelaide sporting clubs.In 1999/20 with a second Under12 div2 team, another uniform was required to separate the two teams. Red tops with white neck a band and sleeve ends were adopted. One with Norths in white letters down front left side. The other with Reds in white letters across chest. This was the birth of the ‘Reds’This led to the seniors adopting the name ‘Reds’ and changing the top to red with white lettering and sleeves being changed to black During Northern Districts Baseball Club’s history, the club has had 87 teams in final four positions, 14 Premierships and 12 runners-up.The club has produced 27 South Australian Baseball Medal winners.This included an Australian club record set in season 1976/77, when the club had six medal winners, 4 seniors and 2 juniors.Don Masters Div.1, Doug Hendry Div.4, Julius Szlazak Div.5, Barry Grieves Div.6,Peter Moore U.17, Leon Faulkner U.15 ...|$|E
40|$|This fMRI study studied age-related {{differences}} in neural activities during response regulation. Twenty-one male participants from two age groups, a younger group {{and an older}} group (mean ages: 29. 9 and 65. 2 years, respectively), were scanned while performing a task with response compatibility manipulation. They were presented with a sequence of arrowheads that pointed either upward or downward. In the "Response Compatible" condition, {{they were required to}} press an up or a <b>down</b> <b>button</b> consistent with the direction of the arrowhead. In the "Response Incompatible" condition, they were required to press the button opposite to the arrowhead direction so that an upward arrow should elicit a down response, and vice versa. Findings showed age-related {{differences in}} response regulation in several brain regions, including the right frontal, the right cingulate, and the left inferior parietal cortexes. The findings suggested a higher level of neural activity in the right prefrontal and left inferior parietal regions during response regulation for the older adults than for the younger adults. © 2006 Elsevier B.

50|$|In September 1942, Buttons {{made his}} Broadway debut in Vickie with Ferrer and Uta Hagen. Later that year, he {{appeared}} in the Minsky's show Wine, Women and Song. This was the last classic Burlesque show in New York City history, as the Mayor La Guardia administration closed it <b>down.</b> <b>Buttons</b> was on stage when the show was raided.|$|R
50|$|Elevators are {{typically}} controlled {{from the outside}} by a call box, which has up and <b>down</b> <b>buttons,</b> at each stop. When pressed at a certain floor, the button calls the elevator to pick up more passengers. If the particular elevator is currently serving traffic in a certain direction, it will only answer calls {{in the same direction}} unless there are no more calls beyond that floor.|$|R
30|$|We also {{considered}} two object selection modes {{for use with}} INSPECT. The first used a relative 2 D cursor. In this mode, one finger moves the cursor relative to its current position, similar to the trackpad commonly found on notebook computers [41]. Objects under the 2 D cursor are highlighted and touching the screen with a second finger or double-tapping selected the object. We also prototyped a virtual hand-like selection mode. In this mode, a spherical cursor (virtual hand) is controlled by plane-casting and intersects the desired object. Either of these two selection modes could be applicable {{depending on the context}} of usage. We found the former to be quicker, yet the latter offers the potential to select occluded objects or “nudge” objects to reveal the desired one (e.g. in a 3 D sandbox game/educational application with collision detection). A double-tap and long press on the volume-down button switched between the 2 D and 3 D cursors. When in 3 D cursor mode, holding the volume <b>down</b> <b>button</b> made the 3 D cursor solid for bumping against other objects (Fig. 6). Neither of those selection modes was formally evaluated because there is extensive literature on 3 D selection.|$|E
50|$|The ME Super has an {{electronic}} {{focal plane shutter}} with metal curtains and a vertical movement. Shutter speeds are selected with up and <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> rather than the conventional wheel. They run from 4 seconds to 1/2000 of a second, with flash synchronisation at 1/125 of a second. The hotshoe features an additional shoe contact for dedicated Pentax flash units, not seen on the preceding ME.|$|R
50|$|The game {{utilized}} full parallax scrolling {{through most}} of the game, however, the graphics were not considered as anything special by the reviewers of the time. The game's audio received better reviews and a sound test was available by holding <b>down</b> <b>buttons</b> A and Start on the title screen (various other options were available here for adjusting the game difficulty and other standard features).|$|R
