25|$|Coates Law of Maturity is a {{principle}} used in wine tasting {{relating to the}} aging ability of wine. Developed by the British Master of Wine, Clive Coates, the principle states that a wine will remain at its peak (or optimal) drinking quality for a duration of time that {{is equal to the}} time of maturation required to reach its optimal quality. During the evolution (aging) of a wine certain flavors, aromas and textures appear and fade. Rather than developing and fading in unison, these traits each operate on a unique evolutionary path and time line. The principle allows for the subjectivity of individual tastes because it follows the logic that positive traits that appeal to one particular wine taster will continue to persist along the principle's guideline while for another taster these traits might not be positive and therefore not applicable to the guideline. Wine expert Tom Stevenson has noted that there is logic in Coates' principle and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> encounter an anomaly or wine that debunks it.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} written in the third-person with flashbacks to {{specific}} events {{in the life of}} Simón Bolívar, [...] "the General". It begins on May 8, 1830 in Santa Fe de Bogotá. The General is preparing for his journey towards the port of Cartagena de Indias, intending to leave Colombia for Europe. Following his resignation as President of Gran Colombia, the people of the lands he liberated have now turned against him, scrawling anti-Bolívar graffiti and throwing waste at him. The General is anxious to move on, but has to remind the Vice-President-elect, General Domingo Caycedo, that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> receive a valid passport to leave the country.

500|$|From the unformed shapeshifter, {{they learn}} {{of a name}} of its {{potential}} target, a doctor at a local hospital. They take the man into custody but find that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be harmed. Based {{on the need for}} three shapeshifters, Walter surmises that Newton is trying to use the same technology that he and William Bell had pioneered for crossing the universes, by placing three vibrational sources triangulated around the target. [...] Walter begins to collect equipment to create interference with the vibrations to prevent the crossing. Another corpse is found, that of a bank manager that appears to have been killed by a shapeshifter. Realizing both men would have access to secured areas in their workplaces, they use these locations as two points on Netwon's triangle. From this, they are able to identify two locations where the transfer will occur. Olivia (Anna Torv), using the information Walter has told her in private about his own crossing, identifies a collapsed derelict bridge over the Charles River, where the water would absorb the energy of crossing over.|$|E
500|$|Though Wenger has {{established}} Arsenal as UEFA Champions League regulars, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> win the European Cup, or translated his domestic success in other continental competitions – often considered a blemish on his managerial career. Writer Michael Calvin argues despite the European failings, Wenger {{should still be}} {{considered one of the}} greats in football: [...] " [...] has been the best, most influential manager of the modern era. His job has involved managing change, and all the hypocrisy which comes with that. In a world where incoherence is routinely hailed as innovation, he has been a true visionary". Wenger's stubbornness to follow his idealistic vision of football has been heavily criticised during his second decade at Arsenal. In 2016, Henry Winter reasoned the Frenchman's methods no longer gave him an advantage over others, and he needed to adapt or resign. Winter also suggested the club was content with lucrative top-four finishes, and the manager needed tough individuals to challenge him. Ferguson however expressed admiration in Wenger's consistency and obstinate nature: [...] "He stays with what he believes in. And I think people who do that are outstanding coaches".|$|E
