40|$|Cuspidal {{edges and}} swallowtails are typical {{non-degenerate}} singular points on wave fronts in the Euclidean 3 -space. The <b>first</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>forms</b> of such singularities {{belong to a}} class of positive semi-definite metrics called `Kossowski metrics'. A point where a Kossowski metric is not positive definite is called a singular point of the metric. Kossowski proved that any (real) analytic Kossowski metric germs at their generic singular points (we call such points `non-flat' singular points) can be realized as wave front germs at non-degenerate singular points (Kossowski's realization theorem). On the other hand, in a previous work with Saji, the third and the fourth authors introduced the notion of `coherent tangent bundle'. Moreover, the authors with Hasegawa and Saji proved that a Kossowski metric canonically induces an associated coherent tangent bundle. In this paper, we shall explain Kossowski's realization theorem {{from the viewpoint of}} coherent tangent bundles. Moreover, as refinements of it, we give several applications. Some remaining problems on isometric deformations of singularities of analytic maps are given {{at the end of this}} paper. Comment: 32 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
