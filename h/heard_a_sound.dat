500|$|As Altgens {{set up for}} {{a second}} {{photograph}} along Elm Street, he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> that he recognized as gunfire, {{and saw that the}} President had been struck in the head. Altgens later wrote that his camera was focused and ready, [...] "but when JFK's head exploded, sending substance in my direction, I virtually became paralyzed.... Yet, many news people say I should have taken the picture anyway... I should have made the picture that I was set up to make. And I didn't do it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Khia's on {{the record}} because I'm a {{producer}} and I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> that I wanted. She don't actually rap {{on the record}}, I'm giving you the exclusive. It’s something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E
2500|$|The head {{tells his}} story: [...] He {{was once a}} mighty warrior, the brother of Chernomor, who envied him. [...] Chernomor’s magic power lay in his beard, and he told his brother that they must secure the sword, which {{had the power to}} kill the both of them – Chernomor, by cutting his beard, the brother, by {{severing}} his head. [...] They set off in quest of the sword, but then disputed to whom it should belong once they found it. [...] Chernomor proposed that they both put their heads to the ground and the sword would go to the one who first <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> [...] Instead, he used the sword to sever his brother’s head, which magically remained alive.|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth Wulf claimed mystical {{experiences}} {{while growing}} up. [...] She claimed {{that when she}} was about four, she had a vision of herself playing on the sands of the Nile river in Egypt. [...] (Her mother told her that it was a past life.) [...] She claimed that as a child she felt God's light around her naturally, and <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> in her inner ear like that of an ocean wave or the roar of Niagara Falls. [...] While water-skiing, she said she felt that she was suspended in a place where other spiritual beings existed, who were joyous in the light, radiating love. [...] This motivated her {{to find out more about}} who these [...] "saints robed in white" [...] (Rev. 7:9-17) were, for she had always believed in the [...] "universality of all true religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after that, Changing Woman {{wished for}} a mate. Every {{morning when the}} sun rose she {{lay on her back}} until noon, her head to the west and her feet to the east. [...] At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|The silence, {{the rhythmic}} {{disappointment}} of the silence, {{came as a}} fresh shock. For a moment one could doubt whether one had ever <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> Or whether it might not still be going on. Had I indeed <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound?</b> ...|$|E
