5|$|The feudalism {{introduced}} under David I, {{particularly in}} the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of administration by local thanes.

It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records.
