Up to 1050 °C, primary mullite formation occurred at earlier temperature within iron-enriched <b>kaolins</b> than in the case of iron-free <b>kaolins.</b> At 1150 °C, the presence of ferric ions tended to promote the transformation of the spinel (γ-Al 2 O 3 -like) phase into primary mullite. This action was correlated with an enhancement of the diffusion mechanism of the main constitutive species of the samples (Al, Si). In the range 1300 – 1400 °C, iron-enriched <b>kaolins</b> exhibited an abnormal grain growth of secondary mullite crystals and a partial reduction of hematite (Fe 2 O 3) into magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).

This was achieved using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) on the Bomkoul, Dibamba, Ediki, Logbaba, Missole and Yatchika <b>kaolins.</b> Transmittance spectra of 20 samples {{were recorded in}} the mid-infrared regions (MIR). Results show {{that most of the}} <b>kaolins</b> had the four distinguishable bands in the hydroxyl (OH) stretching region, though the second transmittance band (3670 cm− 1) had low intensities. The hydroxyl stretching of water bands (3457 and 3442 cm− 1 for KGa- 1 b and KGa- 2, respectively) were mainly observed in all Logbaba samples at 3443 cm− 1 and 3445 cm− 1. The two bands reflecting OH deformation of inner-surface hydroxyl and inner hydroxyl groups (937 and 915 cm− 1) were quite visible in the Bomkoul, Dibamba, Logbaba and Missole II samples; slightly visible in all Yatchika and two of the Ediki; and not visible in Missole I and one of the Ediki samples. Therefore, based on the empirical classification of the degree of order of kaolinite, 10 of the studied samples had ordered structures. Three displayed partially ordered structures; four had poorly ordered structures, and three exhibited disordered structures.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{substitution}} of Fe 3 + in the kaolinite structure is studied by EPR spectrometry and by FTIR spectrometry {{on a large}} set of <b>kaolins</b> from different origins (sedimentary and primary ores, soil <b>kaolins).</b> The IR bands at 3598 and 875 cm-~, observed in the literature only {{in the case of}} disordered <b>kaolins</b> or in Fe-rich environments (ynthetic, lateritic), are revealed by high-resolution IR analysis, whatever the origin and the total Fe content of the samples. The EPR bands corresponding to Fe 3 § substituted in sites II of the octahedral sheet increase when the IR absorbance near 3600 cm- ~ increases. Two IR absorption bands near 4465 cm- ~ and 7025 cm- ~ are observed for the first time, both in transmission and diffuse reflectance on all samples. These bands are assigned to the combination of the 3598 and 875 cm- ~ bands and to the first harmonic of the band at 3598 cm- ~, respectively. The area of the band at 4465 cm- ~ in diffuse reflectance is quantitatively correlated to the abundance of Fe 3 + located in centers II as measured by ESR. This directly confirms the assignment of the two IR bands at 3598 and 875 cm- ~ to OH stretching and deformation vibration bands in octahedral FE 3 + environment in the kaolinite structure, respectively. Effects due to the size of particles and to the main <b>kaolins</b> impurities on the near infrared spectra, are also discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Primary <b>kaolins,</b> {{related to}} Pliocene-Pleistocene {{volcanic}} rocks of acid to intermediate composition {{from the southern}} part of Kimolos island contain kaolinite and quartz + cristobalite. Smectite is rarely present whereas alunite is common and more prevalent than baryte or gypsum.

The elements Nb, Th, Ce and Sr, La, V constitute two groups with a strong intercorrelation a d the <b>kaolins</b> are enriched in these dements compared to the parent rocks. K, Rb, Y and Ba are positively correlated with feldspar content and decrease with the intensity of kaolinization.

30|$|Kaolinitic clays are {{considered}} as acidic refractories {{due to their}} Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 ratio, {{as well as their}} limited total fluxing and alkali oxide contents, namely, Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2, CaO, MgO, Na 2 O, and K 2 O. These clays include fireclays, ball clays, and <b>kaolins</b> (Grim 1968). Konta (1979) classified the kaolintic clays for ceramic industries according to their content of the total coloring oxides, i.e. Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2, into two categories; the first grade (Seger 1 clays) contains less than 1.2 % of the coloring oxides, e.g., China clay, which is suitable for production of white-ware ceramics, e.g., porcelain tableware and electrical insulators. Clays rich in kaolinite containing higher than 1.2 % of total Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 are classified as Seger 2 clays, which are adequate for manufacturing colored and heavy clay-based ceramics and aluminosilicate refractories. The Egyptian <b>kaolins</b> and fireclays are mainly belonging to Seger 2 kaolinitic clays (Carniglia and Barna 1992, Routschka 2004, and Elmaghraby and Ismail 2016).|$|R

Formulations were later developed based on <b>kaolin</b> with quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite or other feldspathic rocks. These were technically superior, and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.|$|E

The amount of smectite varied substantially between sampling sites. Sediments taken near the mount of Ranot Stream contained the largest amount of smectite.

40|$|THE {{degree of}} crystal {{perfection}} of <b>kaolins</b> {{is known to}} be related to certain properties of importance in the ceramic and paper-making industries.

Recent work (Wood-ward, 1955; Murray and Lyons, 1956), in which a qualitative correlation between viscosity and degree of crystal perfection was indicated, is in contradistinction to earlier studies (Mitchell and Henry, 1943; Mitchell and Poulos, 1959) in which no consistent correlation was noted.

40|$|Purification {{processes}} {{performed on}} natural clays to select specific clay minerals {{are complex and}} expensive {{and can lead to}} over-exploitation of some deposits. The present study aimed to examine physicochemical (mineralogy, morphology, size, surface charge, chemical composition, cation exchange capacity [CEC], and pH) and hydration (swelling, wettability, water sorption, and rheological behavior) properties of three native clays from Italian deposits for potential pharmaceutical and cosmetic uses due to the presence of phyllosilicate minerals. Particular emphasis was placed on energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis coupled with the ‘cesium method’ to assay clay elemental composition and CEC. One bentonite of volcanic origin (BNT) and two <b>kaolins,</b> one of hydrothermal origin (K-H) and another of lacustrine-fluvial origin (K-L), were evaluated in comparison with a commercial, purified bentonite. The CEC assay revealed the complete substitution of exchangeable cations (Na+ and Ca 2 +) by Cs+ in BNT samples and CEC values consistent with those of typical smectites (100. 64 7. 33 meq/ 100 g). For <b>kaolins,</b> partial substitution of Na+ cations occurred only in the K-L samples because of the interstratified mineral component which has small CEC values (11. 13 5. 46 meq/ 100 g for the K-H sample and 14. 75 6. 58 meq/ 100 g for the K-L sample). The degree of isomorphous substitution of Al 3 + by Mg 2 + affected the hydration properties of BNT in terms of swelling, water sorption, and rheology, whereas both of the poorly expandable <b>kaolins</b> exhibited significant water-adsorption properties. The EDX microanalysis has proved to be of considerable interest in terms of providing more information about clay properties in comparison with other commonly used methods and to identify the role played by both chemical and mineralogical composition of natural clays for their appropriate use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields...|$|R

40|$|The Patagonian <b>kaolins</b> offer a wide set {{of origin}} of deposits, composition, mineral {{processing}} and ceramic properties, giving {{a rare opportunity}} for investigating the interdependence of mineralogy, chemical composition, particle size distribution, texture, and surface activity with their technological behaviour in sanitaryware and porcelain stoneware production. Plasticity is strictly dependent on surface activity, < 2 micron fraction and expandable clay minerals; slip rheology is affected by soluble salts and expandable clay minerals, but also by high specific surface or tubular halloysite. Kaolinite/halloysite play an opposite role versus smectite/interstratified I/S in slip casting and tile pressing: the former allow faster casting rates, while the latter improve powder flowability and mechanical strength. Kaolinite and quartz are beneficial for drying behaviour while high surface activity or expandable clay minerals increase significantly drying sensitivity. Firing behaviour is mainly affected by minor components supplying "fluxing" (i. e. iron, alkali and alkaline-earth) oxides.
