5|$|Healthcare premium cost {{increases}} in the employer market continued to moderate after {{the implementation of the}} law. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers rose by 69% from 2000-2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015, with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016. From 2008-2010 (before passage of the ACA) <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> rose by an average of 10% per year.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{also helps}} reduce income {{inequality}} measured after taxes, due to higher {{taxes on the}} top 5% of income earners and both subsidies and Medicaid expansion for lower-income persons. CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. For scale, the subsidy for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market. The employer market subsidy was not changed by the law.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> The difference between the family's maximum contribution to <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E

25|$|The Colorado State Health Care System Initiative, Amendment 69, was a citizen-initiated {{constitutional}} amendment proposal in November 2016 {{to vote on}} a single-payer healthcare system funded by a 10% payroll tax split 2:1 between employers and employees.

25|$|The Canton of Geneva has a law on cantonal level, the Partenariat cantonal (the Cantonal Domestic Partnership), since 2001. It grants {{unmarried}} couples, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, many rights, {{responsibilities and}} protections that married couples have. However, {{it does not}} allow benefits in taxation, social security, or <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> (unlike the federal law). Geneva was the first Canton to recognise same-sex couples through this law.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} subsidizes the employer-based market by an estimated $250 {{billion per year}} (about $1,612 per person covered in the employer market), by excluding <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> from employee income. This subsidy encourages people to buy more extensive coverage (which places upward pressure on average premiums), while also encouraging more young, healthy people to enroll (which places downward pressure on premium prices). CBO estimates the net effect is to increase premiums 10-15% over an un-subsidized level.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} improve profits, the Detroit {{automakers}} made deals with unions to reduce wages while making pension and health care commitments. GM, for instance, at one time picked up the entire cost of funding <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> of its employees, their survivors and GM retirees, as the US {{did not have a}} universal health care system. With most of these plans chronically underfunded in the late 1990s, the companies have tried to provide retirement packages to older workers, and made agreements with the UAW to transfer pension obligations to an independent trust. In 2009, the CBC reported that the non-unionized Japanese automakers, with their younger American workforces and fewer retirees will continue to enjoy a cost advantage over the Big Three.|$|E
