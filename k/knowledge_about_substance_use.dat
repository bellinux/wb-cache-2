40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess {{pharmacy}} students’ <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> doping <b>substances</b> <b>used</b> in sport, explore {{their attitudes toward}} doping and investigate their misuse of doping drugs. A questionnaire was developed and employed to collect data from bachelor of pharmacy (BPharm) students at the International University for Science and Technology (IUST). Two-hundred and eighty students participated in this self-administrated, paper-based survey. Around 90 % of the students {{did not appear to}} know that narcotics, β-blockers and diuretics were used in sport as doping agents. Additionally, proportions between 60 % and 80 % considered vitamins, energy drinks and amino acids as substances that possess performance-enhancing effects. The main reason for doping, based on students’ response, was to improve muscular body appearance. The vast majority of students agreed that pharmacists should {{play a major role in}} promoting awareness about risks of doping. While students showed negative attitudes toward doping, approximately 15 % of them, primarily males, had already tried a doping drug or might do so in the future. More than 60 % of the students believed that sports-mates and friends are the most influential in encouraging them to take a doping agent. The study highlights the need to provide pharmacy students with advanced theoretical background and practical training concerning doping. This can be achieved by adopting simple, but essential, changes to the current curricula...|$|R
30|$|REACH aims {{to deliver}} {{structured}} and accessible information on chemicals, e.g. toxicological and physicochemical information to achieve adequate classification and labeling, or DNELs. Relevant data are publicly {{available in the}} ECHA database. Classification, information on the uses, operational conditions and relevant risk management measures are communicated via SDS. The understanding of manufacturers and importers on {{the life cycle of}} their substances has also increased. Bidirectional communication and collection of <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> hazardous <b>substances</b> in <b>use</b> have been achieved in some cases ensuring more reliable data within the supply chain. These achievements are clearly a large step forward. With DNELs, a new type of reference values for safe use has been introduced and made available for many substances that had no OEL before. Whilst the quality of some of the DNELs/DMELs might need improvement, the derivation of these values is a gain for occupational health and safety. The instrument of authorisation for SVHC has also intensified industries' efforts in substitution of the most hazardous chemicals. From the authors' point of view, the transfer of the burden of proof to the manufacturers and suppliers of chemicals has increased their efforts to tackle unknown and neglected risks from hazardous substances.|$|R
40|$|Purpose This project synthesizes <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> psychoactive <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> by {{professionals}} (e. g. dentists, accountant) {{and students in}} professional programs and the impact on occupational performance and quality of experience during engagement. Psychoactive substances alter consciousness, mood, and perception. They encompass licit substances (e. g., alcohol, over-the-counter medication), prescribed medication, illicit substances (e. g., marijuana), and healing plants (e. g., peyote). Research shows a relatively high prevalence of <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> among professionals and students. A systematic study reported use of methylphenidate (Ritalin) by medical students was 16 percent (Finger, Silva, 2 ̆ 6 Falavigna, 2013). Physicians and pharmacists reported higher illicit use of opiates, anxiolytics, and sedative-hypnotics {{than the general population}} (Kenna 2 ̆ 6 Wood, 2004) and cocaine use among a sample of lawyers was higher than the general population (Benjamin, Darling, 2 ̆ 6 Sales, 1990). Methods This study involved a systematic review of English, peer-reviewed articles. Databases included EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, Medline, and Sociological Abstracts. Search terms included a combination of profession-specific terms (e. g. physician/doctor; lawyer/attorney; medical student) and substance-related terms (e. g. performance enhancing; addiction; Adderall; caffeine). Included were articles that reported empirical findings by the authors. Discussions articles, commentaries, poster abstracts, theses, literature reviews, single case studies, and treatment outcome studies were excluded. Articles were reviewed for information regarding prevalence of <b>use,</b> types of <b>substances</b> <b>used,</b> impact of <b>substances</b> on performance, and contextual factors that influence use. Results 122 articles met the search criteria regarding <b>use</b> of <b>substances</b> {{by professionals}} and students, published between 1984 to May 2016. The most common methodology was self-administered survey (n= 98). Only 11 articles reported actual findings about the effects of substances on experience and performance. Desired effects include improved sleep, stress management, alleviation of boredom, and improved productivity (Merlo, Cummings, 2 ̆ 6 Cottler, 2014). Students <b>used</b> <b>substances</b> to improve concentration, productivity, or grades, to enhance energy, to facilitate weight loss, and to aid in socialization (Volger, McLendon, Fuller, 2 ̆ 6 Herring, 2014). Implications A little understood phenomenon, within and outside the field of occupational science, is the deliberate <b>use</b> of <b>substances</b> to alter or enhance performance and to alter the experience of daily occupations. An examination of controlled use, perceived benefits, and naturally occurring strategies to minimise negative consequences can contribute to more comprehensive understandings <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> in the context of daily occupation. Keywords Substance use; occupational performance; professionals Discussion Questions 1) Research <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> typically investigates negative and undesired effects on occupational engagement and occupational performance. How might evaluation of the beneficial and desired effects contribute to more nuanced understandings about motivations for use? 2) What contextual factors might influence types of <b>substances</b> <b>used</b> and patterns of use by professionals and students? 3) What social ideals about optimal occupational performance influence individual decisions <b>about</b> <b>use</b> of <b>substances</b> as cognitive and performance enhancers...|$|R
40|$|Police {{officers}} typically use {{common sense}} honed by experience to interpret ambiguous situations, {{such as those}} involving someone who may have a mental illness or may be {{under the influence of}} substances. Furthermore, for individuals with mental illnesses and co-occurring <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders, police officers can serve as gatekeepers to either the criminal justice or mental health systems. Police officers 2 ̆ 7 decision to refer someone to mental health treatment, rather than arrest them, is predicated on their ability to recognize signs of a mental illness. This study examined police officers 2 ̆ 7 commonsense <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> mental illnesses, <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> and co-occurring disorders in the context of mental disturbance calls, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of police officers 2 ̆ 7 decision-making process. Because common sense knowledge varies with context, the study used a case study methodology to elicit the common knowledge shared by police officers within two Philadelphia police districts. Using Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s lens of habitus and doxa, commonsense knowledge, the study explored how neighborhood characteristics and policy contexts impact officers 2 ̆ 7 interpretation of behavior during mental disturbance calls. Data included secondary data analysis of structured interviews with police officers (N = 15), document analysis, and observation of police/community meetings from each district. The interviews were coded using grounded theory coding techniques and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings from this study indicated that officers used three sources of information to assess a mental disturbance situation: information from dispatch, information from people on the scene, and behavioral observations of subjects of the call. The availability of this information and the officers 2 ̆ 7 judgments about the usefulness of each type of information differed by police district. Officers 2 ̆ 7 ability to differentiate between signs of mental illness and <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> did not impact whether or not they referred an individual for treatment, but did impact the willingness to use force in a situation. Additionally, analysis of police officer doxa suggested that a portion of mental disturbance calls consist of people with mental illness calling police to report bizarre crimes. Future research is needed to investigate how to best serve this population, who may be utilizing a disproportionate amount of policing resources. ...|$|R

The first chapter in this thesis reviews recent empirical and theoretical literature regarding {{the nature of the}} relationship between trauma and substance misuse so as to highlight principal considerations applicable to the process of conceptualisation. In addition, Chapter two presents results of a principal component analysis of the Beliefs <b>About</b> <b>Substance</b> <b>Use</b> inventory (BASU) in order to facilitate the accurate measurement of beliefs in individuals who misuse substances. Findings indicated that in addition to its overall score reflecting the extent of dysfunctional be 1 iefs <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> the BASU is also able to evaluate important beliefs with regard to motivations for continued use, barriers to cessation and withdrawal, beliefs about dependence whilst also addressing contemplative state.

40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} is pilot {{evaluation}} of the life skills program REBOUND in a school context focusing on <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> risk perception, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> psychoactive <b>substances</b> (n IG + CG = 723 students in five schools and 46 classes, Mage = 14. 8, range 14 - 18) for the total sample and in the subgroups gender, age, and school type. Main goal {{of the study is}} collecting evidence for program optimization. A controlled study was carried out with repeated measurement before and after the intervention (4 - 6 months). Multilevel analyses, ANCOVA, and logistic regression analyses were applied to measure the effects. Overall, significantly lower incidence rates of drunkenness (odds ratio [OR] =. 55; p =. 033), improved <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> psychoactive <b>substances</b> (p =. 006), lower personal (p =. 013) and general tobacco risk perception among users (p =. 002), and lower general tobacco (p =. 018) and cannabis (p =. 000) risk perception in non-users were found in the total intervention group. In subgroups, significantly lower rates for the incidence of drunkenness can be shown for males (p =. 008) and for younger participants (p =. 004). Students at academic high school (German Gymnasium) showed a decrease in 30 -day prevalence for alcohol (p =. 017) and cannabis (p =. 014), and they improved in their <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> psychoactive <b>substances</b> (p =. 000).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current studies was to {{identify}} messages that Latino parents communicate to their offspring about the use of legal and illegal drugs and to determine associations between parental messages and <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> outcomes. Previous research has identified parent-child communication as protective against tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use. However, most of these studies have failed to examine the specific messages communicated and those that have focused almost exclusively on non-Hispanic Caucasians. Study 1 identified messages that Latino parents communicate to their offspring regarding legal and illegal drugs through two focus groups with Latino college students (N = 7; ages 18 - 25). Many parental messages expressed in the focus groups were consistent with previous research. However, two distinct messages emerged from the focus groups: abstaining from <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> for religious reasons and because it would be disrespectful to parents. Results of qualitative analyses were combined with previous research identifying parental messages <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> to create a 75 -item questionnaire assessing the degree to which parents conveyed identified message types. Following the first study, an additional sample of Latino emerging adults (N = 222) was recruited from Virginia Commonwealth University, other Virginia colleges, and organizations with primarily Latino members in order to examine the psychometric properties of the newly developed questionnaire and to assess the associations between parental messages and <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> outcomes in Study 2. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) produced six components: Rewards 2 ̆ 6 Punishments, Religious Beliefs, Never Addressed, Respecting Parents, Focus on Yourself, Negative Consequences of Use. These resulting components then were examined in association with <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> outcomes while also controlling for participants’ age, sex, religious commitment, familism, and acculturation. Results suggest that parental messages <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> are differentially associated with <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> outcomes, with some messages appearing to be protective and other messages associated with increased risk. Further, select parental messages were strongly associated with the <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> patterns of Latino emerging adults while some messages were not related or marginally related to <b>substance</b> <b>use.</b> Specifically, messages focused on the negative consequences of use were most protective, while messages stressing rewards and punishments and respecting parents were associated with increased risk.

40|$|Although {{adolescents}} in juvenile detention represent a vulnerable population who {{are exposed to}} situations that foster risk-taking behaviors, {{few studies have been}} conducted with detained adolescents to determine their perceptions regarding <b>substance</b> <b>use.</b> Ethnographic interviews and observations were conducted with 20 male adolescents who resided in a large metropolitan area juvenile detention facility, to discover their <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> beliefs and the decisions they make to continue or discontinue <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> or abuse. The participants described how they initiated sub-stance use and said that they had rarely made active decisions <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> until they were detained. They explained the decisions they made, while they were in detention, to stop or cut down their <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> after release. They talked about the problems they anticipated when they returned home and how they hoped to balance their resolutions with their reputations and obligations. Time-out in juvenile detention may offer nurses the opportunity to capitalize on the potential readiness of detained adolescents to make resolution decisions regarding risky behav-iors. Findings from a similar study conducted with 20 detained adolescent women were reported elsewhere. Adolescents in juvenile detention represent a vulnerable population that i...|$|R
40|$|<b>Substance</b> <b>use</b> {{disorders}} {{create an}} enormous burden of medical, behavioral, {{and social problems}} and pose a major and costly public health challenge. Despite the high prevalence of <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> and its consequences, physicians often do not recognize these condi-tions and, as a result, provide inadequate patient care. At {{the center of this}} failure is insufficient training for physicians <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders. To address this deficit, the Betty Ford Institute convened a meet-ing of experts who developed the following 5 recommendations focused on improving training in substance abuse in primary care residency programs in internal medicine and family medicine: 1) in-tegrating substance abuse competencies into training, 2) assigning substance abuse teaching the same priority as teaching about other chronic diseases, 3) enhancing faculty development, 4) creating addiction medicine divisions or programs in academic medical cen-ters, and 5) making substance abuse screening and management routine care in new models of primary care practice. This enhanced primary care residency training should represent a major step for-ward in improving patient care. Ann Intern Med. 2011; 154 : 56 - 59. www. annals. or...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol is {{implicated in}} over 60 {{diseases}} and injuries {{and accounted for}} 6. 2 per cent of all male deaths globally in 2004 (WHO, 2011). Alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse causes significant individual, family and social harms at all age levels and across all socioeconomic groups. These may result from intoxication (e. g., overdose, vulnerability to physical injury/trauma or death, consequences of impulsive behaviour, aggression and driving under the influence) and longer-term consequences (e. g., alcohol or drug-related brain injury, cardiovascular and liver diseases, blood borne viruses e. g., Chikritzhs et al., 2003, Roxburgh et al., 2013). Mental health problems may be triggered or exacerbated, and family breakdown, poor self-esteem, legal issues and lack of community engagement may also be evident. Despite the prevalence of <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders and evident consequences for the individual, family and wider community, {{it would seem that}} health professionals, including psychologists, are reluctant to ask <b>about</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R
40|$|BackgroundWhile {{researchers}} have identified {{factors that contribute}} to youth violence, less is known about the details of violent incidents. In addition, <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> has been linked to youth violence; however, little is known <b>about</b> actual <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> on days in which violence occurs. ObjectiveThis study examined reasons for peer violence and the association between <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> and violence using daily calendar-based analyses among at-risk urban youth.

40|$|BACKGROUND - This paper {{provides}} a characterisation {{of a national}} sample of intimate partner violence (IPV) victim shelter residents. The study also examines whether perpetrator <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> contributed to physical IPV in 2 subsamples: 1) Norwegian victims and perpetrators, and 2) immigrant victims and perpetrators. METHODS - A national sample (N= 1363) of women at IPV shelters in Norway in 2011. RESULTS - The majority (62. 2 %) of the women had immigrant background, and social security {{was the most common}} employment/income status (42. 6 %). A combination of psychological and physical IPV was most frequently reported (56. 1 %). Perpetrator <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> was common in the Norwegian sample (57. 5 %). while many in the immigrant sample (47. 1 %) were unsure <b>about</b> perpetrator <b>substance</b> <b>use.</b> Perpetrator <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> was associated with physical IPV in both subsamples. CONCLUSION - Immigrant IPV victims are overrepresented in the shelter population, as are women on social security. While <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> is associated with physical IPV among Norwegians and immigrants, the association is more obvious in the Norwegian sample. The high rates of immigrant women stating they are unsure <b>about</b> perpetrator <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> underscore the importance that future studies address this question in a culturally sensitive matter...|$|R
