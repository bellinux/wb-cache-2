5|$|Continental Freemasonry {{has no such}} problems. Le Droit <b>Humain</b> enjoys fraternal {{relations}} with the Grand Orient de France, the Grande Loge féminine de France, and the Grande Loge de France. The Grand Orient de France, in addition to recognising women's masonry, decided in 2010 {{that there was no}} reason that its lodges should not be able to initiate women, thus adding another strand to international co-masonry.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resolved}} at {{the outset}} to adopt the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite as their ritual, the new Grand Lodge found itself with only the three craft degrees, and aspiring to a 33-degree system. Male masons were sent into other jurisdictions to acquire the necessary ritual. In 1899, ten masons in the Droit <b>Humain</b> received the 33rd degree, allowing them to form a Supreme Council. Lodges had opened in Paris, Blois, Lyon, Rouen, and Zürich. By 1914, the movement had spread to Britain, the Far East, the United States, Belgium, and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|On 14 January 1882, Maria Deraismes was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry in Loge Libre Penseurs (Freethinkers Lodge), in Le Pecq, just outside Paris. Deraismes was a well known writer and campaigner for democracy, women's rights, and {{the separation of}} church and state. Her lodge, on 9 January, had seceded from la Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise in order to initiate her. She then resigned, to enable her lodge to rejoin their previous jurisdiction. She did, however, persist in her efforts to legitimately become a mason, with the assistance of Doctor Georges Martin, a fellow campaigner for women's rights, and a Freemason. After a decade of trying they started to form their own lodge, and between 1 June 1892 and 4 March 1893, assembled 16 women who wished to become masons. They were initiated as Apprentices on 14 March 1893, Companions on 24 March, and Master Masons on 1 April. This done, on 4 April the now mixed lodge of male and female masons proceeded to elect its officers and constitute itself as La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France, Le Droit <b>Humain,</b> soon to become l’Ordre Maçonnique Mixte International Le Droit <b>Humain.</b> This would flourish as international co-masonry, which Deraismes never lived to see. She died the following February.|$|E

25|$|In 1941, Teilhard {{submitted}} to Rome {{his most important}} work, Le Phénomène <b>Humain.</b> By 1947, Rome forbade him to write or teach on philosophical subjects. The next year, Teilhard was called to Rome by the Superior General of the Jesuits who hoped to acquire permission from the Holy See for the publication of Le Phénomène <b>Humain.</b> However, the prohibition to publish it that was previously issued in 1944, was again renewed. Teilhard was also forbidden to take a teaching post in the Collège de France. Another setback came in 1949, when permission to publish Le Groupe Zoologique was refused.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, 1893, Deraismes, Martin {{and several}} other male Freemasons founded La Respectable Loge, Le Droit <b>Humain,</b> Maçonnerie Mixte (Worshipful Lodge, Human Rights, Co-Masonry) in Paris. They initiated, passed and raised sixteen {{prominent}} French women.|$|E
25|$|From 1893 to 1899, France saw the {{formation}} of the first mixed-sex mainstream Masonic obedience, which rapidly became international - the Ordre mixte international du Droit <b>humain,</b> which also adopted the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.|$|E
25|$|The Marquis de Condorcet had {{published}} his utopian vision of social progress and the perfectibility of man Esquisse d'un Tableau Historique des Progres de l'Espirit <b>Humain</b> (The Future Progress of the Human Mind) in 1794. Malthus' remarks on Condorcet's work spans chapters 8 and 9.|$|E
25|$|The first lodge of Le Droit <b>Humain</b> {{was founded}} in Brussels in 1911, after {{a long period of}} {{incubation}} during which eminent members of the Maçonnerie Mixte Ecossaise de France worked patiently to convince the Progressives to accept a masonry working in a world without frontiers.|$|E
25|$|The {{humanitarian}} {{ideal of}} the new Masonic order struck him as absolutely compatible with the Socialist ideas of Louis Goaziou. Muzzarelli contacted Goaziou in 1903 {{with the idea of}} creating in Charleroi (Pennsylvania) either a Lodge under the Grand Orient. He did not inform Goaziou of the option to form the Lodge of under Le Droit <b>Humain,</b> into which their wives also could be admitted, until he arrived in Charleroi in October 1903 to institute the Lodge. The charter members decided they would found the Lodge under Le Droit <b>Humain.</b> The first three degrees were conferred on them by Antoine Muzarelli, and over two days, October 18 and 19, 1903, the first Co-masonic American lodge, Alpha No 301 was born in Charleroi, Pennsylvania. Louis Goaziou became the first Worshipful Master.|$|E
25|$|Certain Grand Lodges of Co-Freemasonry, {{those under}} Le Droit <b>Humain,</b> also {{follow the lead}} of the Grand Orient de France in {{removing}} references to the Supreme Being from their rituals and initiating atheists; this is a further point of separation from typical Masonic Lodges which hold belief in a Supreme Being to be a Landmark requirement.|$|E
25|$|The International Order of Mixed Freemasonry Le Droit <b>Humain</b> {{was founded}} in France {{in the late nineteenth}} century, during a period of strong feminist and women's {{suffrage}} campaigning. It was the first Co-Masonic Order, and also the first truly international Masonic Order. Today it has members from over 60 countries worldwide and is organized into 23 federations and 6 juridictions.|$|E
25|$|The first News-sheet of co-masonry {{appeared}} in January, 1895. It contained {{an article by}} Georges Martin enunciating the principles of LE DROIT <b>HUMAIN</b> as well as various rules regarding to membership lists, subscription fees (11 francs for an initiation, and 20–31 francs for an increase of wages), the price of diplomas (5 francs), the annual subscription rate (18 francs) {{and the price of}} subscription to the Newssheet (2 francs per year).|$|E
25|$|The first worshipful master was brother Reelfs—a {{remarkable}} personality—who {{was born}} in Amsterdam in 1888, and {{who had lived in}} Switzerland since 1906, after completed his studies in The Hague; multi-lingual, speaking Dutch, English, German, Greek and French, he became Professor of Literature at Madame Rollier's school (she would later on be a pioneer of Le Droit <b>Humain</b> in Switzerland, and became worshipful master of the lodge in Lausanne).|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{following}} growing {{concerns over}} erosions to the Annie Besant Concord {{by the administration}} in Paris, many member lodges of the Eastern Federation resigned from Le Droit <b>Humain,</b> severing all ties, and reconstituted new governing bodies. Lodges in India, New Zealand, parts of the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Spain and France reformed as the Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry; lodges in the UK reformed as the Grand Lodge of Freemasonry for Men and Women.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the main}} {{sequencing}} {{phase of the}} HGP has been completed, studies of DNA variation continue in the International HapMap Project, whose goal is to identify patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) groups (called haplotypes, or “haps”). The DNA samples for the HapMap came from a total of 270 individuals: Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria; Japanese people in Tokyo; Han Chinese in Beijing; and the French Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme <b>Humain</b> (CEPH) resource, which consisted of residents of the United States having ancestry from Western and Northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Other lodges, {{including}} those in Australia and South Africa and United States lodges, opted to remain affiliated with the Supreme Council of the International Order of Freemasonry for Men and Women, Le Droit <b>Humain,</b> and continue to exist as the British, Australian, and American Federations of the order, governed by the Representative of the Supreme Council, known as the Most Puissant Grand Commander, who holds the 33rd and highest degree of the Order. However some Lodges have now broken away and have aligned themselves with the new Orders maintaining also the landmark belief in a supreme being.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 Besant met Helena Blavatsky {{and over}} the next few years her {{interest}} in theosophy grew while her interest in secular matters waned. She became a member of the Theosophical Society and a prominent lecturer on the subject. As part of her theosophy-related work, she travelled to India. In 1898 she helped establish the Central Hindu College and in 1922 she helped establish the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board in Mumbai, India. In 1902, she established the first overseas Lodge of the International Order of Co-Freemasonry, Le Droit <b>Humain.</b> Over the next few years she established lodges in many parts of the British Empire. In 1907 she became president of the Theosophical Society, whose international headquarters were in Adyar, Madras, (Chennai).|$|E
25|$|In 1926–27, after {{a missed}} {{campaign}} in Gansu, Teilhard traveled in the Sang-Kan-Ho valley near Kalgan (Zhangjiakou) {{and made a}} tour in Eastern Mongolia. He wrote Le Milieu Divin (The Divine Milieu). Teilhard prepared the first pages of his main work Le Phénomène <b>Humain</b> (The Phenomenon of Man). The Holy See refused the Imprimatur for Le Milieu Divin in 1927. He joined the ongoing excavations of the Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian as an advisor in 1926 and continued in the role for the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Geological Survey of China following its founding in 1928. Teilhard resided in Manchuria with Emile Licent, then stayed in Western Shansi (Shanxi) and northern Shensi (Shaanxi) with the Chinese paleontologist C. C. Young and with Davidson Black, Chairman of the Geological Survey of China.|$|E
25|$|Born in Brittany, France in 1864, he {{emigrated to}} the USA in 1881 where {{he worked in the}} coal mines of Houtsdale, Pennsylvania. Three years later he married Marie Bourgeois, born in Namur in 1866. Goaziou wanted to improve the appalling working {{conditions}} of miners and set up, in 1866, the Association of United Miners, as well as two Associations for mutual help, whose aims he defended in a weekly French speaking magazine. Through this he attracted the attention of a professor of French at Columbia University in New York, Antoine Muzarelli, founding member of the New York Lodge La'Atlantide laboring under the Grand Orient de France. It was Muzzarelli who contacted Le Droit Humain's then Grand Master and Co-Founder George Martin, offering to found Lodges in North American for Le Droit <b>Humain.</b> In this way, Muzzarelli became the founder of Co-Freemasonry in North America.|$|E
25|$|When the 1914-1918 war ended, {{operative}} work {{started by}} Louis Goaziou recommenced. Headquarters in Larkspur Colorado {{was established in}} 1916. Within a few years, the mortgage of the property was paid off. The administrative building in Larkspur was built between 1921–1924 in order to replace the first building, which had become too small. In 1922 the potash mines in Colorado went bankrupt and this led to about 100 Italian members of Le Droit <b>Humain</b> losing their jobs. Despite their real interest for the building of Larkspur, many of these miners felt they had {{no option but to}} leave Masonry. In addition to these departures, an economic downturn have taken hold in North American. It was no longer possible, through lack of funds, to realize the initial project to construct, next door to the administrative offices at Larkspur, an orphanage and a home for the elderly. However Louis Goaziou's hard effort to achieve these goals were not successful. With the coming of the Great Depression, membership went into steep decline, which did not recover until after World War II, in the time of his successor, Edith Armour.|$|E
