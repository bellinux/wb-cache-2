5000|$|... 2004 - The <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> 2.00 of {{the release}} 4.7 {{contains}} additional submodules that {{are connected to the}} core components of the LES. The submodule [...] "Direct Store Delivery Backend" [...] supports direct deliveries to the subsidiary branch offices carried out by the manufacturer and is therefore a supplement to the transport component (LE-TRA).|$|E
5000|$|... 2002 - With {{the release}} 4.7, the <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> 1.10 is {{implemented}} in the LES. Task and Resource Management (TRM) is a very controversial function. It was primarily designed to enable the mapping of multi-stage movements. However, it connects itself below the transfer order logic using the system document [...] "Task" [...] and unnecessarily creates another system level for the processing of warehouse movements.|$|E

Private partnerships with surrounding businesses in the community lead to the then new addition to taking on a different appearance in terms of station design {{from the rest of}} the Expo Line. This <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> the Expo Line's current eastbound terminus, King George Station.|$|E
50|$|On 19 September 2010, Hamšík scored Napoli's {{first goal}} {{as they came}} back from a goal down to defeat Sampdoria 2-1 in Genoa. On 23 September, Hamšík signed a three-year {{contract}} <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> to last until June 2015. Three days later, Hamšík scored his second goal of the new season with an 81st-minute penalty to earn Napoli a 4-1 comeback win away to newly promoted Cesena. On 30 January 2011, Hamšík scored a well taken effort as Napoli hammered Sampdoria 4-0.|$|E
50|$|Planning for the U10 {{was officially}} {{removed from the}} Berlin {{transport}} master plan in 2003 (Measures 2015), {{and it is no}} longer considered part of the public transport network master plan through at least 2030. The 1994 version of the line remains part of Berlin's Land-use policy, and construction must accommodate the eventuality of such a line. For example, the station under construction at Berliner Rathaus for the U5 line <b>extension</b> (<b>set</b> to open 2019) includes a lower tunnel for the proposed U10.|$|E

50|$|The 2016 <b>extension</b> (<b>set</b> {{to expire}} itself in September 2017) left out a {{provision}} pushed by Republican House leadership, including House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA). The provision would have moved authority over {{air traffic control}} from the FAA to a non-profit corporation, as many other nations, such as Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom have done. Shuster's bill, the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act, expired in the House {{at the end of}} the 114th Congress.|$|E

He started his first League Two match {{of the season}} with Torquay, at home to Burton Albion. Despite conceding two goals, he received the man of the match award. The following season, he helped the team set a new club record of 20 clean sheets. On 16 February 2012, Olejnik signed a contract <b>extension,</b> <b>set</b> to keep him at the club until 2014.|$|E
50|$|A SWAR {{architecture}} is one which includes instructions explicitly intended to perform parallel operations across data that {{is stored in}} the independent subwords or fields of a register. A SWAR-capable {{architecture is}} one which includes a set of instructions that is sufficient to allow data stored in these fields to be treated independently even though the architecture does not include instructions that are explicitly intended for that purpose. An early example of a SWAR architecture was the Intel Pentium with MMX, which implemented the MMX <b>extension</b> <b>set.</b> The Intel Pentium, by contrast, did not include such instructions, but could still act as a SWAR architecture through careful hand-coding or compiler techniques.|$|E

50|$|Control Strip modules {{were also}} {{available}} from many third parties. For example, Conflict Catcher included a Control Strip module to switch <b>extension</b> <b>sets,</b> while DAVE used one to toggle SMB/NetBIOS networking. Some novelty modules even consisted of calculators, calendars and games. Like the System Trays of other OSs, this was often abused to insert a flotsam module that merely launched and quit a given application.|$|R
50|$|The west {{elevation}} of the southwest <b>extension,</b> <b>set</b> back from the west wing, is of brick laid in English bond. A low plinth {{at the base of}} the wall is capped by moulded stone. A doorway, at the south end of the elevation leads to a lower landing of the main staircase inside the house. The door has four glazed panes arranged in two rows set above the lock rail; below the rail are two moulded panels. The doorway has been inserted into the brickwork causing some rebuild close to the base of the north jamb. A bell pull remains in situ to the north of the door.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{individuals}} {{continue to}} use a long, catheter-like tube, while others use a small [...] "button" [...] with a detachable <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> for feedings. Most G-tubes can be changed easily at home. Gastric feeding tubes are suitable for long-term use, though they sometimes {{need to be replaced}} if used long term. The G-tube can be useful where there is difficulty with swallowing because of neurologic or anatomic disorders (stroke, esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, radiotherapy for head and neck cancer), and to avoid the risk of aspiration pneumonia. However, in patients with advanced dementia or adult failure to thrive it does not decrease the risk of pneumonia. Dementia patients may attempt to remove the PEG, which causes complications.|$|E
50|$|The Low House {{stands in}} a small {{residential}} area east of Norfolk's village center, down a private lane extending south from Laurel Way <b>Extension.</b> <b>Set</b> on an expansive landscaped property, it is a sprawling 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with Georgian Revival features. Its main portion has two gable-roofed sections set at right angles, joined by an angled porch section to the northeast and a two-story three-by-three section to the southwest, which give the building a roughly rectangular shape. The ground level openings of the porch area have a signature Taylor elements, segmented-arch tops. The northeast angled section has an eyebrow dormer in the roof, and has the main entrance under a two-story portico supported by slender columns. The property also includes a period chauffeur's house.|$|E

5000|$|While his {{challenge}} to the legitimacy of Turco-Egyptian rule, and the Sublime Porte by <b>extension,</b> <b>set</b> many of the religious elite against him, some of his radical changes to Islamic doctrine and practice alienated other Muslim scholars, both Sudanese and foreign. [...] In particular, the Mahdi abolished the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (Arabic: Mahdahib, مذاهب), rejected all authoritative texts {{in the history of}} tafsir or Qur'anic exegesis, changed the Shahada, or profession of faith, to include the phrase, [...] "Muhammad al-Mahdi is the Khalifa of the Prophet of God," [...] and revised the five pillars of Islam by replacing the Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca with the obligation to undertake jihad, and adding a sixth pillar, which was belief in the Mahdiyya.|$|E
5000|$|Opposition groups, {{including}} various {{community groups}} and local governments, cited {{environmental issues and}} the cost of extending I-69. In some instances, opponents of the Southern Indiana Toll Road have resorted to extreme democratic actions to protest the I-69 extension, including petition signing by more than 144,000 Hoosiers along the proposed I-69 corridor and mass mailings of opposition to Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Other acts of protest included the vandalizing of the Indiana State Capitol by protesters who spray-painted [...] "I-69 is the enemy" [...] and [...] "No I-69" [...] {{on the side of the}} limestone building. In 2005, environmental extremists opposed to the <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> fire to I-69 project offices near Bloomington. In 2007, a group performed a mock eviction of the I-69 project office in Oakland City.|$|E
50|$|FrontPage used {{to require}} a set of {{server-side}} plugins originally known as IIS Extensions. The <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> was significantly enhanced for Microsoft inclusion of FrontPage into the Microsoft Office line-up with Office 97 and subsequently renamed FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE). Both sets of extensions needed to be installed on the target web server for its content and publishing features to work. Microsoft offered both Windows and Unix-based versions of FPSE. FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions worked with earlier versions of FrontPage as well. FPSE 2002 was the last released version which also works with FrontPage 2003 and was later updated for IIS 6.0 as well. However, with FrontPage 2003, Microsoft began moving away from proprietary Server Extensions to standard protocols like FTP and WebDAV for remote web publishing and authoring. FrontPage 2003 {{can also be used}} with Windows SharePoint Services.|$|E
50|$|On May 15, Bay Area Economics, an {{independent}} consultant {{hired by the}} city in 2009 to conduct a streetcar economic impact study, reported the proposed second phase could generate 1.1 {{million square feet of}} new development for the city by 2035, and nearly $2.4 million in new property taxes. On May 28, the Charlotte city council voted 7-4 to build the Phase 2 <b>extension,</b> <b>setting</b> aside $63 million for the purpose; the line will run from Sunnyside Avenue to French Street.|$|R
50|$|SET allowed {{parties to}} {{identify}} themselves {{to each other and}} exchange information securely. Binding of identities was based on X.509 certificates with several <b>extensions.</b> <b>SET</b> used a cryptographic blinding algorithm that, in effect, would have let merchants substitute a certificate for a user's credit-card number. If SET were used, the merchant itself would never have had to know the credit-card numbers being sent from the buyer, which would have provided verified good payment but protected customers and credit companies from fraud.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent {{performance}} improvements {{have tended}} toward making addition rather than profound change, such as adding the Advanced Vector <b>Extensions</b> instruction <b>set</b> <b>extensions</b> to Sandy Bridge, first released on 32 nm in January 2011. Time has also brought improved support for virtualization and {{a trend toward}} higher levels of system integration and management functionality through the ongoing evolution of facilities such as Intel Active Management Technology.|$|R
50|$|The west wing, {{probably}} {{built in}} 1919, is high set with play {{space and a}} tuckshop under the building. The upper floor originally contained three separate classrooms but has been modified to house the staff room in one original classroom space, with the library occupying two classrooms with the dividing wall removed. Large bays of casement windows to each end wall remain, with the top bay of windows set inwards at an angle. Window hoods with timber brackets and lattice panels protect these windows. Access to the classrooms is provided by double timber doors with fanlights above. A separate brick office, originally for the principal, is accessed from the verandah of this wing. It is a gable roofed <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> at 90 degrees to the building with a single double-hung window.A brick toilet block stands {{to the east of}} the buildings. It is constructed of face brick with a hip roof and high-level louvred windows. Recent school buildings have been set well back from the early buildings and do not intrude on the setting.|$|E
50|$|The current {{version of}} IEC 62448 is an {{umbrella}} standard that contains as appendices two concrete formats, XMDF of Sharp and BBeB of Sony. However, BBeB has been discontinued by Sony and the version of XMDF {{that is in the}} specification is out of date. The IEC TA10 group is discussing the next steps, and has invited the IDPF organization which has standardized EPUB to be a liaison. It is possible that the {{current version of}} EPUB and/or the forthcoming EPUB3 revision may be added to IEC 62448. Meanwhile, a number of Japanese companies have proposed that IEC standardize a proposed new Japanese-centric file format that is expected to unify DotBook of Voyager Japan and XMDF of Sharp. This new format has not been publicly disclosed as of November 2010 but it is supposed to cover basic representations for the Japanese language. Technically speaking, this revision is supposed to provide a Japanese minimum set, a Japanese <b>extension</b> <b>set,</b> and a stylesheet language. These issues were discussed in the TC100 meeting held in October 2010 but no decisions were taken besides offering the liaison status to IDPF.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{graphics}} were re-positioned, SmackDown {{continued to use}} a variation of {{the graphics}} package that had been in use since its first HD broadcast in January 2008, until the show moved to Thursday nights on January 15, 2015, when an all-new graphics package (now optimized for the 16:9 format) and intro video were introduced along with a revised SmackDown logo. On March 26, 2015, WWE added a small LED board to {{the left side of the}} ring on SmackDown, similar to Raw. On the September 14, 2015 season premiere of Raw, the middle rope was colored gold. Throughout the month of October 2015, the WWE broadcast table, entrance ramp, and ring skirts were co-branded with Susan G. Komen for the cure of breast cancer. Also, the middle ring rope was pink to promote the fight against breast cancer. Following the brand split in 2016, the ropes return to its original blue color as well as debuting a new set. The post brand <b>extension</b> <b>set</b> was almost identically to the TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs set from 2009-2013 and caused some negative feedback among online fans for re-using an old stage design. A month after the new set debut, a more distinctive and elaborate stage was created for SmackDown. The current stage used is a new design with multiple LED side panels on each side with a titan-tron in a semi circle in the center. The new set also introduced LED floor panels on the entrance ramp. Feedback was more positive for this set design.|$|E
