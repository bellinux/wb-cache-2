In the health sector, this incongruity is exacerbated by a traditional bio-medical approach to women's issues. In this paper, we ask whether gender mainstreaming can be made to work in the health sectors of developing countries where these challenges, as well as women's poor health status, are further complicated by a raft of local traditional, cultural, political and socioeconomic barriers. To answer these questions, we present a case study of Papua New Guinea (PNG), one of the world's most disadvantaged and politically challenging countries. We review data on women's health in PNG and analyse PNG's aspirational and actual performance on gender mainstreaming, looking at: international commitments; political will and capacity; national policies and programmes; and the women's movement along with civil society's participation. We find numerous paradoxes between the aims of gender mainstreaming and the necessary conditions for its success. 14 page(s...|$|R

Based on these findings, we propose that throughput accounting theory should be modified – variability in some situations and with low throughput products is the main factor for higher profitability. throughput accounting; stochastic processes; system dynamics; simulation; cycle times; work-in-process; WIP; low throughput; variability; manufacturing. ...|$|R
