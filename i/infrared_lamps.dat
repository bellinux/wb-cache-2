The science payload of a radar and a radiometer utilizes a shared rotating six-meter antenna {{to provide a}} global map of the Earth's soil moisture content and its freeze/thaw state on a global, high-resolution scale in this three-year mission.

An <b>infrared</b> <b>lamp</b> array was designed and used in the thermal balance test to replicate solar heating on the solar array and sunlit side of the spacecraft that would normally be seen in orbit. The design, implementation, and operation of an <b>infrared</b> <b>lamp</b> array used for this nineteen-day system thermal test are described in this paper. Instrumental to the smooth operation of this lamp array was a characterization test performed in the same chamber two months prior to the observatory test to provide insight into its array operation and flux uniformity. This knowledge was used to identify the lamp array power settings that would provide the worst case predicted on-orbit fluxes during eclipse, cold, and hot cases. It also showed the lamp array variation when adjustments in flux were needed. Calorimeters calibrated prior to testing determined a relationship between calorimeter temperature and lamp array flux. This allowed the team to adjust the lamp output for the desired absorbed flux on the solar array. Flux levels were within 10 % of the desired value {{at the center of the}} solar array with an ability to maintain these levels within 5 % during steady state cases. All tests demonstrated the <b>infrared</b> <b>lamp</b> array functionality and furthered lamp array understanding for modeling purposes.

50|$|IR {{radiation}} is more useful than the visible radiation for heating our body, because we absorb most of it, {{compared to a}} strong reflection of visible light. Penetration depth of infrared radiation in our skin is dependent of wavelength.
