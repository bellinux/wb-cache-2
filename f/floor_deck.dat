50|$|As of February 2015, Stony Creek Brewery {{opened its}} first {{facility}} at 5 Indian Neck Avenue on the Branford River in Branford, Connecticut. Their $20 Million Indian Neck facility took {{four years of}} planning and 10 months of construction to complete construction, but it finally opened in February 2015. The Brewery's 30,000 square feet makes it the second largest brewing facility and taproom in Connecticut, trailing only Two Roads Brewing Company in Stratford, Connecticut. There is a 2,500 square foot tasting room with 23-ounce glass mugs {{hanging on the wall}} behind the bar as part of the brewery’s Mug Club. As of June 13, 2015 the Mug Club had more that 250 members. The club is a way of thanking devoted customers by giving them an opportunity to, “have their own little piece of the Creek,” Crowley Jr. said. The Stony Creek Brewery also boasts two outdoor decks, one on the first floor outside the Tap Room, and the other by the celebration room on the second floor, both overlooking the Branford River. The first floor back deck is complete with Adirondack chairs and tables while the second <b>floor</b> <b>deck</b> is reserved for those customers looking to rent out the space for gatherings or special occasions. The back deck leads down to a ground level that has more seating, a bocce ball court, custom-designed cornhole boards and fire pits. The front of the building features a 30-foot tall glass wall providing oncoming customers a sneak peek at Stony Creek’s tap room.|$|E
40|$|One of {{analysis}} method {{that used to}} evaluate the construction project planning is value engineering. The purpose of value engineering are cost saving, performance optimization, and the efficiency of the time, but still consider the function, quality, and aesthetic of the project. The main reason for using this analysis method is a systematic and procedural approach in the object evaluation. The value engineering stages are information, creative (speculation), analysis, recommendation (planning or development), and presentation. Value engineering analysis begins by selecting one of the activities that have a higher cost than any other activity, then analysis to determine alternative classification of works or materials with basic and secondary functions according to the requirements in order to obtain a better cost. In this value engineering analysis, steel deck system selected as a replacement for the conventional concrete slab construction. Steel deck system 2 ̆ 7 s product that used in this project is Union <b>Floor</b> <b>Deck</b> W- 1000. Union <b>Floor</b> <b>Deck</b> W- 1000 has double function. There are permanent formwork and positive reinforcement. Steel rebar in tension can be reduced or even could be replaced totally by Union <b>Floor</b> <b>Deck</b> W- 1000. Fast and easy installation for concrete or steel construction generally. It differs from conventional formwork which is to be installed span by span, Union <b>Floor</b> <b>Deck</b> W- 1000 can be used as multiple span for faster installation.

5000|$|The {{largest and}} most well known {{negative}} of interstitial spaces is a high first cost. [...] Adding more floors increases the amount of material used for <b>floor</b> <b>decks,</b> walls, etc. The construction expense becomes much larger when anything is added because it affects many other systems in the building. One main thing that increases {{is the amount of}} façade material necessary to cover the skin of the building. Depending on that material, the cost and time of construction could be largely inflated.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{unfinished}} construction {{in some places}} there are no fragments of the walls and <b>floor</b> <b>decks.</b> Basements flooded building. Construction according to one version stop {{was caused by a}} lack of funding, on the other - the shortcomings of the project (or exploration) - it goes slowly into the ground.

40|$|One of {{alternative}} choice materials of primary structure {{most commonly used}} for high rise building is a steel structure. Advantages of steel structure {{is to have the}} strength, hight durability and high ductility, elastic and easier in workmanship. In addition to steel, concrete is also commonly used in the construction of multi-storey buildings, such as the floor plate. The combination of the material in the construction between steel and concrete structure would make composite structure. The advantages of using composite structure that can reduce weight and height profile steel, increasing the stiffness of floors and can add to the landscape serviceability. The re-design of this building is based on "Planning Procedures Steel Structures for Buildings (SNI 03 - 1729 - 2002) ", "Planning Procedures for Building Earthquake Resistance (SNI 03 - 1726 - 2010) " and Indonesian Loading Regulation for Building 1983.
