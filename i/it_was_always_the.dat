5|$|The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was {{the fifth}} Century (called the proletarii) of the unarmed adjunct class. This Century was the only Century {{composed}} of soldiers who had no property, and since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed {{the organization of the}} army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army {{played an important role in}} the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} {{translating}} Tintin into British English was then commissioned in 1958 by Methuen, Hergé's British publishers. [...] It was a joint operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, {{working closely with}} Hergé to attain an accurate translation as true {{as possible to the}} original work. Due in part to the large amount of language-specific word play (such as punning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus' partial deafness, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> intention not to translate literally, instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right. Despite the free hand Hergé afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Hergé's intentions.|$|E

500|$|Although Anning {{knew more}} about fossils and geology {{than many of the}} wealthy fossilists to whom she sold, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> gentlemen geologists who {{published}} the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found, often neglecting to mention her name. She became resentful of this. Anna Pinney, a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected, wrote: [...] "She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains, and made a great deal of publishing works, of which she furnished the contents, while she derived none of the advantages." [...] Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working-class people in early 19th-century scientific literature. Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman, construction worker, or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector, and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee, which would later form the base for the episode [...] "Dalek". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> intention of the production team for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role Langley was chosen, mostly because of his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. He had auditioned for the role {{on the same day}} as doing publicity for his leaving storyline in Coronation Street. Reacting to his casting Langley, remarked that [...] "I couldn't have asked for a better next role because Doctor Who is another great institution." [...] Langley describes Adam as [...] "a bit nerdy" [...] and states of his character's attraction to Rose that [...] "she's a very pretty girl and Adam hasn't seen any girls for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> {{same sort}} of system with us. We would write {{the nucleus of the}} song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E

500|$|Series {{developer}} Al Gough {{contends that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> producer's intention {{to bring in}} the iconic Lois Lane, they just needed a good reason to do it—Chloe's supposed death at the end of season three appeared to be that reason. Gough explains that, when casting for the role, they looked to Margot Kidder—Lois Lane in the Superman film series—for inspiration. They wanted an actress who was [...] "pretty", [...] "smart", and who came with some [...] "wit". Dozens of actresses auditioned for the role of Lois Lane, {{but it was not until}} a tape from Erica Durance showed up that everyone felt that they had found the right Lois. As executive producer Greg Beeman describes Durance, [...] "She had a toughness about her. She was tough and sexy and direct." [...] Another plus, according to Beeman, was the chemistry between Durance and Tom Welling. Durance came on set that first afternoon and the two hit it off, becoming friends and developing a brother/sister relationship on the set.|$|E
500|$|Ruth Jones {{was cast}} in the central guest role of Nikki. The actress stated that she was both [...] "excited" [...] and [...] "scared" [...] {{to appear in the}} series as it was [...] "a very serious role" [...] and comedy had {{previously}} been her [...] "comfort zone". Robert Pugh was cast as the aged and scarred version of Nikki's son Jonah. Richard Stokes estimated that the actor had to spend between two and {{two and a half hours}} in make-up in addition to a twelve-hour filming day to have prosthetics applied to create the appearance of scarring. Ruth Jones found the prosthetics to be [...] "absolutely fantastic" [...] and [...] "very gruesome". The reveal of Jonah's Scream was initially going to be a wholly alien effect with Pugh just miming on set. However, Pugh was keen to give the scream a go. Everest states that in the final dub the scream was [...] "tweaked" [...] and [...] "layers were added" [...] although stated that the fundamental basis of it was Pugh [...] "screaming his lungs out". Discussing the return of Andy, Stokes stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> plan for the production team to give the character greater focus in an episode due to his [...] "comic value", whilst Eve Myles had joked it was her [...] "personal mission" [...] to get the character back.|$|E
500|$|Scholarly {{attempts}} {{in the early}} 18th century to prove {{a relationship between the}} Finns and the Huns led to the realization of the similarities between the Finnish and Hungarian languages. János Sajnovics's Demonstratio, the first systematic comparative study of Hungarian and the Saami languages, was published in 1770. Three decades later, Sámuel Gyarmathi demonstrated similarities between a larger group of languages that are now known as Uralic languages. However, the majority of Hungarian scholars only gradually adopted Sajnovics's and Gyarmathi's views. In the 1830s, Pál Hunfalvy still wrote that Hungarian had an intermediate position between the Finnish and Turkic languages, but later accepted that Hungarian is closely related to the Mansi and Khanty languages. Hereafter linguistics played a pre-eminent role in the research of the Magyars' prehistory because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> dominant linguistic theory that determined the interpretation of historical and archaeological evidence. Consequently, as historian Nóra Berend writes, Hungarian prehistory is [...] "a tenuous construct based on linguistics, folklore analogies, archaeology, and later written evidence", because there are no certain records of the Magyars before the [...] and the identification of archaeological cultures with peoples is highly debatable. Historian László Kontler identifies [...] "the history of Hungarian origins" [...] as [...] "the history of a community whose genetic composition and cultural character has been changing, but which has assuredly spoken Hungarian or its predecessor language".|$|E

500|$|Adam Mitchell {{joins the}} Doctor and Rose in the episode [...] "Dalek". The {{character}} was first conceived during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> intention for Adam {{to join the}} TARDIS team after Rose developed a liking for him. Contrasting against Rose, Adam was created to show that not everybody is suited to be a companion. Davies stated that he [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} show with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubbed Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". Upon returning Adam home, the Doctor informs him that [...] "I only take the best. I've got Rose". Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog, described Adam as fulfilling a role as [...] "the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions". From episodes nine through thirteen, Rose and the Doctor are joined by the con man Jack Harkness. Jack's appearances were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero. John Barrowman, reflecting on the interrelationships between The Doctor, Jack and Rose, felt that [...] "the subtle sexual chemistry between all three characters... was always in play" [...] with the caveat that [...] "the relationships were by no means driven by desire". SFX magazine also commented on the [...] "intoxicatingly flirtatious dynamic" [...] and compared the trio to [...] "a Buffy-style Scooby gang who can quip in the face of danger". Jack parts from the Ninth Doctor with a kiss which Barrowman felt to be [...] "full of fondess and respect" [...] and both [...] "a significant moment in the annals of the series" [...] and [...] "a moment full of melancholy and loss for the characters".|$|E

[...] EastEnders executive producer Lorraine Newman added: [...] "We're delighted to announce Samantha Womack's return to Albert Square. The Mitchell sisters are a fabulous pairing and it will be an absolute delight to have Ronnie and Roxy back together on screen.
