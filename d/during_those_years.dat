5|$|The {{weakening}} of royal authority {{may also have}} resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards, in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all, probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords.

5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve {{that he had to}} learn more and gain more experience. So when he returned to Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked for about six months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family <b>during</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, but he soon moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E

5|$|The Stanford rugby {{teams of}} 1906 to 1917 {{represented}} Stanford University as the school's only football program <b>during</b> <b>those</b> <b>years,</b> replacing American football with rugby union. The school had played American football from 1892 to 1905, but in 1906, {{concerned with the}} growing levels of violence in football, Stanford and other universities changed to rugby. Stanford played twelve seasons of rugby, during which it played other college teams, club teams from the United States, Canada, and Australia, {{as well as the}} New Zealand national team and Australia national team. Despite the team's success, it became clear that other schools were not adopting rugby in large numbers, and after rival California returned to football in 1915, Stanford faced a limited number of potential opponents; and after a year of playing neither sport officially due to World War I, the school returned to American football in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{next time}} he took arms was in 1623, when his brother Paweł {{received}} a nomination as a rotmistrz of light (cossack) cavalry of the regular army (wojsko kwarciane), and recruited some of his siblings, including Stefan, into his unit. They served under hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski in the campaigns against the Tatars in 1624 (participating {{in the battle of}} Martynów). In 1625 they took part in the quelling of a Cossack Zhmaylo Uprising. He fought later against Gustavus Adolphus (1626–1629) (part of the Polish–Swedish War). His light cavalry was used in reconnaissance, diversion, and raiding the enemy territory. In 1627 Stefan, serving in his brother's chorągiew, was promoted to chorąży. On 6–7 August that year he participated in the battle of Tczew, where Gustavus Adolphus was nearly killed. <b>During</b> <b>those</b> <b>years,</b> he learned much from observing a mastery of military arts, hetman Koniecpolski, who often commanded the Polish army in which he served, and from Poland's Swedish opponents, and earlier from the Cossacks and Tatars they fought.|$|E
5|$|The first {{work that}} Ito {{composed}} after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which he regards as his best work. He attributes this feeling {{both to the}} fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song. He has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though <b>during</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.|$|E
