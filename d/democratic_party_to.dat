However, Davis warned that should the current situation become an issue, she was prepared to return to jail.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the {{sectional}} {{differences that}} eventually {{culminated in the}} Civil War led to a convention {{to be held in}} Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E

40|$|Social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> are {{increasingly}} supportive of European integration. Existing explanations {{view this as}} either a reassertion of social democracy at the supranational level, an adaptation to contemporary political institutions, or {{part of a general}} ideological moderation. This article argues that support for the EU enables social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> proclaim the possibility of social democracy at the supranational level, despite the absence of a substantive social democratic agenda. Thus, European integration enables social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> achieve legitimation by obfuscation through integration.

In May, SBT proposed building a culvert on Digernes as a compromise for a proposal from the Labour Party and the Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> consider other solution, which could have postponed the project several years. Parliament decided on 11 June 1996, with 144 against 20 votes, to build the Triangle Link. The Folgefonna Tunnel was also passed, while the Hardanger Bridge was put aside.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the tariff worked to the Republicans' {{advantage}} in 1888. The legislative revisions {{of the past four}} years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business. Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to James Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.|$|E

Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican who ran for governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter-faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats. Smith was featured in an ad that ran in newspapers across North Carolina and was featured in an Associated Press article. On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States.|$|E

As Speaker, he worked to defeat the Three Strikes Law. Critics have claimed Brown did not do enough to raise the legislature’s ethical standards or to protect the environment.
