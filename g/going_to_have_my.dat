500|$|While Stafford {{was still}} working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, [...] "Some day I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> own record company, and you're going to record for me." [...] She {{subsequently}} became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her {{as a member of}} the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.|$|E

500|$|When the {{platform}} debate {{began in the}} Chicago Coliseum {{on the morning of}} July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he [...] "spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience". According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave [...] "by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction". He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, [...] "the audience might just as well understand that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> say if I stand here until sundown." [...] By the time he had his say, he had [...] "effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate". With Tillman's candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold speech won him the presidential nomination.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, O'Donnell {{partnered with}} the {{publishers}} of McCall's {{to revamp the}} magazine as Rosie's McCall's (or, more commonly, Rosie). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine O. Rosie covered issues including breast cancer, foster care and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that [...] "she has struggled with depression her entire life" [...] and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. [...] "If I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> name and my brand {{on the corner of}} a magazine, it has to be my vision" [...] she told People. Rosie magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie [...] "get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated [...] "I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention." [...] The judge dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive damages.|$|E

(1989) and The Best of Sammy Hagar (1992), unlike Unboxed, were released without Hagar's consent, as his contract with Capitol gave him no control over it.|$|R
