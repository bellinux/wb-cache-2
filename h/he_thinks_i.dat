Regarding his similarity to his character, {{he said he is}} [...] "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe the things that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> also think but I'm able to suppress them." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, {{an all-out}} attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later {{they played a}} longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship. Understanding Janowski's style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski {{unleashed}} his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss). This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses). Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, [...] "Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when <b>he</b> <b>thinks.</b> <b>I</b> am afraid I will not do anything good in this match." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 2, 1906, Saint-Gaudens {{wrote to}} Shaw, enquiring whether a high relief was {{practical}} on coins struck at the Mint. [...] Shaw {{did not immediately}} reply, but instead met with Roosevelt, who wrote {{that there was no}} objection to have the coins, many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated, [...] "as artistic as the Greeks could desire". Roosevelt secured Shaw's support for the redesign, although as the President wrote to Saint-Gaudens, [...] "of course <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> am a crack-brained lunatic on the subject". [...] Shaw wrote to the sculptor on , reproducing a copy of a letter from Roberts which warned, [...] "the judgement of the authority of all countries is that modern coins must be of low relief", but as the President disagreed with Roberts's view, Saint-Gaudens could go ahead with a high-relief design. [...] Numismatic historian Roger W. Burdette commented, [...] "This is also one of those times when the compelling egos of artist and President might have paid greater attention to director Roberts' comments. [...] By continuing with the design in a relief that was not coinable, Saint-Gaudens lost his best chance to explore the limits of artistry on circulation coinage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Searle {{extended}} his inquiries into observer-relative phenomena {{by trying to}} understand social reality. Searle begins by arguing collective intentionality (e.g. [...] "we're going for a walk") is a distinct form of intentionality, not simply reducible to individual intentionality (e.g. [...] "I'm going for a walk with him and I think he thinks he's going for a walk with me and <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> think I'm going for a walk with him and ...").|$|E

'He's {{coming up}} tonight: I wrote to tell him. <b>He</b> little <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> know; <b>he</b> little <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> care. Cunning scoundrel! <b>he</b> don't <b>think</b> that.

6000|$|The tension I was {{suffering}} from {{was so great that}} it was perhaps just as well that Mr. Burns had started on his grievance. He seemed very sore about it and grumbled, [...] "Does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am mad, or what?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Before {{he could}} explain himself, Rufus, {{with the most}} perfect good humour, pulled the old man out of his way. [...] "What's troubling this venerable creature's mind--" [...] he inquired of himself, [...] "does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> don't know my way in?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> may say <b>he</b> was,' {{answered}} the one-eyed man. 'I {{could tell you}} a story about that same uncle, gentlemen, that would rather surprise you.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You're very kind," [...] {{said the}} young man, {{and for the}} third or fourth time he wrung her hand. [...] "It isn't a partnership, of course; but <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> can be of use to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{he knows}} that it is I who insist upon marrying you! I {{explained}} it all to him--how I had asked you. Of course he did not understand. <b>He</b> <b>thinks,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, that it is simply an infatuation." ...|$|E
