His fondness for drawing was so {{apparent}} that his parents supported his artistic training throughout his school days. He started drawing steampunk art long before the term was coined. In 2000 he did the layout and background design for Walt Disney's film Atlantis: The Lost Empire. It was during this period that he developed a fondness for <b>drawing</b> submarines, <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> similar gadgets.

The fictional world is built as a consistent system made of “exposed” bricks that can be easily identified, and this promotes creativity and sharing; it also promotes the imaginary creation by the player (or reader).|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} design and evaluation of GearSketch, a learning environment for the gears domain aimed at students in {{the final years of}} primary school. GearSketch is built around a computational model of the gears domain that represents how <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> chains can be connected to each other and how these connections transmit motion between objects. When working with GearSketch students use a pen-based or touchscreen computer to <b>draw</b> their own <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> chain systems. The learning environment ensures that only valid systems (i. e. systems in which the gears can turn) can be created. Students can explore the behavior of configurations they have drawn by starting a simulation and watching an animation of the <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> chains in motion. GearSketch offers tutorials and practice problems to facilitate learning. The effects of different features of the GearSketch learning environment on learning outcomes were examined in three experimental studies. The first study (N = 74) showed that GearSketch’s ability to interpret and animate students’ drawings led to significantly improved learning outcomes compared to a learning environment that lacked these features. In the second study (N = 44) the effect of adding learner modeling capabilities to GearSketch, so that it could adaptively select appropriate practice items for individual students was examined. Adaptively selecting practice items did not improve learning outcomes compared to offering a fixed sequence of practice items. The third study (N = 78) examined the effects of encouraging students to use more deliberate reasoning while working on the practice items. The results of this study showed that the guidance that was offered improved students’ performance during practice, but did not affect learning outcomes as measured by a posttest. Additionally, this third study showed that the knowledge about the gears domain of both the guided students and those in a control group was significantly improved by practicing with GearSketch. Together these studies show that a learning environment based on a drawing-based simulation can be effectively used by primary school students to learn about the gears domain, but that modeling and guiding students’ reasoning in this domain is still an open challenge...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the vehicle {{dynamics}} caused by the forces exchanged, through <b>buffers</b> <b>and</b> <b>draw</b> <b>gears,</b> by consecutive vehicles on a curve. The results have been obtained by adding a buffers/draw gears contact model on an existing multibody code, previously developed by the authors. The multibody code manages rigid bodies connected by elastic and rigid constraints; the wheel/rail contact model is three dimensional and employs an elastic constraint among wheel and rail. The wheel/rail contact is managed by means of a numerical model called TOAM (third order approximation method). Numerical tests and experimental validations of the proposed model are here presented, considering a train made by three vehicles, running on an S shaped curve, subjected to parametric compressive forces...|$|R
