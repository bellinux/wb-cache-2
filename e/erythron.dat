Values for plasma iron turnover, marrow iron turnover, and <b>erythron</b> transferrin uptake were derived using two ferrokinetic models.

40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of traditional and optimized programs for integrated treatment and prevention of clinical and laboratory manifestations of hepatic dysfunction in acute biliary pancreatitis in patients with diabetes mellitus by observing the dynamics of markers of cytopathic hypoxia, <b>erythron</b> system and iron metabolism. Materials and methods. The work is based on the analysis of the results of the comprehensive treatment of 122  patients with acute biliary pancreatitis against the background of diabetes mellitus. Laboratory analysis was performed to monitor markers of cytopathic hypoxia, <b>erythron</b> system and iron metabolism depending on the morphological form of acute pancreatitis and the effectiveness of optimized and traditional treatment. Results. The interstitial form of acute biliary pancreatitis in diabetes mellitus is characterized by significant changes in the dynamics of carbonyl groups, the content of arginine and adenosine deamination on the background of physiological fluctuations of the remaining markers of cytopathic hypoxia, and the signs of a distinct functional iron deficiency state in the form of microcytosis and hypochromia were detected. The emergence of pancreatic parenchyma necrosis of different planes, depending on the morphological form of acute biliary pancreatitis, is accompanied by reliable evidence of an absolute iron deficiency state of varying intensity and negative dynamics of indicators of endothelial dysfunction with a separate form. In patients with widespread necrotizing acute biliary pancreatitis, the pathological changes in the systemic metabolism are associated with the catabolism of purine nucleotides — the growth of xanthine and hypoxanthine levels. The stage of decompensation of systemic disorders of homeostasis is observed in patients with subtotal-total forms, when additional increase in the concentrations of enzymes responsible for utilization of the products of purine nucleotide catabolism (xanthine oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase) capable of producing reactive oxygen species, stimulating oxidative stress. Conclusions. The course of acute biliary pancreatitis in patients with diabetes mellitus is accompanied by regular changes in the markers of the syndrome of cytopathic hypoxia, the <b>erythron</b> system and iron metabolism, the severity of these disorders has a direct correlation with the area of morphological changes in the pancreas and the dynamics of markers of liver failure. Using the methods of protocol therapy, you can not carry out preventive correction of existing metabolic disorders that requires the inclusion into the standard conservative treatment for edema form of acute biliary pancreatitis of systemic multifunctional metabolic corrector (Berlithion®) for systemic preventive correction of homeostasis and mechanisms of escalation of hepatic insufficiency manifestations, which, in the presence of necrotic forms, requires additional application of low molecular weight heparins (Zibor®) for the restoration of hemorheological and hemocoalogulative disorders on the systemic and intraorganic levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{elucidate}} the specific features of the biorhythms of iron exchange and erythropoiesis in thermal injury and to define their role in the pathogenesis of anemia. Materials and methods. Seventy-five patients aged 32 to 45 years, who had extensive (up to 50 % of the body’s surface) superficial (second-to-third degree) thermal burns, were examined. A control group comprised 108 donors aged 25 — 35 years. Examinations were made four times daily on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 38, 48, 60 after injury. The authors studied daily changes in the titers of erythropoietin (EP), ferritin (F), serum iron concentrations (SIC), MDA, the populations of the ineffective, normal, and terminal types of <b>erythron</b> kinetics (by the activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PDG)). Results. The progressive reduction in the levels of erythro-cytes and hemoglobin, which most intensive during three weeks after injury has been found to correlate with the rise in the population of microcytes with a low activity of G- 6 -PDG and shorter survival in the presence of significantly elevated concentrations of F, EP, and MDA in the evening. In the morning, the production of a highly active population of macrocytes, the progeny of terminal erythropoiesis is increased, which causes a decrease in SIC and levels its circadian rhythm due to the higher uptake of the trace. Conclusion. The surplus of tissue iron pool due to hyperphagocytosis of short-lived erythrocytes, as well as high EP titer-induced inhibition of apoptosis have been ascertained to be the leading mechanisms of burn-related anemia.

40|$|Ferritin is {{the major}} protein {{responsible}} for the sequestration, storage and release of intracellular iron. The ferritin protein shell exists as heteropolymers of various combinations of two types of subunits, the H-subunit and L-subunit, a phenomenon that {{gives rise to the}} existence of isoferritins. As the roles of the H-subunit and L-subunit differ in the mineralization process, the subunit composition of ferritin will influence the metabolic properties of the assembled ferritin molecules. The primary aim {{of the present study was}} to quantitatively measure the expression of the H-subunit and L-subunit of ferritin in bone marrow macrophages and cells of the <b>erythron</b> in patients with chronic T-helper cell type- 1 immune stimulation. A second aim was to investigate the possible role that the expression of the H-subunit and L-subunit of ferritin may have in the establishment and maintenance of an iron transfer block. The study subjects included 48 patients with chronic diseases from the Department of Internal Medicine, Kalafong Hospital and 10 patients with osteoarthritis, scheduled for hip replacement at the Department of Orthopaedics, Pretoria Academic Hospital. Bone marrow and blood samples were collected from each patient. The expression of the H-subunit and L-subunit of ferritin in bone marrow macrophages and cells of the <b>erythron</b> was quantitatively evaluated by post-embedding immunolocalisation with immunogold transmission electron microscopy.

40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the <b>erythron</b> and hematological reactions in miners {{in relation to the}} length of underground work. Subjects and methods. A prospective study of peripheral blood red cell parameters was conducted in 482 miners with an underground work length of as long as 40 years, who were divided into 3 length groups. Age subgroups were identified from the length groups to define the significance of age-related changes. A control group comprised 30 apparently healthy volunteers who did not work under harmful working conditions. Results and discussion. The miners were found to have the following statistically significant changes in red blood cell parameters in relation to the underground work length: elevated levels of red blood cells and hemoglobin as their adaptation to chronic hypoxia and intoxication in the first 10 years of underground work, which were more pronounced in young people (aged less than 29 years), this results from the accelerated release of red blood cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Thereafter, there is a satisfactory adaptation or resistance phase that makes itself evident in the stabilization of <b>erythron</b> parameters. This process is accompanied by the change in the morphophysiological parameters of red blood cells themselves, which may present as increases in average hemoglobin concentration in the red blood cells and in their average hemoglobin volume. The alteration of cell volume is associated with the longer maturation of red blood cells and their increased hemoglobin volume. Conclusion. Our investigation has established that that the miners with an underground work length of less than 10 years, exposed to intermittent hypoxia and intoxicated with coal-ore dust, show a compensatory rise in red blood cells and hemoglobin levels; those with a length of 10 years or more had exhausted adaptive resources, as shown by the downward trend for red blood cells and hemoglobin, which is compensated for by increases in the volume of red blood cells and their hemoglobin concentration.

40|$|AbstractDiamond Blackfan anemia is a {{red cell}} {{hypoplasia}} that typically presents within {{the first year of}} life. Most cases of Diamond Blackfan anemia are caused by ribosome assembly defects linked to haploinsufficiency for structural proteins of either ribosomal subunit.

Significant challenges remain in linking this nucleolar stress signaling pathway to the clinical features of Diamond Blackfan anemia. Defining aspects of disease presentation may relate to developmental and physiological triggers that work in conjunction with nucleolar stress signaling to heighten the p 53 response in the developing <b>erythron</b> after birth.

In the case of normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values, the fractions of microcytes were shown to be increased in four male and three female subjects. In contrast, MCV values were increased in four male subjects while the fractions of macrocytes did not exceed the reference range. Several causes which may give rise to abnormalities in red blood cell size distribution histograms in subjects treated by haemodialysis are discussed.

40|$|Iron {{overload}} in haemoglobinopathies {{and rare}} anaemias may develop from increased iron absorption secondary to hepcidin suppression, and/or from repeated blood transfusions. While {{the accumulation of}} body iron load from blood transfusion is inevitable and predictable from the variable rates of transfusion in the different conditions, there are some important differences {{in the distribution of}} iron overload and its consequences between these. Transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (TDT) is the best described condition in which transfusional overload occurs. Initially iron loads into macrophages, subsquently hepatocytes, and then the endocrine system including the anterior pituiatry and finally the myocardium. The propensity to extrahepatic iron spread increases with rapid transfusion and with inadequate chelation therapy but there is considerable interpatient and interpopulation variability in this tendency. The conduits though which iron is delivered to tissues is through non transferrin iron species (NTBI) which are taken into liver, endocrine tissues and myocardium through L-type calcium channells and possibly through other channells. Recent work by the MSCIO group 1 suggests that levels of NTBI are determined by three mechanisms: i) increasing with iron overload; ii) increasing with ineffective erythropoieis; iii) and decreasing when level of transferrin iron utilisation is high. In TDT all three mechanisms increase NTBI levels because transferrin iron utilisation is suppressed by hypertransfusion. It is hypothesized that the transfusion regimen and target mean Hb may have a key impact on NTBI levels because high transfusion regimes may suppress the ‘sink’ effect of the <b>erythron</b> though decreased clearance of transferrin iron. In sickle cell disease (SCD) without blood transfusion the anaemia results mainly from haemolysis rather than from ineffective erythropoiesis. 2 Thus {{there is a tendency to}} iron depletion because of urinary iron loss from intrascular haemolysis outweighs any increased iron absortion from hepcidin suppression. These effects result in a low trasferrin saturation and NTBI levels and a low tendency from extrahepatic iron distribution. In rare anaemias that result from low production of red cells such as Diamond Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) there is little or no clearance of transferrin iron by the <b>erythron.</b> This leads to high NTBI and a high tendency to extrahepatic iron distribution in DBA. These differences potentially impact on strategies for monitoring and treatment of iron overload in these different conditions...|$|E

Toward identifying novel regulators of this process, murine splenic erythroblasts at 3 developmental stages were prepared, purified and profiled. Stage-to-stage modulated genes were then functionally categorized, {{with a focus}} on apoptotic factors. In parallel with BCL-X and NIX, death-associated protein kinase- 2 (DAPK 2) was substantially up-modulated during late erythropoiesis. Among hematopoietic lineages, DAPK 2 was expressed predominantly in erythroid cells. In a Gata 1 -IE 3. 9 int-DAPK 2 transgenic mouse model, effects on steady-state reticulocyte and red blood cell (RBC) levels were limited. During hemolytic anemia, however, erythropoiesis was markedly deficient. Ex vivo ana-lyses revealed heightened apoptosis due to DAPK 2 at a Kit−CD 71 highTer 119 − stage, together with a subsequent multifold defect in late-stage Kit−CD 71 highTer 119 + cell formation. In UT 7 epo cells, siRNA knock-down of DAPK 2 enhanced survival due to cytokine withdrawal, and DAPK 2 's phosphorylation and kinase activity also were erythropoietin (EPO) -modulated.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the quantitative {{value of a}} simple model of erythropoiesis, based on the basic assumptions that the red blood cell (RBC) mass determines erythropoietin (Epo) production, which in turn stimulates erythropoietic activity. The RBC mass was quantitated by direct isotopic measurement (RCM), Epo production by serum Epo levels, and erythropoiesis by the ferrokinetic measurement of the <b>erythron</b> transferrin uptake (ETU), the serum transferrin receptor (TfR) level, and the reticulocyte (retic) index, and was completed by an evaluation of overall marrow <b>erythron</b> cellularity. We studied a total of 195 subjects, including 31 normal individuals, 38 patients with polycythemia, and 126 patients with various forms of anemia. Instead of only quantitating Epo and erythropoiesis in absolute terms, we also {{evaluated the}}m {{in relation to the}} degree of anemia or polycythemia, and expressed the results as a ratio of observed values to values predicted from the regression equations between hematocrit (Hct) on the one hand, and Epo, TfR, and ETU on the other, obtained in a carefully selected subpopulation. The slope of the regression of TfR (as well as ETU) versus Hct was very similar to the slope of the regression of Epo versus Hct. Average EPO and TfR (as well as ETU) values predicted from the regression equations were quite comparable to observed values in most groups of subjects, with exceptions predictable from knowledge of the pathophysiology of these hematologic disorders. We identified four major patterns of erythropoiesis, ie, normal, hyperdestruction (with variants of hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis), intrinsic marrow hypoproliferation, and defective Epo production. Dissecting out groups of patients showed much greater heterogeneity than when patients were analyzed by group. This was particularly true {{in the case of a}} hypoproliferative component being combined with hyperdestruction, giving what we called a "mixed disorder of erythropoiesis. " We conclude that the pathophysiology of anemia can be assessed by a simple measurement of Hct, retic index, Epo, and TfR levels, with Epo and TfR being more informative when expressed in relation to the degree of anemia. The model is particularly useful for detecting the presence of multiple mechanisms of anemia in the same patient. However, it has limitations inherent to the relative invalidity of TfR in iron deficiency, the imprecision of a retic count, and the difficulty in distinguishing hemolysis from ineffective erythropoiesis in some patients and in recognizing a component of hyperdestruction in hypoproliferative anemia.

40|$|Virtually all {{cells have}} {{transferrin}} receptors (a transmembrane glycoprotein) on their surface {{but in a}} normal adult, 80 % {{of them are in}} the erythroid marrow. Some of them are lost into the circulation where they can be measured by immuno-assays. A direct and highly significant correlation exists between serum transferrin receptor level and <b>erythron</b> transferrin uptake in humans. The measurement of serum transferrin receptor has wide clinical applications for the quantitation of erythropoiesis. It can be used to study erythropoiesis in situations in which ferrokinetics is not acceptable such as pregnancy. It is particularly useful for serial studies, e. i., for monitoring the recovery of erythropoiesis after stem cell transplantation or after treatment with erythropoietin. Combined with the determination of serum erythropoietin, both evaluated in relation to the degree of anemia, they provide a physiological approach to the diagnosis of anemia. Thus, the simultaneous determination of hematocrit, reticulocytes, serum transferrin receptor and serum erythropoietin has high discriminatory value in distinguishing between a defect in erythroid proliferation, maturation or red cell survival. It is also particularly useful for detecting the presence of multiple mechanisms of anemia in the same patient. Peer reviewe...|$|E
