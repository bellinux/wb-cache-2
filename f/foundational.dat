5|$|In March 2014, SAS {{launched}} its SAS Analytics U initiative to provide free <b>foundational</b> technologies {{and support to}} teachers and students.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>foundational</b> {{work had}} been done on the {{philosophy}} of postanarchism by radical theorists such as Andrew Koch and Todd May, From Bakunin to Lacan introduced a slightly different and more substantive formulation of the theory.|$|E
5|$|For the Beckman company, the DU was one {{of three}} <b>foundational</b> inventions - the pH meter, the DU spectrophotometer, and the helipot {{potentiometer}} - that established the company on a secure financial basis and enabled it to expand.|$|E
5|$|The Conquest of Acadia was a <b>foundational</b> {{moment in}} the history of the Canadian state—it was a {{precursor}} to the British conquests of Louisbourg and Quebec in the middle of the century.|$|E
5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) {{was founded}} on 28 December 1924, when about 75 {{linguists}} met to select officers, ratify a constitution, and present papers {{in order to facilitate}} communication within the field of linguistics. The <b>foundational</b> members included 31 women, most of whom worked as educators rather than as scholars at research institutions. By 1935, half of the female <b>foundational</b> members had left the society—a rate similar to that of male members—largely due to the professionalization of the field of linguistics that disproportionately affected women as most worked outside of academia.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of anekāntavāda {{is one of}} the <b>foundational</b> Jain philosophical concept. The development of anekāntavāda also encouraged the development of the dialectics of syādvāda (conditioned viewpoints) and nayavāda (partial viewpoints).|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} <b>foundational</b> {{work by the}} bomber mafia {{resulted}} in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed by war and experience, helped shape the mission of the new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Also {{like her}} mother, whose Letters from Sweden was <b>foundational</b> {{to the writing}} of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley {{emphasised}} her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains <b>foundational</b> for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|At least 25 {{founders of}} Australian martial art schools (and {{at least one}} in New Zealand) {{received}} their <b>foundational</b> taekwondo training in Rhee Taekwon-Do or are former Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors. Of these ex-members, the highest-ranked was a Rhee Taekwon-Do 6th dan instructor when he left Rhee's school.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Aqdas and The Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá are <b>foundational</b> {{documents}} of the Bahá'í administrative order. Bahá'u'lláh established the elected Universal House of Justice, and `Abdu'l-Bahá established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified {{the relationship between the}} two institutions. In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bahá appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, serving as head of the religion until his death, for 36 years.|$|E
5|$|C. C. Rhee {{claims the}} title 'Father of Australian Taekwondo' and Rhee Taekwon-Do is widely publicised as being Australia's first and biggest taekwondo school. It {{has at least}} 294 {{publicly}} listed dojang (training halls) in Australia (and at least five such dojang in New Zealand), with perhaps around 1,400 dojang in total at its peak. Several Australian martial art school founders received their <b>foundational</b> taekwondo training in Rhee's school.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{influence}} of Vivekananda, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are nowadays considered as the <b>foundational</b> scripture of classical yoga, a status which it only acquired in the 20th century. Before the twentieth century, other works were considered as the most central works, such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Vasistha, while Tantric Yoga and Hatha Yoga prevailed over Ashtanga Yoga.|$|E
5|$|<b>Foundational</b> {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating <b>foundational</b> problems in particular sciences. They also examine {{the implications of}} particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen {{a rise in the}} number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.|$|E
5|$|Marquee Moon was {{released}} to widespread critical acclaim and unexpected commercial {{success in the}} United Kingdom, but sold poorly in the United States. The record has since been viewed by critics {{as one of the}} greatest albums of all time and a <b>foundational</b> record of alternative rock. Television's innovative post-punk instrumentation on Marquee Moon strongly influenced the new wave and indie rock movements of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{helped develop}} the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, a {{statistical}} means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases. He is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and for his <b>foundational</b> work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks (trusses) like those in many bridges.|$|E
5|$|The Sinologist Michael Nylan {{describes}} the I Ching as the best-known Chinese {{book in the}} world. In East Asia, it is a <b>foundational</b> text for the Confucian and Daoist philosophical traditions, while in the West, it {{attracted the attention of}} Enlightenment intellectuals and prominent literary and cultural figures.|$|E
5|$|The project's work {{is carried}} out over the Internet {{by a team of}} volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three <b>foundational</b> documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New {{distributions}} are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based freeze.|$|E
5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, {{but they are not}} absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend <b>foundational</b> documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E
5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of the <b>foundational</b> texts of Jainism.|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert wrote {{much of the}} <b>foundational</b> {{code for}} Maniac Mansion, the {{majority}} of the game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a <b>foundational</b> text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
5|$|Bernoulli's work, {{originally}} published in Latin is divided into four parts. It covers most notably his theory of permutations and combinations; the standard foundations of combinatorics today and subsets of the <b>foundational</b> problems today known as the twelvefold way. It also discusses the motivation and applications of a sequence of numbers {{more closely related to}} number theory than probability; these Bernoulli numbers bear his name today, and are one of his more notable achievements.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{provided}} {{many of the}} <b>foundational</b> {{documents for}} reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E
5|$|Fields {{serve as}} <b>foundational</b> notions in several {{mathematical}} domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|PHC {{receives}} all of {{its funding}} from tuition fees or donations. The college states {{that it does not}} accept any money from the government or any other source that includes terms that supersede the authority of its Board of Trustees or conflict with its <b>foundational</b> statements. PHC adds new facilities and programs only as funds are available. The Home School Legal Defense Association is one of the primary benefactors of the school, and all members of the association receive a $1300 grant if they are accepted as students.|$|E
5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are <b>foundational</b> teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E
5|$|A temple {{dedicated}} to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood {{on the island of}} Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt {{in the course of the}} Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a <b>foundational</b> offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a <b>foundational</b> text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the <b>foundational</b> movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
5|$|In December 1816 Jonathan Jennings, Indiana's first governor, {{nominated}} John Johnson of Vincennes Knox County; James Scott of Charlestown Clark County; and Jesse Holman of Aurora Dearborn County, {{to serve}} as the first panel of judges on the Indiana Supreme Court. Johnson became the Court's first chief justice. When Johnson died in 1817, Jennings named Isaac Blackford to replace him. Blackford became the second chief justice of the Court and was the longest serving justice in the Court's history, serving 36 years, 3 months, and 24 days. Blackford recorded all of the Court's early decisions in a multivolume work titled Blackford's Reports that served for many years as a <b>foundational</b> text on the interpretation of state laws.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on <b>foundational</b> assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the <b>foundational</b> movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|The Shaiva Puranas, {{particularly}} the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the {{various aspects of}} Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider soul within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are the <b>foundational</b> texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, advaita), and that Shiva is the soul, the perfection and truth within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty four monism Agama texts.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a federally-supported {{residential}} school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen. Sir Peregrine Maitland, a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, {{was the best way}} to influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, entitled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada. Referred to as the Bagot Report, it is seen as the <b>foundational</b> document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada.|$|E
