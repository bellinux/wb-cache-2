5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.spinulosa has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E

5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof. Similarly to the main pyramid, the substructure was constructed in a shallow open pit dug into the ground before the pyramid construction started and is therefore located <b>just</b> <b>below</b> ground-level.|$|E

5|$|The {{raw water}} intake (headworks) at Bull Run is <b>just</b> <b>below</b> Dam 2. This is where water is {{diverted}} {{from the river}} for chlorination and then routed into three distribution conduits for delivery to Portland. About 23percent of the watershed's annual runoff is diverted to the city's water supply.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun <b>just</b> <b>below</b> the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months small {{passenger}} ferries travel between Tuckton and Mudeford Spit via the town quay. Another ferry crosses the Stour between Wick and the Quay <b>just</b> <b>below</b> Tuckton Bridge. This ferry was running before the bridge was built in 1882 and was then, the only crossing below Iford. Another ferry service operates across the harbour entrance from Mudeford Sandbank to Mudeford Quay. This ferry was operated by rowing boats until the 1960s; payment being {{at the discretion of}} the passenger.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} {{researchers}} have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position with their heads <b>just</b> <b>below</b> or at the surface. A 2008 study published in Current Biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with {{both sides of the}} brain. It appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to <b>just</b> <b>below</b> the ears.|$|E
5|$|Hedwig Jagiellon, Electress of Brandenburg, who was {{daughter}} of Sigismund I the Old {{and his first}} wife Barbara Zápolya. Her parents planned her marriage to Prince Janusz.

5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), <b>just</b> <b>below</b> Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the City of London School {{moved to}} its present site in {{purpose-built}} facilities in Queen Victoria Street (where it is opposite the College of Arms and <b>just</b> <b>below</b> St Paul's Cathedral) {{on one side}} and facing onto the banks of the River Thames on the other side. It was officially opened in 1987 by HRH The Princess Anne. The Millennium Bridge is next to the school buildings.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the Australian line of {{communications}} in the sector, engineers from the 16th Field Company later constructed a road using a bulldozer that had to haul itself up the ridge via a steel cable that was manhandled {{up to a point}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> the ridge over the course of eight days. A light rail system was also established between Barges' Hill and Pearl Ridge.|$|E

5|$|Like most Proteaceae, T.truncata has fine proteoid {{roots that}} arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil <b>just</b> <b>below</b> the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} <b>just</b> <b>below</b> the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.|$|E
