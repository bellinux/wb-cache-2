5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet <b>edge-to-edge.</b> None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet <b>edge-to-edge,</b> but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles have different sizes, so they are not all congruent to each other.|$|E
5|$|A regular {{tessellation}} is {{a highly}} symmetric, <b>edge-to-edge</b> tiling made up of regular polygons, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an <b>edge-to-edge</b> filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).|$|E
5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet <b>edge-to-edge,</b> but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel <b>edge-to-edge</b> planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an <b>edge-to-edge</b> reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are <b>edge-to-edge,</b> and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E
25|$|Convex regular polygons {{can also}} form plane tilings {{that are not}} <b>edge-to-edge.</b> Such tilings can be {{considered}} <b>edge-to-edge</b> as nonregular polygons with adjacent colinear edges.|$|E
25|$|Numerous children's toys, {{generally}} {{aimed at}} the teen or pre-teen age bracket, allow experimentation with regular polygons and polyhedra. For example, klikko provides sets of plastic triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons that can be joined <b>edge-to-edge</b> in {{a large number of}} different ways. A child playing with such a toy could re-discover the Platonic solids (or the Archimedean solids), especially if given a little guidance from a knowledgeable adult.|$|E
25|$|Biscuits are {{predominantly}} used in joining sheet goods such as plywood, particle board and medium-density fibreboard. They are sometimes used with solid wood, replacing {{mortise and tenon}} joints as they are easier to make and almost as strong. They are also used to align pieces of wood when joined <b>edge-to-edge</b> in making wider panels. It is important {{to use the same}} face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{families}} of isogonal each family having a real-valued parameter determining the overlap between sides of adjacent tiles or the ratio between the edge lengths of different tiles. Two {{of the families}} are generated from shifted square, either progressive or zig-zagging positions. Grünbaum and Shephard call these tilings uniform although it contradicts Coxeter's definition for uniformity which requires <b>edge-to-edge</b> regular polygons. Such isogonal tilings are actually topologically identical to the uniform tilings, with different geometric proportions.|$|E
25|$|Early Minox cameras from Minox A/III to Minox B were {{equipped}} with a four-element, three-group Complan (lens) designed by ex-Leica lens designer Arthur Seibert. The Complan lens has a curved film plane, hence in these cameras the negative must be held in an arc to improve the <b>edge-to-edge</b> sharpness of the image. The Minox enlarger also holds the negative in this same curve. Later models, beginning with late model Minox B, to the current model TLX, using the 15mm f/3.5 four-element, three-group flat-field Minox lens, and the negative was held flat. The advance was attributed by Kasiemeir (Small MINOX Big Pictures 1971 edition) to new rare-earth elements. Note that lens performance between old and new complan/minox lenses was rated by MINOX themselves as identical.|$|E
25|$|All mammals {{except the}} monotremes, the xenarthrans, the pangolins, and the {{cetaceans}} {{have up to}} four distinct types of teeth, with a maximum number for each. These are the incisor (cutting), the canine, the premolar, and the molar (grinding). The incisors occupy {{the front of the}} tooth row in both upper and lower jaws. They are normally flat, chisel-shaped teeth that meet in an <b>edge-to-edge</b> bite. Their function is cutting, slicing, or gnawing food into manageable pieces that fit into the mouth for further chewing. The canines are immediately behind the incisors. In many mammals, the canines are pointed, tusk-shaped teeth, projecting beyond the level of the other teeth. In carnivores, they are primarily offensive weapons for bringing down prey. In other mammals such as some primates, they are used to split open hard surfaced food. The premolars and molars are {{at the back of the}} mouth. Depending on the particular mammal and its diet, these two kinds of teeth prepare pieces of food to be swallowed by grinding, shearing, or crushing. The specialised teeth—incisors, canines, premolars, and molars—are found in the same order in every mammal.|$|E
500|$|The {{sides of}} the polygons are not {{necessarily}} identical {{to the edges of}} the tiles. An <b>edge-to-edge</b> tiling is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an <b>edge-to-edge</b> tiling, the {{sides of the}} polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar [...] "brick wall" [...] tiling is not <b>edge-to-edge</b> because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.|$|E

Echoing technology pundits, Reuters suggested {{that the lack of}} a more radical departure from the iPhone 4 could open new market opportunities for rivals. Analyst C. K. Lu of Gartner believed that Apple no longer had the leading edge and that the 4S would only sell due to brand loyalty, as fans had been expecting an iPhone 5 with a thinner profile, <b>edge-to-edge</b> screen, and stronger features. These same fans had also wanted a cheaper, stripped-down iPhone 4.|$|E
500|$|However, for {{cellular}} automata {{with other}} neighborhoods {{in two or}} more dimensions, the problem of testing reversibility is undecidable, meaning that there cannot exist an algorithm that always halts and always correctly answers the problem. The proof of this fact by [...] {{is based on the}} previously known undecidability of tiling the plane by Wang tiles, sets of square tiles with markings on their edges that constrain which pairs of tiles can fit <b>edge-to-edge.</b> Kari defines a cellular automaton from a set of Wang tiles, such that the automaton fails to be injective if and only if the given tile set can tile the entire plane. His construction uses the von Neumann neighborhood, and cells with large numbers of states. In the same paper, Kari also showed that it is undecidable to test whether a given cellular automaton rule of two or more dimensions is surjective (that is, whether it has a Garden of Eden).|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{lamented the}} loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its {{brightness}} was turned all the way up. CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: [...] "According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the <b>edge-to-edge</b> glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions." [...] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15" [...] and 17" [...] models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized. The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{requirement}} of flag-transitivity is relaxed to one of vertex-transitivity, while the condition that the tiling is <b>edge-to-edge</b> is kept, there are eight additional tilings possible, known as Archimedean, uniform or semiregular tilings. [...] Note {{that there are two}} mirror image (enantiomorphic or chiral) forms of 34.6 (snub hexagonal) tiling, only one of which is shown in the following table. [...] All other regular and semiregular tilings are achiral.|$|E
2500|$|For <b>edge-to-edge</b> Euclidean tilings, the {{internal}} angles of the polygons meeting at a vertex must add to 360 degrees. A regular -gon has internal angle [...] degrees. There are seventeen combinations of regular polygons whose internal angles {{add up to}} 360 degrees, each being {{referred to as a}} species of vertex; in four cases there are two distinct cyclic orders of the polygons, yielding twenty-one types of vertex.|$|E
2500|$|... β-sheets can be open, {{meaning that}} they have two edge strands (as in the flavodoxin fold or the {{immunoglobulin}} fold) or they can be closed β-barrels (such as the TIM barrel). β-Barrels are often described by their stagger or shear. Some open β-sheets are very curved and fold over on themselves (as in the SH3 domain) or form horseshoe shapes (as in the ribonuclease inhibitor). Open β-sheets can assemble face-to-face (such as the β-propeller domain or immunoglobulin fold) or <b>edge-to-edge,</b> forming one big β-sheet.|$|E
2500|$|Following Grünbaum and Shephard (section 1.3), a tiling {{is said to}} be regular if the {{symmetry}} group of the tiling acts transitively on the flags of the tiling, where a flag is a triple consisting of a mutually incident vertex, edge and tile of the tiling. This means that, for every pair of flags, there is a symmetry operation mapping the first flag to the second. This is equivalent to the tiling being an <b>edge-to-edge</b> tiling by congruent regular polygons. [...] There must be six equilateral triangles, four squares or three regular hexagons at a vertex, yielding the three regular tessellations.|$|E
2500|$|For odd n, {{only two}} {{examples}} are known that match Dirac's lower bound conjecture, that is, with [...] One example, by , {{consists of the}} vertices, edge midpoints, and centroid of an equilateral triangle; these seven points determine only three ordinary lines. The configuration in which these three ordinary lines are replaced by a single line cannot be realized in the Euclidean plane, but forms a finite projective space known as the Fano plane. Because of this connection, the Kelly–Moser example has also been called the non-Fano configuration. The other counterexample, due to McKee, consists of two regular pentagons joined <b>edge-to-edge</b> together with {{the midpoint of the}} shared edge and four points on the line at infinity in the projective plane; these 13 points have among them 6 ordinary lines. Modifications of Böröczky's construction lead to sets of odd numbers of points with [...] ordinary lines.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{different}} kind of campaign game that does not use a strategic gameboard per se. One was published in the Designer's Edition called the [...] "Captain's Game". There was also such a campaign published as [...] "Operation Unity", the push by the Galactic Powers to destroy the Andromedan starbase in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud. In this type of campaign there are a number of SFB tactical gameboards connected <b>edge-to-edge</b> a certain number of maps wide. These represent a [...] "border" [...] between two neighboring races/empires. The rules specify an order of battle for each side, and how they are to be deployed on each gamemap. A battle is fought on each map, and the victor advances to the next game map closer to his opponent's home starbase (or planet). Between rounds ships are repaired and replenished as usual. The game ends when one player advances to his opponent's home gameboard and vanquishes the enemy starbase (or if the enemy fleet is destroyed).|$|E
2500|$|Various tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to make hand-knitting easier. [...] Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and [...] "yarntainers". [...] Crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces <b>edge-to-edge.</b> [...] The darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as Swiss darning). The crochet hook is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. [...] Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. [...] For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools {{have been developed}} to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. [...] A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by [...] "point protectors" [...] that cap the tapered ends. [...] Another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.|$|E
