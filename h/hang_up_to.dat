50|$|Physalia is a genus of {{the order}} Siphonophorae, colonies of four {{specialized}} polyps and medusoids that drift {{on the surface of}} the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. Although these organisms look like a single multicellular organism, each specimen is actually a colony of minute organisms called zooids that have to work together for survival. A gas-filled bladder resembling a blue bottle provides buoyancy, and long tentacles of venomous cnidocytes provide a means of capturing prey. A sail on the float, which may be left or right-handed, propels Physalia about the sea, often in groups. These siphonophores sometimes become stranded on beaches, where their toxic nematocysts can remain potent for weeks or months in moist conditions. Both species of this siphonophore resemble a jellyfish in appearance, with their gas-filled float and cluster of polyps beneath, which can <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30 or 165 feet below the surface of the sea.|$|E

It is the sayings or statements, doings, and approvals of the Prophet, meanwhile according to Orientalists, hadis was made by muslim community in the first and second age of Higra.
