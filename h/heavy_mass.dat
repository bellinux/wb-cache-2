500|$|The {{time spent}} {{so far as}} a red supergiant can be {{estimated}} by comparing mass loss rates to the observed circumstellar material, {{as well as the}} abundances of heavy elements at the surface. [...] Estimates range from 20,000 years to a maximum of 140,000 years. [...] Betelgeuse appears to undergo short periods of <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> loss and is a runaway star moving rapidly through space, so comparisons of its current mass loss to the total lost mass are difficult. [...] The surface of Betelgeuse shows enhancement of nitrogen, relatively low levels of carbon, and a high proportion of 13C relative to 12C, all indicative of a star that has experienced the first dredge-up. [...] However the first dredge-up occurs soon after a star reaches the red supergiant phase and so this only means that Betelgeuse has been a red supergiant for at least a few thousand years. [...] The best prediction is that Betelgeuse has already spent around 40,000 years as a red supergiant, having left the main sequence perhaps one million years ago.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} conjectured {{solution}} currently is the seesaw mechanism, where right-handed neutrinos with very large Majorana masses are added. [...] If the right-handed neutrinos are very heavy, they induce {{a very small}} mass for the left-handed neutrinos, which {{is proportional to the}} inverse of the <b>heavy</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
2500|$|If it {{is assumed}} that the neutrinos {{interact}} with the Higgs field with approximately the same strengths as the charged fermions do, the <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> should be close to the GUT scale. Note that, in the Standard Model there is just one fundamental mass scale (which can be taken as the scale of [...] breaking) and all masses (such as the electron or the mass of the Z boson) have to originate from this one.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, Marilla {{lifted her}} candle and looked scrutinizingly at Anne's hair, flowing in <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> down her back. It {{certainly}} {{had a very}} strange appearance.|$|R
25|$|The {{design is}} {{consistent}} with the themes of Brutalist architecture, especially in the <b>heavy</b> <b>massing</b> of concrete on the lower floors, but the 2001 renovation has softened those features.|$|R
60|$|Before {{them was}} a little hollow, filled with small stones, and beyond were some {{shelving}} rocks with large cracks between. Over the shelving rocks grew <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> of vines.|$|R
2500|$|During helium burning, {{carbon and}} oxygen will {{accumulate}} {{in the core}} and <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> loss continues. [...] This eventually leads {{to the development of}} a WC spectrum, although at LMC metallicity a star is expected to spend most of the helium burning phase with a WN spectrum. [...] Towards the end of helium burning, core temperature increase and mass loss cause an increase in both luminosity and temperature, with the spectral type becoming WO. [...] Several hundred thousand years will be spent fusing helium, but the final stages of heavier element burning take no more than a few thousand years. [...] R136a1 will eventually shrink to a little over , with just half a [...] of helium left surrounding the core.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principle}} can {{be shown}} by an early special purpose seismometer. This consisted of a large stationary pendulum, with a stylus on the bottom. [...] As the earth starts to move, the <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of the pendulum has the inertia to stay still in the non-earth frame of reference. [...] The {{result is that the}} stylus scratches a pattern corresponding with the Earth's movement. This type of strong motion seismometer recorded upon a smoked glass (glass with carbon soot). While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local earthquake – such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further re-analysis was performed in the 1980s using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{pause for}} ten minutes, then a <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of men could be seen approaching.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a mysterious}} stillness, too, about {{everything}} around him; and the fogs, which floated in <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> above and below, gave a character of changeful wildness to the scenery.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the need}} to detect atoms {{sputtered}} from the lunar surface as well lighter ENAs, the ESA LENA on the Chandrayaan-1 incorporated a mass spectrometer designed to resolve <b>heavier</b> <b>masses</b> including sodium, potassium, and iron.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{had better}} make {{the women and}} {{children}} fast, sir," [...] suggested the mate, as a <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of spray burst over the bulwarks and drenched them.|$|E
60|$|For a {{time the}} French held their {{position}} well, against the tremendous artillery fire which was maintained upon them. Gradually, however, the Germans pushed their <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> of troops forwards; and the French reserves had already been brought up.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, boy, yet it {{surprises me}} that they succeeded in {{breaking}} into my cache, for {{it was made of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> of stone, many of which required two and three men to lift them, even with the aid of handspikes." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{profusion of}} light-brown hair hung in <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> over his herculean shoulders, and a bushy {{moustache}} and beard {{of the same}} colour covered {{the lower part of}} his deeply browned face, which was handsome and mild, but eminently masculine, in expression.|$|R
60|$|She stood up, smiling graciously, and {{her little}} figure seemed to be diminished still more by the <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of her hair and the long train of her gown.|$|E
60|$|The <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of vapour {{which had}} seemed to {{threaten}} the earth with instant destruction suddenly parted. The red and lurid Sun was visible, but his light and heat were quenched in the still impending waters.|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} scarce uttered when a <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of water fell inboard, almost {{crushing}} down the deck. For some moments {{it seemed as}} if the little vessel were sinking, but she cleared herself, and again rushed onward.|$|E
60|$|From the British {{position}} the <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> of French troops {{could be seen}} moving on the opposite heights {{to get into the}} position assigned to them; for it was scarcely a mile from the crest of one slope to that of the other.|$|R
60|$|Although {{taken by}} surprise, and wholly {{ignorant of the}} {{strength}} of the force opposed to them, the pickets stood their ground, but before the <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> of men clambering up the hill, they could do nothing, and were forced to fall back, contesting every foot.|$|R
60|$|Not {{long were}} the Light Division {{to enjoy the}} {{position}} they had won. Breathless, exhausted, bleeding, they were but a handful; and the Russians, looking down upon them and seeing that they were unsupported, again advanced in <b>heavy</b> <b>masses,</b> and the Light Division fell back.|$|R
60|$|The {{additional}} excitement lent {{strength to}} every arm, {{and as if}} it had been nothing more than a piece of wood the <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> was rolled end over end until it lay on the sand a dozen feet from the excavation.|$|E
60|$|The yawl was staunch {{enough to}} stand up {{under the weight of}} the stream-anchor, and while the Mexican was pulling her to the port bow, Bob rove a tackle on the yard-arm by which to raise the <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of metal.|$|E
60|$|He saw the <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> {{of metal}} as it struck the pavement, and {{instantly}} afterward {{was aware of}} what very few gave heed to {{because of the fact}} that all eyes were fixed upon the building, from whence might naturally be expected another explosion.|$|E
60|$|One is an {{athletic}} middle-aged man, whose clothing is goat-skin, evidently home-made, {{and cut in}} sailor fashion. Magnificent shaggy locks fall in <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> from his head, lip, and chin. Robinson Crusoe himself could not have looked grander or more savage in outward aspect.|$|R
40|$|In this project, the {{eigenvalues}} and {{mode shapes}} of a Bernoulli-Euler beam with concentrated masses, springs and viscous dampers are evaluated by using Laplace transform {{with respect to}} the spatial variable, then the forced vibration responses of the beam are calculated by using modal analysis. The boundary conditions of the beam are assumed as attached by the rotational and translational springs at both ends separately to model general structures. A variety of different parameters for the <b>heavy</b> <b>masses,</b> spring and dampers are considered to investigate the eigenvalues of the system. Finally, the dynamic response of the system is calculated for various parameters of the at tachments. The configuration of a restrained beam with <b>heavy</b> <b>masses,</b> springs and viscous dampers is shown in Fig. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of underground objects {{can be determined}} by measuring the gradient in Earth's gravitational field. It is known that an object with <b>heavier</b> <b>mass</b> “attracts” other objects of a considerably lower value of mass. This force of attraction is explained by understanding the following topics.|$|R
60|$|The early {{resistance}} of the infidel host was comparatively slight.

60|$|For {{a moment}} Jerry was too paralyzed with fear {{to move or}} speak. Then as he {{recovered}} he threw off the snake and rolled away, over Harry {{and close to the}} boggy spot. Harry also turned away, but came up against a <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of brush.|$|E
60|$|The exclamation was {{elicited}} by {{the fall}} of a <b>heavy</b> <b>mass</b> of snow on to the fire, over which the kettle had just begun to boil.

40|$|I briefly {{summarized}} {{some recent}} work which uses {{the techniques of}} effective field theory to make quantum predictions in general relativity. In contrast to conventional expectations, these are in fact well behaved. The leading quantum correction to the interaction of two <b>heavy</b> <b>masses</b> {{is used as a}} specific example...|$|R
