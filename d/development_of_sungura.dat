50|$|Charamba's {{gospel music}} {{contains}} elements <b>of</b> <b>sungura,</b> jazz and jit. It can be laid back, or vivid with traditional beats such as mbakumba and mhande.|$|R
5000|$|Chimbetu {{realised}} greater success {{when he went}} solo, recording classics like [...] "Kuipa Chete", [...] "Ngoma Yanditora Moyo", [...] "Mwana Wedangwe", [...] "Southern Africa" [...] {{and many}} others. He called his brand <b>of</b> <b>sungura</b> 'dendera', {{a reference to a}} common tropical bird with a booming bass sound. Chimbetu's songs are distinguished by this deep, booming bass guitar.|$|R
50|$|The band blended {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>sungura,</b> jazz, South African mbaqanga {{and traditional}} music. They recorded several successful albums in the mid-to-late 1990s, their first being Rudo Tsika Nemagariro, which {{sold more than}} 20,000 copies. Their album Mutunhu Unemago sold more than 30,000 copies. Popular songs included Anodyiwa Haature, Mabhauwa, and Vaforomani. They were also popular in Mozambique, and toured there.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{repeated}} {{over the years}} that Zimbabwean popular music is a male-domain and the best-selling sungura genre is nearly exclusively composed by male musicians. Female musicians have opted for the socially acceptable gospel music, avoiding the secular <b>sungura</b> for fear <b>of</b> stigmatisation. Many other reasons have been provided to explain womenâ€™s virtual absence from the <b>sungura</b> genre, some <b>of</b> them sound, and yet others purely sexist and ludicrous. Using Cultural Studies and critical political economy approaches, which seek to both critique and transform the current gender demographics <b>of</b> <b>sungura</b> band leadership, vocalism and monopoly of instrument playing, this paper attempts to provide ways of introducing and nurturing female sungura musicians into the recording and performing industry. Such introduction <b>of</b> female <b>sungura</b> personalities is not only to add to the exciting diversity <b>of</b> creative <b>sungura</b> suppliers, but to expand the discursive and democratic spaces in which women can self-articulate, ironically within a medium that has been accused of negatively stereotyping and objectifying them...|$|R

50|$|The group {{successfully}} mixed elements <b>of</b> <b>sungura,</b> jazz, South African mbaqanga {{and traditional}} sounds, creating an appealing and popular blend. The Chazezesa Challengers produced {{a string of}} hit albums in the mid-to-late 1990s; their debut, Rudo Tsika Nemagariro, sold more than 20,000 copies, while Mutunhu Unemago topped 30,000. Some of their top songs include Anodyiwa Haature, Kaserura Ndizvo, Smoko, Ndiridze Mhere, Ukarambwa Usacheme, and Vaforomani. System Tazvida is known for stressing that he liked better playing for rural crowds who he said liked and appreciated his music by singing along and dancing to it spiritedly when he did live shows. The Challengers were known for their humorous love lyrics and satirical subjects.The band also toured in Mozambique, where they were popular.|$|R
40|$|The researchâ€™s main {{objective}} was to study how sungura musicians at Diamond Studios engage in music business, tracing the challenges that hinder the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> music business and find in possible ways to alleviate these challenges for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>sungura</b> musicians at Diamond Studios and the music industry respectively. To gather data, I used questionnaires, observation guide and interviews as research tools and also a purposive sampling to select the respondents. It was noted in this research that, Diamond Studios has {{played a pivotal role}} in assisting many sungura musicians with positive business contracts. I have managed to highlight that, financial instability, piracy, and inadequate recourses to run music business are some of the challenges that are being faced by sungura musicians. On the other hand, there is need for a firm business partnership between sungura musicians and the record label. The sungura musicians are encouraged to comply with what Diamond Studios is advocating as for the music business to grow. Also strategies like effective marketing and mass productions are mentioned in this research as a way to curb piracy. This research recommends the government to establish policies that are favourable to musicians and promote music business...|$|R

5000|$|Dembo {{seemed to}} have been {{interested}} in songs of love. In fact, most of his songs are particularly loved by youth as they find them appropriate to their situations. Leornard was known as the King <b>Of</b> <b>Sungura</b> music, due to the lead guitarist skills he had from the creative melodies he created and which would match his beautiful unparalleled lead-vocal voice. The great mastery which he used to construct his music, and the amount of album production he did, gave him the nick name [...] "Musoro We Nyoka", which literary translates to [...] "Head of a snake". This refers to the slyness, willy attitude and intelligence of a snake, which Leonard Dembo was compared to. The poetic lyrics of his songs are cleverly crafted full of deep-rooted meanings. Arguably today still unmatched by any artist to come out of Zimbabwe.At various times, Dembo also used to address other social ills of his times, especially the suffering of the orphans and young kids. Although Dembo lived through the tumultuous years of Zimbabwean liberation struggle, he never seemed to be very much interested in the political affairs of his day. However, he sang a few tunes such as Kana Ndorangarira found on his 1987 album, Kuziva Mbuya Huudzwa which immediately found itself a hit on all the radio stations in the land. He even alluded to the struggle in such songs as Matsotsi (when he said that now that people were free, those who used to thrive in pickpocketing were to be punished).|$|R

Macheso is one <b>of</b> the best <b>sungura</b> artists ever to emerge from Zimbabwe. In recent years Macheso has risen to become an advertising face for many corporations with his recent achievement being an ambassador for the Red Cross.|$|R
