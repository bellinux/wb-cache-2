5|$|Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, {{related in}} his memoirs that the Russian left was {{shifting}} position when the French Army arrived sooner than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to shield the redeployment of the Russian left.

5|$|San Martín did {{not mention}} Escalada in his first battle report, leading initial <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> infer that they stayed within the convent during the battle. However it is {{currently}} considered that they {{took part in the}} battle, as suggested by the royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Empire or Byzantium {{is a term}} {{conventionally}} used by <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> {{describe the}} Greek ethnic and speaking Roman Empire of the Middle Ages, centered on its capital of Constantinople.

5|$|The {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479–431 BC) is not well supported by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia (πεντηκονταετία, the Fifty Years) by ancient writers, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporaneous, is Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is, used by <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} both shell and workings, and {{analysis}} of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture.

5|$|Unfortunately, the {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479431 BC) is poorly attested by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia by ancient scholars, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece.

5|$|Alberti {{requested}} in {{his will}} to avoid pageantry or complex funerals, and inherited his properties (house, farm, furniture, slaves, clothing, books, etc.) to his siblings Juana María, Matilde, Casimira and Manuel Silvestre. His personal diaries are kept, but with some parts of them being lost due to poor keeping. Still, his personal bibliography is used by <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct his influences and ideological background. It included many works of theology, studies of the Bible, scholastic theologists and juridical studies. Alberti's remains were lost when the chapel was demolished {{to make way for}} an expansion of 9 de Julio Avenue.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} earlier {{construction}} of nearby Battersea Bridge, during excavations workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the area {{was the site of}} Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. The most significant item found was the Celtic La Tène style bronze and enamel Battersea Shield, {{one of the most important}} pieces of Celtic military equipment found in Britain, recovered from the riverbed during dredging for the piers.|$|E

5|$|Calgacus' fate {{is unknown}} but, {{according}} to Tacitus, {{after the battle}} Agricola ordered the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north of Scotland to confirm that Britain was an island and to receive the surrender of the Orcadians. It was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain. However, the Roman historian Cassius Dio reports that this circumnavigation resulted in Titus receiving his 15th acclamation as emperor in 79. This is five years before Mons Graupius is believed by most <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> have taken place.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E

5000|$|Butterfield {{argued that}} this {{approach}} to history compromised {{the work of the}} historian in several ways.

5|$|English Heritage, a {{government}} body {{in charge of}} conservation of historic sites, roughly locates the battlefield in an area 800 to 1600metres (0.5 to 1.0 mile) north {{of the town of}} Barnet. Over the centuries, much of the terrain has changed, and records of the town's boundaries and geography are not detailed enough for English Heritage or <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> conclude the exact location of the battle. Geographical features corresponding to contemporary descriptions allow approximations of where the fighting took place.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|In July 1893 {{a peasant}} conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian {{contracts}} for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented {{them to the}} landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a strike against landowners and against state taxes broke out over {{a large part of}} western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone Covenants), are considered by <b>historians</b> <b>to</b> be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893. Railwaymen of Catania and Palermo, the sulphur-miners and many other workers followed their example winning higher wages or better working conditions.|$|E
