25|$|In 246, Lu Kang was {{promoted}} to General of the Household (中郎將) and ordered to switch posts with Zhuge Ke – he would leave Wuchang and move to Chaisang (柴桑) while Zhuge Ke would do vice versa. Before Lu Kang left, he had the city walls repaired and his residence renovated while leaving his fruit orchards intact. When Zhuge Ke arrived in Chaisang, {{he was surprised to}} see that Lu Kang had left behind a well-maintained residence for him. He also <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> because his garrison at Chaisang was in poor condition when he departed.|$|E
25|$|The {{journalist}} who {{reported on the}} event believed that most people who turned up for the meeting were not actually interested in votes for women at all, but had instead come to witness any trouble if there was any. The only violence {{on the day of}} the Dartford meeting, however, was a stone which was thrown at the wagon from a neighbouring backyard, but no damage was caused. At the end of the speech, Florence Conybeare invited Councillor W.H.D. King to give the vote of thanks. He said that he <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> that he had the vote while they did not, but thanked the party for recognising Dartford as a place of importance worth visiting.|$|E

25|$|The Cao Man Zhuan (曹瞞傳) and the Shiyu (世語) {{mentioned}} that Xiahou Dun once suggested to Cao Cao to eliminate Liu Bei first {{in order to}} force Sun Quan to surrender of his own accord, and then {{follow in the footsteps}} of the mythological rulers Shun and Yu by making Emperor Xian voluntarily abdicate the throne to him. Cao Cao accepted his proposal. After Cao Cao's death, Xiahou Dun regretted his words and fell sick and died. The historian Sun Sheng dismissed the Shiyu account as nonsense, saying that it did not match what was recorded in the main text of Xiahou Dun's biography in the Sanguozhi – Xiahou Dun <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> of serving under the Han imperial court so he requested to serve in Cao Cao's vassal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|HRW {{reported}} that girls aged five to women aged eighty were assaulted with exceptional brutality, with knives and razor blades {{being used to}} mutilate the vagina. Families were forced to watch women being sexually assaulted. Survivors of the attacks have reported major health issues {{as a result of}} the rapes. 87 percent reported vaginal discharge and 79 percent have reported lower abdominal pains. Fistulas were commonplace among survivors, 41 percent reported the discharge of fecal and urinary matter from the vagina. Psychological trauma includes nightmares and insomnia, with 77 percent reporting that they suffered from these. 91 percent of survivors {{reported that}} they lived in fear and <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> over the assaults. At the Saint Paul Health Center in Uvira, in a review of medical records from 658 survivors nine percent returned positive for HIV. Other sexual infections were syphilis, with thirteen percent infected, and a further 31 percent were infected with gonorrhea. Few victims seek medical attention, due to the costs associated with health care, and also due to the fact that should it become publicly known that they were raped, these survivors would then be socially stigmatized.|$|E
500|$|Frank {{frequently}} {{wrote of}} her difficult {{relationship with her}} mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942 she described her [...] "contempt" [...] for {{her mother and her}} inability to [...] "confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness," [...] before concluding, [...] "She's not a mother to me." [...] Later, as she revised her diary, Frank <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> of her harsh attitude, writing: [...] "Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?" [...] She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.|$|E

500|$|Although {{encouragement}} to keep Indigenous languages alive {{was present in}} some schools, a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society was to suppress Indigenous languages and culture. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. Teachers responded by strictly prohibiting {{the use of these}} languages despite many students having little or no understanding of English or French. The practice of traditional and spiritual activities including the Potlatch and Sun Dance were also banned. Some survivors reported being strapped or forced to eat soap when they were caught speaking their own language. [...] The inability to communicate was further affected by their families' inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> for being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities as ugly and dirty.|$|E
500|$|Night (1960) {{is a work}} by Elie Wiesel {{about his}} {{experience}} with his father in the Nazi German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1944–1945, {{at the height of}} the Holocaust toward the end of the Second World War. In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the death of God and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent–child relationship, as his father declines to a helpless state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. [...] "If only I could get rid of this dead weight...Immediately I <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> of myself, ashamed forever." [...] In Night everything is inverted, every value destroyed. [...] "Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends," [...] a kapo tells him. [...] "Everyone lives and dies for himself alone." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{an effort}} led, between 1879 and 1881, by the völkisch {{historian}} Heinrich von Treitschke {{and the court}} chaplain, Adolf Stoecker to dis-emancipate German Jews, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were in opposition, Victoria writing that she saw [...] "Treitschke and his supporters as lunatics {{of the most dangerous}} sort", and opining that Pastor Stoecker properly belonged in an insane asylum. She went on to write that she <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> of her adopted country because people like Treitschke and Stoecker [...] "behave so hatefully towards people of a different faith and another race who become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!". Clad in the uniform of a Prussian field marshal Frederick, together with Victoria, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for tolerance in contrast to what Victoria called Treitscke's [...] "disgraceful attacks". Shortly afterward, Frederick gave a speech denouncing the anti-Semitic movement in Germany as [...] "a shameful blot on our time", adding that [...] "We are ashamed of the Judenhetze which has broken all bounds of decency in Berlin, but which seems to flourish under the protection of the Court clerics." [...] In 1881, Frederick and Victoria again attended a synagogue service, this time in Wiesbaden [...] "to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are". Frederick followed this up by giving a speech in which he spoke out for [...] "poor, ill-treated Jews" [...] of Europe. Frederick's mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, wrote to thank him for his speech, saying she was proud that her daughter had married someone like him, but within Junker circles, Frederick was widely criticised for his actions in support of the Jews. Prominent among the Crown Prince's critics was his eldest son, Prince Wilhelm, who called his father a weak, cowardly man controlled by his British mother and the Jews. Beyond Wilhelm, many of the [...] "reactionary and 'chauvinistic' circles in Germany" [...] had, {{in the words of the}} British historian John C. G. Röhl come to the [...] "...conviction that the Crown Prince and his liberal English wife were an alien, un-German force that must not be allowed to accede to the throne".|$|E

2500|$|At age nine, Jorge Luis Borges {{translated}} Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince into Spanish. It {{was published}} in a local journal, but Borges' friends thought the real author was his father. Borges Haslam was a lawyer and psychology teacher who harboured literary aspirations. Borges said his father [...] "tried to become a writer and failed in the attempt", despite the 1921 opus El caudillo. Jorge Luis Borges wrote, [...] "as most of my people had been soldiers and I knew I would never be, I <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed,</b> quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sami {{were for}} many years victims of the Norwegianization policy, which in essence was {{an attempt by the}} {{government}} to make them [...] "true" [...] Norwegians and forget about their Sami way of life and religion, which was seen as inferior. As a result, the Sami living at the coast and in the fjords gradually lost much of their culture and often <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> by their Sami inheritance. The Sami in the interior managed to preserve more of their culture. In the 1970s, instruction of the Sami language started in schools, and a new sense of consciousness started to grow among the Sami; today most are proud of their background and culture.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the first}} two re-scheduled shows had to be {{cancelled}} as the part of band couldn't get flight tickets to the US due to flight delays caused by the Heathrow Terrorist Plot.

After getting his voice back, Lightbody gave up drinking on tour in order to preserve his voice, on advice on his doctor (who also works with pop singer Celine Dion). Although he <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> of it before, he hired a vocal coach after finding that Johnny Rotten had one when he was a Sex Pistol. He also started to do vocal warm-ups before shows, and requested a separate area for him to do his exercises, away from [...] "the band laughing at [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1816, Clarke {{introduced}} Keats to {{the influential}} Leigh Hunt, {{a close friend}} of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of Poems, the first volume of Keats's verse, which included [...] "I stood tiptoe" [...] and [...] "Sleep and Poetry," [...] both strongly influenced by Hunt. The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in The Champion. Clarke commented that the book [...] "might have emerged in Timbuctoo." [...] Keats's publishers, Charles and James Ollier, <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> of the book. Keats immediately changed publishers to Taylor and Hessey on Fleet Street. Unlike the Olliers, Keats's new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of Poems they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company's rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists eventually included Coleridge, Hazlitt, Clare, Hogg, Carlyle and Lamb.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were three}} {{conferences}} at Doullens on 26 March. The first was between Haig and his Army Commanders (except Gough). There {{was then a}} second with them and Wilson and Milner, {{who was able to}} bring assurances of French help from Clemenceau and Foch. The main conference was attended by Poincare, Clemenceau, Petain and Foch, as well as Haig, Wilson and Milner. Haig accepted the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed much of the credit for Foch’s appointment and to have insisted that he have wider powers over Petain across the whole front, not just the Amiens sector, than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him. The typed diary, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and Sheffield's view is that Haig either needed to reconcile himself psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply letting off steam and wanted to give himself the credit he felt he deserved. Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Petain's recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously. In his diary for that day Haig accused Petain of [...] "funk". He was later to make the same accusation against the King on 29 March and Lloyd George on 3 April; Harris suggests that he was attributing to others an emotion of which he <b>felt</b> <b>ashamed</b> in himself. After the conference Haig went riding (his main form of relaxation) {{for the first time in}} days, and Wilson recorded that he seemed “10 years younger” that evening.|$|E
