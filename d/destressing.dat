A digital seismic array and an array of borehole pressure cells (BPC's) had been installed near the site of a stope undergoing mining and periodic de stressing. The instrumentation was being monitored at the time of a <b>destress</b> blast of the 46 - 99 stope.

BPC measurements indicated coseismic ground pressure changes on the order of 200 to 300 kPa associated with the damaging events. Fault plane solutions and dislocation models established that stress changes induced by the event at 034500 may have been significant in promoting the occurrence of the event at 122020.

It {{is important to note}} that in Ute, the length of a vowel (short or long) is phonemic, thus marked orthographically, for example, whca-y, meaning 'wrapping,' versus whcáa-y, meaning 'swirling'. In some cases however, the difference between a long and a short vowel is purely phonetic, and does not change word meaning. Additionally, whether a vowel is stressed or unstressed has an effect on meaning, for example, suwá, meaning 'almost', versus súwa, meaning 'straight out'. Either the first or second vowel of a word in Ute may be stressed, with the latter situation being the most common. As a result, word stress is generally only marked in writing when it falls on the first vowel. Note that the high back unrounded vowel ʉ often is pronounced as a high central [...] when unstressed.

The pillar splitting, retreat mining system induced large pillar pressure increases and roof-to-floor con-vergence.

Maximum strain energy storage in chain pillars appears to have occurred just prior to the first of four split cuts. At that point a 15 -ft-wide, highly fractured perimeter confined the core of the 55 -by 70 -ft pillars, permitting the pillar core to support tremendous pressures. Splitting the chain pillars into two 17. 5 -by 70 -ft wings removed the confinement load, resulting in pillar yield. Thus, the pillar splitting mining method successfully redistributed the weight of the roof away from the pillar line.

40|$|AbstractUnderground {{longwall}} mining of coal seams in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin {{is currently being}} carried out under increasingly difficult geological and mining conditions. Mining depth, dislocations and mining remnants are the main factors responsible for the most significant rockburst hazard, which can be minimized via the use of active and passive rockburst prevention. Active rockburst prevention in longwalls is usually based on blasting, in order to either <b>destress</b> local stress concentrations in the rock mass or to fracture the thick layers of strong roof rocks to prevent or minimize the impact of high energy tremors on excavations. The accurate estimation of active rockburst prevention effectiveness is particularly important when mining under disadvantageous geological and mining conditions, which are associated {{with high levels of}} this hazard. The efficiency of blasting applied for this purpose is typically evaluated from the seismic effect, which is calculated based on seismic monitoring data and the weight of the charged explosive. This method, as used previously in the Czech Republic, was adopted in the present study to analyze conditions occurring in a Polish hard coal mine in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. Parameters of long hole <b>destress</b> blastings in roof rocks (torpedo blastings) {{from the face of the}} assigned longwall in coal seam no. 507 were correct a success according to the seismic effect method and corresponded to observations made in situ. The analytical method presented enables the rapid estimation of <b>destress</b> blasting effectiveness and could also be useful when determining appropriate active rockburst prevention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRock {{sampling}} {{with traditional}} coring method would cause initial damage to rock samples induced by in-situ stress relief during coring. To solve this problem, a damage-free coring method is proposed in this paper. The proposed coring scheme is numerically modeled first, {{and then it}} is verified by comparative laboratory tests using rock samples both obtained by conventional coring method and the proposed damage-free coring method. The result indicates that the in-situ stresses in sampling area could be reduced by 30 %– 50 % through drilling {{a certain number of}} <b>destressing</b> holes around the whole sampling area. The spacing between adjacent <b>destressing</b> holes is about 10 cm. The average uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of rock samples obtained by the damage-free coring method in Jinping II hydropower station with overburden depth of 1 900 m is higher than that of samples obtained by the conventional coring method with the same depth by 5 %– 15 % and an average of 8 %. In addition, the effectiveness of damage-free coring method can also be verified by acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. The AE events monitored during uniaxial compression test of damage-free coring samples is fewer than that of conventional coring samples at the primarily loading phase...|$|E

40|$|Rockburst control {{measures}} have been in practice with continued efforts for improvements {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century. The thesis concentrates on the evaluation of destress blasting, which is an important pro-active rockburst control measure. The concept of destress blasting is based on the fracturing of highly stressed rock mass by detonating explosive charge within it. The concept has been carried out ever since the first reported use in a Canadian coal mine circa the early 1930 s. Since then, many mines across the continents have applied this technique using a trial-and-error approach with mixed successes. To date, the application lacks scientific base. The aim of this thesis is to identify the governing mechanisms associated with destress blasting applications. A holistic approach is undertaken, which involves a critical analysis of the reported field evidences, development of a numerical procedure and detailed investigations at the micro-mechanical level to investigate the fracturing of rock under confinement by different types and magnitudes of explosive energy. A numerical procedure is developed in the thesis that carries promising potential to improve the understanding on rock fracturing by explosive energy as well as provides a platform to develop means for enhancing explosive energy utilization. The procedure is validated with reported field observations. Analyses of destress blasting is made through dynamic modelling by simulating discrete fractures using the developed procedure. A normalized parameter ℓ ci is introduced to investigate fracturing extent after destress blasts. The investigations revealed that destress blasting produces limited fractures aligned along the principal stresses. The fracturing extent reduces with the increase in the confinement. The study indicates that the current practice of destress blasting seemingly provides more psychological benefits than factual benefits from the desired <b>destressing.</b> The study also introduces a non-dimensional parameter, betaij, which characterizes <b>destressing</b> effects. The parameter not only adequately explains <b>destressing</b> phenomenon, but also offers clarifications to seemingly inexplicable reported field observations of destress blasting. Local fractures around the boreholes aligned along the principal stresses are found to be the cause of reported local stress concentration and rock stiffening post to destress blasting against the desired stress relaxation and softening...|$|E

40|$|The advance-and-relieve method {{benefits}} from lateral <b>destressing</b> associated with mining in laminated rocks {{and a high}} horizontal stress regime. This stress control method is based on measurements showing that occurrence of rock failure in the roof and floor of an entry (or caving of roof strata in a panel gob) results in redistribution of stresses in adjacent entries. By locating other entries within the shadow zone of the first entry (or gob), improvements in stability can be achieved. Numerical modeling proved useful in studying the basic mechanics of lateral relief while investigating the sensitivity of results to different geologic and mining parameters using controlled experiments. It was shown that failure of rocks near an entry results in redistribution of horizontal stress and shifting of the stress to higher horizons. Measurements from two mines are consistent in showing significant horizontal stress reductions {{in comparison with the}} far-field stress regime within the destressed zone. Although the far-field stress regime is very anisotropic, these measurements show near-equal secondary principal horizontal stresses, or perhaps a switch in orientation, as a result of <b>destressing.</b> Stress relief is achieved through lateral movement and relaxation of rocks along weak bedding planes toward adjacent caved zones (or softened zone). Because of cave geometry in the advancing panel, horizontal stress concentrations occur near the cave line both in front of the face and to the sides. The horizontal stress concentration reaches 1. 7 times the far-field stress ahead of the face. This stress increase is significant and may cause structural damage in this zone benefiting from additional support. In the next advancing panel located within the shadow zone of the gob, horizontal stresses are significantly reduced in the roof (by 50 %). Thus, the stability of future advancing panel can be improved through prudent layout designs and sequencing. The width of the relief zone is significantly influenced by the height of the softened (or cave zone) and rock mass properties...|$|E
