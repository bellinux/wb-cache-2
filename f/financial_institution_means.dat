In fact, few international arbitral awards explicitly {{address the issue of}} whether an award of interest should attract compound, rather than simple, interest. While there is little consensus on approaches to awarding interest generally in international arbitration, the issue of compound interest is especially problematic. This {{is due to the fact}} that compound interest is often singled out for prohibition in domestic legal systems, yet it is the commercial norm in calculating interest in modern financial transactions.

Nontamperable and traceable features of data reduce billing costs and reduce financing costs. The financing of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> by <b>means</b> of orders requires the manufacturing companies to provide transaction data, but because of the competitive relationship between manufacturing companies, there is a need for transaction privacy protection.

Under the agreement, Liechtenstein banks and other financial intermediaries are required to identify ‘relevant persons’ (i.e. accounts with UK addresses which might have UK tax liability) and contact them about their tax affairs. These ‘relevant persons’ must then register with HMRC that they wish to use the LDF and provide their <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> with a relevant certificate. But for those with assets already in Liechtenstein or who create a ‘footprint’ in the country, disclosure can be made voluntarily without prior contact from a <b>financial</b> <b>institution.</b> This <b>means</b> those who have undeclared assets in another offshore jurisdiction can bring that account within {{the terms of the}} LDF by opening a new account in Liechtenstein. [...] Once registered under the LDF, an individual has up to 10 months to complete their disclosure to HMRC. Tax liabilities declared under the LDF only need to cover the timeframe after 6 April 1999 rather than the standard 20 year assessment period. Furthermore, when under a tax investigation, an individual could be exposed to 20 years of back taxes plus interest, a potential 100 per cent penalty or criminal prosecution. However, under the LDF, there is normally only a 10 per cent penalty as well as assurance that no criminal investigation will be initiated.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE AND MOTIVATION: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect {{functional}} diversification on the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> The focus is on whether <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> should be allowed to combine commercial banking and investment banking functions under one financial conglomerate. Under current regulators <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> are allowed to combine the functions, however regulators are considering driving regulation towards separating commercial and investment banking. This study sheds light on whether the contemplated separation of investment and commercial banking increases or decreases the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> DATA AND METHODS: The data sample of his study consists of 51 <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> from Europe and the US, with a time span ranging from 2007 to 2014. Functional diversification is measured using income and asset based measures, collected from the annual financial statements of the <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Credit risk is measured with the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> level credit default swap (CDS) spreads and the CDS spread difference with banking sector CDS index spreads. The impact of functional diversification on credit risk is examined with multiple panel data regressions, where the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> is explained with the functional diversification measures and a set of control variables. Furthermore, multiple robustness checks are developed. FINDINGS: Based on the results, functional diversification decreases the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> at the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> credit risk level and compared with the average credit risk in the banking sector. The results are confirmed with multiple robustness checks. Based on the results the contemplated separation of commercial and investment banking with new regulation can have grave consequences. Separating the two functions would decrease functional diversification increasing the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> and the probability of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> failures...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{different}} views {{on the effects of}} public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> on corporate debt restructuring : the soft budget view and the hard budget view. The former view, which is held by Kornai (1979, 1983), Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), and others insists that because centralized public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have difficulty committing themselves to refrain from providing additional funds to distressed firms, corporate reorganizations often result in overinvestment. On the other hand, the latter view argues that public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> should prefer corporate liquidation rather than the continuation of business because public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> are secured by mortgages to a greater extent and are more reluctant to forgive the debts than private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> In this paper, I have empirically examined the role and impact of public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> in particular, from the viewpoints of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and bankruptcy procedures for distressed firms. The conclusions of this paper are as follows. In the DIP financing, the Development Bank of Japan always takes the lead, followed by private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Namely, so-called cowbell effect may exist, which is inconsistent with the hard budget view. Regarding the selection of bankruptcy procedures, firms that owed to government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have a tendency to opt for private procedures which have the effect of delaying a drastic debt restructuring. This is consistent with the soft budget view. public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> bankruptcy procedures, debtor-in-possession financing...|$|R
