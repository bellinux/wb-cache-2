40|$|Librarians are expected	to equip {{themselves}} {{with knowledge of}} the various information resources available and tips for efficient search strategies before being given the task of helping	out at	the Help Desk. For this	reason,	fresh librarian are often paired with	senior librarians when on duty. However, the emergence of	multitude online resources and the inherent digital skills of the Net generation seem to have a shrinking effect on the need	for academic related types of <b>enquiries.</b> The objective of this paper	is to analyse and study the characteristics and changes in the trends of reference <b>enquiries</b> received at the Help Desk particularly in the Sunway Campus Library. All <b>enquiries</b> received either in person, phone, email or via social media are recorded in	the Reference <b>Enquiries</b> Database developed by the	Automation division. <b>Enquiries</b>	received are categorised as Simple or In-Depth <b>enquiries.</b> The Simple <b>enquiries</b> are categorised as; Bibliograph instruction, Directional Questions, Computer & IT related; nformational, and Others. In-depth <b>enquiries</b> consist of Literature Search and Bibliographical Verification. This paper will plot the types of <b>enquiries</b> received for 3 years (2014 - 2016) and analyse the changes and trends in the types of <b>enquiries</b> received. It is hoped that this analysis will give an insight to the changing needs of library users and help academic libraries to plan, modify, and re-evaluate Help Desk services...|$|R
