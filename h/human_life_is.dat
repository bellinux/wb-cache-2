5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{examination of}} orality in <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> Walter J. Ong's Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982). Ong studies the distinguishing characteristics of oral traditions, how {{oral and written}} cultures interact and condition one another, and how they ultimately influence human epistemology.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle bases his ethical {{theory on}} this teleological worldview. Because of his form, {{a human being}} has certain abilities. Hence, his purpose {{in life is to}} {{exercise}} those abilities as well and as fully as possible. Now, the most characteristic human ability, which is not included in the form of any other organism, is the ability to think. Therefore, the best <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> a life lived rationally.|$|E
25|$|Non-violence, Compassion for all life, {{human and}} non-human, {{is central to}} Jainism. <b>Human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> valued as a unique, rare {{opportunity}} to reach enlightenment. Killing any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably terrible. It is a religion that requires monks, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh have been strongly influenced by Jains and often {{the majority of the}} local Hindus of every denomination are also vegetarian.|$|E

25|$|An {{absolute}} pacifist {{is generally}} {{described by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation as one who believes that <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available {{as a tool to}} aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.|$|E

The concept of life being in danger is interpreted broadly: for example, it is mandated that one violate Shabbat to bring a woman in active labor to a hospital. Lesser rabbinic restrictions are often violated under much less urgent circumstances (a patient who is ill but not critically so).|$|E
25|$|Humanae vitae (Latin: Of <b>Human</b> <b>Life)</b> <b>is</b> an {{encyclical}} {{written by}} Pope Paul VI and dated 25 July 1968. The text was issued at a Vatican {{press conference on}} 29 July. Subtitled On the Regulation of Birth, it re-affirmed the orthodox teaching of the Catholic Church regarding married love, responsible parenthood, and the rejection of most forms of artificial contraception. In formulating his teaching he explained why he did not accept the conclusions of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control established by his predecessor, Pope John XXIII, a commission he himself had expanded.|$|E

25|$|In 1839, {{the philosopher}} Hermann Ulrici {{wrote that the}} play and its {{depiction}} of human life reflected the views of Platonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> nothing but a dream, suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour {{as an indication of}} parody about class differences.|$|E
25|$|Competition {{for water}} has widely increased, {{and it has}} become more {{difficult}} to conciliate the necessities for water supply for human consumption, food production, ecosystems and other uses. Water administration is frequently involved in contradictory and complex problems. Approximately 10% of the worldwide annual runoff is used for human necessities. Several areas of the world are flooded, while others have such low precipitations that <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> almost impossible. As population and development increase, raising water demand, the possibility of problems inside a certain country or region increases, as it happens with others outside the region.|$|E
25|$|In the Islamic conception, {{every human}} being has a {{responsibility}} towards oneself. Since <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> sacred and initially created by divine rather than human agency, people are responsible for trying to keep their bodies and souls healthy, and not causing themselves spiritual or physical harm. Consequently, sport has obvious attractions in Islam: traditions record that Muḥammad raced with his wife 'Ā'ishah, and that he encouraged parents to teach their children swimming, riding and archery. Persian miniatures show Muslim women jointly playing polo with men in the same field. In the twenty-first century, some Muslim sociologists even argue {{that it should be}} obligatory for Muslim females to participate in sport of some kind.|$|E

25|$|Objectivism's central tenets {{are that}} reality exists {{independently}} of consciousness, {{that human beings}} have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception {{through the process of}} concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} from high school in 1965, Bonin became engaged to marry; this {{engagement}} had largely been at the behest of his mother, who believed the prospect of marriage would quell her son's evident sexual preference for males. The same year of his graduation, Bonin joined the U.S. Air Force. He later served five months of active duty in the Vietnam War as an aerial gunner, logging over 700 hours of combat and patrol time. Bonin was to later claim his experiences in Vietnam had installed a belief within him that <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> overvalued. On one occasion, while under enemy fire, he risked his own life to save the life of a wounded fellow airman. For this act, Bonin received a Good Conduct Medal in recognition of his gallantry. Bonin later claimed to have engaged in consensual sexual relations with both males and females in Vietnam; he also later admitted to sexually assaulting two fellow soldiers at gunpoint during the period of the Tet Offensive.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling is a {{means for}} sharing and {{interpreting}} experiences. Peter L. Berger says <b>human</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation. Storytelling {{can be used as}} a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.|$|E

500|$|The cantata {{is based}} upon the hymn [...] "", versed and {{composed}} by Michael Franck in 1652. The tune was later edited by Johann Crüger. It is the only time Bach used this hymn, except BWV 644 (Orgelbüchlein). Its theme, the transience of <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> <b>is</b> the only connection to the prescribed gospel reading. The first and last stanza are used unchanged in both text and tune: the former is treated as a chorale fantasia, the latter as a four-part closing chorale. An unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas as arias and recitatives. Bach scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of horn, flute, three oboes, strings and continuo.|$|E
