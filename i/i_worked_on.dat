The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was {{on the couch in the}} bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin...in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne {{and early}} in his career crafted his prose {{in a way that would}} {{resonate}} with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that [...] "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters.... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up".|$|E

500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E

I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man's face with his hand covering his eyes. You can {{get a sense of how}} many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E

500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that meant a lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
5000|$|Apte {{had also}} {{dismissed}} suggestions of any similarities {{between both the}} films, pointing out {{that she does not}} take any inspiration from characters in other films to prepare for her own role. She replied and said, [...] "Phobia and Kaun have no similarities. Phobia is a very different film with a very different character. And, when <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> any character, <b>I</b> <b>work</b> very independently <b>on</b> it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Adkins {{compared}} {{the process of}} writing the album's lyrics to that of the band's third studio album, Clarity (1999), stating: [...] "It's similar to [...] because that's how I approached a lot of emotional things in those days.

2500|$|Bon Iver's [...] "Perth" [...] was {{inspired}} by Heath Ledger.

[...] "The first thing <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on,</b> the riff and the beginning melodies, was the first song on the record, 'Perth,'" [...] Vernon told Exclaim!.

2500|$|Musically, Wilson stated {{he wanted}} to bring {{back some of the}} {{experimental}} aspects they had moved away from on Stupid Dream, stating [...] "Richard [...] and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> creating some unique keyboard sounds for the album – e.g. the 'fairground' on 'How is Your Life Today?' and the 'insects' at the end of 'Russia On Ice. He also spoke of the influence of metal music on the album, stating, [...] "...part of the beauty of the guitar solo on 'Where We Would Be' {{comes from the fact that}} it was played relatively straight but then fed through so many distortion and lo-fi processes that it began to fizz and disintegrate. The riffing guitars on 'Russia On Ice' are pure metal and one of the solos of 'Hatesong' I call my 'Korn solo' on account of the fact that the bottom strings on the guitar are tuned down so low that the notes can be bent several tones". Conversely, the band added more unconventional instruments to the compositions as well, such as the banjo, hammered dulcimers, and more string sections. String sections in Lightbulb Sun were arranged and produced by Dave Gregory from alternative rock band XTC at Christchurch Studios, Clifton, Bristol in January 2000, recorded by John Waterhouse.|$|E

5000|$|Stockholder {{has said}} of her own work and {{approach}} that [...] "My work developed {{through the process of}} making site-specific installations—site-specific sometimes in very specific ways but also just by virtue of being 'art' in a room; there's at least that much going <b>on</b> between the <b>work</b> and its context; after all, paintings don't hang on trees. In all of the <b>work</b> <b>I</b> place something I make in relationship to what's already there. With installations it's the building, the architecture, or you might say it's the place that <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> top of; with the smaller pieces <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> top of or in relation to stuff that I collect. I don't see a dichotomy between formalism and something else. Form and formal relations are important because they mean something; their meaning grows out of our experiences as physical mortal beings of a particular scale in relationship to the world as we find it and make it. I don't buy that formalism is meaningless".|$|R
