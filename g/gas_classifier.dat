40|$|Genetic Algorithms (GAS) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used in many scientific and engineering problems but the dynamics is not yet understood completely. This thesis aims to apply GA in multiple time series problem and to investigate the dynamics behind the algorithm. With <b>GAS,</b> <b>classifier</b> system, optimizer system and parallel system are developed in the project. We discuss issues like objective functions, specificity, genetic operations, pattern matching and other control parameters. A simple investigation of Self Organized Criticality (SOC) in the evolutionary process is also discussed. Real financial blue chips' stock prices in Hang Seng Index are used as the time series for the investigation...|$|E
40|$|Substrate Temperature Control with Fuzzy Logic: On-chip {{integrable}} gas sensors show temperature dependent characteristics, forcing {{users to}} keep {{the temperature of the}} sensors at a constant level, but also allowing increased accurcy and selectivity of gas classification by deliberate temperature changes. Problems with modelling and integrability are easier to solve by implementation of a fuzzy controller, but there remains a substantial hardware effort on the chip. As a result the layout of a chip was developed with areas whose temperature can be independently controlled. These areas can be utilized by any user to stabilize temperature dependent circuits or to test their behaviour at varying temperatures. Combined Neuro/Fuzzy Signal Processing: In applications of gas sensors their output signals depend on parasitic influences like air humidity, temperature deviations or the age of the sensor. The development of a <b>gas</b> <b>classifier</b> based on statistical methods involves through the necessary number of samples considerable time and cost. With fuzzy methods a <b>gas</b> <b>classifier</b> can be easier constructed; additional results, like p. e. the reliability of the classification, may be used in safety relevent applications. Fuzzy logic is equally suited to mutual monitoring of gas sensors in a multiple sensor system. A functional working model of such a fuzzy state identification system was completed. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} of functional data, {{is a common}} task in bioinformatics. Spectral data as obtained from mass spectrometric measurements in clinical proteomics are such functional data leading to new challenges for an appropriate analysis. Here {{we focus on the}} determination of classification models for such data. In general the available approaches for this task initially transform the spectra into a vector space followed by training a classifier. Hereby the functional nature of the data is typically lost, which may lead to suboptimal classifier models. Taking this into account a wavelet encoding is applied onto the spectral data leading to a compact functional representation. Further the Supervised Neural <b>Gas</b> <b>classifier</b> is extended by a functional metric. This allows the classifier to utilize the functional nature of the data in the modeling process. The presented method is applied to clinical proteom data showing good results.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emanating from urine samples {{to determine whether they}} can be used to classify samples into those from prostate cancer and non-cancer groups. Participants were men referred for a trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy because of an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level or abnormal findings on digital rectal examination. Urine samples were collected from patients with prostate cancer (n = 59) and cancer-free controls (n = 43), on the day of their biopsy, prior to their procedure. VOCs from the headspace of basified urine samples were extracted using solid-phase micro-extraction and analysed by <b>gas</b> chromatography/mass spectrometry. <b>Classifiers</b> were developed using Random Forest (RF) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification techniques. PSA alone had an accuracy of 62 - 64 % in these samples. A model based on 4 VOCs, 2, 6 -dimethyl- 7 -octen- 2 -ol, pentanal, 3 -octanone, and 2 -octanone, was marginally more accurate 63 - 65 %. When combined, PSA level and these four VOCs had mean accuracies of 74 % and 65 %, using RF and LDA, respectively. With repeated double cross-validation, the mean accuracies fell to 71 % and 65 %, using RF and LDA, respectively. Results from VOC profiling of urine headspace are encouraging and suggest that there are other metabolomic avenues worth exploring which could help improve the stratification of men at risk of prostate cancer. This study also adds to our knowledge on the profile of compounds found in basified urine, from controls and cancer patients, which is useful information for future studies comparing the urine from patients with other disease states...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{aim for the}} {{replication}} {{of a state of}} the art architecture for recognition of human actions using skeleton poses obtained from a depth sensor. We review the usefulness of accurate human action recognition in the field of robotic elderly care, focusing on fall detection. We attempt fall recognition using a chained Growing When Required neural <b>gas</b> <b>classifier</b> that is fed only skeleton joints data. We test this architecture against Recurrent SOMs (RSOMs) to classify the TST Fall detection database ver. 2, a specialised dataset for fall sequences. We also introduce a simplified mathematical model of falls for easier and faster bench-testing of classification algorithms for fall detection. The outcome of classifying falls from our mathematical model was successful with an accuracy of 97. 12 ± 1. 65 % and from the TST Fall detection database ver. 2 with an accuracy of 90. 2 ± 2. 68 % when a filter was added.
