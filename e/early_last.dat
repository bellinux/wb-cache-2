25|$|Cosby's lead {{criminal}} {{lawyer in}} Pennsylvania is fighting a subpoena {{related to his}} $2,500 donation to the ex-prosecutor who says he had promised Cosby {{that he would never}} be charged. Lawyer Brian McMonagle co-hosted a political fundraiser for former District Attorney Bruce Castor <b>early</b> <b>last</b> year but said it took place months before he joined Cosby's defense team in September. Constand's lawyer now wants McMonagle to detail any ties between his office and Castor, including phone records and documents. She wants Cosby to do the same. At a pretrial hearing on April 15, 2016, a judge ruled that Constand is entitled to any documents shared between Castor and Cosby's attorneys.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 July 2006, a {{man called}} in at 6.23pm to say [...] "Ada bom" [...] (There is a bomb) {{but it turned out}} to a bomb hoax. A section of Kuching International Airport's (KIA) {{domestic}} arrival entrance was cordoned off for several hours after a suspicious looking black plastic bag was found lying near one of the pillars there. MAB quickly cordoned off the area and quietly diverted the public and passengers to other sections of the KIA complex. With the aid of a Robot Scanner, the Bomb Disposal Unit closed in to check the package and twice blasted it with shotgun pellets. A thorough check by one of the police from the Bomb Disposal Unit in special suit confirmed that the black plastic bag actually contained rubbish. Nevertheless, none of the flights were rescheduled or cancelled during the whole episode. This is the first bomb hoax incident reported since the KIA was refurbished and reopened <b>early</b> <b>last</b> April.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the filing}} {{deadline}} for candidates looming, Lawrence said in January that [...] "we have adopted this other formula - a makeshift redistricting - and that's {{what it will}} be - to hurtle this present situation of avoiding having an election of all 27 member of Congress at large. Subsequent legislatures, I hope, will {{be in a position to}} redistrict the state properly, and have an equitable division somewhere close to the 419,000 mean". The governor called a special session of the legislature to convene on January 22, for the purpose of drawing up congressional districts. Chester's Democratic state representative, John E. Gremminger (aka [...] "Reds Gremminger"), attacked Bell's plan to combine Delaware and Chester counties into one district, with two congressmen elected at-large, calling it [...] "unworkable and un-American". After an inconclusive meeting with Lawrence and Morse, Bloom declared: [...] "If this matter had been left to the legislature to decide <b>early</b> <b>last</b> year, without outside interference, we would have had a solution now and there would have been no reason for a special session. As Republican state chairman I shall assist and advise in every way that I can, but the final decision on what districts will be eliminated is a matter for the legislature and its committees to decide." [...] Morse, in turn, retorted: [...] "It would appear that responsibility for the delay is going to be placed exactly where it belongs - with the Republicans." ...|$|E

So beautifully veiled and varied--the air, with that early-summer perfume, not at all damp or raw--at times Luna languidly emerging in richest brightness for minutes, and then partially envelop'd again. Far off a poor whip-poor-will plied his notes incessantly. It was that silent time between 1 and 3.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} develops impact {{assessments of}} climate change projections by incorporating climate variables (including water (SF, P), Heat (T, SR), carbon dioxide, relative humidity and wind speed) into existing process based and black box models. Changes in Kansas climate will be reflected in both the mean values for rain fall, maximum, minimum, average, and diurnal temperature as well as extreme values for rain fall, and maximum and minimum temperature. Based on analysis of data from 23 centennial weather stations, the highest average monthly temperature during the summer season was from 1920 - 1949 for many locations. This indicates the dust bowl years {{can serve as a}} good proxy for the near future climate conditions. Long term trends for frost indices in Kansas have changed at both {{the beginning and end of}} the growing season with <b>earlier</b> <b>last</b> spring freeze events and later first fall freezes, although this is less consistent than the last spring freeze. Combined, these result in fewer frost days and a longer growing season. Further analysis will assess the impact of potential producer adaptations to these changes such as earlier planting dates in response to <b>earlier</b> <b>last</b> spring freeze events on biomass yield...|$|R

60|$|Many persons {{would like}} to have the society of cats during the summer {{vacation}} in the country, but they deny themselves this pleasure because they think they must either take the cats along when they return to the city, where they would be a trouble and an encumbrance, or leave them in the country, houseless and homeless. These people have no ingenuity, no invention, no wisdom; or it would occur to them to do as I do: rent cats by the month for the summer and return them to their good homes at the end of it. <b>Early</b> <b>last</b> May I rented a kitten of a farmer's wife, by the month; then I got a discount by taking three. They have been good company for about five months now, and are still kittens--at least they have not grown much, and to all intents and purposes are still kittens, and as full of romping energy and enthusiasm {{as they were in the}} beginning. This is remarkable. I am an expert in cats, but I have not seen a kitten keep its kittenhood nearly so long before.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{an immense}} {{satisfaction}} {{to get your}} news--and no figure of speech {{to say that it}} has found me literally on the point of reaching out, for it, into the thick twilight of your whereabouts. I have had my general silence much on my conscience--and especially my dumbness and darkness to Rosina and Bay, for whom my movements must have been enveloped in a perfidious mystery that has caused me, I fear, to forfeit all their esteem. But let me tell you first of all how I rejoice in your good conditions and in your having found your feet. It was [...] "borne in" [...] upon me, on general grounds, that Southwold would never do for long, and it is charming that you have found so near and so nice a substitute. I especially delight (without wanting to sacrifice the rest of you) in such a letting-down-easy of the Art-Daughters. Please give them my tender love and tell them that, preposterous as it sounds, I have never, all this time, and in spite of the rosiest asseverations, crossed the channel at all. The nearest I have come to it is to have, <b>early</b> <b>last</b> month, come down here {{to the edge of the}} sea and collapsed into the peace and obscurity of this convenient corner (long familiar to me,) which, having a winter season, is practically empty at present. I will tell R. and B. when I see them just how it was that I happened to be so false--it is too long a story now. Suffice it that my reasons (for continuing to hug this fat country) were overwhelming, and my regrets (at not tasting of their brave Bohemia) of the sharpest. Moreover all's well that ends well. If I had gone abroad I should be abroad now and the rest of the summer; and therefore unable to join you on your Suffolk shore--or at least alight upon you there--which is what I shall be enchanted to do. You describe a little Paradise--houris and all; and I beseech you to keep a divan for me there. The only thing is that I fear I shan't be able to come till toward the end--or by the end--of the month. I have more or less engaged myself (to a pair of friends who are coming down here next week for my--strange as it may seem--sweet sake) to remain on this spot till toward the 25th. But I will come then, and stay as long as you will let me. If you can bespeak any quarters for me at the inn, in advance, I will take it very kindly of you. Can they give me a little sitting-room as well as a bed-room? If you can achieve any effective [word illegible] at them to do so I shall be very grateful. I always need some small literary bower other than the British bed-room--and in this case I would of course [...] "meal" [...] there, as that makes them always more zealous. I don't know the East Coast to speak of at all--and I can imagine no more winsome introduction to it. I quite yearn to commune with the young Parisians. Bravo, McMonnies. Bravo everybody--especially Grenville. How I shall joy to frolic with him in the sand! Have they seen--the art-daughters--the image of the St. Gaudens Shaw? It is altogether great. William's oration was a first-class success. I encircle you all and will write again! ...|$|E
