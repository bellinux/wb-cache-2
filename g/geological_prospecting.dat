40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} {{dependence}} among <b>geological</b> <b>prospects</b> increases exploration risk.

Risk-neutral and risk-averse investors are distinguished not by the plunging phenomenon, but by the threshold level of dependence that triggers such behavior. Aversion to risk does not imply aversion to dependence. Indeed the potential to plunge may be larger for risk-averse investors than for risk-neutral investors.

40|$|Komatiites are {{fascinating}} volcanic rocks. They {{are among}} the most ancient lavas of the Earth following the 3. 8 Ga pillow basalts at Isua and they represent some of the oldest ultramafic magmatic rocks preserved in the Earth’s crust at 3. 5 Ga. This fact, linked to their particular features (high magnesium content, high melting temperatures, low dynamic viscosities, etc.), has attracted the community of geoscientists since their discovery in the early sixties, who have tried to determine their origin and understand their meaning in the context of terrestrial mantle evolution. In addition, it has been proposed that komatiites are not restricted to our planet, but they could be found in other extraterrestrial settings in our Solar System (particularly on Mars and Io). It {{is important to note that}} komatiites may be extremely significant in the study of the origins and evolution of Life on Earth. They not only preserve essential geochemical clues of the interaction between the pristine Earth rocks and atmosphere, but also may have been potential suitable sites for biological processes to develop.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} sequential investment and active management {{on the value of}} a portfolio of real options. The options are assumed to be interdependent, in that exercise of any one is assumed to produce, in addition to some intrinsic value based on an underlying asset, further information regarding the values of other options based on related assets. We couch the problem in terms of oil exploration, where a discrete number of related <b>geological</b> <b>prospects</b> are available for drilling, and management’s objective is to maximize the expected value of the combined exploration campaign. Management’s task is complex because the expected value of the investment sequence depends on the order in which options are exercised. A basic conclusion is that, although dependence increases the variance of potential outcomes, it also increases the expected value of the embedded portfolio of options and magnifies the value of optimal management. Stochastic dynamic programming techniques may be used to establish the optimal sequence of investment. Given plausible restrictions on the information structure, however, we demonstrate that the optimal dynamic program can be identified and implemented by policies that are relatively simple to execute. In other words, we provide sufficient conditions for the optimality of intuitive decision rules, like “biggest first, ” “most likely first, ” or “greatest intrinsic value first. ” We also develop exact analytic expressions for the implied value of the portfolio, which permits the value of active management to be assessed directly...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to briefly {{emphasize}} the shale gas technology of extraction and because the important role of water within this process, the imperious need to preserve the water quality. If rigorous <b>geological</b> <b>prospects</b> indicate the presence of gas in shale, it is extracted using the hydraulic fracturing technology. The water delivered by tank trucks mixed with sand and additives is injected into a well, at near 1, 500 m, under high pressure, from a pumper truck, through a probe (lined with several layers of steel and cements for protecting the groundwater of the fluids that are pumped through the probe and also of the natural gas that is released and collected inside the well). For obtaining gas from shale, holes are horizontally made in stainless steel and cement casing of the probe up to shale, and gas is extracted from the fractures with steel pipes. The reflux water is conducted to depuration stations in order to be cleaned and reused (about 10 – 30 % is recycled). The residues (wastewater and solids) resulted from depuration process are stored in special facilities designed and built with aim of waste storage. Usually, such a well is productive for several decades. Complete exploitation of such facility needs about 10, 000 – 20, 000 m 3 water. By comparison with other types of fuels, the ratio water volume used/unit of energy, is the lowest for shale gas production. The negative experiences worldwide, concerning environmental protection, with accent on water issue, must be taken into consideration if Romania would implement hydraulic fracturing technology in order to obtain shale gas, especially focused on total accomplishment of exploitation standards and regulations...|$|R
