50|$|Vacuum {{consolidation}} (or vacuum preloading) is a {{soft soil}} improvement method {{that has been}} successfully used by geotechnical engineers and specialists of ground improvement companies {{in countries such as}} Australia, China, Korea, Thailand and France for soil improvement or land reclamation (Chu et al., 2005). It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required. However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system. The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> in suitable areas. Where the underlying ground consists of permeable materials, such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum. It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum preloading is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum consolidation is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.|$|E
40|$|Continuous-span, cast-in-place box girders {{have been}} popular in modern bridge construction. Secondary moments due to {{prestressing}} in continuous-span, post-tensioned girders, however, have significantly complicated the structural analysis {{and design of}} the girders. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method is a commonly used method {{in the analysis of}} continuous-span, post-tensioned concrete girders since the method reduces the analysis of a prestressed structure to that of a nonprestressed structure in which the consideration of secondary moments is not required. The basic concept of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method is that the effects of prestressing are replaced by equivalent loads produced by the prestressed tendon along the span of the structure. The approximate <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method significantly simplifies the procedure for the computation of equivalent loads for post-tensioned concrete girders with parabolic tendons and therefore has commonly been used by structural engineers. In this paper, three examples of simply-supported, posttensioned concrete girders with various combinations of locations of the centroid of tendons (c. g. s.) and the centroid of concrete (c. g. c.) are demonstrated to verify the accuracy of the approximate <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method.

40|$|Operators need {{accurate}} {{knowledge on}} structural reserves to decide about lifetime extension of offshore wind turbines. Load monitoring {{enables us to}} directly compare design loads with real loading histories of the support structure in order to calculate its remaining useful lifetime. Monitoring of every hot spot is technically and financially not feasible. This paper presents a novel idea for load monitoring of monopiles. It requires strain measurements at only one level convenient for sensor installation, such as tower bottom. Measurements are converted into damage <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> for 10  min time intervals. Damage <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> are extrapolated to other locations of the structure with a simulation model and statistical algorithm. For this, structural loads at all locations of the monopile are calculated with aero-hydro-elastic software and updated finite element models. Damage <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> at unmeasured locations are predicted from the simulation results with a k-nearest neighbor regression algorithm. The extrapolation was tested with numerical simulations of an 8  MW offshore wind turbine. Results show that damage can be predicted with an error of 1 – 3  % if this is done conditional on mean wind speed, which is very promising. The load monitoring concept is simple, cheap and easy to implement. This makes it ideal for making decisions on lifetime extension of monopiles...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} globalwarming {{and climate}} change has boosted research on sustainable energy {{in the last few}} decades leading to a lot of research being carried out on wind energy. Wind turbines have {{played a major role in}} harvesting wind energy withHorizontal AxisWind Turbines (HAWTs) being the dominant design. However, for urban and offshore applications, Vertical AxisWind Turbines (VAWTs) have been under consideration for a while. VAWTs have some inherent advantages such as no need for a yawingmechanism, easy operation and maintenance, low noise emission, and better potential performance under skewed and unsteady wind conditions. But due to lack of research on VAWTs, they have not been commercialized on a scale which is equal to that of HAWTs. This study is one of such attempts for a better understanding of VAWTs. The primary aim of this study is to explore and analyse the behaviour of VAWTs under the influence of turbulent wind. This target has been achieved by analysing the loads on the turbine and their effect on its fatigue life under the influence of constant wind and turbulent wind. For this purpose, first one hour turbulent wind fields based on statistical models were generated using the turbulence simulator, ‘TURBSIM’ and two-dimensional turbulent wind fields were extracted from the generated wind fields. Next, the simulations of a two-dimensional vertical axis wind turbine using the generated turbulent wind fields were done in an aeroelastic code named ‘Unsteady Two-Dimensional Vorticity Aerodynamics (U 2 DiVA) model’. These simulationswere done between the cut-in (4 m/s) and cut-out (25 m/s) wind speeds of the turbine at intervals of 1 m/s. The results from these simulations were the streamwise force, cross-streamwise force and the moment about the quarter-chord points of the airfoils of the blades. A post-processing tool was then developed for the processing of these results. Using this tool and the results of the simulations, the equivalent tangential force, the equivalent radial force and the equivalent moment on the airfoilswere calculated. All calculationswere done for both types of wind. First the <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> at each wind speed were calculated and then the total <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> were calculated. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> were calculated for various values of inverse slope (m) of the S-N curve of thematerial used to manufacture the blades of the turbine. The same procedure was repeated with constant wind. Finally,the changes in total <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> under turbulent wind were calculated with respect to total <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> under the constant wind. The variation in these changes with respect to the change in the value ofmwas then calculated. Additionally, the effect of phase angle (angle between the blades and the incoming windstream at the beginning of the simulation) on the <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> was also calculated. The value of m used for this case was 10 as recommended in literature and the four phase angles chosen were 0 o, 45 o, 90 o and, 135 o. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> at various wind speeds were calculated for the different values of m and various peaks were observed at various wind speeds. It was recommended that the peaks can be avoided using a suitable control scheme to control the rotational speed of the rotor. The changes in total <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> under the influence of turbulent wind were found to be less than 0. 2 % which indicates that the effect of turbulence on the fatigue life of VAWTs is not so significant. The value of m at which the change was smallest was found to be around 3. Under phase effect, the variation of the radial force and the moment with wind speed seemed to follow Gaussian distribution at phase angles of 45 o, 90 o and 135 o. The total <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> were found out for all the phase angles and the change in these loads were found out with respect to 0 o phase angle. These changes were quite high and indicate that the operation of a VAWT at phase with incoming wind can be detrimental for the fatigue life of the VAWT.
