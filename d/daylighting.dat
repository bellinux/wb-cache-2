5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, <b>daylighting</b> and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{courtyard}} doughnut {{shape is}} critical to the two main design priorities: <b>daylighting</b> and natural ventilation. Natural <b>daylighting</b> was achieved through the shallow floor plate depths and high ceilings allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior of the building and the core open-air courtyard. <b>Daylighting</b> models were tested at the University of Washington’s Integrated Design Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers.

25|$|Because of {{the design}} {{challenges}} and sensitivity to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.), designers must apply holistic design principles, {{and take advantage of}} the free naturally occurring assets available, such as passive solar orientation, natural ventilation, <b>daylighting,</b> thermal mass, and night time cooling.|$|E
40|$|<b>Daylight</b> factor {{has long}} been the {{predominant}} metric to evaluate <b>daylight</b> performance. Recently, the profession has moved toward annual dynamic <b>daylight</b> metrics such as useful <b>daylight</b> illuminance and <b>daylight</b> autonomy, which are based on absolute values of time varying <b>daylight</b> illuminance for a period of full year. As opposed to static <b>daylight</b> metrics that only concentrate on individual sky conditions, such as the widely used <b>daylight</b> factor, these metrics provide a more comprehensive way to measure illuminance {{for a wide range of}} sun positions and sky conditions. Although there is a growing consensus assigning importance to dynamic <b>daylight</b> metrics, there is no common understanding of how to integrate the preference and behaviour of building occupants in assessing the applicability of these metrics. In fact, it is when these occupancy observations and quantitative measurements are taken together that the importance of <b>daylight</b> performance metrics is fully realized. This study seeks to investigate the extent to which the influence of <b>daylight</b> on behaviour can be predicted, and for this the behaviour investigated is seating preferences of occupants in open plan, hot-desking spaces in two university libraries in Sheffield: Western Bank Library and the Information Commons. The results suggest that the association between <b>daylight</b> and seat choice may not be strong, and that any effect is better associated with <b>daylight</b> factor than with useful <b>daylight</b> illuminance or <b>daylight</b> autonomy...|$|R

40|$|The ® rst step in {{evaluating}} the visual performance and energy ef ® ciency provided by <b>daylight</b> requires an accurate estimation {{of the amount of}} <b>daylight</b> entering a building. Traditionally, the <b>daylight</b> performance of a building is often evaluated in terms of <b>daylight</b> factors with the calculations being based on the CIE overcast sky. In general, the <b>daylight</b> factor approach is quite simple to use but it cannot predict the dynamic variations in interior illuminance as sky conditions and the sun’s position change. The recently introduced concept of the <b>daylight</b> coef ® cient, which needs sky luminance data, provides an alternative approach. With the advances in computer technology, the computation of <b>daylight</b> illuminance using the two prediction methods can be conducted by a simulation program. This paper presents a study of the <b>daylight</b> factor and <b>daylight</b> coef ® cient approaches. The interior <b>daylight</b> illuminance data measured in a scale model and a classroom were compared with the simulated results using RADIANCE computer simulation software. It was found that, in general, the <b>daylight</b> coef ® cient approach performs better than <b>daylight</b> factor approach. Both methods tend to estimate the <b>daylight</b> illuminance less accurately when the measurement points in the classroom are far away from the window facË ade.

25|$|To {{provide the}} kind of {{information}} and support people need to invest money, time and effort in energy conservation, {{it is important to understand}} and link to people's topical concerns. For instance, some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing.

25|$|George LeyVa Middle School Administrative Offices, {{occupied}} since fall 2011, is a net zero energy, net {{zero carbon}} emissions building of just over 9,000 square feet. With <b>daylighting,</b> variable refrigerant flow HVAC, and displacement ventilation, it is designed to use half of the energy of a conventional California school building, and, through a building-integrated solar array, provides 108% of the energy needed to offset its annual electricity use. The excess helps power the remainder of the middle school campus. It is the first publicly funded NZE K–12 building in California.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (<b>daylighting)</b> can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E
50|$|Continuous <b>daylight</b> {{autonomy}}, {{is similar}} to <b>daylight</b> autonomy but partial credit is attributed to time steps when the <b>daylight</b> illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level. For example, if the target illuminance is 400 lux and the calculated value is 200 lux, <b>daylight</b> autonomy would give zero credit, while continuous <b>daylight</b> autonomy would give 0.5 credit (200/400 = 0.5). The benefit of continuous <b>daylight</b> autonomy {{is that it does}} not give a hard threshold of acceptable illuminance. Instead, it addresses the transition area—allowing for realistic preferences within any given space. For example, office occupants usually prefer to work at <b>daylight</b> below the illuminance threshold since this level avoids potential glare and excessive contrast.|$|R
