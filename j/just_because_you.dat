25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s bottom line is that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.|$|E

500|$|The {{first draft}} of the book was {{finished}} in April 2008. In a newsletter sent out that month, Paolini said he was busy [...] "chewing [...] way through the editing, {{which has been a}} surprisingly enjoyable experience this time around." [...] The hardest part of editing was having to excise material that he spent days and weeks working on. [...] "However, as most any writer will tell you, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> spent ten days slaving over a certain scene is no reason to keep it in the final manuscript.

The album was multi-platinum in both Italy and Portugal.|$|E

So, he noted with some bemusement, [...] "the beauty of this argument is that it is invulnerable to disproof—because its proof lies in the future, which of course always lies ahead." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> have a government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. <b>Just</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{journalists and}} video game {{designers}} have questioned this cultural classification, {{arguing that the}} differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated. In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo, Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura (who worked on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts) emphasized that RPGs should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: role-playing games. Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Final Fantasy and The Last Story, noted that, while [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Japanese RPGs as [...] "turn-based, traditional styles" [...] and Western RPGs as [...] "born from first-person shooters," [...] there [...] "are titles that don't fit the category," [...] pointing to Chrono Trigger (which he also worked on) and the Mana games. He further noted {{that there have been}} [...] "other games similar to the style of Chrono Trigger," [...] but that [...] "it's probably because the games weren't localised and didn't reach the Western audience." [...] series director Tetsuya Takahashi, in reference to Xenoblade Chronicles, stated that [...] "I don’t know when exactly people started using the term 'JRPG,' but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term, I’ll be satisfied." [...] The writer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com states that [...] "Xenoblade throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community's obsession over the differences between" [...] Western and Japanese RPGs, pointing out that it [...] "does things that don't really fit into either genre. Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and neat little rules, I know, but <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> cram something into a little box doesn't mean it belongs there." [...] Nick Doerr of Joystiq criticizes the claim that Japanese RPGs are [...] "too linear," [...] pointing out that non-linear Japanese RPGs are not uncommonfor instance, the Romancing SaGa series. Likewise, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq points out that linear Western RPGs were common in the 1990s, and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally [...] "not true" [...] and [...] "never was", pointing to classic examples like Lands of Lore and Betrayal at Krondor that were more narrative-focused than the typical Western-style RPGs of the time. In 2015, IGN noted in an interview with Xenoblade Chronicles Xs development team that the label [...] "JRPG" [...] is most commonly used to refer to RPGs [...] "whose presentation mimics the design sensibilities" [...] of anime and manga, that it's [...] "typically the presentation and character archetypes" [...] that signal [...] "this is a JRPG." ...|$|E
