Four battalions of infantry formed up across the highway about a mile south of the bridge while the cavalry hurriedly saddled their horses. As soon as his troopers were ready, Alburquerque flung them at the French without waiting to form them into proper regiments or lines. As a result, 2,500 Spanish cavalry charged into La Houssaye's dragoons in a great <b>ill-formed</b> mass. But Lorge's dragoons and the corps light cavalry units were across the river and quickly joined the melee. Within a short time Alburquerque's overmatched horsemen were defeated.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} this study show that the {{earliest}} age at which children can discriminate well-formed from <b>ill-formed</b> sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years. During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, there is {{a significant increase in the}} accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since metalinguistic skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the psycholinguistic ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute whether it can or cannot generate the target sentence. This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic grammar skills have been established, and is related to early reading acquisition—acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of syntactic awareness.|$|E

40|$|Grammar-based parsing is a {{prevalent}} {{method for}} {{natural language understanding}} (NLU) and has been introduced into dialogue systems for spoken language processing (SLP). A robust parsing scheme is proposed in this paper to overcome the notorious phenomena, such as garbage, ellipsis, word disordering, fragment, and <b>ill-form,</b> which frequently occur in spoken utterances. Keyword categories are used as terminal symbols, and the definition of grammar is extended by introducing three new rule types, by-passing, up-messing and over-crossing, {{in addition to the}} general rules called up-tying in this paper, and the use of semantic items simplifies the semantics extraction. The corresponding parser marionette, which is essentially a partial chart parser, is enhanced to parse the semantic grammar. The robust parsing scheme integrating the above methods has been adopted in an air traveling information service system called EasyFlight, and has achieved a high performance when used for parsing spontaneous speech...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} {{in the era of}} big data use is how to ‘clean’ the vast amount of data, particularly from micro-blog websites like Twitter. Twitter messages, called tweets, are commonly written in <b>ill-forms,</b> including abbreviations, repeated characters, and misspelled words. These ‘noisy tweets’ require text normalisation techniques to detect and convert them into more accurate English sentences. There are several existing techniques proposed to solve these issues, however each technique possess some limitations and therefore cannot achieve good overall results. This paper aims to evaluate individual existing statistical normalisation methods and their possible combinations in order to find the best combination that can efficiently clean noisy tweets at the character-level, which contains abbreviations, repeated letters and misspelled words. Tested on our Twitter sample dataset, the best combination can achieve 88 % accuracy in the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score and 7 % Word Error Rate (WER) score, both of which are considered better than the baseline model...|$|R

50|$|Varsity Wednesday {{included}} the final matches before the summer, Netball and Lacrosse. The Netball match was a turbulent affair, but the Uni women emerged victorious. With 7 victories, Trent needed {{to secure the}} Lacrosse match to remain in contention for the Varsity Championship. Although a close match last year, Uni took the home-field advantage and won the game 16-11. With only 5 matches remaining, Uni retained the Varsity Championship for 2013, also doing so before the Easter break. After the holidays, and with only pride to play for, Trent gave an impressive performance at Meadow Lane for the football. The women's match ended 1-0 to Trent who just outplayed their opponents. For the men's match, Trent continued their momentum to take {{the game in the}} second-half, scoring two goals and resigning Uni to another defeat in consecutive years. A few days later, however, at the rugby union matches, Uni's team found the form absent from the football. The uni women's team showed a clear dominance of the Trent team, beating them by a resounding 34-17. Immediately following, the men's match again carried Uni's momentum as Trent fell apart, costing them needed points. The final score reflected the <b>ill-form</b> of Trent as Uni stormed to victory, 22-3. The series wrapped up with Cricket at Clifton campus. Trent were able to beat Uni by 56 runs and claim one final consolation point. This left the final Varsity score as 10-5 to Uni, making the series victory the largest since 2004 and the first time Uni won the series before the summer term.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{source of}} {{mistakes}} is type confusions, {{in which a}} predicate of a kind {{is used as a}} predicate of another kind. For example, the pseudo-statements [...] "we know the Nothing" [...] is analogous to [...] "we know the rain", but while the latter is well-formed, the former is <b>ill-formed,</b> at least in a logically constructed language, because [...] "Nothing" [...] is incorrectly used as a noun. In a formal language, [...] "Nothing" [...] only means , such as [...] "there is nothing which is outside"—i.e., , and thus [...] "Nothing" [...] never occurs as a noun or as a predicate.|$|E
2500|$|A member {{function}} {{can also}} be made [...] "pure virtual" [...] by appending it with = 0 after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an abstract class. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is <b>ill-formed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} pseudo-statements in which occur only {{meaningful}} words; these pseudo-statements are formed in a counter-syntactical way. An {{example is the}} word sequence [...] "Caesar is a prime number"; every word has a definite meaning, but the sequence has no meaning. The problem is that [...] "prime number" [...] is a predicate of numbers, not a predicate of human beings. In the example the nonsense is evident; however, in natural language the rules of grammar do not prohibit the formation of analogous meaningless word sequences that are not so easily detectable. In the grammar of natural languages, every sequence of the kind [...] "x is y", where x is a noun and y is a predicate, is acceptable. In fact, in the grammar there is no distinction between predicate which can be affirmed of human beings and predicate which can be affirmed of numbers. So [...] "Caesar is a general" [...] and [...] "Caesar is a prime number" [...] are both well-formed, in contrast for example with [...] "Caesar is and", which is <b>ill-formed.</b> In a logically constructed language—says Carnap—a distinction between the various kinds of predicate is specified, and pseudo-statements as [...] "Caesar is a prime number" [...] are <b>ill-formed.</b> Now, {{and this is the}} main point of Carnap's argument, metaphysical statements in which meaningless words do not occur, are indeed meaningless because they are formed in a way which is admissible in natural languages, but not in logically constructed languages. Carnap attempts to indicate the most frequent sources of errors from which metaphysical pseudo-statements can arise. One source of mistakes is the ambiguity of the verb [...] "to be", which is sometimes used as a copula ("I am hungry"), and sometimes to designate existence ("I am"). The latter statement incorrectly suggests a predicative form, and thus it suggests that existence is a predicate. Only modern logic, with the introduction of an explicit sign to designate existence (the sign [...] ), which occurs only in statements such as , never as a predicate, has shown that existence is not a predicate, and thus has revealed the logical error from which pseudo-statements such as [...] "cogito, ergo sum" [...] has arisen.|$|E

60|$|On recalling my own {{recollections}} {{during my}} journey I may note that I found great pleasure in my companion's conversation, {{as well as}} in her mode of managing all her little concerns on the road.

The ascent of Stainmore seemed duller and longer than usual, and Bowes, which used to strike me as a distinguished feature, seemed an <b>ill-formed</b> mass of rubbish, a great deal lower than I had supposed; yet I have seen it twenty times at least.

60|$|The {{belief that}} twiners {{have a natural}} {{tendency}} to grow spirally, probably arose from their assuming a spiral form when wound round a support, and from the extremity, even whilst remaining free, sometimes assuming this form. The free internodes of vigorously growing plants, when they cease to revolve, become straight, and show no tendency to be spiral; but when a shoot has nearly ceased to grow, or when the plant is unhealthy, the extremity does occasionally become spiral. I have seen this in a remarkable manner with {{the ends of the}} shoots of the Stauntonia and of the allied Akebia, which became wound up into a close spire, just like a tendril; and this was apt to occur after some small, <b>ill-formed</b> leaves had perished. The explanation, I believe, is, that in such cases the lower parts of the terminal internodes very gradually and successively lose their power of movement, whilst the portions just above move onwards and in their turn become motionless; and this ends in forming an irregular spire.|$|E

And if there was any flaw whatever in her attention to Miss Alimony's stirring talk, it was because she was keeping a little look-out in the tail of her eye for the reappearance of the men, and more particularly for the reappearance of Mr. Brumley with whom she had a peculiar feeling of uncompleted relations. And at last the men came and she caught his glance and saw that her feeling was reciprocated.|$|E

When I add that he distinctly refused to visit the Palaeontologic Museum, that he saw nothing of our new hydraulic apparatus, or of our classes in Domestic Science, his judgment that we had here a great institution seems a little bit superficial. I can only put beside it, to redeem it in some measure, the hasty and <b>ill-formed</b> judgment expressed by Lord Milner, [...] "McGill is a noble university": and the rash and indiscreet expression of the Prince of Wales, when we gave him an LL.D. degree, [...] "McGill has a glorious future." ...|$|E
60|$|Such was the {{situation}} of Greece and Italy from a very remote period. The Gauls and other Northern nations, envious of their wealth, and despising the effeminacy of their manners, often invaded them with, numerous, though <b>ill-formed</b> armies. But their greatest and most frequent attempts were against Italy, their connection with which country alone we shall here consider. In the course of these wars, {{the superiority of the}} Roman discipline over the Gallic ferocity was at length demonstrated. The Gauls, notwithstanding the numbers with which their irruptions were made, and the impetuous courage by which that nation was distinguished, had no permanent success. They were altogether unskilful either in improving their victories or repairing their defeats. But the Romans, being governed by a most wise order of men, perfected by a traditionary experience in the policy of conquest, drew some advantage from every turn of fortune, and, victorious or vanquished, persisted in one uniform and comprehensive plan of breaking to pieces everything which endangered their safety or obstructed their greatness. For, after having more than once expelled the Northern invaders out of Italy, they pursued them over the Alps; and carrying the war into the country of their enemy, under several able generals, and at last under Caius Cæsar, they reduced all the Gauls from the Mediterranean Sea to the Rhine and the Ocean. During the progress of this decisive war, some of the maritime nations of Gaul had recourse for assistance to the neighboring island of Britain. Prom thence they received considerable succors; by which means this island first came to be known with any exactness by the Romans, and first drew upon it the attention of that victorious people.|$|E
60|$|The breakfast {{had ever}} been a happy meal at Clawbonny. My father, though merely a ship-master, {{was one of the}} better class; and he had imbibed many notions, {{in the course of his}} {{different}} voyages, that placed him much in advance of the ordinary habits of his day and country. Then an American ship-master is usually superior to those of other countries. This arises from some of the peculiarities of our institutions, as well as from the circumstance that the navy is so small. Among other improvements, my father had broken in upon the venerable American custom of swallowing a meal as soon as out of bed. The breakfast at Clawbonny, from my earliest infancy, or as long as I can remember, had been eaten regularly at nine o'clock, a happy medium between the laziness of dissipation and the hurry of <b>ill-formed</b> habits. At that hour the whole family used to meet, still fresh from a night's repose, and yet enlivened and gay by an hour or two of exercise in the open air, instead of coming to the family board half asleep, with a sort of drowsy sulkiness, as, if the meal were a duty, and not a pleasure. We ate as leisurely as keen appetites would permit; laughed, chatted, related the events of the morning, conversed of our plans for the day, and indulged our several tastes and humours, like people who had been up and stirring, and not like so many drowsy drones swallowing our food for form's sake. The American breakfast has been celebrated by several modern writers, and it deserves to be, though certainly not to be compared to that of France. Still it might be far better than it is, did our people understand the mood in which it ought to be enjoyed.|$|E
