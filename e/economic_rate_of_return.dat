40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} some of {{the critical}} factors that determine project success inthe African Development Bank {{on the basis of}} data available on 146 projectscompleted by 1995. The analysis relies heavily on these observed data and doesnot take into account issues of project quality and implementation which haveassumed greater importance since 1995. The paper looks at the relationship betweenthe <b>economic</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> at appraisal and at completion for some 56 projectswhere such data were available. First, simple ordinary least squares models areused to explain {{some of the}} divergences in the <b>economic</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> at appraisaland completion stages. This is done by regressing <b>economic</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> atcompletion on the rates determined at appraisal.

An alternative specificationuses simple probit modeling techniques to assess the effect of a number of variableson the probability of project success.

The findings of the study suggest that the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> at appraisal are at bestweak indicators of project performance.

50|$|Electricity generation. A 2008 {{evaluation}} of the dam conducted by three financiers (EIB, German KfW and French AFD) concluded that the main benefit of the dam is the generation of hydropower, where the production of 740 GWh per year exceeded expectations of 540 GWh. About 55% of the electricity is used in Mali, 30% in Senegal and 15% in Mauritania. In 2006 in Mali more than 90% of all electricity generated came from Manantali, in Mauritania 34% and in Senegal 13%. The dam has not resolved the power problem of the three countries, where power outages regularly occur and the few existing industries have to produce their own power. As for the economic efficiency of the project, the European evaluation calculated an <b>economic</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> of the hydropower component of 8%. A World Bank evaluation even calculated an <b>economic</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> of 12 to 24%. The plant load factor of the planned hydropower plant - the expected electricity production divided by the potential production if the power plant was utilized permanently at full capacity, is 42% compared to 45-60% for other hdyropower plants. However, these economic benefits did not translate into financial benefits for two reasons: First, bulk electricity tariffs were set at {{only about half of}} production costs (4.7 Euro Cents/kWh compared to 8.8 Cents). Second, the national power utilities of the three countries that buy the electricity in bulk regularly pay only about half their bills. The entity in charge of operating the hydropower plant, SOGEM, thus accumulates deficits. A Hydrology Risk Fund was to be gradually replenished in order to pay for operating costs of the plant {{in the case of a}} revenue shortfall due to drought. The Fund received only limited contributions, since the payments earmarked for the fund were instead used for rural electrification in areas near the power transmission lines in response to pressure from local communities.|$|E

Settlers were allocated tenancies of 1,3 ha of which 1,25 ha were for field crops and 0,05 for garden vegetables. An ingenious cropping pattern would make it possible for the tenants to grow 1,25 ha cotton and 0,625 ha maize intercropped with cow peas each year. The total cost of the project was US $91,7 m (Kshs 766 m). Financiers were the IBRD (US $34m), IDA (US $ 6m), EDF (US $12m), Netherlands (US $8,8m), ODM (US$8,5m) and CDC (US $8,5m).

50|$|During {{the later}} 1930s and 1940s the colonial {{government}} was already concerned about population pressure and soil erosion.

As early as 1934 Harris and Sampson published their ‘Report on the Tana River Expedition’. In 1948 the colonial government published a study on two 40,000 ha schemes between Bura and Grand Falls. Due to the remoteness and poor soils these projects were uneconomic. In 1956 the government started Hola Pilot Irrigation Project about 40 km south of Bura.From 1963 to 1967 the FAO oversaw the Lower Tana River Basin study. This study was carried out by Ilaco and Acres (two engineering firms) and they proposed to start an irrigation project of minimally 100,000 ha. However, with an <b>economic</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> of 10% the study showed that the project was economically marginal.

The reconstruction efforts would be aimed at improving access of rural communities to social and productive infrastructure and services.

50|$|Whereas {{the formal}} {{agreements}} between Kenya and the World Bank were signed in June 1977 the implementation was delayed {{due to a}} number of factors. Firstly Kenya and the consultants needed about 10 months before they could agree on a new consultancy contract. The outcome of these negotiations was that the consultancy cost almost doubled. Secondly, during the preparation of the final designs, major modifications were made by the consultants on both the intake and the irrigation structure. These changes caused not only new delays, but also, for instance, an increase of concrete structures in the main canal with 138%, stone pitching with 338% and digging with 255%. In 1979 the World Bank concluded that both the original design of Ilaco and MacDonald’s design were based on sound engineering principles. Rejection of the new design would have resulted in further delays and fearing further delays the World Bank accepted the new design. According to the World Bank, however, design changes would result in a cost increase of 65% in real terms. At that time the <b>economic</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> of the project was at best 4%.

50|$|Afghanistan as a {{landlocked}} country needs more diversified transit policy. Alternative routes and corridors are always helpful for the domestic economy {{as well as}} regional connectivity. This was the biggest motivation for Waissi to initiate an alternative transit route, later called the Lapis Lazuli Transit and Transport Route. His ideas was accepted by Jawed Ludin, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Afghanistan and later by Zarar Ahmad Osmani, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan. Waissi was being appointed immediately by Minister Osmani to follow with the concerned counties and coordinate to become party of the this initiative. Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia immediately joined and Turkey was the last country to become as a party to this initiative. In early 2014 Waissi {{and a team of}} experts from the Afghan Government started the negotiation from Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. Waissi was leading the negotiation for the agreement on behalf of Afghan Government. The Lapis-Lazuli Transit & Transport Route (known as the 'Lapis Lazuli Route') agreement aims to enhance regional economic cooperation and connectivity between the countries of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, thereby expanding economic and cultural links between Europe and Asia. In doing so, the initiative seeks to improve transport infrastructure and procedures (including for road, rail, and sea), increase exports, and expand the economic opportunities of citizens in countries benefiting from this new transport corridor. Barriers to regional trade and transit and transaction costs will be reduced, in part, through a new Custom Integration Procedure and, between Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, a new Cross-Border Transport Agreement. Its projected impact is considerable not only because most of the needed infrastructure is already in place, but also because most of the investment required will focus on improving policy and governance.The <b>Economic</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Return</b> and Net Present Value still need to be established, but with a discount rate applied at 12%, the overall returns are expected to be positive.

50|$|In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank {{approved}} Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project (BISP) in Kenya. The {{project area}} is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin. It {{lies on the}} west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County. The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya, the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area, create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange. Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 ½ year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya. Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population, expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985. The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices.Actual construction started in 1978. During implementation the costs exploded from $17,500/= per family to $55,000/=, a new record for the World Bank. The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network (615%). The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha, although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha. In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme. They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha. Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas.Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives. Job creation was only 40% of the target, the <b>economic</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits. Even with net farm incomes of about 40% of the appraisal estimates in real terms, annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler. The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems.After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops. Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme, living on famine relief and odd jobs. In the period 1993-2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project, but all in vain. After 2005, rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009-10 the tenants have been growing crops, although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50% of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes, if any. This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop, cotton, is no longer a profitable crop.|$|E

Using the Blinder-Oaxaca method, the gross gender difference in earnings is decomposed into the part that is explained by men and women's differential characteristics and the part that is due to labour market discrimination. The results reveal that there is substantial omitted family background bias in the estimates <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> and that, contrary to received wisdom, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> to education rise by education level. The analysis suggests that, as well as overall labour girls face significantly lower <b>economic</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> to education than boys.

Productivity increase in agriculture is an effective driver of economic growth and poverty reduction {{both within and outside}} agricultural sectors. Such productivity increase depends on good rural infrastructure, well functioning domestic markets, appropriate institutions, and access to appropriate technology.

In spite of the well documented importance of rural infrastructure to promote growth and poverty alleviation, high <b>economic</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to investments in rural infrastructure, and significant deficiencies of rural infrastructure in most developing countries, neither national governments nor international aid agencies seem to prioritize investments in the construction of new infrastructure and maintenance of existing infrastructure. Much of the required investment is of...|$|R
