40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{this animal}} study is to assess fasting-induced changes in {{myocardial}} substrate metabolism and energy status {{as a consequence of}} mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation deficiency, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Carbon- 13 ((13) C) MRS of hyperpolarized [1 -(13) C]pyruvate was used to assess in vivo pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity <b>in</b> fed and <b>fasted</b> wild-type (WT) mice and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (LCAD KO) mice. PDH activity decreased after <b>fasting</b> <b>in</b> both genotypes, but was 2. 7 -fold higher <b>in</b> <b>fasted</b> LCAD KO mice compared with fasted WT mice. Incorporation of the (13) C label into the myocardial malate and aspartate pools <b>in</b> <b>fasted</b> LCAD KO mice demonstrates enhanced activity of anaplerotic pathways <b>in</b> <b>fasted</b> LCAD KO hearts.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} urinary {{catecholamine}} excretion <b>in</b> <b>fasting</b> differs <b>in</b> pregnant and nonpregnant rats, {{which suggests that}} the sympathoadrenal response to fasting is altered by pregnancy. <b>In</b> <b>fasting</b> nonpregnant animals, urinary norepinephrine (NE) excretion decreases and epinephrine (E) excretion remains unchanged, whereas the excretion of both catecholamines rises significantly with refeeding. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>fasting</b> third-trimester pregnant rats exhibit a 420 % increase in urinary E and a 345 % increase in urinary NE, elevations which fall with refeeding. Specific evaluation of sympathoadrenal activity <b>in</b> <b>fasting</b> pregnant rats reveals stimulation of the adrenal medulla and suppression of sympathetic nerves. <b>In</b> <b>fasting</b> third-trimester rats the adrenal content of E is 37 % lower in innervated adrenals as compared with contralateral denervated glands, which indicates the presence of neurally-mediated adrenal medullary activation. Adrenalectomy completely abolishes the fasting-induced rise in urinary E and NE in pregnant rats. Studies with 2 -deoxy-D-glucose suggest that stimulation of the adrenal medulla results from hypoglycemia, which is present after 3 d of <b>fasting</b> <b>in</b> pregnant rats (plasma glucose 36. 7 mg/dl). Sympathetic nervous system activity, as measured by [3 H]NE turnover in the heart, decreases <b>in</b> <b>fasting</b> pregnant rats despite hypoglycemia, a response similar to that seen <b>in</b> <b>fasting</b> nonpregnant animals where plasma glucose is maintained above 50 mg/dl.

5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{metabolic}} profiles {{have been}} associated with chronic disease risk, lack of temporal stability of metabolite levels could limit their use in epidemiological investigations. The present study aims to evaluate the reliability over a two-year period of 158 metabolites and compare reliability over time <b>in</b> <b>fasting</b> and non-fasting serum samples. METHODS: Metabolites were measured with the AbsolueIDQp 180 kit (Biocrates, Innsbruck, Austria) by mass spectrometry and included acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. Measurements were performed on repeat serum samples collected two years apart <b>in</b> 27 <b>fasting</b> men from Turin, Italy, and 39 non-fasting women from Utrecht, The Netherlands, all participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Reproducibility was assessed by estimating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: <b>In</b> <b>fasting</b> samples, a median ICC of 0. 70 was observed.

5|$|Alamo Force was {{responsible}} for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational. This date also gave the landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals. As Arawe {{was believed to be}} only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than the one which had been intended for the landing at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at Goodenough Island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat. After the landing, holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft ammunition, for which a 10-day supply was thought necessary. The assault force and its supplies were to be carried <b>in</b> <b>fast</b> ships which could rapidly unload their cargo.|$|E

Johnston typically delivered pace after the Lindwall and Miller had first use of the new ball, before resorting to spin later in the innings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define and {{quantify}} patterns of normal jejunal myoelectrical activity in the conscious neonatal pig. Twelve 3 -day-old piglets were obtained from a local herd. At 7 days of age four bipolar Ag-AgCl electrodes were surgically implanted at 5 cm intervals on the jejunum. Piglets were divided into fed (n = 7) and fasted (n = 5) groups and a minimum of four daily recordings were made from each pig between 7 and 14 days of age. Slow wave and spike activity were seen in all animals. Slow waves occurred at a frequency of 17. 0 +/- 0. 3 cycles/min (c. p. m.) in fed and 16. 8 +/- 0. 2 c. p. m. <b>in</b> <b>fasted</b> piglets. Spike activity predominated, occurring in characteristic migrating myoelectrical complexes (m. m. c. s.) and occupying 79 % of the recording time in fed and 73 % <b>in</b> <b>fasted</b> piglets (P less than 0. 05). The activity front (phase 3) of the m. m. c. recurred every 47. 7 +/- 2. 4 min in fed, and 50. 9 +/- 2. 3 min <b>in</b> <b>fasted</b> piglets. The m. m. c. periodicity in both groups was irregular, with a range of 4 - 145 min in fed, and 8 - 104 min <b>in</b> <b>fasted</b> piglets.
