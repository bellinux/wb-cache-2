40|$|<b>Dissecting</b> aneurysms of the {{intracranial}} arteries are exceedingly rare vascular lesions {{that can}} produce acute cerebral or brain stem infarction in young healthy adults.

Both <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms were located distal to PICA origin. Both the patients developed post operative lower cranial nerve paresis and one developed lateral medullary syndrome, which improved subsequently. <b>Dissecting</b> aneurysms presenting with bleed should be surgically managed by trapping and excising the involved segment sparing the PICA origin or by interventional radiological techniques.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Dissecting</b> vertebrobasilar aneurysms are {{challenging}} to treat, and standard treatment modalities remain controversial. We retrospectively evaluated our experience using endovascular techniques to treat these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 1997 to December 2007, 42 patients with intradural vertebrobasilar <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms underwent endovascular treatment. Twenty-nine patients had ruptured aneurysms, and 13 patients had unruptured <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms. The endovascular modal-ities for vertebrobasilar <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms were the following: 1) trapping (n 30), 2) proximal occlusion (n 3), 3) stent with coil (n 6), and 4) stent alone (n 3). RESULTS: Seventeen of the 29 patients with ruptured vertebrobasilar <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms had successful outcomes without procedural complications following endovascular treatment. Procedure-related complications were the following: 1) rebleeding (n 3), 2) posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory infarction (n 6), 3) brain stem infarction (n 2), and 4) thromboembolism-related multiple infarctions (n 1). Clinical outcomes were favorable in 32 patients (76. 1 %).

5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum).

Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains.

In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly <b>dissected</b> to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly <b>dissected</b> than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{endovascular}} {{strategy of}} the huge <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms involving the basilar artery (BA) is controversial and challenging. This {{study was to investigate}} the clinical and angiographic outcomes of the treatment of the huge <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms involving the BA by the internal trapping (IT) technique. Methods: We retrospectively studied 15 patients with the huge <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms involving the BA treated by the IT technique between September 2005 and September 2014 in Department of Interventional Neuroradiology of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Clinical and angiographic data were reviewed and evaluated. Results: All patients were treated by the IT technique. That meant the <b>dissecting</b> artery and aneurysm segments were completed occlusion. After the procedure, the angiography demonstrated that all the <b>dissecting</b> artery and aneurysm segments were completed occlusion. Follow-up angiography was performed at 3 - 6 months or 12 - 18 months after the endovascular treatment (median 8 months), 14 patients had a good recovery. Re-canalization occurred in one patient whose aneurysm involved in bilateral vertebral arteries and the two third of the middle-lower BA. After the second treatment, the patient died by the ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions: The IT technique is a technically feasible and safe alternative for the treatment of BA <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms, but it is not necessarily the safest or most definitive treatment modality. The ideal treatment of the huge <b>dissecting</b> aneurysms involving the BA remains debatable and must be investigated on a case-by-case basis...|$|R
