5|$|Pakistan {{is part of}} {{the active}} tectonic belt which is {{responsible}} for the formation of the Himalayas following the collision of India and Asia. As a result of this activity, <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration and <b>hydrothermal</b> activity are expected to be widespread in Pakistan. Koh-i-Sultan is the youngest volcano in Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{researchers}} were continually met by clouds of sulfide and sulfate. The sudden collapse of Pele's Vents caused a large discharge of <b>hydrothermal</b> material. The presence of certain indicator minerals in the mixture suggested temperatures exceeded 250°C, {{a record for}} an underwater volcano. The composition of the materials {{was similar to that}} of black smokers, the <b>hydrothermal</b> vent plumes located along mid-ocean ridges. Samples from mounds built by discharges from the <b>hydrothermal</b> plumes resembled white smokers.|$|E
5|$|Various {{parts of}} the main volcano have been {{subjected}} to <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration. The Azufrera stage edifice was subject to the most alteration; especially in the summit area and between the Angulo and Azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits. The central part of the complex is heavily altered by fumarole activity. <b>Hydrothermal</b> alteration may be driven by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting <b>hydrothermal</b> circulation in overlying rocks.|$|E
5|$|A {{recently}} discovered carnivorous sponge that lives near <b>hydrothermal</b> vents hosts methane-eating bacteria, and digests some of them.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), <b>hydrothermal</b> synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the <b>hydrothermal</b> method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E

5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove <b>Hydrothermal</b> Field, , {{elevation}} −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion <b>Hydrothermal</b> Field, , elevation −3047m), {{are three}} <b>hydrothermal</b> vents {{of the black}} smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002. These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407°C were recorded {{at one of these}} vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464°C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>hydrothermal</b> {{activity}} remains {{along the}} lake floor, suggesting {{that at some}} time in the future Mazama may erupt once again.|$|E

5|$|Myanmar Engineering Society has {{identified}} at least 39 locations (in Myanmar) capable of geothermal power production {{and some of}} these <b>hydrothermal</b> reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a significant underutilized resource.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2017, NASA {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} possible <b>hydrothermal</b> activity on Enceladus' sub-surface ocean floor. In 2015, the Cassini probe made a close fly-by of Enceladus' south pole, flying within 48.3km (30mi) of the surface, {{as well as through}} a plume in the process. A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of <b>hydrothermal</b> activity beneath the surface. It has been speculated that such activity could be a potential oasis of habitability.|$|E
5|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that life exists on Europa, but Europa has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean <b>hydrothermal</b> vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic <b>hydrothermal</b> activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|Sulfur {{deposits}} {{generated from}} <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration are found on Cerro Tuzgle. They are mostly {{associated with the}} Azufre synthem and were previously mined on the southern, eastern and western flanks of the volcano. The mines are now abandoned. Arsenic {{is also found in}} the groundwater and presumably comes from Tuzgle.|$|E
5|$|There are no dates {{available}} for post-caldera lava domes, which probably arose from magma ascending through the caldera forming conduits, seeing as these domes are found only inside the caldera. The elevated temperatures of the caldera lake suggest that <b>hydrothermal</b> activity still occurs beneath Incapillo.|$|E
5|$|Two {{abandoned}} sulfur mines can {{be found}} {{north and south of}} Llullaillaco. The northern mine is known as Azufrera Esperanto and associated with an area of <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration. A path or road leads up to that mine from northwest.|$|E
5|$|Upon death, whale {{carcasses}} fall to {{the deep}} ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and <b>hydrothermal</b> vents.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the <b>hydrothermal</b> vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E
5|$|Although lithium {{is widely}} {{distributed}} on Earth, {{it does not}} naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity. The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near <b>hydrothermal</b> vents.|$|E
5|$|Boron has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in <b>hydrothermal</b> systems, and during <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have <b>hydrothermal</b> vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world. The conductive heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, <b>hydrothermal</b> circulation or a combination of these.|$|E
5|$|Polychaetes occur {{throughout}} the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the surface, to the deepest oceanic trenches. The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2–3cm specimen (still unclassified) of polychaete {{at the bottom}} of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009. There are more than 10,000 described species of polychaetes; they can be found in nearly every marine environment. Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the hadal zone, while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to <b>hydrothermal</b> vents.|$|E
5|$|Tehama started life some 600,000 years ago. At {{its peak}} activity, it reached {{approximately}} 3,350meters (11,000ft) high, with a basal diameter of approximately 12kilometers. Volcanic activity then declined 400,000 years ago, with other volcanic lava domes forming {{at the edges}} of Mount Tehama later on, the largest and best known of which is Lassen Peak. A combination of continued <b>hydrothermal</b> activity and erosion, particularly by glaciers during ice ages, removed the central cone of the volcano, leaving a large caldera, the northern edge of which can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes {{a source of}} heat. Depending {{on the amount of}} tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving <b>hydrothermal</b> activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some <b>hydrothermal</b> vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrothermal</b> {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|Marine life inhabiting {{the waters}} around Lōʻihi {{is not as}} diverse as life at other, less active seamounts. Fish found living near Lōʻihi include the Celebes {{monkfish}} (Sladenia remiger), {{and members of the}} Cutthroat eel family, Synaphobranchidae. Invertebrates identified in the area include two species endemic to the <b>hydrothermal</b> vents, a bresiliid shrimp (Opaepele loihi) of the family Alvinocarididae (described in 1995), and a tube or pogonophoran worm. Dives conducted after the 1996 earthquake swarms were unable to find either the shrimp or the worm, and it is not known if there are lasting effects on these species.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} {{only a tiny fraction}} of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near <b>hydrothermal</b> vents and cold seeps.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can {{be accounted for by}} a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted from a pool of magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion {{can be explained by the}} presence of <b>hydrothermal</b> vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused <b>hydrothermal</b> {{alteration}} of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be visible from ASTER satellite image but barely visible from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} metal and sulfur in VMS {{deposits}} {{is a combination of}} incompatible elements which are leached from the volcanic pile in the sub-seafloor <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration zone by <b>hydrothermal</b> circulation. <b>Hydrothermal</b> circulation is generally considered to be driven via heat in the crust often related to deep-seated gabbro intrusions.|$|E
25|$|Transport {{of metals}} occurs via {{convection}} of <b>hydrothermal</b> fluids, the heat for this {{supplied by the}} magma chamber which sits below the volcanic edifice. Cool ocean water is drawn into the <b>hydrothermal</b> zone and is heated by the volcanic rock and is then expelled into the ocean, the process enriching the <b>hydrothermal</b> fluid in sulfur and metal ions.|$|E
25|$|Spectacular <b>hydrothermal</b> {{features}} {{are a part}} of the Richat Structure. They include the extensive <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration of rhyolites and gabbros and a central megabreccia created by <b>hydrothermal</b> dissolution and collapse. The siliceous megabreccia is at least 40m thick in its center to only a few meters thick along its edges. The breccia consists of fragments of white to dark gray cherty material, quartz-rich sandstone, diagenetic cherty nodules, and stromatolitic limestone and is intensively silicified. The <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration, which created this breccia, has been dated to have occurred about 98.2 ± 2.6million years ago using the 40Ar/39Ar method.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>hydrothermal</b> vents {{and cold}} seeps differ also in many ways. Compared {{to the more}} stable cold seeps, vents are {{characterized}} by locally high temperatures, strongly fluctuating temperatures, pH, sulfide and oxygen concentrations, often the absence of sediments, a relatively young age, and often unpredictable conditions, such as waxing and waning of vent fluids or volcanic eruptions. Unlike <b>hydrothermal</b> vents, which are volatile and ephemeral environments, cold seeps emit at a slow and dependable rate. Likely owing to the cooler temperatures and stability, many cold seep organisms are much longer-lived than those inhabiting <b>hydrothermal</b> vents.|$|E
25|$|Depending on <b>hydrothermal</b> treatment, {{buckwheat}} groats contain 7–37% of resistant starch.|$|E
