40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a wider study that seeks to {{ascertain}} the types of internal and external labour market practices {{and the extent to which}} labour market arrangements vary between three divisions of the Australian and New Zealand affiliate of an <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>banking</b> institution, BZW/ABN AMRO. Building on earlier work of Althauser and Kalleberg (1981, 1989), this research explores the workings of the internal and external labour market by adopting an integrative internal labour market framework that goes beyond the three-featured model espoused by Althauser and Kalleberg (1981, 1989) and that emphasises recruitment rather than selection criteria. However, this paper will elaborate on the organisation’s recruitment and selection policy and practices. More specifically, by adopting an internal labour market construct the paper will seek to analyse the recruitment and selection practices in the three divisions of the <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>banking</b> affiliate and it will ascertain the importance of selection criteria for differentiating internal labour market types. It will also highlight how these practices vary from the perceptions held by both management and employees and from the ideal types outlined in the typology. The paper concludes by emphasising the significance of expanding the internal labour market typology to include selection criteria for the purpose of differentiating labour market types in an <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>banking</b> institution. 1...|$|R
