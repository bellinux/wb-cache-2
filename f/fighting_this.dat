5|$|The {{increased}} use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security in the saddle when <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> {{may have led to}} greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups. In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup, and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013 {{one of the}} Globemasters {{which was}} {{deployed}} to the Middle East was, along with a RAAF Hercules, tasked with flying peacekeepers into South Sudan to reinforce the United Nations force there following an outbreak of <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> airlift was completed in mid-January, by which time the Australian C-17 had made eight flights into South Sudan from Brindisi in Italy and Djibouti. During September and December 2014, RAAF Globemasters flew five sorties into Iraq to deliver weapons and ammunition destined for Iraqi forces fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Following the deployment of Australian fighter aircraft in late 2014 to attack ISIL forces as part of Operation Okra, C-17s have also conducted regular flights from Australia to the Middle East carrying munitions and specialised equipment.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{elements}} of the battalion suffered similar problems, however; on the same day, 9 January, B Company destroyed eleven German tanks advancing on the village of Rittershoffen, with four more the next day, while another section working with the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion in Hatten nearby accounted for nine. These units remained with the infantry in the village for several days, unable to withdraw, and acquitted themselves well in close <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> {{was all the more}} of an achievement when it was considered that, leaving disciplinary problems aside, the battalion suffered from major training deficiencies and was entirely combat inexperienced. One member of the battalion was awarded the Silver Star, while the 79th Division recommended a crew which had fought in Hatten to receive Bronze Stars—it is unclear if these were ever awarded.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} the war {{delineated}} itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed {{the bulk of the}} scouting and <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> pattern was radically changed in 1986, {{towards the end of the}} war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad. This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{casualties}} for {{the battle}} are {{almost impossible to}} estimate precisely {{due to a lack}} of records. It is difficult to determine how many South Korean citizens were forcibly conscripted during the battle and how many deserted as opposed to being killed. Larger engagements destroyed entire regiments and even divisions of North Korean troops, and their strength had to be estimated based on accounts of North Koreans captured by the UN. On September 1, the North Korean army numbered approximately 97,850 in South Korea, and up to one third of this number is suspected to have been conscripts from South Korea. In the aftermath of the Pusan Perimeter battle, only 25,000 or 30,000 of these soldiers returned to North Korea by the end of the month. Upwards of one third of the attacking force became casualties in the <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> would mean North Korean casualties from September 1 to 15 could range from roughly 41,000 to 36,000 killed and captured, with an unknown number of wounded. With the addition of the 5,690 killed in the Bowling Alley, 3,500 at the Naktong Bulge, at least 3,700 at Taegu and an unknown number at P'ohang-dong before September 1, North Korean casualties likely topped 50,000 to 60,000 by the end of the battle. They also lost 239 T-34 tanks and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns; virtually all of the armor they possessed.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally Xing Yi was {{an armed}} art.

Weapon diversity is great in many lineages, with the idea being that an experienced Xing Yi fighter would be able to pick up almost any weapon available (or an object to use as such) irrespective of its exact length, weight and shape.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the entry}} into the war was clearly {{political}} opportunism, {{which led to a}} lack of consistency in planning, with principal objectives and enemies being changed with little regard for the consequences. Mussolini was well aware of the military and material deficiencies but thought the war would be over soon and did not expect to do much <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> led to confusion amongst ordinary Italians and soldiers who had little idea of what they were fighting for and, hence, had little conviction and saw little justification for it. As the war progressed and one disaster followed another, Comando Supremo were forced to take more serious steps in their planning.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{territorial}} {{of their}} roosts, and will often fight other intruding males {{by means of}} boxing. Males follow a pattern of behavioral stages before <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> entails ear movements, head lifts, neck craning, wing unfolding, punch mimicking, and finally boxing with each other. Even though this is aggressive behavior, either male is allowed to stop fighting and leave the conflict, and injuries usually aren't worse than a few scrapes and bruises. It is also shown that males use distinct vocalizations during conflicts, which {{might be used to}} determine the identity of the competitor, and based on that information, parts of the pre-fighting stages can be skipped, and the animals will begin boxing.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the War of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1651), the English Rump Parliament {{sent the}} New Model Army to Ireland to subdue and take revenge on the Catholic {{population}} of the country and also to prevent Royalists loyal to Charles II from using Ireland as a base to threaten England. The force was initially under the command of Oliver Cromwell and it was later under the command of other parliamentary generals. The Army sought to secure the country, but also to confiscate the lands of Irish families that had been involved in the <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> became a continuation of the Elizabethan policy of encouraging Protestant settlement of Ireland, because the Protestant New Model army soldiers could be paid in confiscated lands rather than in cash.|$|E
25|$|Operation Hammer {{concluded}} by 09:00 on 8 June {{with one}} final sweep carried out that morning {{to ensure that}} Binh Ba was clear. By this time a large communist force had been defeated by the Australians, and the village practically destroyed. Indeed, Binh Ba was so badly damaged {{that many of the}} villagers whose homes were destroyed were subsequently resettled {{with the help of the}} 1st Australian Civil Affairs Unit. Despite efforts to clear the village of civilians before the battle, a large but unknown number of civilians had undoubtedly died during the <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> fact, coupled with the one-sided casualty count, later led to claims in the media of an Australian atrocity. One Australian had been killed and 10 wounded, while communist losses included at least 107 killed, six wounded and eight captured.|$|E
25|$|The Can-Am Police and Fire Games are a multi-sport competition, {{exclusive}} {{to members of}} law enforcement and fire <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> competition features sports common to the Olympic Games, but is unique in that it also features competitions specific to various duties of a police officer or fire fighter. The participants are generally drawn from police services or fire departments from across Canada and the United States. However, some members from Europe and Australia have participated, as well as members of Canada Border Services Agency and the various law enforcement agencies of the United States Department of Justice.

25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{was achieved}} in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on <b>fighting</b> <b>this.</b> Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, {{president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working {{under the influence of}} male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves. Arguments employed by antisuffragists {{at the turn of the}} century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.|$|E
25|$|Following a truce (declared on 11 July 1921), a {{negotiated}} peace {{known as the}} Anglo-Irish Treaty between Britain and Ireland was signed. It created a self-governing twenty-six county Irish state, known as the Irish Free State. However it also disestablished the Irish Republic, which many in the nationalist movement and the IRA in particular felt they were bound by oath to uphold. This triggered {{the outbreak of the}} Irish Civil War of 1922–23, when the intransigent republicans took up arms against those who had accepted a compromise with the British. The Civil war began in Dublin, where Anti-Treaty forces under Rory O'Connor took over the Four Courts and several other buildings in April 1922, hoping to provoke the British into restarting the <b>fighting.</b> <b>This</b> put the Free State, led by Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith into the dilemma of facing British military re-occupation or fighting their own former comrades in the Four Courts.|$|E
25|$|From October 2003 to May 2005, West Africa {{faced the}} largest desert locust {{outbreak}} in 15 years. The upsurge started as small independent outbreaks that developed in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Sudan {{in the autumn}} of 2003. Two days of unusually heavy rains that stretched from Dakar, Senegal to Morocco in October allowed breeding conditions to remain favourable {{for the next six months}} and the desert locusts rapidly increased. Lack of rain and cold temperatures in the winter breeding area of northwest Africa in early 2005 slowed the development of the locusts and allowed the locust control agencies to stop the cycle. During the upsurge, nearly 130,000km² were treated by ground and aerial operations in more than 20 countries. The costs of <b>fighting</b> <b>this</b> upsurge have been estimated by the FAO to have exceeded US$400 million, and harvest losses were valued at up to US$2.5 billion, which had disastrous effects on the food security situation in West Africa.|$|E
