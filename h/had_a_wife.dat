Her father, Juan Duarte, was descended from French Basque immigrants, meanwhile her mother Juana Ibarguren, was descended from Spanish Basque immigrants.

At {{that time in}} rural Argentina, {{it was not uncommon}} for a wealthy man to have multiple families.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Jacques became a nurse in the VAD; she served in a mobile unit in London, attending bombed sites during the Blitz. After a reorganisation in the VAD, Jacques sought new work and, in the summer of 1943, she became a welder in a factory in north London, a job that lasted {{until the end of the}} year. Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and children in the United States when he had proposed to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.|$|E
50|$|Here, the presupposition {{triggered}} by the expression my <b>wife</b> (that I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife)</b> is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife.</b> In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence does imply that I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|R

5|$|During this visit, Parry and {{his friends}} who had {{accompanied}} him to Wales travelled the country giving concerts of Parry's own works. They were well received throughout the land. Parry was offered the opportunity to study for a year under Dr Davies of Swansea, followed by a one-year scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. He had to refuse both offers since he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and child in the United States dependent on him for support. By 1865, Parry's musical ability had become well known in Wales and in the United States. A fund was established to support Parry and his family while he studied music; donations were received from both countries. Parry aided his own cause by giving concerts in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife.</b> She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife,</b> Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E

5|$|Several StarCraft novels also feature Raynor; he is a {{prominent}} character in Liberty's Crusade, which reveals that Raynor <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and son. His son exhibited psychic potential and consequently is conscripted for the Confederate ghost program, where the intense training ultimately kills him. Afterward, Raynor's wife Liddy dies {{after a period}} of depression and illness. As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in Queen of Blades, a novelization of the events of StarCrafts Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from the Zerg on Char and eventually allies with the high templar Tassadar and renegade dark templar Zeratul, facilitating the reconciliation between the two estranged Protoss.|$|E
5|$|Edward 'Ned' Trickett {{sought to}} win the Australian Championship from Rush. Trickett was outclassed by Rush at the 1874 and 1875 events, but {{afterwards}} competed at numerous regattas and in private matches, and his form was consistently improving. Trickett and his backers demanded that Rush contest the title on the Parramatta River where he won it from Hickey. Rush declined to row anywhere but on the Clarence River, and demanded that the stakes be not less than £500. By 1875, Rush <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and five children to support, {{as well as many}} business commitments, and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money, unless there was a chance of an adequate financial return. Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated the issue for nearly two years, as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush's stalling. Finally, former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of sculling events, offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World Sculling Championship, Englishman Joseph Sadler. Rush declined to travel to London. Trickett agreed to the journey, went to the Thames, beat Sadler, and brought home the World Championship to Australia. Rush challenged Trickett for the World title. Trickett demanded that the race be rowed on the Parramatta River, and the match came off on the afternoon of 30 June 1877.|$|E

Another late Welsh tradition was that Medrawd's wife was Gwenhwy(f)ach, sister of Gwenhwyfar.|$|E

25|$|At {{this period}} he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and family {{depending}} {{on him for}} support, and it speaks well for his abilities, {{that he was able}} to amply provide for them out of the profits solely derived from his literary labours. To do this he had to devote himself to work that could be quickly written, and readily sold. Accordingly, Dent produced no very long or ambitious work in England.|$|E
25|$|Aside from Sub-Zero's unmasked {{appearance}} in his Mortal Kombat II ending and his portrayal in , the character has primarily been portrayed or voiced by non-Asian actors. Midway later explained Sub-Zero's rather occidental appearance for a Chinese assassin by {{giving him a}} Caucasian mother. According to this new backstory, his father <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife,</b> two sons, and a daughter while he lived in America to hide his personal role as an assassin for the Lin Kuei.|$|E
