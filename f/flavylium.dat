5000|$|Anthocyanidins {{are common}} plant pigments. They are the {{sugar-free}} counterparts of anthocyanins {{based on the}} <b>flavylium</b> ion or 2-phenylchromenylium, which {{is a type of}} oxonium ion (chromenylium is referred also to as benzopyrylium). They form a large group of polymethine dye. In particular anthocyanidins are salt derivatives of the 2-phenylchromenylium cation, also known as <b>flavylium</b> cation. As shown in the figure below, the phenyl group at the 2-position can carry different substituents. The counterion of the <b>flavylium</b> cation is mostly chloride. With this positive charge, the anthocyanidins differ from other flavonoids.|$|E

30|$|Eight anthocyanidins, seven {{anthocyanins}} and two synthesized 4 ′-hydroxy <b>flavyliums</b> {{were evaluated}} {{and the results}} showed that most compounds had better activities than trolox and catechol [73]. The SAR study illustrated that, {{in the absence of the}} 3 -OH group, radicals of the 4, 5 or 7 -OH groups can only be stabilized by resonance through pyrylium oxygen, while 3 -OH group improved hydrogen atom donation. Catechol structure enhanced both hydrogen and electron donation and those compounds lacking the catechol structure had a decreasing order of H-atom and electron donation consistent with decreasing number of their hydroxyl and/or methoxy groups. This study provided novel insights into antiradical and reductant activities of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins.|$|R
40|$|As antocianinas compreendem o maior conjunto de pigmentos solúveis em água do reino vegetal. Responsáveis pelas cores vermelha, azul e roxa da maioria das frutas e flores, estas pertencem ao grupo dos flavonóides (polifenois). A cor apresentada por uma determinada antocianina depende do padrão de substituição, presença ou não de íons metálicos ou de outras moléculas capazes de estabilizar a cor, co-pigmentos, do pH local do meio e da natureza do microambiente em que a antocianina se encontra. Neste projeto, realizou-se um estudo de especiação e das propriedades antioxidantes de uma série de compostos análogos às antocianinas: os sais de 3 -́hidroxiflavílio (3 -́HF), 4 -́ hidroxiflavílio (4 -́HF), 7, 4 -dihidroxiflavílio (7, 4 -́DHF), 3,́ 4 -́dihidroxiflavílio (3,́ 4 -́DHF), 5, 7 -dihidroxi- 4 -metilflavílio (5, 7 -DH- 4 -MF), 7 -hidroxi- 4 -metilflavílio (7 -H- 4 -MF) e 7 - metoxi- 4 -metilflavílio (7 -metox- 4 -MF). No estudo de especiação, foram determinados o pK imediatamente após a preparação da amostra e o pKfinal após 1 dia. Para 3 -́HF, os valores do pK e pKfinal foram 2, 88 ± 0, 05 e 1, 94 ± 0, 15; para 4 -́HF, 4, 56 ± 0, 10 e 4, 23 ± 0, 20. Para os flavílios com dois grupos hidroxila ionizáveis, as constantes pK 1, pK 2, pK 1 final e pK 2 final para 7, 4 -́DHF foram 4, 12 ± 0, 07, 7, 85 ± 0, 01, 3, 29 ± 0, 01 e 7, 40 ± 0, 03; para 3,́ 4 -́DHF, 3, 98 ± 0, 10, 8, 80 ± 0, 40, 3, 70 ± 0, 01 e 7, 01 ± 0, 22. Para o 5, 7 -DH- 4 -MF, que não sofre hidratação devido à presença do grupo metílico na posição 4, o pK 1 e pK 2 foram 4, 87 ± 0, 01 e 7, 97 ± 0, 01. Para a determinação da atividade antioxidante, foi utilizado o método de ABTS em que o poder antioxidante é obtida comparando-se a descoloração do radical 2, 2 -́azino-bis(3 - etilbenzoiltiazolina- 6 -sulfônico) (ABTS+), a 734 nm, pela amostra com a do composto padrão Trolox (ácido 6 -hidroxi- 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetrametilcroman- 2 -carboxílico), sendo expressa como a TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity). A cinética da reação com os flavílios é bifásica, com uma fase lenta devido à atividade antioxidante {{residual}} dos subprodutos da reação. Utilizou-se a primeira derivada das curvas cinéticas para identificar o fim da fase rápida e, portanto, o tempo ótimo para a determinação do valor da TEAC. Os monohidroxiflavílios (3 -́HF e 4 -́HF) e o 7, 4 -́DHF não apresentaram poder antioxidante em solução aquosa a pH 2, 1 (H 3 PO 4 /H 2 PO 4 -). Por outro lado, o grupo catecol presente no anel B do 3,́ 4 -́DHF e o grupo resorcinol no anel A do 5, 7 -DH- 4 -MF conferem propriedades antioxidantes, mesmo em pH baixo. Também apresentaram atividade antioxidante a pH 2, 1 o 7 -H- 4 -MF e o 7 -metox- 4 -MF. Em pHs acima do pK, a formação de cis- e trans-chalconas, devido à hidratação, tautomerização e isomerização dos flavílios, resultou num aumento do valor da TEAC. Anthocyanins are {{the major}} water-soluble pigments of the plant kingdom. Responsible of the red, blue and purple colors {{of the majority of}} fruit and flowers, they belong to the group of flavonoids (polyphenols). The color presented by an anthocyanin depends on the pattern of substitution, the presence or not of metal ions or other molecules capable to stabilize the color (co-pigments), the local pH of the solution {{and the nature of the}} microenvironment of the anthocyanin. In this project, a study was made of the speciation and the antioxidant properties of a series of compounds analogous to anthocyanins: 3 -́hydroxyflavylium (3 -́HF), 4 -́ hydroxyflavylium (4 -́HF), 7, 4 -́dihydroxyflavylium (7, 4 -́DHF), 3,́ 4 -́dihydroxyflavylium (3,́ 4 -́DHF), 5, 7 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylflavylium (5, 7 -DH- 4 -MF), 7 -hydroxy- 4 - methylflavylium (7 -H- 4 -MF) and 7 -methoxy- 4 -methylflavylium (7 -Methox- 4 -MF). In the study of the speciation, the pK is determined immediately after preparation of the samples and the pKfinal after 1 day. For 3 -́HF, the values of pK and pKfinal were 2. 88 ± 0. 05 and 1. 94 ± 0. 15; for 4 -́HF, 4. 56 ± 0. 10 and 4. 23 ± 0. 20. For the <b>flavyliums</b> with two ionizable hydroxyl groups, the constants pK 1, pK 2, pK 1 final and pK 2 final for 7, 4 -́DHF were 4. 12 ± 0. 07, 7. 85 ± 0. 01, 3. 29 ± 0. 01 and 7. 40 ± 0. 03; for 3,́ 4 -́DHF, they were 3. 98 ± 0. 10, 8. 80 ± 0. 40, 3. 70 ± 0. 01 and 7. 01 ± 0. 22. For 5, 7 -DH- 4 -MF, which does not hydrate due to the presence of the methyl group at position 4, pK 1 and pK 2 were 4. 87 ± 0. 01 and 7. 97 ± 0. 01. For the determination of the antioxidant activity, the ABTS method was employed, in which the antioxidant power is obtained by comparing the rate of bleaching of the 2, 2 -́azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonate) radical (ABTS+), at 734 nm, by the sample with that of the standard compound Trolox (6 -hydroxy- 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethylchroman- 2 -carboxylic acid), the result being expressed as the TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity). The reaction kinetics with the <b>flavyliums</b> are biphasic, with the slower phase due to the residual antioxidant activity of the reaction subproducts. The first derivative of the kinetic curves was employed to determine the end of the faster phase and thus the optimum time for measuring the TEAC value. The monohydroxyflavyliums (3 -́HF and 4 -́HF) and 7, 4 D́HF showed no antioxidant power in aqueous solution at pH 2. 1 (H 3 PO 4 /H 2 PO 4 -). However, the catechol group in ring B of 3,́ 4 -́DHF and the resorcinol group in ring A of 5, 7 -DH- 4 -MF conferred antioxidant properties even at low pH. In addition, 7 -H- 4 -MF and 7 -Methox- 4 -MF also showed antioxidant activity at pH 2. 1. At pH above the pK, the formation of the cis- and trans-chalcones via hydration, tautomerization and isomerization resulted in an increase in the value of the TEAC...|$|R

40|$|A multistate {{molecular}} dyad containing <b>flavylium</b> and viologen units was synthesized and the pH dependent thermodynamics of {{the network}} completely characterized {{by a variety of}} spectroscopic techniques such as NMR, UV-vis and stopped-flow. The <b>flavylium</b> cation is only stable at acidic pH values. Above pH ≈ 5 the hydration of the <b>flavylium</b> leads to the formation of the hemiketal followed by ring-opening tautomerization to give the cis-chalcone. Finally, this last species isomerizes to give the trans-chalcone. For the present system only the <b>flavylium</b> cation and the trans-chalcone species could be detected as being thermodynamically stable. The hemiketal and the cis-chalcone are kinetic intermediates with negligible concentrations at the equilibrium. All stable species {{of the network}} were found to form 1 [*]:[*] 1 and 2 [*]:[*] 1 host[*]:[*]guest complexes with cucurbit[7]uril (CB 7) with association constants in the ranges 10 (5) - 10 (8) M(- 1) and 10 (3) - 10 (4) M(- 1), respectively. The 1 [*]:[*] 1 complexes were particularly interesting to devise pH responsive bistable pseudorotaxanes: at basic pH values (≈ 12) the <b>flavylium</b> cation interconverts into the deprotonated trans-chalcone in a few minutes and under these conditions the CB 7 wheel was found to be located around the viologen unit. A decrease in pH to values around 1 regenerates the <b>flavylium</b> cation in seconds and the macrocycle is translocated {{to the middle of the}} axle. On the other hand, if the pH is decreased to 6, the deprotonated trans-chalcone is neutralized to give a metastable species that evolves to the thermodynamically stable <b>flavylium</b> cation in ca. 20 hours.

40|$|Anthocyanins are {{identified}} by the respective <b>flavylium</b> cation, which is only one species of a multistate of different molecules reversibly interconverted by external inputs such as pH, light and temperature. The <b>flavylium</b> cation (acidic form) is involved in an apparent acid-base reaction, where the basic species {{is the sum of}} quinoidal base, hemiketal and cis- and trans-chalcones, their relative fraction depending on the substitution pattern of the <b>flavylium</b> cation. The full comprehension of this complex system requires a thermodynamic and kinetic approach. The first consists in drawing an energy level diagram where the relative positions of the different species are represented as a function of pH. On the other hand, the kinetic approach allows measuring the rates of the reactions that interconnect reversibly the multistate species. The kinetics is greatly dependent on the existence or not of a high cis-trans isomerization barrier. In this work, the procedure to obtain the energy level diagram and the rates of inter-conversion in the multistate in both cases (low or high isomerization barrier) are described.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of proton-transfer rate constants in the ground state of anthocyanins and related <b>flavylium</b> salts is described. The method {{is based on the}} well-known pKa shift of phenols on going from ground to the first excited singlet state coupled to the typically very fast excited state proton transfer and very short lifetimes (picosecond range) occurring in these compounds. Under these conditions, a nanosecond light pulse instantaneously shifts the ground-state equilibrium, after which the ground-state transients can be monitored with nanosecond or microsecond resolution. The method is successfully applied to {{the determination of}} the deprotonation rate constants, kd, of two synthetic <b>flavylium</b> salts and a natural anthocyanin (7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylflavylium chloride (HMF), 4 ′, 7 -dihydroxyflavylium chloride (DHF), and malvidin- 3 -glucoside chloride (oenin), respectively) and the protonation rate constants, kp, of their conjugate quinonoidal bases in the ground state. For all three <b>flavylium</b> cations, the protonation of the ground state base form is essentially diffusion-controlled, and the deprotonation occurs in the submicrosecond range. Our directly determined rate constants are 2 orders of magnitude greater than previous values estimated for oenin by T jump. The flash photolysis approach utilized in the present work seems to be the only technique available for measurement of the kinetics of proton transfer in anthocyanins. In addition, our results show clear laser-induced perturbation of the ground-state protonation of oenin, providing the first direct evidence for excited-state proton transfer as a significant energy dissipation process in natural anthocyanins...|$|E
30|$|The {{solution}} {{chemistry of}} anthocyanidins is complex (Pina et al. 2012) and analogous anthocyanidins under similar pH exist in equilibrium between the <b>flavylium</b> ion, deporotonated quinoidal base, {{and as the}} hydrated hemiketal (Brouillard et al. 1982; Sweeny and Iacobucci 1983). The FRAP assay is non-specific for any antioxidant present under the reaction conditions that could reduce Fe 3 +, which {{takes into account the}} chemistry <b>flavylium</b> ions undergo in solution. Under similar assay conditions, ascorbic acid gives higher FRAP value (2.7) and shows a higher antioxidant activity than anthocyanidins 1 – 3. FRAP values are normally obtained after 4  min at 37  °C, or 6  min at room temperature. No significant variation of the FRAP value was observed between 4 and 6  min for our experiments, which are 2.2, 2.0, and 2.1  mM for 1, 2, 3, respectively, based on equivalent FeSO 4 standard. In comparison, purified anthocyanin extracts from fruit show reducing power one-third that of ascorbic acid, however these comparisons are not straightforward because the reducing power is dose-dependent even for ascorbic acid (Sun et al. 2014).|$|E

The equilibrium and rate constants of the multistate of chemical species derived from the <b>flavylium</b> ion were calculated and compared with those in the absence of the host. A new procedure to obtain the host-guest association constants of the multistate (including the transient species) by superimposing the two energy level diagrams, in the presence and absence of the cyclodextrin, was developed. The results indicate that the magnitude of the association constants follows the order, trans-chalcone = cis-chalcone = hemiketal > quinoidal base > <b>flavylium</b> cation. The hydration equilibrium constant increases ca. 42 times {{in the presence of}} captisol as the hydration and dehydration rate constants respectively increases and decreases. The other equilibrium constants are modestly affected: the rate constants of ring closure and opening are significantly decreased in the complex and the isomerization rate constants increase in both directions.

40|$|Anthocyanins are {{the largest}} group of {{water-soluble}} pigments in the plant kingdom (1). Chemically, they are polyhydroxylated or polymethoxylated glycosides or acylglycosides of anthocyanidins which are oxygenated derivatives of 2 -phenylbenzopyrylium or <b>flavylium</b> salts (1, 2). They belong to the family of compounds known as flavonoids, and they are distinguished from other flavonoids as a separate class by virtue of their ability to form <b>flavylium</b> cations (1 - 3). Anthocyanins are responsible for most of the red, blue, and purple colors of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and other plant tissues or products. They are particularly abundant in berries and other fruits with red, blue, or purple color, and in red wines (1). Color differences between anthocyanins are largely determined by the substitution pattern of the B-ring of the aglycone, the pattern of glycosylation, and the degree and nature of esterification of the sugars with aliphatic or aromatic acids, and by the pH, temperature, type of solvent, and the presence of copigments (1 – 6).

Wine samples acidified at pH 1. 2 were analyzed immediately, after 30 min, 2 h and 3. 5 h, in order to check if any degradation of phenolic compounds occurred during the storage. Maximum response of the <b>flavylium</b> cation of peonidin- 3 -glucoside (at 520 nm), statistically significant (p 0. 05), meaning that both 1 % and 2 % formic acid in the mobile phase are suitable for anthocyanin analysis. Regarding phenolic acids, lower peak intensities, statistically significant (p < 0. 001), were obtained in the negative ion mode with 2 % formic acid in the mobile phase, presumably due to the lower proportion of acids in the anionic form under more acidic conditions. Thus, 1 % formic acid in the mobile phase and acidification of the sample at pH £ 1. 2 were selected as the best compromise for simultaneous analysis of anthocyanins and phenolic acids. Acidification of the wine samples at pH 1. 2 followed by a 30 min delay enabled total transformation of chalcone and carbinol forms into the corresponding <b>flavylium</b> cations, without causing degradation of the other wine phenolics.

40|$|AbstractThe {{composition}} of carotenoids and phenolic compounds from jambolão fruits (Syzygium cumini) {{was determined by}} HPLC-DAD-MS/MS. Two main carotenoids {{were found in the}} fruits, all-trans-lutein (43. 7 %) and all-trans-β-carotene (25. 4 %). The anthocyanin composition was characterised by the presence of 3, 5 -diglucosides of five out of six aglycones commonly found in foods. This pattern was also observed for the other flavonoids, since diglucosides of dihydromyricetin, methyl-dihydromyricetin and dimethyl-dihydromyricetin, along with myricetin glucoside and a galloyl-glucose ester were identified. Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity of a functional extract rich in anthocyanins was evaluated through the scavenging capacities of ABTS+ and peroxyl radical (ORAC) and the protective effect against singlet oxygen (1 O 2). The TEAC values indicated that the hemiacetals/chalcones and quinonoidal bases species (pH⩾ 5) possess higher scavenging capacity as compared to the <b>flavylium</b> cation (pH< 3). The functional extract also showed 60 % of dimethylanthracene protection against 1 O 2 and an ORAC value of 16. 4 μmolTrolox/gfruit...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAnalogs of {{anthocyanins}} with a 3 0, 4 0 -dihydroxy substitution: Synthesis {{and investigation}} of their acidebase, hydration, metal binding and hydrogen-donating properties {{in aqueous solution}} a b s t r a c t Glycosides of hydroxylated <b>flavylium</b> ions are proposed as pertinent analogs of anthocyanins, a major class of polyphenolic plant pigments. Anthocyanins with a 3 0, 4 0 -dihydroxy substitution on the Bring (catechol nucleus) are especially important for their metal chelating and electron-donating (antioxidant) capacities. In this work, an efficient chemical synthesis of 3 0, 4 0 -dihydroxy- 7 -O-b-D-glucopyranosyloxy-flavylium chloride and its aglycone is reported. Then, {{the ability of the}} two pigments to undergo proton transfer (formation of colored quinonoid bases) and add water (formation of a colorless chalcone) is investigated: at equilibrium the colored quinonoid bases (kinetic products) are present in very minor concentrations (< 10 % of the total pigment concentration) compared to the colorless chalcone (ther-modynamic product). The glucopyranosyloxyflavylium ion appears significantly less acidic than the aglycone. The thermodynamics of the overall sequence of <b>flavylium</b> e chalcone conversion is not affected by the b-D-glucosyl moiety while the kinetics appears slower by a factor ca. 8. Although the glucopyr-anosyloxyflavylium ion and its aglycone display similar affinities for Al 3 þ, the Al 3 þ-glucoside complex is more stable than the Al 3 þ-aglycone complex due to the higher sensitivity of the latter to water addition and conversion into the corresponding chalcone. Finally, the glucopyranosyloxyflavylium ion and its aglycone are compared for their ability to reduce the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical in a mildly acidic water/MeOH (1 : 1) mixture as a first evaluation of their antioxidant activity. Glycosidation at C 7 -OH results in a lower rate constant of first electron transfer to DPPH and a lower stoichiometry (total number of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radicals reduced per pigment molecule). Anthocyanins are difficult to extract from plants in substantial amount. However, the analogs investigated in this work are of easy access by chemical synthesis and express the physico-chemical properties typical of anthocyanins. They can thus be regarded as valuable models for investigating the coloring, metal-binding and antioxidant properties of these important natural pigments...|$|E

HPLC-DAD-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS and spectrophotometry {{were used for}} analysis of phenolics (anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids and proanthocyanidins) in the samples, observing that their content varied greatly with the winemaking conditions and ripening. The effect of pH of the sample and mobile phase on anthocyanin analysis was explored. Maximum <b>flavylium</b> response was obtained in the samples acidified to pH 1. 2 and elution using 1 % (V/V) formic acid in the HPLC mobile phase, allowing proper separation and detection of anthocyanins and phenolic acids as well as lower current in the MS source. Several MALDI matrices were tested: α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), sinapic acid (SA), 2, 5 - hydroxybenzoic acid (2, 5 -DHB) and C 70. 2, 5 -DHB was superior with respect to all the matrices tested.

40|$|The complex {{anthocyanin}} {{fraction of}} red wines poses a demanding analytical challenge. We {{have found that}} anthocyanins are characterised by extremely low optimal chromatographic velocities, {{and as a consequence}} generic HPLC methods suffer from limited resolving power. Slow on-column inter-conversion reactions, particularly between carbinol and <b>flavylium</b> species, are shown to occur on the same time scale as chromatographic separation, leading to increased plate heights at normal chromatographic velocities. In order to improve current routine HPLC separations, the use of small (1. 7 microm) particles and high temperature liquid chromatography (HTLC) were investigated. 1. 7 microm particles provide better efficiency and higher optimal linear velocities, although column lengths of approximately 20 cm should be used to avoid the detrimental effects of conversion reactions. More importantly, operation at temperatures up to 50 degrees C increases the kinetics of inter-conversion reactions, and implies significantly improved efficiency under relatively mild analysis conditions. It is further demonstrated using relevant kinetic data that no on-column thermal degradation of these thermally labile compounds is observed at 50 degrees C and analysis times of < 2 h. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{compound}} 7, 4 prime-dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyflavylium (dracoflavylium) {{was identified}} as the major red colorant in samples of the resin ldquodragon's bloodrdquo, extracted from the tree Dracaena draco. The complex network of reversible chemical reactions that dracoflavylium undergoes in aqueous solution is fully described; for the first time, all the equilibrium constants that enable a complete characterisation of the system have been obtained (Kprimea= 1. 6 × 10 - 4, Ka 1 = 1. 0 × 10 - 4, Ka 2 = 3. 2 × 10 - 8, KCt 1 = 1. 0 × 10 - 7, KCt 2 = 1. 3 × 10 - 10). It is concluded that the red colour {{is due to a}} stable quinoid base, A, which is the major species at pH  4 - 7. It is further shown that this compound does not fit the commonly accepted definitions of anthocyanidin nor 3 -deoxyanthocyanidin. Similarly to synthetic <b>flavylium</b> salts, the natural compound 7, 4 prime-dihydroxy- 5 -methoxyflavylium gives rise to several species (multistate system) reversibly interconverted by external stimuli, such as pH.

40|$|Three water-insoluble, micelle-anchored <b>flavylium</b> salts, 7 -hydroxy- 3 -octyl-flavylium chloride, 4 `-hexyl- 7 -hydroxyflavylium chloride, and 6 -hexyl- 7 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl-flavylium chloride, {{have been}} {{employed}} to probe excited-state prototropic reactions in micellar {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS). In SDS micelles, the fluorescence decays of these three <b>flavylium</b> salts are tetraexponential functions in the pH range from 1. 0 to 4. 6 at temperatures from 293 to 318 K. The four components of the decays are assigned to Four kinetically coupled excited species in the micelle: specifically, promptly deprotonable (AH(+) *) and nonpromptly deprotonable (AH(h) (+) *) orientations of the acid in the micelle. the base-proton geminate pair (A*center dot center dot center dot H(+)), and the free conjugate base (A*). The initial prompt deprotonation to form the germinate pair occurs at essentially the same rate (k(d) similar to 6 - 7 x 10 (10) s(- 1)) for all three photoacids. Recombination of the germinate pair is similar to 3 -fold faster than the rate of proton escape from the pair (k(rec) similar to 3 x 10 (10) s(- 1) and k(diss) similar to 1 x 10 (10) s(- 1)), corresponding to an intrinsic recombination efficiency of the pair of similar to 75 %. Finally, the reprotonation of the short-lived free A* (200 - 350 ps, depending oil the photoacid) has two components, only one of which depends oil the proton concentration in the intermicellar aqueous phase. Ultrafast transfer of the proton to water and substantial compartmentalization of the photogenerated proton at the micelle surface Oil the picosecond time scale strongly suggest preferential transfer of the proton to preformed hydrogen-bonded water bridges between the photoacid and the anionic headgroups. This localizes the proton {{in the vicinity of}} the excited base much more efficiently than ill bulk water, resulting ill the predominance of geminate re reprotonation at the micelle surface.
