5|$|In general, Greece {{enjoyed a}} period of peace and {{prosperity}} during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across <b>his</b> <b>empire.</b> However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout <b>his</b> <b>empire</b> depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it {{in the years after}} Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).|$|E

5|$|The Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had {{supported}} the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499–494BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young {{and prone to}} revolts by its subject peoples. Moreover, Darius was an usurper and had to spend considerable time putting down revolts against his rule. The Ionian Revolt threatened the integrity of <b>his</b> <b>empire,</b> and he thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire). Darius also saw the opportunity to expand <b>his</b> <b>empire</b> into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.|$|E

5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up <b>his</b> <b>empire</b> after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E

5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{constituted}} {{the first major}} conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire and represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars.
