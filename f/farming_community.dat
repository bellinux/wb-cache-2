In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S.

5|$|In 1736, a ferry {{began to}} operate, {{traveling}} from Shawnee between Shawnee Island and Depuy Island, then across the Delaware River to New Jersey. By 1740 Aaron Depuy was operating a store, and in 1753 {{he built a}} stone and log church used by ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church. The cornerstone of this church remains, {{now part of the}} Shawnee Presbyterian Church. The <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> grew steadily, using the river to transport produce. A post office was built in 1843, and a brick church was erected in 1853 on the foundation of the old stone and log church. Some of the original beams still remain, as well as the original sounding board.|$|E
5|$|Albert Benjamin Chandler {{was born}} in the <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> of Corydon, Kentucky in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler's father {{allegedly}} rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen, though no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler said his mother leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville, Florida. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{was born}} in the 600‑person <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> of Avon, South Dakota. His father, Rev. Joseph C. McGovern, born in 1868, was pastor of the local Wesleyan Methodist Church there. Joseph – the son of an {{alcoholic}} who had immigrated from Ireland – had grown up in several states, working in coal mines from the age of nine and parentless from the age of thirteen. He had been a professional baseball player in the minor leagues, but had given it up due to his teammates' heavy drinking, gambling and womanizing, and entered the seminary instead. George's mother was the former Frances McLean, born c. 1890 and initially raised in Ontario; her family had later moved to Calgary, Alberta, and then she came to South Dakota looking for work as a secretary. George was the second oldest of four children. Joseph McGovern's salary never reached $100 per month, and he often received compensation in the form of potatoes, cabbages, or other food items. Joseph and Frances McGovern were both firm Republicans, but were not politically active or doctrinaire.|$|E
5|$|The 1801 census {{recorded}} the village's population as 537. In the early 19th century, the Tudor Quex House {{had to be}} demolished and a replacement manor house was built in its place. In 1818, the Waterloo Tower {{was built on the}} grounds of Quex Park. It is a bell tower built by the owner of Quex Park, John Powell Powell, who had an interest in change ringing. Waterloo Tower was the first twelve-bell tower in Kent. The village was a <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> until the late 19th century, when it began to develop into a coastal resort. Birchington railway station was opened in 1863 and the Railway Hotel, now the Sea View Hotel pub, was opened in 1865. Station Road was subsequently built to serve as Birchington's main shopping street. Coast Guard cottages were built at Minnis Bay in the 1870s and the first shops appeared by the bay in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} {{soils are}} mostly a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for arable farming {{and the growing}} of grains of all kinds {{that contributed to the}} area being a mostly <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> until the modern era. Soils were further enriched over the millennia by alluvial deposits from the River Taff. The bedrock under the whole area is predominantly sandstone, dating from both the Devonian period (Old Red Sandstone) and the Triassic (New Red Sandstone) laid down in arid conditions. These may subsequently have been ground down by the Taff valley glacier during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, the Portland Water Committee, {{predecessor}} of the Portland Water Bureau, began {{a search}} for a superior drinking water source. The committee, led by Henry Failing, commissioned Isaac W. Smith, an engineer and surveyor, to inspect any viable water supply in the region. Smith chose the Bull Run River, and a five-month survey trip led him to conclude that a gravity-flow system could deliver clean water from Bull Run to Portland. In 1892, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison signed a proclamation creating a protected area, the Bull Run Reserve, in the watershed. By 1895 Portland had built a diversion dam on the Bull Run River, and completed its first conduit (Conduit 1) to carry Bull Run water to the city. At {{about the same time as}} the Smith survey, a small <b>farming</b> <b>community,</b> at first named Unavilla but renamed Bull Run in 1895, grew up near the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers. Meanwhile, improvements to the Barlow Road encouraged population growth along the lower Sandy and the establishment of cities like Gresham and Sandy. Even so, by 1900 much of the upper Sandy basin was still remote, wild, and accessible mainly by trails.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E
