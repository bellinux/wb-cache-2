25|$|For a long time, {{scholarship}} {{considered the}} younger girl as a boy. Recent research definitely {{proves that the}} chubby-cheeked child with <b>ears</b> <b>sticking</b> out is a girl. Around her neck is a leather band with a lunula pendant, an apotropaic amulet commonly worn by women or girls. Her chiton is violet in colour, a feature exclusive to females. Further it has partially fallen, exposing her left shoulder, an attribute of the goddess Aphrodite, aimed to underline erotic attraction. It is commonly used on the mummy portraits of women and even young girls. Thus, the child's gender is indubitably female.|$|R
5000|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 Director, which resembles a turret with [...] "ears" [...] rather than guns, was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows or hatches on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes or <b>ears</b> <b>sticking</b> out each side), and later models, fire control radar antennas. The rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna on the left ("orange peel") is for the Mk 22 FC radar.

After several attempts he gave it up, and set out for the steamer with little pieces of barley-straw and spiky <b>ears</b> <b>sticking</b> all over him. He could swim tolerably well, and swung along comfortably enough over the smooth-backed swell, for his light clothing did not greatly cumber him. Still, he did not desire that any one beyond the Estremedura's crew should witness his arrival.|$|R

For the {{installation}} series Action Notation she mixed photographs of her previous wounds with objects, such as toys, glass, etc., from her previous actions. The process was controversial since it almost always involved an element of masochism: climbing up a ladder studded with razor blades, cutting her tongue or her <b>ear,</b> <b>sticking</b> nails into her forearm, smashing through a glass door, ingesting food to the point of nausea. Pane no longer based her approach on direct bodily experience, although the body remained pivotal and retained its symbolic significance through figures (cross, rectangle, circle) and materials (burnt or rusty metal, glass or copper).|$|R

Bugs moves his ears so the bullets miss, but seems to raise his hands in surrender. As the manager gloats that he'll finish Bugs off, Bugs pops out from behind the counter (revealing that the raised hands were just a pair of gloves on the tips of his ears), armed with a gun as well, and states he'll finish off the manager. He pulls the trigger, to which the gun sticks out three [...] "bang" [...] signs, prompting the manager to stick three [...] "ouch" [...] signs out of his mouth.|$|R
5000|$|One of B.D.'s odder traits was his helmet. For 34 {{years he}} was never seen without one. He wore a {{football}} helmet at college, as a coach and as a pro football player, a soldier's helmet in the army, a California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer's helmet [...] {{when he was a}} police officer. His only explanations for this were [...] "My <b>ears</b> <b>stick</b> out" [...] or [...] "I have bad hair". In the February 21, 2006 strip he revealed that his mother used to put helmets on him, as a means of protection, when he was a child. When Ray visits B.D. in the hospital after losing a leg, he's more shocked at seeing B.D.'s hair than his injury.|$|R

2500|$|At {{least six}} {{different}} calls {{have been documented}} for the plains zebra. One of which is its distinctive high-pitched contact call (commonly called [...] "barking") heard as [...] "a-ha, a-ha, a-ha" [...] or [...] "kwa-ha, kaw-ha, ha, ha" [...] (...) , also transcribed as [...] "kwahaah", or [...] "oug-ga". The species name quagga {{is derived from the}} Khoikhoi word for [...] "zebra" [...] and is onomatopoeic for its call. When a predator is sighted, a zebra will make a two-syllable alarm call. A loud snort is made when moving in cover of potential danger. When in contentment, a zebra will make a more drawn-out snort. Males will make a short high-pitched squeal when hurt and foals will emit a drawn out wail when in distress. There are two main facial expressions made by zebras. One is for greeting and involves the <b>ears</b> <b>sticking</b> up and directed forward; the other is threatening and involves the ears down.|$|R

6000|$|He was a {{wonderful}} man, this Cap'n Bill. Not so very old, although his hair was grizzled--what there was of it. Most of his head was bald as an egg and as shiny as oilcloth, and this made his big <b>ears</b> <b>stick</b> out in a funny way. His eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color, and his round face was rugged and bronzed. Cap'n Bill's left leg was missing, from the knee down, {{and that was why}} the sailor no longer sailed the seas. The wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on land, or even to take Trot out for a row or a sail on the ocean, {{but when it came to}} [...] "runnin' up aloft" [...] or performing active duties on shipboard, the old sailor was not equal to the task.

60|$|It is {{a figure}} that I once saw, just after dark, chalked upon a door in a little back lane near a country church - my first church. How young a child I may {{have been at the}} time I don't know, but it horrified me so {{intensely}} - in connexion with the churchyard, I suppose, for it smokes a pipe, and has a big hat with each of its <b>ears</b> <b>sticking</b> out in a horizontal line under the brim, and is not in itself more oppressive than a mouth from ear to ear, a pair of goggle eyes, and hands like two bunches of carrots, five in each, can make it - that it is still vaguely alarming to me to recall (as I have often done before, lying awake) the running home, the looking behind, the horror, of its following me; though whether disconnected from the door, or door and all, I can't say, and perhaps never could. It lays a disagreeable train. I must resolve to think of something on the voluntary principle.|$|R

The savages, as we calls 'em, bores holes in their lips an' sticks rings into 'em. The civilised folk, as we calls ourselves, bores holes in their <b>ears</b> an' <b>sticks</b> rings into 'em.

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the tale, the narrator surveys and categorizes the people around him in a similar way as Walt Whitman in [...] "Song of Myself". Poe's narrator, however, lacks Whitman's celebratory spirit. While viewing these people, the narrator is able to ascertain {{a great deal of information}} about them based on their appearance and by noting small details. For example, he notices that a man's <b>ear</b> <b>sticks</b> out a small amount, indicating he must be a clerk who stores his pen behind his ear. Poe would later incorporate this ability to observe small details in his character C. Auguste Dupin. All of this is a virtuoso performance of the representation of social typicality; it owes something to Dickens’s Sketches by Boz, but there is also something of the moralizing medieval Vice in its parade of degenerates, of depraved women and of social outcasts. In one sense this is a sideshow, a digression from the main line of the narrative, which is concerned with the crowd only as an abstract force; in another, however, it brings to the fore the sense that it is only through these social clichés that the crowd can be made humanly understandable.|$|R

Despite being friendly and gentle, Moo-tan is quite perverted and hyper, but she is also quite strong and clever {{when it comes down to}} fighting, shown in episode 2. She loses her seal to the cat in episode 2. As seen in episode 4, she is considered too perverted of an Eto-shin to be included in the Nya-tan issue, having her own category. She seems to be quite attached to Nya-tan. Moo-tan always wants to cuddle with her, and Moo-tan herself said that she loves her. This, however, makes Nya-tan irritated sometimes, but they are on good and friendly terms.|$|R
