The {{expected}} {{sensitivity of}} the water Cerenkov detector array of the southern Auger Observatory site is described by calculations of the energy and zenith angle dependent aperture function (A(E,θ) km 2 sr).

The uncertainties arising from the extrapolation to distances beyond 2 km and to extreme zenith angles (”horizontal air showers”) are discussed.

His parents persecuted him, and he fled to a friend, a Hindoo convert; but he was seized by his relations, and the case was referred to the Supreme Court, who decided that the father's power over the son must not be interfered with; and the poor boy was dragged away, clinging to the barrister's table, amid the shouts of the heathen and the tears of the Christians.

Heilman's brother, Dan, and son, Carl, are also physicians. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Arts degree and {{chemistry}} major in 1955, he entered the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine graduating in 1959. There, he developed an interest in medical research and realized that coming technologic advances would provide opportunities for innovative products having breakthrough diagnostic and therapeutic potential. After medical school graduation, he completed a general medical internship in 1960. During this time, a prominent cardiologist from the Cleveland Clinic showed him {{an early version of}} an x-ray movie of blood combined with iodine-based contrast medium moving through a patient's heart. Heilman immediately recognized that angiography, the field of providing contrast media-enhanced moving images of a patient's heart, arteries and veins would provide physicians with an extremely valuable diagnostic tool. Having already decided to pursue a career developing medical devices, Heilman opted to forgo a specialty residency. Instead, he joined the US Air Force to satisfy a deferred military service obligation and was stationed at the Soesterberg Air Force base in the Netherlands, where he spent two years as the Military Officer in charge of the 654th Air Force Tactical Hospital. This facility offered first level medical care for approximately 3,500 US military personnel and <b>dependents</b> <b>stationed</b> in the Netherlands. Specialty care for military personnel was provided by air flight to the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital in Germany and the military dependents received their specialty care from the Dutch economy. The Soesterberg air base supported both Dutch and American aircraft as part of the NATO defense system during the cold war.

40|$|AbstractOur {{objective}} is to study the dependence structure of extreme snowfall in the French Alps. Snowfall amount measurements (3 days accumulation period) from 90 monitoring stations providing data spanning from 1958 to 2013 were projected at the same altitude level (1800 m). Annual maxima of projected snowfall were modeled with Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions and transformed in unit Fréchet in order {{to focus on the}} dependence structure only. The final goal is to evaluate the spatio-temporal evolution of this dependence structure and to compare the ability of different max-stable models to capture it. In addition to the most classical max-stable models (Smith and Schlather), max-stable processes made available more recently (extremal-t, Geometric Gaussian and Brown-Resnick) were also considered, taking into account spatial anisotropy. These latter models are found to be the most suitable in our case according to CLIC. Further cross-validation on joint exceedance probabilities does not clearly discriminate these max-stable models. Results show that measurement stations in the Northern and Central Alps are strongly <b>dependent</b> whereas <b>stations</b> from the extreme Southern Alps, influenced by Mediterranean effects, are more isolated. Furthermore, extremal dependence appears controlled by the orientation of mountains and valleys. Finally, using an estimation window moving in time, we highlight a recent decrease in extremal dependence at large distances...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – A {{universal}} soil loss {{equation is}} used for predicting soil erosion. Rainfall erosivity (EI) in this equation is related to storm type, amount, and intensity, so it should be calculated from rainfall characteristics. In the present research, data of 13 recording rain gauge stations at the southern region of the Islamic Republic (I. R.) of Iran were analyzed and single storm, daily, monthly and annual erosion indices (MJ. mm. ha- 1. h- 1) were calculated and estimated by different simple models. For a single storm erosion index, the model EI=α Peβ/Dγ was modified. A coefficient of α for stations without snowfall and with an elevation of less than 1000 m, or higher than 1000 m, and β for stations without snowfall were 0. 51, 0. 21 and 2. 0, respectively. The values of α and β for stations with snowfall and γ for both types of stations may be determined based on the station elevation using the proposed equations. For a daily erosion index, a power function (EI=ahb) was derived (h is daily rainfall, mm). The value of a was <b>dependent</b> on <b>station</b> conditions, but an average value of 1. 61 was obtained for b.
