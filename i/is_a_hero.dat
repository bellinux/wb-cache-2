5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero.</b> Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

John struggles to get the ship back safely on Earth but eventually succeeds in landing it at Cape Canaveral. The next day, Jonah learns that the Globes cover story on the Goblin's rampage—featuring Peter's photos—is outselling the Bugles story on John's heroic space journey. An infuriated Jameson decides {{to meet with the}} public's demand by publishing a new cover story questioning if Spider-Man <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> or a menace. Meanwhile, John is interviewed at the shuttle hangar when he spots a mysterious, vibrating black goo {{on the bottom of the}} shuttle.|$|E

25|$|Lucas began {{researching the}} science fiction genre by {{watching}} films and reading books and comics. His first script incorporated ideas from many new sources. The script would also introduce {{the concept of}} a Jedi Master father and his son, who trains to be a Jedi under his father's friend; this would ultimately form the basis for the film and, later, the trilogy.

25|$|The dragon {{with his}} hoard {{is a common}} motif in early Germanic {{literature}} with the story existing to varying extents in the Norse sagas, but it is most notable in the Völsunga saga and in Beowulf. Beowulf preserves existing medieval dragon-lore, most notably in the extended digression recounting the Sigurd/Fafnir tale. Nonetheless, comparative contemporary narratives {{did not have the}} complexity and distinctive elements written into Beowulfs dragon scene. Beowulf <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> who previously killed two monsters. The scene includes extended flashbacks to the Geatish-Swedish wars, {{a detailed description of the}} dragon and the dragon-hoard, and ends with intricate funerary imagery.|$|E

25|$|As is {{standard}} in five-act bunraku and kabuki plays, the middle act departs {{from the main}} characters, the nobility and politics, focusing on {{a different set of}} characters, usually commoners. The third act of Sugawara features triplets, Umeōmaru, Sakuramaru, and Matsuōmaru, each a loyal retainer to one of the play's chief characters (Kan Shōjō, Prince Tokiyo, and Shihei, respectively). The triplets each wear a symbol on their sleeve to identify them: Ume, Sakura, and Matsu are the Japanese words for plum blossom, cherry blossom, and pine respectively. They are also distinguished by their makeup and acting style. Sakuramaru is a romantic and gentle type, in the wagoto fashion, Umeōmaru <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in aragoto style, with bright red face makeup, and Matsuōmaru is a villain, his face painted with blue lines.|$|E
25|$|After this event, Arvalan {{turns into}} a demon. Kailyal, while trying to escape from Kehama's wrath, is pushed into a river {{and was about to}} drown before Ladurlad comes and saves her. Although he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> Ladurlad cannot bear to be near her, which allows for Arvalan to pursue after Kailyal as she escapes to the temple of Pollear. When she gets there, she is almost {{poisoned}} by a poisonous manchineel tree. Before this happens, a gandharvas, or good spirit, named Ereenia takes Kailyal to Casyapa, Father of the Hindu gods. With the help of the Tree of Life at Casyapa's mountain, she is able to be healed. However, Kailyal is sent back because Casyapa is worried about Kehama's power. Kailyal is sent to the land of Indra for safety. While there, she is united with her father and Ladurlad, and they are told of how Vishnu saved humanity by assuming a human form. During this time, Kailyal grows close to Ereenia and they fall in love with each other.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from being}} himself a writer, Iorga's public image was also {{preserved}} in the literary work of both his colleagues and adversaries. One early example is a biting epigram by Ion Luca Caragiale, where Iorga is described as the dazed savant. In addition to the many autobiographies which discuss him, he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in various works of fiction. As geographer Cristophor Arghir, he {{is the subject of}} a thinly disguised portrayal in the Bildungsroman În preajma revoluței ("Around the Time of the Revolution"), written by his rival Constantin Stere in the 1930s. Celebrated Romanian satirist and Viața Românească affiliate Păstorel Teodoreanu was engaged in a lengthy polemic with Iorga, enshrining Iorga in Romanian humor as a person with little literary skill and an oversized ego, and making him the subject of an entire collection of poems and articles, Strofe cu pelin de mai pentru Iorga Neculai ("Stanzas in May Wormwood for Iorga Neculai"). One of Teodoreanu's own epigrams in Contimporanul ridiculed Moartea lui Dante, showing the resurrected Dante Aligheri pleading with Iorga to be left in peace. Iorga was also identified as the subject of fictional portrayals in a modernist novel by N. D. Cocea and (against the author's disclaimer) in George Ciprian's play The Drake's Head.|$|E

25|$|The trio and the Hunters of Artemis {{make it to}} the Wolf House, only {{to start}} a battle between Lycaon's wolves, storm spirits, and Khione, {{daughter}} of Boreas, goddess of snow, and a traitor to the gods. Although the heroes and the Hunters defeat their enemies and save Hera, the king of the Giants, Porphyrion, rises fully as Hera's energy was being used to raise him; and disappears into a hole in the earth to escape Hera as she uses her power to destroy the monsters around her. Back at Camp Half-Blood, Jason's memory then starts returning, and he remembers that he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> from Camp Jupiter, a camp for Roman demigods, and is the son of Jupiter, Zeus's Roman counterpart. Meanwhile, Piper challenges Drew and after a brief power-struggle is made the new Aphrodite counselor. Leo shows the Hephaestus campers (along with Jason and Piper) Bunker Nine, revealing his fire powers along the way. In bunker nine, he shows them plans for a ship that would sail to Greece, and the Hephaestus campers decide to undergo the project, also appointing Leo to be their new counselor. Jason realizes that Hera, also known as Juno to the Romans, has switched him with Percy Jackson, who will be at Camp Jupiter with amnesia, in the hopes that the two camps would band together to defeat Gaea and the Giants.|$|E

500|$|Dutthagamani's {{campaign}} against Elara {{is given in}} detail in the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka; Mahavamsa, Dipavamsa, Rajavaliya and Thupavamsa. All of them describe the battle in detail, and apply a high importance to it. Dutthagamani <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in these chronicles, and his campaign is depicted as a [...] "holy war" [...] aimed at restoring Buddhism in the country. Therefore, these accounts are favourably biased to him, and {{the description of the}} Battle of Vijithapura, {{along with the rest of}} the campaign, is a mix of fact and legend. However, historians agree that the basic facts from these chronicles are accurate. The one sided accounts given in the chronicles mean that there is very little information to be obtained on Elara and his armies. According to Orientalist Wilhelm Geiger, who translated the Mahavamsa, the problem is [...] "not what is said but what is left unsaid".|$|E
500|$|Caesar A. Montevecchio of the University of Notre Dame {{published}} a theological {{assessment of the}} spiritual themes in the film concentrating on the act of priestly renunciation depicted towards the end stating: [...] "This climactic scene of Rodrigues trampling the fumie makes clear that Silence {{is as much about}} the object of Christian faith as it is the experience of that faith. As ambient and live sound are washed out entirely, Rodrigues hears the voice of Christ telling him to trample, that it was to be trampled upon that Christ came into the world. The object of faith becomes a Christ who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> of pity, who takes up the weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross, rather than a hero of triumphant resolve. The Jesus of Silence is one of utter kenosis (self-emptying), and one who in the mercy of that kenosis radically sympathizes with the weakness, and frailty, of human beings, even ones like Judas and Kichijiro." ...|$|E
