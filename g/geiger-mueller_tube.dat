50|$|The thin {{sidewall}} <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tube</b> enclosed {{within the}} brass probe body detects beta radiation and gamma radiation with the detecting probe's beta shield open, or gammas {{only when the}} shield is closed. The brass body of the probe has an energy-compensation effect on the readings taken from the probe, reducing the over-reporting of events from low-energy gamma radiation as can be encountered with non-compensated GM probes.|$|E
50|$|On 14 October 1938, in the Tatra Mountains, Jodko-Narkiewicz and Captain Zbigniew Burzyński {{attempted}} a stratospheric flight in the hydrogen balloon Star of Poland. Their {{aim was to}} reach a height of 30 kilometres, beating the world record for high-altitude flight. They were equipped with a <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tube</b> telescope, intending to measure the variation in intensity of cosmic rays at different altitudes. The balloon caught fire during take-off, while still less than 100 feet above the ground, but {{the two men were}} able to land the gondola safely and were uninjured.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} package, {{consisting of}} seven <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tubes</b> as basic sensors, is described, including the instrumental characteristics and tube arrangements.

40|$|Data {{obtained}} by Pioneer 10 on {{the properties of}} energetic electrons in the Jovian magnetosphere are analyzed. The basic detectors (seven miniature <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tubes)</b> are described together with the signal processor and sampling techniques. The model of Jupiter used in the data analysis is a centered dipole with a tilt of 9. 5 deg toward 230 deg System III longitude. The energetic-electron observations within the inner magnetosphere are found to indicate that radial as well as pitch-angle diffusion of energetic electrons must take place very rapidly. Outbound observations within the magnetodisk (the region beyond 20 Jupiter radii) are found to indicate a spiraling of the apparent location of the longitude of the dipole tilt, while inbound data indicate a constant value for the apparent longitude of the dipole tilt out to 70 Jupiter radii...|$|R
50|$|Cook {{attempted}} {{to cast a}} large sodium iodide crystal in a glass baking dish, {{using one of the}} Department ovens, with poor results. (it's an art) With limited funds, he secured a large <b>geiger-mueller</b> <b>tube</b> 18 inches long, one inch in diameter, which was adequate for his thesis experiments.He developed the needed accessory circuits (high-voltage source and amplifiers, all battery-powered, a borrowed mechanical pulse counter, and 400 ft of lightweight, high-voltage twin cable on a portable reel). With this equipment Cook found the effect of height on the gamma ray field from the soil (using flagpoles). He also ran fairly accurate (1.5%) radiation profiles at various heights over several gamma-ray sources: boxes of ore, the Mauch Chunk uranium deposit, and 0.1 gram of pure radium borrowed from a hospital! Heights up to 300 ft. were achieved using 6-foot hydrogen-filled balloons from the Meteorology department to lift the detector, preamplifier and cable. This work occupied much of the Winter and Spring of 1950-51. Cook wrote a careful thesis of over 100 pages, with 29 figures, which wife Vi typed in 3 copies, and was approved by the Committee.|$|E
5000|$|The bGeigie Nano is {{available}} as a kit, so the user needs {{to learn how to}} solder in order to build it from the supplied parts. The kit can be purchased from the Kithub product page. The device was developed in collaboration with International Medcom Inc. and shares some parts with their Inspector Alert™ detector. According to the Safecast Github page [...] "bGeigie Nano is a lighter version of the bGeigie Mini using an Arduino Fio, a GpsBee, an OpenLog and an Inspector Alert geiger counter. The aim is to make everything fit in a Pelican Micro Case 1040".The final version of the bGeigie is placed inside the smaller Pelican Micro Case 1010. It features the LND 7317 pancake <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tube</b> type detector, a GPS receiver and is expandable with a Bluetooth module. The mode switch offers choice between geotagged radiation logging (data saved to microSD card) and measuring without GPS - showing also Bq/m2 (Cs137) values. Inside the case the unit is calibrated for gamma radiation. The main unit taken out of its case will additionally do α- and β-detection for careful use as a surface contamination spot meter.|$|E
40|$|Elementary {{particle}} detectors fall broadly into {{only two}} classes: phase-transformation devices, {{such as the}} bubble chamber, and charge-transfer devices like the <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tube.</b> Quantum measurements are seen to involve transitions from a long-lived metastable state (e. g., superheated liquid or a gas of atoms between charged capacitor plates) to a thermodinamically stable condition. A detector is then a specially prepared object undergoing a metastable-to-stable transformation that is significantly enhanced {{by the presence of}} the measured particle, which behaves, in some sense, as the seed of a process of heterogeneous nucleation. Based on this understanding of the operation of a conventional detector, and using results of orthogonality-catastrophe theory, we argue that, in the thermodynamic limit, the pre-measurement Hamiltonian {{is not the same as}} that describing the detector during or after the interaction with a particle and, thus, that superpositions of pointer states (Schroedinger cats) are unphysical because their time evolution is ill defined. Examples of particle-induced changes in the Hamiltonian are also given for ordinary systems whose macroscopic parameters are susceptible to radiation damage, but are not modified by the interaction with a single particle.

40|$|The interplanetary cosmic-ray {{intensity}} {{was measured}} over a complete solar activity cycle for heliocentric distances {{of up to}} 32 AU, using the <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tubes</b> on Pioneer 10 and 11. The study uses the revised background rates derived from observations during the Saturn encounter of Pioneer 11 (September 1, 1979). Time profiles of the intensity for the 1972 - 1984 period have a flat and relatively constant maximum for 1975 through 1977, a brief (8 -month) minimum in mid- 1981, and a maximum centered around early January, 1983. The maximum-to-minimum intensity ratio for the solar activity cycle is approximately 2. 7. The correlation among the Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and Deep River observation results {{is found to be}} fairly good. The radius of the heliospheric modulation region is noted to be greater than 32 AU; certain arguments indicate that it lies between 50 and 100 AU...|$|R
5000|$|The CD V-718 is a {{variation}} of the US military-issue AN/VDR-2 RADIAC made by Nuclear Research Corporation, located in the US State of New Jersey. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) purchased a quantity of CD V-718s in the 1990s as a supplement to and partial replacement for the older meters in the inventory. The CD V-718 differs from the military AN/VDR-2 primarily by being painted bright [...] "civil defense" [...] yellow instead of olive green and being graduated in Röntgens rather than Grays. A much more modern and sophisticated device than earlier CD meters and equipped with a probe containing two <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tubes</b> of differing sensitivities, the CD V-718 can cover a much wider range of radiation levels than the earlier Geiger counters and ion-chamber survey meters combined (from [...]001mR/h to 10,000 R/h). As a result of its military heritage, the CD-V-718 is far more rugged than earlier CD meters, and can easily be mounted in vehicles.|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} of {{galactic cosmic radiation}} in interplanetary space has been observed over the heliocentric radial range 0. 99 to 5. 26 AU with five <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tubes</b> on Pioneer 10 and over the range 1. 00 to 3. 59 AU with three similar tubes on Pioneer 11. The observations span the time period 1972 March 3 to 1974 April 29, near the epoch of minimum solar activity. The contributions of solar energetic particles are eliminated. The effect of temporal trends is removed {{in a variety of}} ways - by comparison of simultaneous measurements on the two spacecraft; by comparison with data from Explorer 35 at 1. 0 AU; and by comparison with terrestrial neutron monitor data. The radial gradient of the {{intensity of}} particles with energies greater than 80 MeV/nucleon is zero to within an experimental uncertainty of less than 2 per cent per AU over the range 0. 99 to 5. 26 AU. Hence, it is less than the theoretically expected value by at least a factor of 5...|$|R

40|$|Sampling during {{environmental}} drilling {{is essential}} to fully characterize the spatial distribution and migration of subsurface contaminants. However, analysis of the samples is expensive and time-consuming: off-site laboratory analysis can take weeks or months. Real-time information on environmental conditions, drill bit location and temperature during drilling is valuable in many environmental restoration operations. This type of information {{can be used to}} provide field screening data and improved efficiency of site characterization activities. The Environmental Measurement-While-Drilling (EMWD) System represents an innovative blending of new and existing technology in order to obtain real-time data during drilling. The system consists of two subsystems. The down-hole subsystem (at the drill bit) consists of sensors, a power supply, a signal conditioning and transmitter board, and a radio-frequency (RF) coaxial cable. The up-hole subsystem consists of a battery pack/coil, pickup coil, receiver, and personal computer. The system is compatible with fluid miser drill pipe, a directional drilling technique that uses minimal drilling fluids and generates little to no secondary waste. In EMWD, downhole sensors are located behind the drill bit and linked by a high-speed data transmission system to a computer at the surface. Sandia-developed Windows{trademark}-based software is used for data display and storage. As drilling is conducted, data is collected on {{the nature and extent of}} contamination, enabling on-the-spot decisions regarding drilling and sampling strategies. Initially, the downhole sensor consisted of a simple gamma radiation detector, a <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>tube</b> (GMT). The design includes data assurance techniques to increase safety by reducing the probability of giving a safe indication when an unsafe condition exists. The EMWD system has been improved by the integration of a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) in place of the GMT. The GRS consists of a sodium iodide-thallium activated crystal coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The output of the PMT goes to a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The MCA data is transmitted to the surface via a signal conditioning and transmitter board similar to that used with the GMT. The EMWD system is described and the results of the GRS field tests and field demonstration are presented...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{radiation}} monitor {{has been developed}} for performing wide-area field surveys for radiation sources. This device integrates the real-time output of multiple radiation detectors into a hand-held personal computer (e. g., a PDA) containing an intuitive graphical user interface. An independent hardware module supplies high voltage to the detectors and contains a rapid sampling system for transferring the detector count rates through an interface to the PDA. The imbedded firmware can be changed for various applications using a programmable memory card. As presently configured, the instrument contains a series of <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> (GM) <b>tubes</b> in a flexible detector string. This linear array of multiple sensors {{can be used by}} US Coast Guard and Customs container inspection personnel to measure radiation intensity in stacks of transport containers where physical access is impeded...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION A <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> (GM) <b>tube</b> is a {{gas-filled}} radiation detector. It commonly {{takes the}} form of a cylindrical outer shell (cathode) and the sealed gas-filled space with a thin central wire (the anode) held at - 1 KV positive voltage with respect to the cathode. The fill gas is generally argon at a pressure of less than 0. 1 arm plus a small quantity of a quenching vapor (whose function is described below). If a gamma ray (- ray) interacts with the GM tube (primarily with the wall by either the Photoelectric Effect or Compton scattering) it will produce an energetic electron that may pass through the interior of the tube. Figure 1. The principal mechanism by which gas-filled counters are sensitive to - rays involves ejection of electrons from the counter wall. Only those interactions that occur within an electron range of the wall's inner surface can result in an output pulse. Ionization along the path of the primary electron results in low energy electrons that will b...|$|R
