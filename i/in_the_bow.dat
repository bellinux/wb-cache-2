5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; {{in about half}} an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|Brody and {{his wife}} Ellen follow an {{ambulance}} to the docks, where they find Tom as he is put on a stretcher; the divers suspect something scared him underwater. Deputy Len Hendricks, Brody's replacement, tells them Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody, along with Ellen and Hendricks, takes the police boat to rescue them. They find Tina hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> of her boat, and she informs them of the shark's presence. Hendricks and Ellen take Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while Brody goes on to find the kids.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe outlet flow {{fields of}} a {{low-speed}} repeating-stage compressor with bowed stator stages are measured with five-hole probe under the near stall condition when the rotor/stator axial gap varies. The {{performances of the}} straight stator stages are investigated and compared to those of <b>the</b> <b>bowed</b> stator stages. <b>The</b> results show that using bowed stator stages could alleviate the flow separation at both upper and low corners of the suction surface and the endwalls, and decrease the losses along the flow passage {{as well as the}} outlet flow angle. As the rotor/stator axial gap decreases, although the diffusion capacity of the compressor increases obviously, the outlet flow field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> straight stator stages deteriorates quickly. By contrast, little changes occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowed</b> stator stages, indicating that as the rotor/stator axial gap decreases, improved performance is achieved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowed</b> stator stages...|$|R
5|$|Documents {{mention the}} {{construction}} of another bucentaur in 1449 larger than the 1311 one, but {{little is known about}} this vessel. The earliest known image of a bucentaur appeared in Jacopo de' Barbari's monumental woodcut Pianta di Venezia (Map of Venice) which was published in 1500. This work pictured a bucentaur afloat in the Arsenale without oars or decoration save for a large wooden sculpture of Justice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> A similar illustration was produced by Andrea Valvassore between 1517 and 1525.|$|E
5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radar mounted {{at the top of}} the foremast.

These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E
5|$|Galleys were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> The galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E

40|$|Wind speed {{measurements}} obtained from anemometers mounted on ships {{are prone to}} systematic errors caused by the distortion of the air flow around the ship's hull and superstructure. This report describes the results of simulations of the air flow around the R. R. S. James Clark Ross made using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software VECTIS. The airflow distortion {{at a number of}} anemometer sites has been quantified for wind speeds of 5 m/s and 15 m/s blowing a) directly over <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> of <b>the</b> ship, and b) directly over the port beam (90 ° to port of <b>the</b> <b>bow).</b> <b>The</b> anemometers <b>in</b> this study were located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> of <b>the</b> ship and also on the port bridge wing. For bow-on flows <b>the</b> instrument sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> of <b>the</b> ship experienced relatively small flow distortion.

The wind speed error varied rapidly from - 40 % to 20 % depending on the exact location of the instrument, and the vertical displacement varied between 5. 3 m and 6. 3 m. For flows over the port beam <b>the</b> instrument sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> of <b>the</b> ship experienced moderate flow distortion with wind speed errors of 9 % to 13 % and vertical displacements of between 4. 8 m and 5. 4 m.

Baden and her sister Bayern were the first German warships to feature guns of this caliber; earlier battleships carried either 28 or 30.5cm (11 or 12inch) guns. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15cm (5.9in) guns, six 8.8cm (3.45in) guns and five 60cm (23.6in) underwater torpedo tubes, one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and two on each beam.

5|$|Since the 19th century, {{humans have}} {{impacted}} Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Valley, among other human activities. Bison {{once lived in}} the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic.

5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir.
