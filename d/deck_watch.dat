25|$|In this circumstance, {{the ability}} of the eyes to adjust to darkness, to detect moving targets at low levels of illumination, and mental attentiveness are all effected. The Commandant states,"It is {{imperative}} that the <b>deck</b> <b>watch</b> of any vessel be in complete control of his faculties", and the evidence shows that Auletta was not in control of his faculties, as it is inconceivable that such an experienced mariner could either ignore or fail to see the Frosta unless his faculties were impaired.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Coast Guard Academy is a {{four-year}} service academy located in New London, Connecticut. Approximately 200 cadets graduate each year, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission as an ensign in the Coast Guard. Graduates {{are obligated to}} serve a minimum of five years on active duty. Most graduates are assigned to duty aboard Coast Guard cutters immediately after graduation, either as <b>Deck</b> <b>Watch</b> Officers (DWOs) or as Engineer Officers in Training (EOITs). Smaller numbers are assigned directly to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida or to shore duty at Coast Guard Sector, District, or Area headquarters units.|$|E
2500|$|Buck {{planned to}} quit {{high school in}} 1941 to take a {{full-time}} job {{in an effort to}} support his family. Dissuaded by one of his teachers, Buck decided to finish high school, graduating from Lakewood High School in the winter of 1942. After graduation, he followed one of his friends and began working on an iron ore freight boat operated on the Great Lakes by the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company. Buck served on a [...] steamer named [...] "The Sheadle", where he began as porter and was later promoted to night cook and baker. After performing various other shipping related jobs, Buck attempted to become a [...] "deck watch". A physical examination related to the <b>deck</b> <b>watch</b> application process revealed Buck was color blind, unable to differentiate between the colors green and brown. Ineligible for the promotion to <b>deck</b> <b>watch,</b> Buck subsequently became eligible for the military draft, and was drafted into the United States Army in June 1943.|$|E

2500|$|All graduating cadets earn {{commissions}} as ensigns in the United States Coast Guard, {{as well as}} Bachelor of Science degrees. For {{that reason}} the academy maintains a core curriculum of science and professional development courses in addition to major-specific courses. Each cadet takes two semesters of classes {{during the school year}} and then spends the majority of the summer in military training to produce officers of character with the requisite professional skills. Among these are courses in leadership, ethics, organizational behavior, and nautical science. The majority of cadets report to their first units after graduating, which are either afloat units, shore units, or basic flight training as student naval aviators, with the training conducted {{under the auspices of the}} U.S. Navy. [...] Those that are assigned afloat serve as either <b>deck</b> <b>watch</b> officers or student engineers. [...] Professional maritime studies courses help prepare cadets in piloting, voyage planning, deck seamanship, and all aspects of shiphandling, as well as Coast Guard leadership and administrative duties.|$|E

60|$|What a delightful, lazy, languid {{time we had}} whilst we {{were thus}} gliding along! There {{was nothing to be}} done; a {{circumstance}} that happily suited our disinclination to do anything. We abandoned the fore-peak altogether, and spreading an awning over the forecastle, slept, ate, and lounged under it the live-long day. Every one seemed to be under the influence of some narcotic. Even the officers aft, whose duty required them never to be seated while keeping a <b>deck</b> <b>watch,</b> vainly endeavoured to keep on their pins; and were obliged invariably to compromise the matter by leaning up against the bulwarks, and gazing abstractedly over the side. Reading was out of the question; take a book in your hand, and you were asleep in an instant.|$|E
