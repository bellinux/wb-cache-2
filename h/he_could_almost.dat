5|$|A classic {{victory was}} within his grasp but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel his adversary's breath on his neck. Somehow Garin {{held on to}} his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|E
500|$|The 17th-century rise of Britain's American {{colonies and}} the rapid 18th-century {{expansion}} of the Atlantic slave trade had made Bristol an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised {{in what was then}} the second-largest city in England. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the Province of Carolina, Tobias Knight. The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family. [...] He may have arrived in the Caribbean {{in the last years of}} the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a slave ship). [...] The 18th-century author Charles Johnson claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from Jamaica on privateer ships during the War of the Spanish Succession, and that [...] "he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage". [...] At what point during the war Teach joined the fighting is, in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.|$|E
500|$|The {{press was}} given an {{opportunity}} to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, [...] "an unqualified disaster". A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered. The Sunday Times called the C5 a [...] "Formula One bath-chair"; its reporter [...] "had travelled five yards outdoors when everything when phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule". The Guardians reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes, while Your Computer found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: [...] "The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive [...] "peep, peep" [...] noise signalling that the engine had overheated." [...] Even the distinguished former racing driver Stirling Moss ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported that while he had started out well, [...] "a jaunty smile on [...] face as he braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> drive underneath", he ran into problems when he reached a hill: [...] "It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead. On a cold and foggy London day, the great man was visibly sweating." ...|$|E
60|$|Although Mike {{carried out}} his {{suggestion}} {{as gently as}} <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> Desmond <b>almost</b> fainted with pain.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{knew their}} customs. The death blow {{had not been}} struck. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> tell <b>almost</b> to a minute how far the dance had gone.|$|R
50|$|As a young man, Quentin {{displayed}} a natural mechanical aptitude. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> fix <b>almost</b> anything, and rebuilt a motorcycle {{to present to}} a friend as a gift.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did you say {{anything}} to him, Miss May?' said Leonard, turning on her a flushed face, as if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have been angered with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{said his}} {{shoulder}} hurt him awfully last night," [...] added Grace. [...] "I heard him tell ma <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel the bullet worrying {{him in the}} flesh." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{disappeared}} {{under the}} bed just in time. He lay and [...] "breathed" [...] himself for a time, and then crept to where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> touch his aunt's foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Elizabeth, [...] "it is too bad. Take a {{man like}} that; with a college {{education}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> attain <b>almost</b> any decree of success he chose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, she ha'n't took wing yet, I'm {{thankful to}} think," [...] said Whitwell, {{and he spoke}} from his own large mind to the sympathy of an old friend who <b>he</b> felt <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> share his {{feelings}} as a father.|$|R
50|$|Paul Josef Herbert Scharner (born 11 March 1980) is an Austrian retired footballer. He {{operated}} {{mainly as}} a defender, although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play <b>almost</b> every midfield position as well. He {{was known for}} his great flexibility and haircuts.|$|R
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} intensely moved. He {{was filled with}} the warmth of her. In the glow <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel {{her as if she were}} present--her arms, her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them, almost contain them.|$|E
60|$|And thus, {{the more}} Berenger {{heard of the}} state of things, the less hopeful did his cause appear, till <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have {{believed}} his best chance lay in Philip's plan of persuading the Huguenots to storm the convent.|$|E
60|$|James {{stood for}} a moment, {{not knowing what to}} answer; his knees trembled, and he sweated with the agony of his love. It was an angry, furious passion, that made him feel <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> seize the woman by the throat and {{strangle}} her.|$|E
60|$|So it was arranged, {{and then}} the three talked over the details. Cadmus {{said it was a}} good tern miles to the nearest point of the mainland, but that he was certain <b>he</b> <b>could</b> steer <b>almost</b> a {{straight}} course thither.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father never}} {{in his life}} said {{anything}} to me about his own money affairs, though he says {{a great deal about}} mine. No man ever was closer than my father. But I believe that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> afford <b>almost</b> anything." ...|$|R
60|$|On several {{occasions}} Ralph had had sharp words with Percy because the latter wished {{to do as}} he pleased on the bridge, against the printed rules that were posted up. Because his parent was squire, Percy imagined <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do <b>almost</b> anything {{and it would be}} all right.|$|R
6000|$|... "It did {{not make}} the sin the less; but among her fellow-mortals--" [...] And then he stopped himself, wanting words to express his meaning. The sin, till it was repented, was damning; but now that it was repented, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> love the sinner for the sin.|$|E
60|$|He felt {{a strange}} and vivid value in all the earth around him, in the grass under his feet; he felt the love of life in all living things. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy that he heard the grass growing; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were {{springing}} up and breaking into blossom in the meadow--flowers blood red and burning gold and blue, fulfilling the whole pageant of the spring. And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm, staring, hypnotic eyes of the Marquis, they saw the little tuft of almond tree against the sky-line. He {{had the feeling that}} if by some miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree, desiring nothing else in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "The traitors," [...] said Flambeau, and shuddered. As {{he looked}} around at the inhuman {{landscape}} of trees, with taunting and almost obscene outlines, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy he was Dante, and the priest with the rivulet of a voice was, indeed, a Virgil leading him through a land of eternal sins.|$|E
60|$|I {{was as much}} {{moved as}} <b>he.</b> ‘I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> beg you to do otherwise,’ I said. ‘I was a brute to come to you, a brute and a coward. You are a noble enemy; you will make a noble soldier.’ And with rather a happy idea of a {{compliment}} for this warlike youth, I stood up straight {{and gave him the}} salute.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{proficient}} pianist {{who loved}} entertaining others, had an amazing memory for dates and information and enjoyed telling jokes and stories which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> match to <b>almost</b> any subject or occasion.|$|R
5|$|After Crisis Cores release, Kitase {{expressed}} {{surprised at}} {{the quality of the}} cutscenes, to the point where <b>he</b> felt it <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be a PlayStation 2 game. He also enjoyed the game's ending, surprised by how moving Zack's story became.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{walked across}} from Wain's, {{where he had}} changed, feeling quite hollow. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have cried with pure fright. Bob had shouted after him from a window as he passed Donaldson's, to wait, {{so that they could}} walk over together; but {{conversation}} was the last thing Mike desired at that moment.|$|E
60|$|The {{man sitting}} on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly out to sea. Now he was once more in repose. Flambeau felt quite certain {{that one of his}} eyes was {{naturally}} larger than the other. Both were now well opened, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy the left eye grew larger as he gazed.|$|E
60|$|The School Play came {{almost as}} a relief to Kipps. In the flusterment of going in <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> forget for a time his Laocoon {{struggle}} to explain, and in the intervals {{he did his best}} to keep forgetting. But Helen, with a gentle insistence, resumed the explanation of Chitterlow as they returned towards Folkestone.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} ten {{years since he}} had last been inside Windles, and it never {{occurred}} to him that in this progressive age even a woman like his aunt Adeline, of whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> believe <b>almost</b> anything, would still be using candles and oil-lamps as a means of illumination. His only doubt was whether the switch was where it was in most houses, near the door.|$|R
60|$|Sir Marmaduke {{modified}} {{his disappointment}} a little that night, {{when he had}} talked Philip {{into a state of}} feverishness and suffering that became worse under Madame de Quinet's reproofs and remedies, and only yielded to Eustacie's long and patient soothing. <b>He</b> then <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have owned that it was well she was not like his own cherished type of womanhood, and the next day he changed his opinion still more, even as to her appearance.|$|R
50|$|Zygmunt Gorazdowski {{was born}} on 1 November 1845 in Sanok to the {{politician}} Szczęsny Gorazdowski (c.1813-May 1903) and Aleksandra Łazowska; his parents had married in 1843 and his paternal grandparents were Szymon Gorazdowski and Maria Dobrzańskich. He was baptized on 9 November 1845 at a Franciscan church. In his childhood he suffered a lung ailment that became tuberculosis; this did not prevent him from considering {{the needs of others}} and offering his help wherever <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>almost</b> died in 1846 during the Galician slaughter that saw peasants revolt against serfdom and he managed to survive when his parents hid him under a mill's wheel. In 1863 he joined the uprising against the Russian occupation.|$|R
60|$|Mike felt as Robinson Crusoe {{felt when}} he met Friday. Here was a fellow human being in this desert place. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have embraced Psmith. The very sound of the name Lower Benford was heartening. His dislike for his new school was not diminished, but now he felt that life there might at least be tolerable.|$|E
60|$|He {{learned to}} know the little hands and feet, the strange, unseeing, golden-brown eyes, the mouth that opened only to cry, or to suck, or to show a queer, toothless laugh. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> {{understand}} even the dangling legs, which at first had created in him a feeling of aversion. They could kick in their queer little way, {{they had their own}} softness.|$|E
60|$|Greed had {{prompted}} him to an act, the discovery of which by his companion could lead only to the most frightful consequences for Werper. Already <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel those strong, white fangs burying themselves in his neck. He shuddered. Far out across the plain a leopard screamed, and in the dense reeds behind him some great beast moved on padded feet.|$|E
60|$|The {{interval}} between {{the delivery of}} this message, {{and the arrival of}} Mr Squeers, was very short; but, before he came, Ralph had suppressed every sign of emotion, and once more regained the hard, immovable, inflexible manner which was habitual to him, and to which, perhaps, was ascribable no small part of the influence which, over many men of no very strong prejudices on the score of morality, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> exert, <b>almost</b> at will.|$|R
60|$|Now, why had {{the fellow}} said that? Curious how this desperate secret feeling {{of his own}} made him see {{sinister}} meaning in this servant, in Oliver's visit of last night--in everything. It was vile--this suspiciousness! <b>He</b> <b>could</b> feel, <b>almost</b> see, himself deteriorating already, with this furtive feeling in his soul. It would soon be written on his face! But what {{was the use of}} troubling? What would come, would--one way or the other.|$|R
60|$|The captain stared about him, {{apparently}} as much {{confounded by}} {{the situation as}} was the boy. But his mind was quickly brought to the consideration of things which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> understand. <b>Almost</b> at his feet was Maka, lying on his face, his arms and head {{over the edge of}} what might be a bank or a bottomless precipice, and yelling piteously. Making a step toward him, the captain saw that he had hold of another man, several feet below him, and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not pull him up.|$|R
