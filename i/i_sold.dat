5|$|In 1603, the {{unification}} of the Scottish and English crowns eliminated any residual need for Dunstanburgh Castle as a royal fortress. The following year, King James <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> the castle to Sir Thomas Windebank, Thomas Billott and William Blake, who in turn sold it onto Sir Ralph Grey, a nearby landowner, the following year. Ralph's son, William Lord Grey, was affirmed {{as the owner of}} the castle in 1625.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} barbican had been {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for houses and the moat had begun to be occupied with housing. By 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all {{around the edge of the}} bailey wall. In 1611 King James <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, {{took charge of the}} castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E

5|$|Still ruined, Bowes Castle was {{reclaimed}} by the Crown in 1361; between 1444 and 1471 it {{was controlled}} by the Neville family, powerful regional landowners, before reverting to the Crown once again. James <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> the castle in the early 17th century and the remaining fortifications were dismantled in the mid-17th century after the English Civil War. By 1928, the castle was in a poor condition, with little interest being shown in it from locals or its owner, Lady Lorna Curzon-Howe. Facing death duties on her estate, Curzon-Howe agreed to pass the castle into {{the care of the}} Office of Works in 1931.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, the Manor of Ebury was divided up and leased by the Crown to {{servants}} or favourites. In 1623, James <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> the freehold of Ebury for £1,151 and 15 shillings. The land was sold on several more times, until it {{came into the}} hands of heiress Mary Davies in 1666.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{construction}} of London's bridges and the Underground, the River Thames {{had served as a}} major thoroughfare for centuries. Attempts to regulate the transport of passengers and goods began in 1197, when King Richard <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> the Crown's rights over the Thames to the City of London Corporation, which then attempted to license boats on the river. In 1510 Henry VIII granted a licence to watermen that gave exclusive rights to carry passengers on the river, and in 1555 an Act of Parliament set up the Company of Watermen and Lightermen to control traffic on the Thames.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July 1507 Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> the County of Kirchberg, {{located at}} Ulm, the {{adjacent}} lordship Weißenhorn {{with the associated}} city, {{as well as the}} lordships Wullenstetten and Pfaffenhofen(Roth) from the Habsburg possessions in Further Austria to Jakob Fugger. Maximilian I who crowned himself Holy Roman Emperor in 1508 received a payment of 50.000 guilders for these sales. More sales followed in 1508 where he sold manor Schmiechen and in 1514 where he sold the lordship Biberbach to Fugger. Maximilian I elevated Jakob Fugger into nobility in 1511 and granted him the title of Imperial Count in 1514 so the former burgher could operate his business without interference from local nobility. In the course of his life Jakob Fugger also became lord of more than 50 smaller villages.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} 1990s {{saw another}} {{downturn}} in the industry, with Gottlieb, Capcom, and Alvin G. closing {{by the end of}} 1996. Data East's pinball division was acquired by Sega and became Sega Pinball in 1994. By 1997, there were two companies left: Sega Pinball and Williams. In 1999, Sega sold their pinball division to Gary Stern (President of Sega Pinball at the time) who called his company Stern Pinball. By this time, Williams games rarely sold more than 4,000 units. In 1999, Williams attempted to revive sales with the Pinball 2000 line of games, merging a video display into the pinball playfield. The reception was initially good with Revenge From Mars selling well over 6,000 machines, but short of the 10,000-plus production runs for releases just six years earlier. The next Pinball 2000 game, Star Wars Episode <b>I,</b> <b>sold</b> only a little over 3,500 machines. Williams exited the pinball business to focus on making gaming equipment for casinos, which was more profitable. They licensed the rights to reproduce Bally/Williams parts to Illinois Pinball and the rights to reproduce full-sized machines to The Pinball Factory. Stern Pinball remained the only manufacturer of original pinball machines until 2013, when Jersey Jack Pinball started shipping The Wizard of Oz. Most members of the design teams for Stern Pinball are former employees of Williams.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the Congressional hearings, Night Trap started to {{generate}} more sales and released ports to the PC, Sega 32X, and 3DO. [...] According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, [...] "You know, <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> 50,000 units of Night Trap a week after those hearings." [...] Although experiencing increased sales, Sega decided to recall Night Trap and re-release it with revisions in 1994 due to the Congressional hearings. [...] After the close of these hearings, video game manufacturers came together to establish the rating system that Lieberman had called for. [...] Initially, Sega proposed the universal adoption of its system, but after objections by Nintendo and others, Sega took a role in forming a new one. This became the Entertainment Software Rating Board, an independent organization that received praise from Lieberman. [...] With this new rating system in place, Nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed, and the SNES port of Mortal Kombat II was released uncensored.|$|E
500|$|The castle began {{a second}} period of {{decline in the}} 16th century. After 1518, no more money was spent {{repairing}} the castle. The inner bailey became used first as a rubbish tip, then for small-scale agriculture. By 1585, the castle was [...] "very ruynaise and in greete decaye". In contrast to many royal castles, Southampton Castle was never converted into a gaol, with Southampton's two prisons instead being built in the town at the Bargate and on Fish Street. In 1618 James <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> the castle to property speculators; it was then sold on to George Gollop, a local merchant, and a windmill was subsequently built on the motte. The castle played {{no role in the}} subsequent English Civil War, although some of the masonry was used to strengthen the town walls in 1650. Two of the entrances to the castle, Southgate and Castle Eastgate, were demolished in the late 18th century; and the remaining castle buildings fell into significant disrepair.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, {{during the time}} of King James I, {{abortive}} plans were made to drain and enclose much of Sedgemoor, which the local Lords supported but opposed by the Commoners who would have lost grazing rights. In 1632, Charles <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> the Crown's interest in the scheme, and it was taken over by a consortium that included Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch drainage engineer. However, the work was delayed by the English Civil War and later defeated in parliament after local opposition. In 1638, it was reported that nearly [...] of Tealham and Tadham Moors were not reclaimed, with a total of [...] being undrained. Between 1785 and 1791, much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed.

There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Several years later, Gail Berman, a Fox executive, {{approached}} Whedon {{to develop}} his Buffy concept into a television series. Whedon explained that [...] "They said, 'Do {{you want to do}} a show?' And I thought, 'High school as a horror movie'. And so the metaphor became the central concept behind Buffy, and that's how <b>I</b> <b>sold</b> it." [...] The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with adolescence and young adulthood. Early in its development, the series was going to be simply titled Slayer. Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute non-broadcast pilot that was shown to networks and eventually sold to the WB Network. Buffy the Vampire Slayer first aired on March 10, 1997, as a mid season replacement for the show Savannah on The WB network, and {{played a key role in}} the growth of the Warner Bros. television network in its early years.

He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
