5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} bovids have horns, {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess horns. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic {{structure}} is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A <b>high</b> <b>correlation</b> exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the <b>high</b> <b>correlation</b> between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various Echis species, and found a <b>high</b> <b>correlation</b> between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E

This <b>higher</b> <b>correlation</b> is mainly driven by common <b>higher</b> <b>correlation</b> with international stock returns and not by <b>higher</b> <b>correlation</b> between country specific components of return.

We hypothesized that Eurocentricity and attractiveness would be positively correlated, overall, but differ across sex and ethnicity.

Additionally, we predicted that Asians, Caucasians/Europeans, and Hispanics/Latinos would show a <b>higher</b> <b>correlation</b> between Eurocentricity and attractiveness than African Americans/Blacks and mixed individuals.

Participants completed a Eurocentric Attractiveness Survey where they rated thirty photos, with pre-determined Eurocentricity scores, on attractiveness. Using Pearson Product-Moment correlations, we found a positive overall correlation between mean Eurocentricity scores and mean Attractiveness scores, but it was not significant. However, their relationship significantly differed across sex and ethnicity. Specifically, men showed a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>correlation</b> between Eurocentricity and Attractiveness than women.

25|$|Yet another {{explanation}} of the <b>high</b> <b>correlation</b> between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of extraversion {{is a tendency to}} behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and excitement, that person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly correlated with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{attempting}} a model-free inversion of the DSC profile {{to extract the}} underlying probability density function, they assumed a specific free energy functional with either one or two minima (similar to the Landau theory of phase transitions) thus enabling the extraction of free energy barrier heights. This model {{is the first of}} its kind in physical biochemistry that enables the determination of barrier heights from equilibrium experiments. Analysis of the DSC profile of BBL with this model resulted in zero barrier height, i.e. downhill folding, confirming the earlier result from the statistical mechanical model. When the variable-barrier model was applied to a set of proteins for which both the rate and DSC data are available, a very <b>high</b> <b>correlation</b> of 0.95 was obtained between the rates and barrier heights. Many of the proteins examined had small barriers (<20 kJ/mol) with baseline crossing evident for proteins that fold faster than 1 ms. This is in contrast to the traditional assumption that the free energy barrier between the folded and unfolded states are large.|$|E
25|$|The {{image on}} the right shows scatter plots of Anscombe's quartet, a set of four {{different}} pairs of variables created by Francis Anscombe. The four y variables have the same mean (7.5), variance (4.12), correlation (0.816) and regression line (y=3+0.5x). However, {{as can be seen}} on the plots, the distribution of the variables is very different. The first one (top left) seems to be distributed normally, and corresponds to what one would expect when considering two variables correlated and following the assumption of normality. The second one (top right) is not distributed normally; while an obvious relationship between the two variables can be observed, it is not linear. In this case the Pearson correlation coefficient does not indicate that there is an exact functional relationship: only the extent to which that relationship can be approximated by a linear relationship. In the third case (bottom left), the linear relationship is perfect, except for one outlier which exerts enough influence to lower the correlation coefficient from 1 to 0.816. Finally, the fourth example (bottom right) shows another example when one outlier is enough to produce a <b>high</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient, even though {{the relationship between the two}} variables is not linear.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the main acceleration phase of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the particle acceleration in the associated flares as evidenced in RHESSI non-thermal X-rays for a set of 37 impulsive flare-CME events. CME peak velocity and peak acceleration yield distinct correlations with various parameters characterizing the flare-accelerated electron spectra. The <b>highest</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient is obtained for the relation of the CME peak velocity and the total energy in accelerated electrons (c = 0. 85), supporting the idea that the acceleration of the CME and the particle acceleration in the associated flare draw their energy from a common source, probably magnetic reconnection in the current sheet behind the erupting structure. In general, the CME peak velocity shows somewhat <b>higher</b> <b>correlations</b> with the non-thermal flare parameters than the CME peak acceleration, except for the spectral index of the accelerated electron spectrum which yields a <b>higher</b> <b>correlation</b> with the CME peak acceleration (c = - 0. 6), indicating that the hardness of the flare-accelerated electron spectrum is tightly coupled to the impulsive acceleration process of the rising CME structure. We also obtained <b>high</b> <b>correlations</b> between the CME initiation height h_ 0 and the non-thermal flare parameters, with the <b>highest</b> <b>correlation</b> of h_ 0 to the spectral index of flare-accelerated electrons (c = 0. 8).
