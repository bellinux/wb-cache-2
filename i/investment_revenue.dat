50|$|Additionally, Rep. Setzler is {{the sponsor}} of HR-9 (2009) the Freedom of Ownership Amendment (FOA) to the Georgia constitution.

Once this payment is made (estimated at 30% of the property value), the subject property will be permanently and unconditionally free from ad valorem property taxation, a benefit that will be transferable upon sale to all subsequent owners.

50|$|Reforms {{made in the}} Indian Money Market are:-Deregulation of the Interest Rate : In recent {{period the}} {{government}} has adopted an interest rate policy of liberal nature. It lifted the ceiling rates of the call money market, short-term deposits, bills rediscounting, etc. Commercial banks are advised to see the interest rate change that takes place within the limit. There was a further deregulation of interest rates during the economic reforms. Currently interest rates {{are determined by the}} working of market forces except for a few regulations.Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMFs) : In order to provide additional short-term <b>investment</b> <b>revenue,</b> the RBI encouraged and established the Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs) in April 1992. MMMFs are allowed to sell units to corporate and individuals. The upper limit of 50 crore investments has also been lifted. Financial institutions such as the IDBI and the UTI have set up such funds.Establishment of the DFI : The Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) was set up in April 1988 to impart liquidity in the money market. It was set up jointly by the RBI, Public sector Banks and Financial Institutions. DFHI has {{played an important role in}} stabilizing the Indian money market.Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) : Through the LAF, the RBI remains in the money market on a continue basis through the repo transaction. LAF adjusts liquidity in the market through absorption and or injection of financial resources.Electronic Transactions : In order to impart transparency and efficiency in the money market transaction the electronic dealing system has been started. It covers all deals in the money market. Similarly it is useful for the RBI to watchdog the money market.Establishment of the CCIL : The Clearing Corporation of India limited (CCIL) was set up in April 2001. The CCIL clears all transactions in government securities, and repurchase agreements (repos) reported on the Negotiated Dealing System.Development of New Market Instruments : The government has consistently tried to introduce new short-term investment instruments. Examples: Treasury Bills of various duration, Commercial papers, Certificates of Deposits, MMMFs, etc. have been introduced in the Indian Money Market.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we endogenize the {{objective}} {{functions of the}} regions {{as well as their}} decision to provide public investment in a model of competition for foreign owned mobile capital. We demonstrate that the competing regions can `restrict race-to-the-bottom' in tax rates by deviating away from social welfare to net tax revenue. It is optimal for a region to be fully revenue oriented even if that region's ultimate goal is to maximize social welfare, irrespective of whether the rival region is concerned about social welfare or net tax revenue. Moreover, we demonstrate that the regions have unilateral incentive to spend on public investment, except in case of perfect spillover. In equilibrium, both the regions spend on public investment and end up with Pareto inferior outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the relationship between corporate social <b>investment</b> and <b>revenue</b> in Woolworths Holdings Limited South Africa. The approach is thus a single case study, and financial data on social <b>investment</b> and <b>revenue</b> was retrieved from the Woolworths Holdings’ Good Business Journey report 2008 - 2013 and from its annual report of 2002 - 2007. Using the SPSS statistics software, a correlation was sought between the Woolworths Holdings’ social <b>investment</b> expenditure and <b>revenue,</b> earnings per share and return on equity. Findings from the analysis revealed that, within the six years of Woolworths Holdings’ Good Business Journey, a significant positive relationship exists between Woolworths Holdings’ social <b>investment</b> and its <b>revenue,</b> earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE). A further analysis of difference in means using the t-test statistics indicates that the revenue streams to Woolworths Holdings’ between 2008 – 2013 is significantly greater than the revenue streams in the six years before the Good Business Journey. In conclusion, the paper suggests a new research model, referred to in this research as the share holders’ support for corporate social investment model, and it is represented as: SHSSI = f (Rv+Es+Re+Of). The paper thus offers an agenda for further research to apply the above model to evaluate the degree of shareholders’ interest and support for corporate social investment in retailing and other companie...|$|R
