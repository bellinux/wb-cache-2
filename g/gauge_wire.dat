500|$|Many audiophiles {{and reporters}} {{disagree}} on whether more expensive cables {{have an effect}} on audio quality. In 1980 Speaker Builder said that Monster audio cables were [...] "a reasonable investment" [...] and that they out-perform generic 24- or 18- gauge cables. Tests by Stereo Review Magazine in 1983 concluded that Monster cables did not {{make a difference in the}} sound and were [...] "indistinguishable" [...] from 16-gauge lamp cord. Smaller gauge numbers equate to larger wire, so this is a comparison to heavier (16 <b>gauge)</b> <b>wire</b> [...] than 18 or 24 gauge speaker wires. [...] The same publication in 1990 said that whether the cables are worth it depends on the application and the user's willingness to pay a premium.|$|E
2500|$|In Mississippi, along State Route 63, {{chain link}} fences were built to prevent gopher {{tortoise}} mortality from traffic. These fences, made from heavy <b>gauge</b> <b>wire</b> for durability, are three {{feet high and}} are buried one foot below the surface. The fences have [...] "turnarounds" [...] at either end, which are angled fences that redirect tortoises back into the area from which they come.

2500|$|The biceps muscle {{can only}} be used for this {{transfer}} if the other elbow flexors are intact (m. brachialis and m. brachioradialis). This procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia but can be performed under supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. The incision depends on {{whether there is a}} contracture that needs to be released. If this is the case a wide exposure of the anterior side of the elbow joint is needed. The distal side of the incision should allow complete dissection of the tendon of the biceps. The primary tendon of the biceps is released from its insertion on the radius [...] and then rerouted medial or lateral. If the ulnar nerve is functional a lateral route is favored to prevent compression, however, the lateral route can cause compression of the radial nerve. A second incision is made to expose the triceps insertion and the triceps is dissected from its insertion on the olecranon. A hole is then drilled in the olecranon and a <b>gauge</b> <b>wire</b> is then looped in the hole. The biceps is routed through a skin tunnel to the posterior side and woven into the triceps tendon to create more length. Then the tendon is inserted to the olecranon.|$|E

5000|$|Since 1976 when New Zealand {{adopted the}} metric system, number 8 wire is officially {{referred}} to as 4.0 mm <b>gauge</b> <b>wire,</b> although the older term [...] "Number 8 wire" [...] continues to be commonly applied. Fencing now predominantly uses 2.5 mm high-tensile wire.|$|E
50|$|Increasing gauge numbers denote {{decreasing}} wire diameters, {{which is}} similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as SWG. This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire.

Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.|$|E

50|$|The car {{cigarette}} lighter socket is also called a cigar lighter receptacle, {{since it was}} originally designed as a lighter for cigars—hence its rather large size. These sockets were not originally designed to provide DC power, and are not an ideal DC connector for several reasons. Three sizes exist, one for 6 VDC and two for 12 VDC and the mating of the different sized 12 VDC plugs and jacks is problematic. Because of this, and the small <b>gauge</b> <b>wire</b> sometimes used, they may provide unreliable power connections.|$|E

50|$|Stråhle stated at the {{conclusion}} of the article that he had implemented the string scale in the highest three octaves of a clavichord, although it is unclear whether this section would have been strung all with the same <b>gauge</b> <b>wire</b> under equal tension like the monochord which he wrote it resembled, and whose construction he described in more detail. He only described an indirect method of setting its tuning, however, requiring that he first establish reference pitches by transferring the corresponding string lengths to the movable bridges on a keyed thirteen string monochord whose open strings had been previously tuned in unison.|$|E
50|$|Cages with {{incorrectly}} sized {{wire gauge}} bottoms (as opposed to small <b>gauge</b> <b>wire</b> or solid bottoms) can harm {{the feet of}} a Flemish Giant more so than smaller house rabbits due to their increased weight. A resting board {{may be required to}} prevent sore hocks for a larger breed rabbit. The Flemish Giant will require larger quantities of food compared to smaller breeds of domestic rabbits. Like some other short hair breeds of rabbits, the Flemish Giant will usually require mild attention to grooming due to its shorter hair. Shedding during the spring and fall transition periods tend to be the most dramatic, with smaller sheds often occurring in between.|$|E
50|$|The camp {{measured}} 200 yards by 1000 {{yards and}} {{was surrounded by}} a 12 feet high wooden fence fixed with heavy <b>gauge</b> <b>wire.</b> There were 33 barracks, all one story buildings 120' x 16' with ten rooms to a barracks. Constructed of wood with tight tar paper roofs, and windows with panes. Officers were billeted three or four per room measuring 9' x 10', with four to six enlisted men accommodated in rooms of same size. There was no heating whatsoever, which was a serious problem in the winter months as the men were living on starvation diets. Each room had one 15-watt light bulb.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} three wires in the basic {{sheathed}} cable, in the United States it is referred to by its gauge {{and the number of}} the insulated (non-ground wires). Thus, 14-2 ("fourteen two") describes 14 <b>gauge</b> <b>wires</b> (black, white, ground). 12-2 describes thicker <b>wire,</b> 12 <b>gauge.</b> These types of cable are used for most (single pole) switches and receptacles.|$|R
25|$|American <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> (AWG), {{also known}} as the Brown & Sharpe <b>wire</b> <b>gauge,</b> is a {{standardized}} <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> system used since 1857 predominantly in North America for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire.

50|$|A laser wire {{stripper}} is a computer-controlled machine, {{much like a}} CNC router, which uses a laser to burn off the insulation of the wire.

5000|$|With the DC switch set to its [...] "AC" [...] {{position}} and the AC switch set to [...] "DC", no current can flow through the instrument. However whenever any moving coil instrument {{is likely to be}} subjected to heavy shock in transit, it is good practice to damp the movement by short circuiting the moving coil using a heavy <b>gauge</b> <b>wire</b> connected across the terminals. On earlier Avometers, this may be done by short-circuiting the input terminals and selecting the most sensitive direct current range. The Model 8 Mark V, 6 & 7 were provided with an [...] "OFF" [...] position on the DC switch which both disconnected the meter's terminals and short-circuited the moving coil.|$|E

50|$|Standard <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> used {{to refer}} to the number of dies through which the wire had been pulled. Thus, a higher-numbered <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> meant a thinner wire. Typical {{telephone}} wires were 22-gauge, while main power cables might be 3- or 4-gauge.|$|R
5000|$|Humidity - If {{the wires}} {{connecting}} the strain gauge to the signal conditioner are not protected against humidity, such as bare wire, corrosion can occur, leading to parasitic resistance. This can allow currents to flow between the wires and the substrate {{to which the}} strain gauge is glued, or between the two wires directly, introducing an error which competes with the current flowing through the strain gauge. For this reason, high-current, low-resistance strain gauges (120 ohm) are less prone {{to this type of}} error. To avoid this error it is sufficient to protect the strain <b>gauges</b> <b>wires</b> with insulating enamel (e.g., epoxy or polyurethane type). Strain <b>gauges</b> with unprotected <b>wires</b> may be used only in a dry laboratory environment but not in an industrial one.|$|R
