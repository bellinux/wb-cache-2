5|$|The series {{features}} {{a number of}} recurring character archetypes. Most famously, every game since Final FantasyII, including subsequent remakes of the original Final Fantasy, {{features a}} character named Cid. Cid's appearance, personality, goals, and role in the game (non-playable ally, party member, villain) vary dramatically. However, two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are 1) being a scientist or engineer, and 2) being tied <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid {{has at least one}} of these two traits.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, various {{independent}} delegates {{gathered in}} Indianapolis to nominate a presidential ticket to campaign on those issues. For president, they chose Peter Cooper, an 85-year-old industrialist and philanthropist from New York, with Samuel Fenton Cary, a former congressman from Ohio, {{as his running}} mate. The Greenback ticket fared poorly in the election that November, attracting just 81,740 votes—less than 1% of the total. As bad economic times continued, however, the party gained momentum. Labor unrest the following year, culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, added to many laborers' alienation from the two major parties. Local movements, like California's Workingmen's Party, began to agitate for laws to improve the condition of laborers (and {{for an end to}} Chinese immigration). By 1878, the third-party movement had become strong enough to elect 22 independents to the federal House of Representatives, most tied <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Greenback movement. As the 1880 presidential election approached, members of the Greenback Party (or Greenback-Labor Party, as it was sometimes known) had reason to believe that they could improve on the results of 1876.|$|E

5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project can be anything. Their paper then has to relate <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> their project, so if the project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house. The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E

25|$|Contemporarily, it is {{commonly}} seen only at graduation ceremonies, but formerly academic dress was, {{and to a lesser}} degree in many ancient universities still is, worn daily. Today, the ensembles are distinctive <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> each institution, and generally consist of a gown (also known as a robe) with a separate hood, and usually a cap (generally either a square academic cap, a tam, or a bonnet). Academic dress is also worn by members of certain learned societies and institutions as official dress.|$|E
25|$|Children in {{indigenous}} communities can also {{learn from the}} underlying message of a story. For example, in a nahuatl community near Mexico City, stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the ahuaque, the protagonist dies. In this way, storytelling serves {{as a way to}} teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.|$|E
25|$|Biofeedback {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine that involves measuring a subject's quantifiable bodily functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, sweat gland activity, and muscle tension, conveying the information to the patient in real-time. This raises the patient's awareness and conscious control of his or her unconscious physiological activities. Neal Miller is generally considered the father of modern-day biofeedback. Miller theorized the basic principles of biofeedback by applying his theory that classical and operant conditioning were both the result of a common learning principle in 1961. Miller hypothesized that any measurable physiological behavior within the human body would respond <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> voluntary control.|$|E

25|$|Stevenson {{helped to}} found the Society for Scientific Exploration in 1982, {{and was the}} author of around three hundred papers and {{fourteen}} books on reincarnation, including Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation (1966) and European Cases of the Reincarnation Type (2003). His major work was the 2,268-page, two-volume Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects (1997). This reported two hundred cases of birthmarks that seemed to correspond <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a wound on the deceased person whose life the child recalled. He wrote a shorter version of the same research for the general reader, Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect (1997).|$|E
25|$|Calligraphy {{is central}} in Tibetan culture. The script {{is derived from}} Indic scripts. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High Lamas and {{inhabitants}} of the Potala Palace, were usually capable calligraphers. Tibet has been a center of Buddhism for several centuries, and that religion places {{a great deal of}} significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of secular pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the Dalai Lama and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their prayer wheels, although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E

25|$|Time has passed, and {{a heavily}} {{pregnant}} Dot visits George's studio. She {{asks for a}} painting George made of her, but he refuses. Jules and Yvonne come to the studio to see George's nearly finished painting. While Jules goes with George to see the painting, Yvonne and Dot hold a wary conversation. They realize they have both felt neglected by an artist, their mutual dislike fades, and they discuss the difficulties of trying to maintain a romantic relationship with an artist. Meanwhile, Jules is puzzled by George's new technique and concerned that his obsession with his work is alienating him from his fellow artists and collectors alike. He refuses to support the work. Jules and Yvonne leave, and George, having forgotten Dot was there, goes back to work. Dot reveals {{the real reason for}} her visit: despite the obvious fact that George fathered her unborn child, she and Louis are getting married and leaving for America. George angrily retreats behind his canvas, and she begs him to react, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way,</b> <b>to</b> her news. They argue bitterly about their failed relationship, and Dot concludes sadly that while George may be capable of self-fulfillment, she is not, and they must part ("We Do Not Belong Together").|$|E
500|$|Another historian, Forrest Scott, {{guessed that}} Siward {{was a member}} of the family of Northumbrian earls, presumably {{connected}} <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Siward, Earl of Northumbria. Margaret Faull and Marie Stinson, the editors of the Philimore Domesday Book for Yorkshire, believed that Siward was [...] "a senior member of the house of Bamburgh and possibly a brother or half-brother of Earl Gospatric". Another historian, Geoffrey Barrow, pointed out that Faull and Stinson gave no evidence for this assertion, and doubted the hypothesis because of Siward's Danish name.|$|E

She and Kassandra become close, as does Kassandra with Helen, despite her initial distaste for the problems Helen brings to Troy. Despite being her twin, Paris dislikes Kassandra. Early in the story, Bradley writes that Paris' main character flaw is [...] "a total {{lack of interest in}} anything that did not relate to himself or contribute <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> his own comfort and satisfaction." ...|$|E
