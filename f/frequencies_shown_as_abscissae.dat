50|$|A {{histogram}} is {{a representation}} of tabulated <b>frequencies,</b> <b>shown</b> <b>as</b> adjacent rectangles or squares (in some situations), erected over discrete intervals (bins), with an area proportional to {{the frequency of the}} observations in the interval. The height of a rectangle is also equal to the frequency density of the interval, i.e., the frequency divided by the width of the interval. The total area of the histogram is equal to the number of data. A histogram may also be normalized displaying relative <b>frequencies.</b> It then <b>shows</b> the proportion of cases that fall into each of several categories, with the total area equaling 1. The categories are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The categories (intervals) must be adjacent, and often are chosen to be of the same size. The rectangles of a histogram are drawn so that they touch each other to indicate that the original variable is continuous.|$|R

To test this hypothesis, oximetry was used to measure changes in hemoglobin saturation in a subject exposed to a 45 Hz signal, and accelerometers were used to monitor attenuation of two source frequencies (45 Hz and 8 Hz) across 5 subjects at varying source transducer locations. The data from the oximetry monitoring was only suggestive, but its interpretation is encouraging for future avenues of study.

It is played using a small cup mouthpiece, and has an approximately conical bore with seven side holes. A systematic study of the acoustics of the cornetto is being undertaken in collaboration with the performer and manufacturer Jeremy West. The present paper reports measurements of input impedance carried out on two modern reproduction instruments and one seventeenth century original. The mea-surement technique has been described elsewhere [1]. Two typical impedance curves are shown here, both obtained on a reproduction cornetto in filled resin made by Christopher Monk. In figure 1, all the side holes are closed, and the first four impedance peaks are close to harmonics of the playing <b>frequency</b> (<b>shown</b> <b>as</b> dotted lines).

40|$|Abstract [...] Histogram is a {{graphical}} representation showing a visual {{impression of the}} distribution of experimental data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable and was first introduced by Karl Pearson. A histogram consists of tabular <b>frequencies,</b> <b>shown</b> <b>as</b> adjacent rectangles, erected over discrete intervals (bins), with an area equal to the frequency of the observations in the interval. In this paper the comparative analysis of various Image Edge Detection techniques for Power Amplifier is presented with histogramic implementation. The software is developed using MATLAB 7. 5. Evaluation of the images showed that under noisy conditions Canny, LoG(Laplacian of Gaussian), Robert, Prewitt, Sobel exhibit better performance, respectively[1]. Histograms are used to get better results which helps to plot the number of pixels for each tonal value. By looking at the histogram for a specific image a viewer will be able to judge the object edge detection is one of the ways of solving the problem of high volume of space images occupy in the computer memory. The problems of storage, transmission over the Internet and bandwidth could be solved when edges are detected...|$|R

Since, frequencies of these electrostatic waves {{are close to the}} lower-hybrid frequency and those electric field vectors are almost perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, we conceive that these electrostatic waves are lower-hybrid waves. Electrostatic {{waves in the}} lower hybrid frequencies play important roles in acceleration and heating of particles and in the contribution of the overall dynamics of the magnetosphere. However, generation mechanism of lower-hybrid waves in the electron plasma sheet boundary layer is not clear. Figure 1 shows typical examples of the lower-hybrid waves on January 11 1995 at the location of XGSM = 41. 4 RE, YGSM = 1. 6 RE, ZGSM =- 5. 2 RE. Upper and lower panel of Figure 1 shows a dynamic spectrum and a waveform of the electric field observed by the electric field detector (EFD) [1] onboard the Geotail spacecraft. The waves are observed near the lower-hybrid <b>frequency</b> <b>shown</b> <b>as</b> black solid line in upper panel of Figure 1. From our waveforms and electrons observations, observations of the lower-hybrid waves correlate with the existence of electron beams which are parallel to the ambient magnetic field.
