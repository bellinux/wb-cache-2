40|$|The {{sailfish}} <b>fisheries</b> <b>chart</b> {{is a tool}} {{to determine}} the concentration areas and movement patterns of schools that are incidentally caught during migration for reproduction by boats that target mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) and tunas (Thunnus atlanticus and T. albacares). There are 350 boats regularly operating in that studied area of the Brazilian coast. That information is based on logbooks and is related to four migratory cycles observed from 2002 to 2006. A model developed by COPPE/UFRJ was used for making the <b>fisheries</b> <b>chart.</b> The use of that chart, as {{a new source of}} information in this research, identified concentration areas and movement patterns of sailfish schools, contributing to the formulation of sustainability system of the stock that are in heavy decline. Two areas were identified, from 180 o to 220 o off Ilha de Cabo Frio and 100 -m deep isoline. The concentrations were first found 10 miles off the coast. The incidental sailfish catches in tuna fisheries are concentrated in the same area at 90 o, beginning at 70 miles off the coast, near the local oil platforms. Due to the observed spawning of the species in the studied period and local, we suggest a sailfish fishing prohibition from December to January, between 180 o and 220 o off Ilha de Cabo Frio, from 10 to 30 miles off the coast. This measure intends to prevent the decline of the stocks, caused specially by the tun...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{fishermen}} {{are interested}} in the safety of their crews, boats, and gear, and in making the best catch for their time and money. Rising fuel costs, increased competition from foreign fisheries, improved knowledge about fish habits and the new 200 mile economic zone have all {{had an impact on the}} U. S. fishing industry. As a consequence, the modern fisherman, more than ever, requires reliable and timely information about the marine environment. This paper describes an experimental program to utilize satellite observations of the ocean surface, in conjunction with conventional observations and products, to prepare special <b>fisheries</b> aids <b>charts</b> for daily radio facsimile broadcasts to commercial fishermen. These special fisheries products aggregate a broad set of ocean observations, including ocean color structure, to depict oceanographic conditions of importance to commercial fishing tactics. Results to date have shown that improved safety at sea and decreased fuel costs can be achieved through the applied use of these special <b>fisheries</b> <b>charts...</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{criticism}} of the FAO Country Profiles was that, in its inception phase, it only contained very few resources. Since 2002, the number of available resources has increased to cover country-based information and data, directly linked from FAO's web pages or FAO's digital repositories. Over the last years, another identified area for improvement was {{the simplicity of the}} system methodology, being the resources only linked from country pages and thus, lacking real integration. This need was addressed by starting to integrate additional data, such as, the <b>fisheries</b> <b>charts</b> or the news and events items taken from AgriFeeds. In addition, in order to provide more complete country profiles, the system started to link or integrate non-FAO resources.|$|R
