40|$|International {{audience}} Recent evolutions of computer-aided {{product development}} and massive integration of numerical simulations {{to the design}} process require new methodologies to decrease the computational costs. Numerical design of experiments is used to increase quality of products by taking into account uncertainties in product development.

This paper presents a literature review of design of experiments methodology to <b>identify</b> <b>potential</b> <b>improvements</b> for simulation process shortening. By means of metamodelling and adaptive design of experiments, the computational cost of each simulation {{and the number of}} required experiment can be reduced.

30|$|To perform {{software}} measurement, {{an organization}} must initially plan it. Based on its goals, the organization must define which entities (processes, products and so on) {{are to be}} considered for software measurement and which of their properties (e.g., size, cost, time etc.) are to be measured. The organization must also define which measures are to be used to quantify those properties. For each measure, an operational definition must be specified, indicating, among others, how data is to be collected and analyzed. Once planned, measurement can start. Measurement execution involves collecting data for the defined measures, storing and analyzing them. Data analysis provides information for decision making, supporting the identification of appropriate actions. Finally, the measurement process and its products should be evaluated to <b>identify</b> <b>potential</b> <b>improvements</b> (Barcellos et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|To {{deal with}} the {{increasing}} complexity of software systems and uncertainty of their environments, software engineers have turned to self-adaptivity. Self-adaptive systems are capable of dealing with a continuously changing environment and emerging requirements that may be unknown at design-time. However, building such systems cost-effectively and in a predictable manner is a major engineering challenge. In this paper, we explore the state-of-the-art in engineering self-adaptive systems and <b>identify</b> <b>potential</b> <b>improvements</b> in the design process. Our most important finding is that in designing self-adaptive systems, the feedback loops that control self-adaptation must become first-class entities. We explore feedback loops {{from the perspective of}} control engineering and within existing self-adaptive systems in nature and biology. Finally, we identify the critical challenges our community must address to enable systematic and well-organized engineering of self-adaptive and self-managing software systems...|$|E

Despite {{the wide range}} of technologies developed so far, the large amount of information that needs to be integrated and processed, as well as the quantity of data that has to be produced and presented still poses important challenges both from a processing and presentation perspectives. We argue that to enhance BPA, semantics have to be the core backbone in order to better support the application of analysis techniques on the first hand, and to guide the computation and presentation of the results on the other hand. We propose a knowledge-based approach to supporting strategydriven BPA by making use of a comprehensive and extensible ontological framework capturing from high-level strategic concerns down to lowerlevel monitoring information. We describe how corporate strategies can be operationalized into concrete analysis that can guide the evaluation of organisational processes, structure the presentation of results obtained and better help assess the well-being of corporate business processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Construction {{contract}} auctions are characterised by (1) a heavy {{emphasis on}} the lowest bid as that is which usually determines {{the winner of the}} auction, (2) anticipated high outliers due to the presence of uncompetitive bids, (3) very small samples, and (4) uncertainty of the appropriate underlying density function model of the bids. This paper describes a graphical method for simultaneously identifying outliers and density function by first removing candidate (high) outliers and then examining the goodness-of-fit of the resulting reduced samples by comparing the reduced sample predictability (by the expected value of the lowest order statistic) of the lowest bid with that of the equivalent predictability by Monte Carlo simulations of one of the common density functions. When applied to a set of 1073 auctions, the results indicate the appropriateness of censored and reduced sample lognormal models {{for a wide range of}} cut-off values.

In this inter-laboratory comparison the gas-fluid-mineral reactions of three samples of rock-forming minerals have been investigated by 11 experimental labs. The reported results point to robust identification of the major processes in the experiments by most groups.
