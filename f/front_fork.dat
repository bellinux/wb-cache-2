5|$|The lateral and {{torsional}} stiffness {{of the rear}} frame and the wheel spindle affects wobble-mode damping substantially. Long wheelbase and trail and a flat steering-head angle {{have been found to}} increase weave-mode damping. Lateral distortion can be countered by locating the <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> torsional axis as low as possible.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (<b>front</b> <b>fork,</b> handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided <b>front</b> <b>fork,</b> and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E

5000|$|Conic SLX; early (1989) models had {{round tubes}} with {{internal}} stiffeners and curved <b>front</b> <b>forks,</b> later models had clover leaf design down tube to add stiffness to the frame, and had straight <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The frames were {{initially}} available with AMC and Norton telescopic <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> and British Hub Co. (Motoloy) brakes front and rear. The pivoting rear-forks on all models were fitted with Silentbloc bushes. A later option was Metal Profiles (REH) <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed to damp vibrations before they reach the rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the <b>front</b> <b>fork,</b> seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> in the process.|$|E
25|$|Due to <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> suspension, modern {{mountain}} bikes - {{as opposed to}} road bikes - tend to have slacker head tube angles, generally around 70° although they can be as low as 62° (depending on frame geometry setting).|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the California Motor Company {{was formed}} in 1901 to sell {{complete}} gasoline-engine motorbikes in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. The company began with a 200cc single-cylinder, 1.5-horsepower, four-stroke engine designed by R.C. Marks. Mounted to a standard bicycle frame, the California could reach speeds of approximately 25mph (40km/h). The California weighed around 75-80 pounds, and featured a leading-link <b>front</b> <b>fork,</b> a leather spring saddle, a front Duck roller brake, and an Atherton rear coaster brake. A leathern belt-drive directly connected the engine output shaft to the rear wheel. During the summer of 1903, George A. Wyman rode a 200cc, 1.5-horsepower California from San Francisco to New York City, becoming {{the first person to}} cross the North American continent aboard a motor vehicle.|$|E
500|$|Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr {{nonetheless}} still {{favor the}} Roper, even by Cameron's criterion. The reason, they say, {{is that it}} did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies, including the twistgrip throttle control, and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle {{as we know it}} today, while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude, failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the <b>front</b> <b>fork,</b> and turn by leaning. Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees, rather than perfectly vertical, and by having the steering axis slightly offset, creating trail. This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive, and typically unconscious, technique of countersteering, in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left, causing the machine to lean to the right, and turning the vehicle to the right. Trail, also called fork offset, is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down, so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed [...] "a crude makeshift", saying, [...] "as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{prototype}} of the Servi-Car with rear suspension had been tested and {{was found to be}} unstable. [...] The production model had its axle mounted directly to the frame with no suspension at all.Until 1957, the <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> of the Servi-Car were the springer-type leading-link forks used on the R-series and W-series solo motorcycles. From 1958 on, the Servi-Car changed neck stem length and inner diameter to use Hydra-Glide <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some manufacturers, such as Greeves, used {{swingarm}} {{designs for}} the <b>front</b> <b>forks,</b> which were more robust than telescopic forks. In particular, sidecar motocross outfits frequently use swing arm <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b> The swingarm has also been used for the front suspension of scooters. In this case it aids in simplifying maintenance. In motorcycles with shaft drive, such as the Yamaha XJ650 Maxim, the shaft housing forms the left side swingarm.|$|R

5000|$|Though BMW {{first used}} oil-damped {{telescopic}} <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> in the 1930s, it {{chose to use}} Earles forks on these models. The triangular <b>front</b> Earles <b>fork,</b> named after its designer, Englishman Ernest Earles,precluded any front-end dive during heavy front braking, which is common with telescopic <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b> It also worked well in sidecar duty. Though heavy and ponderous in turning, the Earles fork gave the old Beemer a steady and reassuring ride.In 1968, BMW introduced telescopic forks on some of its slash-2 models, and they were continued into the 1969 model year. Modified, they became the <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> on the slash-5 models introduced for the 1970 model year. The photo of the red R60US to the right was taken at a BMW dealership in 1968 and shows a brand-new motorcycle waiting for its first buyer. Earles fork and telescopic fork models both were manufactured for these two years and were available to customers.|$|R
2500|$|These iron head XR-750s of 1970–71 were {{prone to}} {{overheating}} (humorously called [...] "waffle irons") {{as well as}} having insufficient power. The engine was again re-designed for 1972 with an all-aluminum head and cylinder package with bigger bore and shorter stroke for the same 750cc displacement. The frame and the running gear were held over from the KRTT racer, with a Ceriani <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> and two Girling rear shocks. The fuel tank, fenders, and rear seat/fender combination were fiberglass, with a snap down seat cover over a foam cushion.

2500|$|Prior to 2006, Dyna models {{typically}} {{featured a}} narrow, XL-style 39mm <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> and front wheel, {{as well as}} footpegs which the manufacturer included the letter [...] "X" [...] in the model designation to indicate. This lineup traditionally included the Super Glide (FXD), Super Glide Custom (FXDC), Street Bob (FXDB), and Low Rider (FXDL). One exception was the Wide Glide (FXDWG), which featured thicker 41mm forks and a narrow front wheel, but positioned the forks on wider triple-trees that give a beefier appearance. In 2008, the Dyna Fat Bob (FXDF) {{was introduced to the}} Dyna lineup, featuring aggressive styling like a new 2–1–2 exhaust, twin headlamps, a 180mm rear tire, and, {{for the first time in}} the Dyna lineup, a 130mm front tire. For the 2012 model year, the Dyna Switchback (FLD) became the first Dyna to break the tradition of having an FX model designation with floorboards, detachable painted hard saddlebags, touring windshield, headlight nacelle and a wide front tire with full fender. [...] The new front end resembled the big-twin FL models from 1968-1971.|$|E
