40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is an {{analysis}} of selected provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("CISG"). The selection of these particular provisions arises from {{the main purpose of}} this thesis, which is their application on a particular dispute. The analysed and discussed dispute is the problem of the 18 th Willem C. Vis International Arbitration Moot ("Vis Moot"). The first chapter provides a brief introduction to issues of international trade and history of the CISG. Second chapter is composed of detailed analysis of selected parts of the CISG which are consequently applied in the dispute. This analysis starts with general issues concerning application of the CISG. Thesis continues with a description of formation of a contract which is composed of valid offer and acceptance. Further on, the provisions concerning conformity of goods with a particular sales contract are analysed. In the last part of this chapter, provisions concerning <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and provisions dealing with the notification of non- conformity of goods are dealt with. Third chapter consists of application of already generally analysed provisions of the CISG on the particular dispute. This chapter is subdivided into sections providing arguments applicable in the particular [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In recent past, India {{has taken}} several {{measures}} {{to implement the}} trade facilitation measures. These have helped {{the private sector in}} a major way and have also helped in setting the stage for a WTO agreement in this regard which is all set to be launched depending on the negotiation dynamics. However, one of the key areas of concern among the private sector firms has been the one related to the customs valuation. There are varying perceptions regarding the implementation of WTO Customs Valuation (CV) Agreement in India especially in the context of trade facilitation (TF). In this paper, we present results of a survey conducted to understand the major issues confronting this important link of CV to achieve a TF friendly trade regime in India. After interviewing a large number of firms, custom house agents and government officials we found that the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) and Ministry of Finance have put in place a large administrative set up to implement Indias commitments to the CV agreement. The introduction of risk management system (RMS) has provided a great support to the accredited traders as their consignments are cleared at much faster track. However, there are still many cases where industry has to wait for long in getting the goods cleared. There are several reasons responsible for this situation including the large number of cases in which under invoicing is done especially by the traders which triggers a much closer <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and hence much longer time in clearance and this also invites the discretionary powers being used by the customs. Other challenges come from the lack of clear instructions to the ground staff on new technology goods, the import of which is expanding at a fast pace. A greater coordination between industry and customs agencies and intense training programmes for the ground staff may help in a major way to overcome these constraints.

40|$|THE large {{commercial}} losses {{caused by}} condemnation of spoiled consignments,-L complaints from consumers {{about the quality}} of outwardly sound material, and the identification of a &dquo; pasteurized &dquo; can of ham as the cause of an outbreak of sal-monella food poisoning (Wildman, Nicol & Tee, 1951) have lately aroused considerable interest in Britain in the bacteriology of this product. Consequently, we have tried in this paper to review results obtained, in Britain, from the bacteriological <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> samples representing practically all the major producing countries outside America. Three separate, and rather different, investigations are here reported: (i) A routine <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> commercial consignments, made to check general suitability for consumption, with particular emphasis on detection of faecal pollution and potential pathogens. (ii) A general investigation, on both sound and spoiled material, of the safety of such ham for human consumption, including a careful search for all potentially pathogenic types of bacteria of intestinal significance. (iii) A more thorough survey on a correspondingly smaller number of samples, from a chiefly ecological view-point, of the numbers and species of micro-organisms present in spoiled material. These groups of observations will be described separately, but they can best be understood if related to the normal flora of hams before canning which we shall first consider briefly...|$|R

5000|$|The novel covers several themes, {{perhaps the}} most obvious being {{sacrifice}}; Neil's sacrifice for his brother, the sacrifice of the forest being cut down, and the ultimate sacrifice of Calum himself. There is close <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil, intertwined with Neil's jealousy and hatred for the Lady Runcie-Campbell and her family, and in turn Lady Runcie-Campbell's jealousy and hatred for the two brothers working on the estate. Her turmoil between trying {{to appear to be}} Christian, and upholding her aristocratic background recurs throughout the novel which introduces the theme of religion. Another theme is class structure - Lady Runcie-Campbell believes she is above the lower subjects, Duror himself enjoys the small luxuries he is given because of his higher job of game keeper but Neil hates the class structure: [...] "we're human beings just like them". This carries on throughout the book and at the end we can see that Lady Runcie Campbell may even have been able to stop the death of Calum. Yet another theme is nature. Calum himself is extremely close to nature - he does not feel close to the human world, but in nature he seems to coexist with it: [...] "it was a good tree ... with rests among its topmost branches as comfortable as chairs." ...|$|R

The family chosen here is that of the generalised gamma curves and this is related to empirical evidence from Bedford and Durham to give a predictive model for the price structure/distribution in the urban system. ...|$|R

40|$|Aims of {{this thesis}} were {{to compare the}} {{agreement}} of different magnetic resonance angiography(MRA) techniques and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in follow-up of intracranial aneurysms treated with coils in order to select the best MRA method, to evaluate the impact of increased iodine concentration in contrast medium and decreased tube voltage on arterial attenuation and image quality in computed tomography angiography (CTA) of intracranial arteries, and finally to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CTA in non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) compared to DSA and to assess the arterial attenuation (HU) as an image quality factor in this aspect. Follow-up DSA and time-of-flight (TOF) MRA at 1. 5 T and 3 T as well as contrast-enhanced MRA at 3 T were performed in 37 patients with 41 coiled intracranial aneurysms. TOF-MRA at 3 T showed best agreement with DSA. One of three different combinations of iodine concentrations in contrast medium and CT tube voltages was tested in each of 63 patients referred for CTA of intracranial arteries. Increased iodine concentration (400 mgI/ml) and decreased tube voltage (90 kVp) improved image quality in CTA of intracranial arteries and arterial attenuation at 340 HU in the ICA was found to represent a cut-off level for <b>examinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> quality. In 326 patients with non-traumatic SAH, diagnostic accuracy and arterial attenuation (HU),reflecting image quality, were assessed for CTA. CTA can be performed with high sensitivity(95 %) and specificity (97 %) for detection of ruptured aneurysms in the acute setting of SAH and arterial attenuation is correlated to the sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{accession}} to the European Union (EU) {{has brought a}} lot of advantages for all the new member states (NMS). The general and wide range implementation of economic integration gave the hope of economic prosperity and macroeconomic stability for all the new member states. In the case of foreign trade of agricultural products the possibility of expansion has opened after EU integration. The chance to build and stabilize new trading relations was especially important for the small countries with an open economy. In general, it can be concluded from the analysis of EU membership that the trade among new member countries has substantially expanded as a result of increasing trading activities in relation to member states which integrated into the EU in 2004 and also due to the elimination of former trading barriers and a growing common internal market. Starting from this, the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> trading <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> between particular countries is also justified. The important aspects in considering the possible solutions for the consequences of the economic crisis in 2008 are: the strengthening of regional markets, the utilization of geographical conditions and the increasing role of comparative advantages.

In regards to trading <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> it is reviewed which products show concentration and which products can be characterized with comparative advantages...|$|R

Drawing upon {{interviews}} with senior judicial figures in Northern Ireland, South Africa and elsewhere, this article considers {{the role of}} the judiciary in a political conflict. Using the socio-legal literature on judicial performance and audience as well as transitional justice scholarship, the article argues that judges in Northern Ireland 'performed' to a number of 'imagined' audiences including Parliament, 'the public', and their judicial peers - all of which shaped their view of the judicial role. In light of ongoing efforts to deal with the past in the jurisdiction, and the experiences of other transitional societies, the article argues that the judiciary can and should engage in a mature, reflexive and, where appropriate, self-critical <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good</b> and bad <b>of</b> their own institutional history during the conflict.

The Darwinian notion of natural selection is also used in the analysis, providing an alternative and complementary way to look into good and evil actions. This approach shows not only the way the literary piece discusses the problems of defining actions from purely rational, natural, and circumstantial perspectives, by laying bare criteria used here to define and evil actions, but also how Stevenson's book relates to the historical context of Victorian culture...|$|R
