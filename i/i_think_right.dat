60|$|I {{have brought}} {{together}} {{in these last}} pages a few notes, which were not properly to be incorporated with the text, and which, {{at the bottom of}} pages, checked the reader's attention to the main argument. They contain, however, several statements to which I wish to be able to refer, or have already referred, in other of my books, so that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> to preserve them.|$|E

60|$|CUSINS [reflectively] Yes: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you're <b>right,</b> Mr Walker. Yes: I {{should do}} it. It's curious: it's exactly what an ancient Greek would have done.|$|R
6000|$|The sailor {{declared}} that he knew nothing of schools, and would take no part in the discussion. There had, in truth, been high words between the brothers, each accusing the other of going the way to ruin their nephew, ending by the captain's' exclaiming, 'Well, I wash my hands of it! I can't flatter a foolish woman into spoiling poor Lucilla's son. If I am not to do what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> by him, I shall get {{out of sight of}} it all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet I cannot ask you {{to renounce}} your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are {{returning}} to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not {{ask you to}} do what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right,</b> for I may still be misled by passion.|$|E

There are worlds of money wasted, {{at this time of}} the year, in getting things that nobody wants, and nobody cares for after they are got; and I am glad, for my part, that you are going to get up a variety in this line; in fact, I should like to give you one of these stray leaves to help on," [...] said he, {{dropping}} a ten dollar note into her paper.

60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. To stay in {{this house}} any longer is impossible. To-night a man who loves me offered me his whole life. I refused it. It was foolish of me. I will offer him mine now. I will give him mine. I will go to him! [Puts on cloak {{and goes to the}} door, then turns back. Sits down at table and writes a letter, puts it into an envelope, and leaves it on table.] Arthur has never {{understood}} me. When he reads this, he will. He may do as he chooses now with his life.

6000|$|... "I {{did tell}} him--of course--as I should you. It {{has come to}} that now, that if a man robs you--your own man--you are not to dare to tell him of it! What would you think of me, Karl, if I were to find you out, and was {{to be afraid of}} {{speaking}} to you, lest you should turn against me and burn my fences?" [...] Karl Bender shrugged his shoulders, holding his reins up to his eyes. [...] "I know what you ought to think! And I wish that every man about Gangoil should be sure that I will always say what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right.</b> I don't know that I ever was hard upon any man. I try not to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Merely this, Miss Trotwood,' he returned. 'I {{am here to}} take David back--to {{take him}} back unconditionally, to dispose of him as I think proper, {{and to deal with}} him as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right.</b> I am not here to make any promise, or give any pledge to anybody. You may {{possibly}} have some idea, Miss Trotwood, of abetting him in his running away, and in his complaints to you. Your manner, which I must say does not seem intended to propitiate, induces me to think it possible. Now I must caution you that if you abet him once, you abet him for good and all; if you step in between him and me, now, you must step in, Miss Trotwood, for ever. I cannot trifle, or be trifled with. I am here, for the first and last time, to take him away. Is he ready to go? If he is not--and you tell me he is not; on any pretence; it is indifferent to me what--my doors are shut against him henceforth, and yours, I take it for granted, are open to him.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Not, again, {{that any}} one of these novels will {{deliberately}} attempt to PROVE anything. I have been amused at the allegations brought by certain critics against The Woman who Did that it [...] "failed to prove" [...] the practicability of unions such as Herminia's and Alan's. The famous Scotsman, in the same spirit, objected to Paradise Lost that it [...] "proved naething": but his criticism has not been generally endorsed as valid. To say the truth, it is absurd to suppose a work of imagination can prove or disprove anything. The author holds the strings of all his puppets, and can pull them as he likes, for good or evil: he can make his experiments turn out well or ill: he can contrive that his unions should end happily or miserably: how, then, can his story be said to PROVE anything? A novel is not a proposition in Euclid. I give due notice beforehand to reviewers in general, that if any principle at all is [...] "proved" [...] by any of my Hill-top Novels, it will be simply this: [...] "Act as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right,</b> for the highest good of human kind, and you will infallibly and inevitably come to a bad end for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|No {{wonder that}} in Lydgate's {{energetic}} nature {{the sense of}} a hopeless misconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance. The scowl which occasionally showed itself on his square brow was not a meaningless accident. Already when he was re-entering the town after that ride taken in the first hours of stinging pain, he was setting his mind on remaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be done against him. He would not retreat before calumny, as if he submitted to it. He would face it to the utmost, and no act of his should show that he was afraid. It belonged to the generosity as well as defiant force of his nature that he resolved not to shrink from showing to the full his sense of obligation to Bulstrode. It was true that the association with this man had been fatal to him--true that if he had had the thousand pounds still in his hands with all his debts unpaid he would have returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary rather than the rescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe (for, remember, {{he was one of the}} proudest among the sons of men)--nevertheless, he would not turn away from this crushed fellow-mortal whose aid he had used, and make a pitiful effort to get acquittal for himself by howling against another. [...] "I shall do as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right,</b> and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me out, but--" [...] he was going on with an obstinate resolve, but he was getting near home, and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again into that chief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized struggles of wounded honor and pride.|$|E
6000|$|After all, the {{practical}} reason why, {{when the power}} is once {{in the hands of}} the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men understand it. Can there not be a government in which the majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?--in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right.</b> It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents on injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for the law is, that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys, and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, ay, against their common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power? Visit the Navy Yard, and behold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such as it can make a man with its black arts--a mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and already, as one may say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniment, though it may be, ...|$|E

6000|$|Alton nodded with grave sympathy. [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you're <b>right,</b> and {{you must}} wait. Well, it's time to turn in. With {{the first of the}} {{daylight}} we're going on again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing immediately, sir," [...] said he, rather abashed; [...] "but as I {{have made}} up my mind about Mary Thorne,--quite {{made up my mind}}, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>right</b> to tell you." ...|$|R
50|$|Bolton {{considered}} {{running in}} the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In an interview with National Review, Robert Costa wrote the following, quoting Bolton:He wants {{to be president of}} the United States, or, at the very least, a provocative contender for the Republican nomination in 2016. 'My hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe; <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>right</b> now, especially after two terms of President Obama, they want a president who has the know-how to lead during a crisis, a president who can defend our national interests,' he says.|$|E
5000|$|Songwriter Aaron Kamin told Launch {{about the}} {{background}} behind the song. He said, [...] "My cousin passed away, {{and he and}} his wife had been married for 50 some-odd years, and I was just putting myself in her shoes. Like, losing somebody after, like, 50 years." [...] He went on to refer to the September 11 attacks that occurred only a few months after the song's release and said that the song has [...] "become more relevant in our lives as the world has changed recently. It's been rekindled even more so for us, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>right</b> about now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thoreau {{asserts that}} because governments are {{typically}} more harmful than helpful, they therefore cannot be justified. Democracy {{is no cure}} for this, as majorities simply {{by virtue of being}} majorities do not also gain the virtues of wisdom and justice. The judgment of an individual's conscience is not necessarily inferior to the decisions of a political body or majority, and so [...] "it is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right....</b> Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice." [...] He adds, [...] "I cannot for an instant recognize as my government that which is the slave's government also." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As far as {{you have}} gone, Fanny, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you {{perfectly}} <b>right.</b> <b>I</b> may be sorry, I may be surprised--though hardly that, for you had not had time to attach yourself--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you perfectly <b>right.</b> Can it admit of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love him; nothing could have justified your accepting him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} down here, to-day, sir, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>right</b> {{to let you know}} at once that Miss Waddington and I have agreed that our {{engagement}} shall be at an end." ...|$|R

5000|$|Just {{after the}} 2012 presidential election, in the November 8, 2012 {{issue of the}} Chicago Tribune, Daley was {{reported}} as considering a run in the 2014 election for Governor of Illinois. Daley said [...] "I've thought about it before and I don't take it off the table. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> now, to be very frank with you, {{the last thing in}} the world anybody wants to hear about is a race that's two years down the road." [...] Daley further was quoted as saying: [...] "I'm not closing the door and, I know that sounds like a politician, {{but the fact of the}} matter is that these are tough days and I think there's a lot to be done by the Legislature. I don't think it helps right now for people to be out there saying they're going to run and they have a solution at this point. I think we've got to see what the Legislature does." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{you first}} saw her come in season 3, she didn’t really know {{who these people}} were. She finds this group of people and makes them her family immediately. And yes, she’s got what I think you could call anger issues. I wouldn’t say she’s gotten away from it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> now she’s gotten {{in touch with a}} lot of pain. I think she’s been sort of quote-unquote [...] "betrayed", or at least she thinks she’s been betrayed, by {{something}} that’s very close to her, which is her family, particularly her father. And it’s a big deal to her. Which would explain her love and relationship with somebody like Leroy Jethro Gibbs...The fact that she becomes a part of this team and the fact that she’s officially an NCIS agent—as opposed to a Mossad liaison officer—is a big deal to her. But nothing really changes as far as the work. Hopefully things can begin to settle as far as her emotional stuff. Hopefully she can start to enjoy things a little bit more and maybe take a breather. But for a person like Ziva who’s been through so much, I feel like it’ll just take a little bit to adjust. In real life, a person that has gone through all that stuff, I don’t think it’s just from night to day. It’s just not gonna change that easily.|$|E
5000|$|After {{being thrown}} out by Sharon, Mariah disappears {{and it is}} soon {{revealed}} {{that she has been}} kidnapped by Ian. Ian drugs Mariah and forces her to marry him. After being rescued by Nick and Sharon, Mariah learns that Sharon, [...] "the woman she despises", is actually her biological mother, and does not handle the news well. Prior to the kidnapping, Nick tracked down the doctor (Dr. Hill) that delivered Cassie and learns that Sharon (a poor teenager at the time) was drugged after giving birth to her, and had in fact delivered twins. Helen Copeland (Karina Logue), a [...] "bitter" [...] woman who claimed to be Mariah's mother for her entire life, was the nurse present who bought the baby for Ian from Dr. Hill, who needed the money for gambling debts. Grimes explained that Mariah has had the [...] "rug pulled from out under her" [...] with this news, stating that [...] "This has been a stressful time for her. I think any change or new information at this point, or anybody's perceived happiness, will be very upsetting, because she has been through so much." [...] The actress also noted that Mariah finds herself in a state of limbo, [...] "She is wandering about, and she is not really sure what she wants. She is trying to determine if she is going to flee, because that is what she is so used to doing, or what is keeping her here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> now she {{is trying to figure out}} where she belongs, and how she is going to take this next step." [...] Mariah maintains that she wants nothing to do with Sharon, but they later forge a relationship. Grimes opined: [...] "Mariah is smart and independent, but she has a lot of growing up to do. She needs to find her place in the world and reaching out to those around her—including her new family—will only help that process. I don't think Sharon and Mariah will ever stay mad at each other for too long." ...|$|E
