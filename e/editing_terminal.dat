5000|$|VT173 - A {{high-end}} <b>editing</b> <b>terminal</b> containing an 11/03, which loaded its {{editing software}} over a serial {{connection to a}} host minicomputer. Used in various publishing environments, it was also offered with DECset, Digital's VAX/VMS 3.x native mode OEM version of the Datalogics Pager automated batch composition engine. When VT173 inventory was exhausted in 1985, Digital discontinued DECset and transferred its customer agreements to Datalogics. (HP now uses the name HP DECset for a software development toolset product.) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{aerodynamic}} analysis {{system based}} on potential theory at subsonic and/or supersonic speeds and impact type finite element solutions at hypersonic conditions is described. Three dimensional configurations have multiple nonplanar surfaces of arbitrary planforms and bodies of noncircular contour may be analyzed. Static, rotary, and control longitudinal and lateral-directional characteristics may be generated. The analysis was implemented on a time sharing system in conjunction with an input tablet digitizer and an interactive graphics input/output display and <b>editing</b> <b>terminal</b> to maximize its responsiveness to the preliminary analysis. Computation times on an IBM 3081 are typically less than one minute of CPU/Mach number at subsonic, supersonic, or hypersonic speeds. This is a user manual for the computer programming...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} aerodynamic {{analysis program}} based on linearized potential theory is described. The solution treats thickness and attitude problems at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Three dimensional configurations {{with or without}} jet flaps having multiple nonplanar surfaces of arbitrary planform and open or closed slender bodies or noncircular contour are analyzed. Longitudinal and lateral-directional static and rotary derivative solutions are generated. The analysis is implemented on a time sharing system in conjunction with an input tablet digitizer and an interactive graphics input/output display and <b>editing</b> <b>terminal</b> to maximize its responsiveness to the preliminary analysis problem. Nominal case computation time of 45 CPU seconds on the CDC 175 for a 200 panel simulation indicates the program provides an efficient analysis for systematically performing various aerodynamic configuration tradeoff and evaluation studies...|$|E
50|$|An early {{developer}} of CRT-based <b>editing</b> <b>terminals</b> for photocomposition machines was Omnitext of Ann Arbor, Michigan. These CRT phototypesetting terminals were sold under the Singer brand name during the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|CRT-based <b>editing</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{which can}} work compatibly {{with a variety}} of {{phototypesetting}} machines, were a major technical innovation in this regard. Keyboarding the original text on a CRT screen, with easy-to-use editing commands, is faster than keyboarding on a Linotype machine. Storing the text magnetically for easy retrieval and subsequent editing also saves time.|$|R
50|$|At first, News & Observer {{copy desk}} staff (called sub-editors in the UK) fed stories to the Nando Times from the newspaper's main newsroom, using aging SII newswire <b>editing</b> <b>terminals</b> to add {{intermediate}} mark-up codes for further processing into HTML. Nando developers {{figured out how}} to semi-automate newswire story conversion and posting of news photos to the site, including an early Java-powered animated photo display, although the photos were never fully integrated with related stories.|$|R
40|$|Trypanosomatids are {{pathogenic}} protozoa that {{undergo a}} unique form of post-transcriptional RNA editing that inserts or deletes uridine nucleotides in many mitochondrial pre-mRNAs. Editing is catalyzed {{by a large}} multiprotein complex, the editosome. A key editosome enzyme, RNA <b>editing</b> <b>terminal</b> uridylyl transferase 2 (TUTase 2; RET 2) catalyzes the uridylate addition reaction. Here, we report the 1. 8 Ã… crystal structure of the Trypanosoma brucei RET 2 apoenzyme and its complexes with uridine nucleotides. This structure reveals that the specificity of the TUTase for UTP is determined by a crucial water molecule that is exquisitely positioned by the conserved carboxylates D 421 and E 424 to sense a hydrogen atom on the N 3 position of the uridine base. The three-domain structure also unveils a unique domain arrangement not seen before in the nucleotidyltansferase superfamily, with a large domain insertion between the catalytic aspartates. This insertion is present in all trypanosomatid TUTases. We also show that TbRET 2 is essential for survival of the bloodstream form of the parasite and therefore is a potential target for drug therapy...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the MCACCU units required to support 1200/75 dial up access, the Update Centre machines were also connected to special modems provided to support online bulk updating by IPs. Banks of 300/300 bit/s full duplex asynchronous V21 modems supported computer to computer links for the more sophisticated IP while 1200 bit/s half duplex V23 modems supported so called intelligent <b>editing</b> <b>terminals</b> (i.e. those capable of storing a number of frames offline before uploading to the UDC). In addition twin 9-track NRZI tape decks of 800 bytes/inch capacity were provided {{in order to support}} bulk offline updates.|$|R
50|$|Editing {{of pages}} was {{possible}} {{in one of}} two ways, either directly by creating or amending pages using special editing keyboards whilst connected online to the main Update Computer, or by creating pages offline and updating them in bulk to the main Update Computer. Bulk update required that pages be created offline by the use of <b>editing</b> <b>terminals</b> which could store pages, or by micro-computers such as that provided by Apple or Acorn. The pages were then transmitted to the UDC online in bulk via a special dialup port and protocol, or sent via magnetic tape to the Update Centre (UDC) where they were uploaded by Network Operations (NOC) staff.|$|R
5000|$|Available {{characters}} {{consisted of}} {{upper and lower}} case alphanumeric characters as well as punctuation and simple arithmetic symbols, using a variant of ISO 646 and CCITT standard. [...] This layout was later formalised in the 1981 CEPT videotex standard as the CEPT3 profile. By embedding cursor-control characters within the page data, it was also possible to encode simple animations by re-writing parts of the screen already displayed. These were termed [...] "dynamic frames" [...] {{and could not be}} created online using conventional <b>editing</b> <b>terminals,</b> but required specialist software and uploading via the [...] "bulk update" [...] facility. No timing options were available beyond that imposed by the available transmission speed, usually 1,200 baud.|$|R

5000|$|Norsk Data {{also sold}} {{custom-made}} Tandberg Data TDV-2200 terminals as [...] "NOTIS terminals" [...] with special keys for text <b>editing.</b> Other <b>terminals</b> were [...] "endorsed", provided new keycaps and branded as [...] "NOTIS Terminals" [...] - including the Facit [...] "Twist" [...] - {{that would show}} a page standing.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} {{is divided into}} six sections (Sites, <b>Edit,</b> Preview, CSS, <b>Terminal,</b> and Books), which are accessed through six tabs {{at the top of}} the application. Users can also split the window into multiple sections either vertically or horizontally, to access multiple sections or different files at the same time.|$|R
2500|$|On most {{operating}} systems the name text file refers to file format that allows only plain text content {{with very little}} formatting (e.g., no bold or italic types). Such files can be viewed and <b>edited</b> on text <b>terminals</b> or in simple text editors. Text files usually have the MIME type [...] "text/plain", usually with additional information indicating an encoding.|$|R

5000|$|Collegian Media Group {{acquired}} the first computerized editing equipment in a Kansas newsroom {{and among the}} first four in a U.S. university in 1972, when Bill Brown, {{the director of the}} company, persuaded the board to purchase two Hendrix <b>editing</b> display <b>terminals.</b> An upgrade to punched tape typesetting equipment followed in 1982 with the installation of a Compugraphic Trendsetter. Another Trendsetter was added in 1983 and the Collegian changed to broadsheet format. Laser typesetting came to the paper in 1987, when an Apple LaserWriter Plus and Linotronic 100 replaced the Trendsetter presses. In 1992, under the direction of adviser Ron Johnson, the paper started evolving towards to full pagination in January, when Student Senate funded a half-million dollar purchase of Macintosh computer equipment.|$|R
40|$|Divalent metal ions, usually Mg 2 +, are {{required}} for both DNA synthesis and proofreading functions by DNA polymerases (DNA Pol). Although used as a non-reactive cofactor substitute for binding and crystallographic studies, Ca 2 + supports DNA polymerization by only one DNA Pol, Dpo 4. Here, we explore whether Ca 2 +-driven catalysis might apply to high-fidelity (HiFi) family B DNA Pols. The consequences of replacing Mg 2 + by Ca 2 + on base pairing at the polymerase active site {{as well as the}} <b>editing</b> of <b>terminal</b> nucleotides at the exonuclease active site of the archaeal Pyrococcus abyssi DNA Pol (PabPolB) are characterized and compared to other (families B, A, Y, X, D) DNA Pols. Based on primer extension assays, steady-state kinetics and ion-chased experiments, we demonstrate that Ca 2 + (and other metal ions) activates DNA synthesis by PabPolB. While showing a slower rate of phosphodiester bond formation, nucleotide selectivity is improved over that of Mg 2 +. Further mechanistic studies show that the affinities for primer/template are higher in the presence of Ca 2 + and reinforced by a correct incoming nucleotide. Conversely, no exonuclease degradation of the terminal nucleotides occurs with Ca 2 +. Evolutionary and mechanistic insights among DNA Pols are thus discussed...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. A design-oriented, interactive computer system which makes possible the dynamic loading of {{programs at the}} user's request throughout the operating session has been developed. This system, which {{is referred to as}} DEX, also allows the user to select various types of files as the source and destination of information during the session. With respect to one type of file, databases, DEX introduces a more versatile form of organization and use. An extended DEX library of subroutines is developed which enables the user to read and write integer scalar, real scalar and one-dimensional real array variables and to <b>edit</b> from the <b>terminal</b> integer and real scalar values. It also enables the user to employ during input and output sequences the unit system of his choice. A proposal is offered for the organization of DEX databases for the preliminary design of naval ships. Suggestions are made, based on a demonstration computer program, for employing existing ship databases to support a generalized ship synthesis model. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|VI (Visual) is {{a display}} {{oriented}} interactive text editor. When using VI {{the screen of}} the terminal acts as {{a window into the}} file which is being editing. Changes which made to the file are reflected in what is seen. Using VI the user can insert new text any place in the file quite easily. Most of the commands to VI move the cursor around in the file. There are commands to move the cursor forward and backward in units of characters, words, sentences and paragraphs. A small set of operators, like d for delete and c for change, are combined with the motion commands to form operations such as delete word or change paragraph, in a simple and natural way. This regularity and the mnemonic assignment of commands to keys makes the editor command set easy to remember and to use. VI works on a large number of display terminals, and new terminals are easily driven after <b>editing</b> a <b>terminal</b> description file. While it is advantageous to have an intelligent terminal which can locally insert and delete lines and characters from the display, the editor will function quite well on dumb terminals over slow phone lines. The editor makes allowances for the low bandwidth in these situations and uses smaller window sizes and different display updating algorithms to make best use of the limited speed available. It is also possible to use the command set of VI on hardcopy terminals, storage tubes and'glass ty's'using a one line editing window, thus VI's command set is available on all terminals. The full command set of the more traditional, line oriented editor ED is available within VI, it is quite simple to switch between the two modes of editin...|$|R
