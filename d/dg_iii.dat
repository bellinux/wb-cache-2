A total of 16 questions dealing with various aspects of allergy to natural rubber products were presented to the SCMPMD. Background Description of the problem Medical devices made from Natural Rubber (NR) may cause allergic reactions to patients and users because of allergy to proteinaceous components or chemical constituents of the material. Allergic reactions to proteinaceous allergens in NR products have the potential to provoke life threatening (anaphylactic) reactions in sensitised individuals (type I allergy). This risk is present in health care settings, and in the general public, following contact with NR products or possibly due to cross reactions to different fruits. Allergic contact dermatitis (type IV allergy) caused by chemicals present in NR products is a well known, and frequent, cause for workers compensation claims...|$|E

The minimum voltage is more in case of type <b>III</b> <b>DG</b> operating at 0.9 pf. The losses are also lower with <b>DG</b> type <b>III</b> operating at 0.9 pf when compared to DG operating at upf in Table 4. This is due to both real and reactive powers are supplied by the DG at lagging pf. Reactive power is not supplied by type <b>III</b> <b>DG</b> when operating at Unity pf. Hence, losses are higher when compared to DG operating at 0.9 pf lagging.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{importance}} and role that durability is acquiring in contemporary design activities. “Durability” is the ability of an architectural work to continue to perform its required function over a period of time. This definition also draws from the considerations of the European Commission <b>DG</b> <b>III</b> relating to the Construction Products directive. This paper discusses the methods the designer can use to ensure a carefullydeveloped plan for ensuring the long-term performance (durability), starting from the client’s choices (the building’s standard and value, intended uses and management) and allowing for concomitant circumstances such as the environment (e. g. sustainable development), economic aspects, technological progress, and so on. It is up to the designer to formulate a general durability plan, considering each of the building’s various parts, and to identify the technical means needed for implementing the plan. Achieving this latter goal depends on the availability of the necessary technical information including relevant standards and tests, and in the basic data related to the service life of building components and materials that might be available from industry...|$|E
40|$|It is {{expected}} that the global warming will reduce {{the frequency of the}} snow events. On the other hand, the intensity of extreme snow events may increase, since the capacity of the atmosphere to hold moisture increases with temperature. This may lead to the increase of both snow density and occurrence of extreme snowfalls in regions where temperatures still may happen to be below freezing level during precipitation events. To assess the evolution of the snow load and its impact on design of new buildings and on reliability of existing ones, a comparison of future trends, in both intensity and frequency of future precipitation in cold areas with current versions of snow load maps for structural design should be performed. The European Snow Loads Research Project was carried out under contracts with the European Commission <b>DG</b> <b>III</b> – D 3 in the period 1996 - 1999 with the aim to provide scientific basis for harmonized definition of models for determining the actions of snow applied to the structural parts of construction works. The project was led by Pisa University. The snow load design map produced by this project is incorporated in Annex C of EN 1991 - 1 - 3 with the aim to help National Competent Authorities to redraft their national snow maps and to establish harmonized procedures to produce such maps. A pilot study on creating a snow load map for structural design taking into account the climate change was launched at a working meeting on 8 April 2014 at JRC/Ispra with the participation of Pisa University and the JRC CRM and ELSA Units. While the study has been performed in Pisa University, the JRC CRM Unit provided data on climate change projections, and the two JRC Units consulted the approach and the results. The results obtained show that the developed procedure is very appropriate for the creation of snow maps taking into account the climate change implications, since it allows to estimate characteristic ground snow loads on the basis of daily data Tmax, Tmin and h rain, which are typically available as outputs of climate change projections for all possible scenarios...|$|E
30|$|The above {{benefits}} can {{be achieved}} by optimal placement of DGs. A novel nature-inspired algorithm called Dragonfly algorithm is used to determine the optimal DG units size in this paper. It has been developed based on the peculiar behavior of dragonflies in nature. This algorithm mainly focused on the dragonflies how they look for food or away from enemies. The proposed algorithm is tested on IEEE 15, 33 and 69 test systems. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with other evolutionary algorithms. When compared with other algorithms the Dragonfly algorithm gives best results. Best results are obtained from type <b>III</b> <b>DG</b> unit operating at 0.9 pf.|$|R
3000|$|Distributed {{generator}} (DG) {{resources are}} small scale electric power generating plants {{that can provide}} power to homes, businesses or industrial facilities in distribution systems. Power loss reductions, voltage profile improvement and increasing reliability are some advantages of DG units. The above benefits {{can be achieved by}} optimal placement of DGs. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), a novel metaheuristic algorithm, is used to determine the optimal DG size. WOA is modeled based on the unique hunting behavior of humpback whales. The WOA is evaluated on IEEE 15, 33, 69 and 85 -bus test systems. WOA was compared with different types of DGs and other evolutionary algorithms. When compared with voltage sensitivity index method, WOA and index vector methods gives better results. From the analysis best results have been achieved from type <b>III</b> <b>DG</b> operating at 0.9 pf.|$|R

The E 48 antigen, a {{putative}} human homologue of the 20 -kD protein {{present in}} desmosomal preparations of bovine muzzle, and formerly called desmoglein <b>III</b> (<b>dg</b> 4), is a promising target antigen for antibody-based therapy of {{squamous cell carcinoma}} in man.

Reduction of system power losses and improvement in voltage profile are the objectives taken in this paper. The proposed method has been applied on typical IEEE 15, 33, 69 and 85 -bus radial distribution systems with different types of DGs and compared with other algorithms. Better results have been achieved with WOA when compared with other algorithms. The simulation results indicated that the overall impact of the DG units on voltage profile is positive and proportionate reduction in power losses is achieved. It can be interfered that best results can be achieved with type <b>III</b> <b>DG</b> operating at 0.9 pf, because it generates both real power and reactive power. The results show that the WOA is efficient and robust.|$|R
40|$|The E 48 antigen, a {{putative}} human homologue of the 20 -kD protein {{present in}} desmosomal preparations of bovine muzzle, and formerly called desmoglein <b>III</b> (<b>dg</b> 4), is a promising target antigen for antibody- based therapy of {{squamous cell carcinoma}} in man. To anticipate the effect of high antibody dose treatment, and to evaluate the possible biological involvement of the antigen in carcinogenesis, {{we set out to}} molecularly characterize the antigen. A cDNA clone encoding the E 48 antigen was isolated by expression cloning in COS cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the clone contained an open reading frame of 128 amino acids, encoding a core protein of 13, 286 kD. Database searching showed that the E 48 antigen has a high level of sequence similarity with the mouse ThB antigen, a member of the Ly- 6 antigen family. Phosphatidylinositol-specific (PI-specific) phospholipase-C treatment indicated that the E 48 antigen is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI-anchored) to the plasma membrane. The gene encoding the E 48 antigen is a single copy gene, located on human chromosome 8 in the 8 q 24 -qter region. The expression of the gene is confined to keratinocytes and squamous tumor cells. The putative mouse homologue, the ThB antigen, originally identified as an antigen on cells of the lymphocyte lineage, was shown to be highly expressed in squamous mouse epithelia. Moreover, the ThB expression level is in keratinocytes, in contrast to that in lymphocytes, not mouse strain related. Transfection of mouse SV 40 -polyoma transformed mouse NIH/ 3 T 3 cells with the E 48 cDNA confirmed that the antigen is likely to be involved in cell-cell adhesion...|$|R
40|$|Difference in {{differences}} (DD) is {{a popular}} way of finding treatment effects with observational data. DD relies on the key identifying condition that the untreated response variable would have grown equally across the control and treatment groups (i. e., the time effects across the groups is the same). This key condition can be rewritten as the group effects across the time points being the same, with which this paper generalizes DD to difference in generalized-differences (DG). DG is indexed by a parameter η, and includes DD as a special case when η = 1. This feature {{makes it possible to}} use DG as a sensitivity analysis for DD by trying values of η other than one. Going further from sensitivity analysis, one may desire to fix the value of η. For this, we provide a way to get a benchmark value of η using a dynamic panel data model for the control group. An empirical analysis is provided for the effects of moving from private to public school on various test scores. In the empirical analysis, (i) DD magnitude is fairly sensitive to changes in η around one, but its statistical significance is not, (ii) η is significantly smaller than one in math score (and possibly in science score), and (<b>iii)</b> <b>DG</b> yields a significant negative effect of about 3 - 5 % for reading score, but the effects are ambiguous or insignificant for the other scores. η being less than 1 means that, had the movers to public school stayed, the score gap between the movers and stayers would have narrowed. That is, the move to public school is likely to have been involuntary. Key Words: treatment effect, difference in differences, panel data, private-school effect. * The author is grateful to the Editor, Associate Editor, two reviewers for their detailed comments which led to a substantial improvement of the paper.

40|$|We {{developed}} and evaluated a two-step PCR-based assay with universal primers and genus- or species-specific primers {{for the detection}} of the most prevalent bacterial etiologies of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children from Lebanese hospitals. These etiologies included Haemophilus, Streptococcus, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, which were detected in middle-ear effusion (MEE) samples taken from children with OME. A total of 47 MEE samples were aspirated from 36 patients during insertion of a tympanostomy tube performed particularly for OME. The duration of effusion in all patients was ≥ 2 months. DNA was extracted from MEE samples, and PCR was initially done with DNA extracts by using the universal primers RW 01 and DG 74, which flank an ∼ 370 -bp fragment found in the 16 S rRNA gene of all bacterial species. For the identification of specific bacteria, we used in three separate reaction mixtures the following genus- or species-specific primers: (i) a Haemophilus-specific probe (probe RDR 125) as a primer along with DG 74, (ii) a Streptococcus-specific primer (primer STR 1; designed by us) along with <b>DG</b> 74, and (<b>iii)</b> an M. catarrhalis-specific primer pair (primer pair MCA 1 -MCA 2). Thirty-five MEE samples (74. 5 %) gave the expected 370 -bp band, indicating the presence of bacterial DNA in the tested samples. Of the 35 PCR-positive samples tested, 33 (94. 3 %) were positive for Haemophilus, 3 (8. 6 %) were positive for Streptococcus, and 10 (28. 6 %) were positive for M. catarrhalis. Ten samples (28. 6 %) exhibited a mixed infection and were positive for both Haemophilus and M. catarrhalis. Culture was simultaneously performed for all 47 MEE samples. Ten of the 47 MEE samples (21. 3 %) exhibited bacterial growth. These 10 were PCR positive for bacterial DNA. The remaining 25 PCR-positive samples were negative by culture, thus showing about 53 % discordance between PCR results and those of culture. The PCR assay proved to be more sensitive than culture, more rapid, less cumbersome, and more cost-effective than the available PCR-Southern hybridization-based assays...|$|R
