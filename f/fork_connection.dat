50|$|After {{completion}} of the ULS, the Diamond Fork System will allow for the full trans-basin diversion of Bonneville Unit water from Strawberry Reservoir in the Colorado River drainage basin to Spanish Fork Canyon in the Bonneville Basin. The Diamond Fork System protects the Diamond Fork Creek and Sixth Water Creek riparian areas from damaging high flows. The Diamond Fork System was constructed in three primary phases. The Bureau of Reclamation constructed the first phase; the Central Utah Water Conservancy District constructed {{the second and third}} phases under the Central Utah Project Completion Act. The first phase included the Syar Tunnel Inlet, Syar Tunnel, Sixth Water Aqueduct, and Sixth Water Flow Control Structure, which together form a continuous 7.3 mi conduit from Strawberry Reservoir to Sixth Water Creek and currently discharges water into Sixth Water Creek. The second phase included the Diamond Fork Pipeline from Monks Hollow downstream to the mouth of Diamond Fork Creek. The third phase, now completed, consists of a tunnel connection to the Sixth Water Shaft and Flow Control Structure, Tanner Ridge Tunnel, Upper Diamond Fork Pipeline, Upper Diamond Fork Flow Control Structure, connection to Upper Diamond Fork Tunnel, Upper Diamond <b>Fork</b> Tunnel, and <b>connection</b> to the Diamond Fork Pipeline. Flow control structures are located at Sixth Water Creek, Upper Diamond Fork Creek, and at Monks Hollow. The 19.8 mi-long conduit will convey Bonneville Unit water and Strawberry Valley Project water to the mouth of Diamond Fork Canyon. The Diamond Fork System will remove a portion of the Strawberry Valley Project irrigation flows that were historically conveyed down Sixth Water Creek and Diamond Fork Creek. In-stream flows specified in the Central Utah Project Completion Act will be released into Sixth Water Creek and lower Diamond Fork Creek to enhance fisheries in these streams.|$|R
