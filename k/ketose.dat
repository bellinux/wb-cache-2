25|$|Transketolase is {{an enzyme}} {{of both the}} pentose {{phosphate}} pathway in all organisms and the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. It catalyzes two important reactions, which operate in opposite directions in these two pathways. In the first reaction of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine diphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon <b>ketose</b> (D-xylulose-5-P), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon aldose (D-ribose-5-P) to form a 7-carbon <b>ketose</b> (sedoheptulose-7-P). The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle, transketolase catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the <b>ketose</b> D-xylulose-5-P.|$|E
25|$|Destabilizing the {{molecule}} {{in the previous}} reaction allows the hexose ring to be split by aldolase into two triose sugars: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (a <b>ketose),</b> and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (an aldose). There are two classes of aldolases: class I aldolases, present in animals and plants, and class II aldolases, present in fungi and bacteria; the two classes use different mechanisms in cleaving the <b>ketose</b> ring.|$|E
25|$|Monosaccharides are {{classified}} according to three different characteristics: {{the placement of}} its carbonyl group, the number of carbon atoms it contains, and its chiral handedness. If the carbonyl group is an aldehyde, the monosaccharide is an aldose; if the carbonyl group is a ketone, the monosaccharide is a <b>ketose.</b> Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses, those with four are called tetroses, five are called pentoses, six are hexoses, and so on. These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, glucose is an aldohexose (a six-carbon aldehyde), ribose is an aldopentose (a five-carbon aldehyde), and fructose is a ketohexose (a six-carbon ketone).|$|E
50|$|With three carbon atoms, {{dihydroxyacetone}} is {{the simplest}} of all <b>ketoses</b> {{and is the only}} one having no optical activity. <b>Ketoses</b> can isomerize into an aldose when the carbonyl group is located {{at the end of the}} molecule. Such <b>ketoses</b> are reducing sugars.|$|R
40|$|Of all {{possible}} <b>ketoses,</b> only D-fructose occur large scale in nature. Therefore, all the <b>ketoses</b> {{with the exception}} of D-fructose are defined as “rare ketose”. Despite their lower accessibility, rare <b>ketoses</b> offer an enormous potential for applications in pharmaceutical, medicine, functional food and synthetic chemistry. However, studies of rare <b>ketoses</b> have been hampered by the lack of efficient preparation methods. Here, a convenient and efficient platform for the facile synthesis of rare <b>ketoses</b> is described. The introduced two-step strategies are based on a “phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation” cascade reaction. Rare <b>ketoses</b> were prepared from readily available starting materials as their ketose- 1 -phosphate forms in step 1 by one-pot multienzyme reactions, followed by the hydrolysis of the phosphate groups in acidic conditions to produce desired <b>ketoses</b> in step 2. By this strategy, 14 rare <b>ketoses</b> were obtained from readily available starting materials with high yield, high purity, and without having to undergo tedious isomer separation step. Sialic acids are typically linked a 2 - 3 or a 2 - 6 to the galactose that located at the nonreducing terminal end of glycans, playing important but distinct roles in a variety of biological and pathological processes. However, details about their respective roles are still largely unknown {{due to the lack of}} an effective analytical technique. Lectin and antibody binding have been the primary method to analyze glycans, but lectins and antibodies often suffer from weak binding affinity, limited specificity, and cross-reactivity. To address this issue, we develop a chmoenzymatic reporter strategy for rapid and sensitive detection of N-acetylneuraminic acid-a(2 - 3) -Galactose (Neu 5 Aca(2 - 3) Gal) glycans on cell surface...|$|R

25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (<b>ketose).</b> If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E
2500|$|A {{monosaccharide}} {{can switch}} from the acyclic (open-chain) form to a cyclic form, through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group {{and one of}} the hydroxyls of the same molecule. [...] The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom. The resulting molecule has an hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a <b>ketose.</b> [...] The reaction is easily reversed, yielding the original open-chain form.|$|E
2500|$|Although this enzyme {{is able to}} bind {{numerous}} {{types of}} substrates, such as phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated monosaccharides including the keto and aldosugars fructose, ribose, etc., it has a high specificity for the stereoconfiguration of the hydroxyl groups of the sugars. [...] These hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-4 of the <b>ketose</b> donor {{must be in the}} D-threo configuration in order to correctly correspond to the C-1 and C-2 positions on the aldose acceptor. [...] Also they stabilize the substrate in the active site by interacting with the Asp477, His30, and His263 residues. [...] Disruption of this configuration, both the placement of hydroxyl groups or their stereochemistry, would consequently alter the H-bonding between the residues and substrates thus causing a lower affinity for the substrates.|$|E

50|$|The process only {{provides}} {{direct access}} to aldoses, whereas some sugars of interest may instead be <b>ketoses.</b> Some <b>ketoses</b> may be accessible from similar aldoses by isomerization via an enediol intermediate; for example, on standing in aqueous base, glucose, fructose, and mannose will slowly interconvert since they share an enediol form. (See mutarotation). Some unusual sugars are also accessible via aldol addition.|$|R
2500|$|Each carbon atom {{bearing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group (-OH), {{with the exception}} of the first and last carbons, are asymmetric, making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers. In the case of glyceraldehydes, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the <b>ketose</b> corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light. This usage of [...] "d-" [...] and [...] "l-" [...] is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.|$|E
