2500|$|Mild {{deficiencies}} can exceed 50% of {{the population}} in Third World countries and in refugee situations. Deficiency is uncommon in the United States and in other countries that have wheat flour, bread, pasta, corn meal or rice enrichment regulations. In the U.S., starting in the 1940s, <b>flour,</b> <b>corn</b> meal and rice have been fortified with B vitamins as a means of restoring some of what is lost in milling, bleaching and other processing. For adults 20 and older, average intake from food and beverages is 1.8mg/day for women and 2.5mg/day for men. An estimated 23% consume a riboflavin-containing dietary supplement that provides on average 10mg. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conducts National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey every two years and reports food results in a series of reports referred to as [...] "What We Eat In America." [...] From NHANES 2011–2012, estimates were that 8% of women and 3% of men consumed less than the RDA. When compared to the lower Estimated Average Requirements, fewer than 3% did not achieve the EAR level. Anyone choosing a gluten-free or low gluten diet should, however, as a precaution take a multi-vitamin/mineral dietary supplement which provides 100% DV for riboflavin and other B vitamins.|$|E

The rheological properties showed that maximum viscosity (PV), hot paste viscosity (HPV), breakdown viscosity (BV), cold paste viscosity (CPV) and setback viscosity (SV) of pre-treated <b>corn</b> <b>flour</b> decreased as the steam pressure treatment time increased. The steam pressure treatment changed the gelatinization profile from B to C type. Correlation analyses showed that the PV had positive correlation with swelling volume.
