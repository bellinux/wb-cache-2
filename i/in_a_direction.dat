5|$|In 1914, Zeller {{published}} {{a study of}} the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in Seattle in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains. The growth form of Xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae {{at the top of the}} stem and subsequently expands by growth along the margins; the hymenium forms later beneath the cap <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> away from the center.|$|E

5|$|The Gaelic Revival of {{the early}} twentieth century has had a {{long-term}} influence. There is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoirí) in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast. They represent an expanding demographic, with their own schools (called Gaelscoileanna) and their own social media. It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, with better employment prospects and higher social status. Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar. Irish is also taught in mainstream English-speaking schools as a compulsory subject, but has been criticised for its ineffectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction,</b> the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass. By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E
5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact.

5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine {{what they want to}} do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a visual cue. When in use, the bullet time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the bullet time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the bullet time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E

5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|Photonic {{crystals}} can {{be formed}} in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized {{holes in the}} chitin of the wing scales. The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and {{are about the same}} distance apart. The holes are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a micrometre wide. Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> different from its neighbours.|$|E
5|$|There {{is another}} {{opportunity}} for tennessine to complete its octet—by forming a covalent bond. Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet {{they are expected}} to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a diatomic molecule. Such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms; these are different from pi bonds, which are divided into two parts, each shifted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the At2 molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine is predicted to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts2. The molecule tennessine chloride (TsCl) is predicted to go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.|$|E

30|$|The {{azimuthal}} {{dependence of}} the durations of HFER shown in Section 2 indicates the rupture propagation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> southwest <b>direction,</b> while some rupture models placed large slips <b>in</b> <b>an</b> east <b>direction</b> from the epicenter (e.g., Fujii et al., 2011; Hayes, 2011; Shao et al., 2011). These results suggest {{that there were two}} distinct rupture propagations in this event: one <b>in</b> <b>a</b> southwest <b>direction</b> from which high frequency energies were radiated efficiently, and the other <b>in</b> <b>an</b> east <b>direction</b> from which <b>a</b> very large seismic moment was released. The latter is likely to have cased the huge tsunamis that struck areas along the Sanriku coast.|$|R
