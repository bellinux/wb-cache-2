40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the creation of}} the High Representative in the context of two salient prior examples of this ongoing competition between European Union (EU) Member-States and the Commission. The first example is the European Commission's endeavors to increase its institutional role and international profile in the EU's foreign relations through the personal participation of individual Commissioners. In addition to the Commission President's representation of the European community within international fora, the Commission's portfolios have been repeatedly reformed to emphasize the Commission's role in the EU's <b>external</b> <b>political</b> <b>relations,</b> first symbolized by the post-Maastricht creation of a Commissioner for CFSP. The second example is the recent creation of EU Special Envoys. These limited foreign policy actors are essentially policy instruments of the Council, being appointed, controlled and maintained by Council action. The paper concludes by applying a theoretical perspective of this phenomenon by comparing Neo-Realist theory with a Historical Institutionalist (HI) approach. Particular attention will be paid to the HI assertion that EU Member-State policy-making can be constrained over time by past decisions within the same collective decision-making framework...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinctive}} Sami historical {{land use}} concerning reindeer management and settlement of inner Troms, North Norway, {{is reflected in}} places with archaeological remains. The insight and knowledge connected with these places can be accessed through oral traditions and place-names where reindeer management is embedded in reindeer knowledge developed over long time spans. Previous distinctions between wild reindeer hunting and pastoral herding can be redefined, since much of the traditional knowledge concerning the wild reindeer (goddi) may have been transferred to the domesticated animals (boazu). The transition from reindeer hunting to pastoralism is a current research focus and archaeological results from inner Troms indicate that several Sami dwellings with árran (hearths) are related to a transitional period from AD 1300 to 1400. This period {{is marked by a}} reorganisation of the inland Sami siida (collective communities), and changes in landscape use wherein seasonal cycles and grazing access began to determine the movements of people and their domestic reindeer herds. This reorganisation was a response to both <b>external</b> <b>political</b> <b>relations</b> and the inner dynamic of the Sami communities. The first use of tamed reindeer was as decoys and draft animals in the hunting economy, only later becoming the mainstay of household food supply in reindeer pastoralism, providing insurance for future uncertainties. The formation of the national border between Norway-Denmark and Sweden in 1751 led to extensive changes in the previously trans-national mobility pattern, leading to fragmentation of the old siidas and to a new stage of nomadic pastoral economy...|$|E
40|$|Movement {{of people}} has been a key feature in {{the whole history of}} European integration. While {{existing}} literature has mostly adopted national viewpoints and a socioeconomic perspective, this book integrates these existing fragmented analyses, views them from a broader perspective and places them in the wider context of the social and demographic transformation of Europe and the political and economic narrative of continental integration. It highlights the impact made by EC/EU immigration policies on the <b>external</b> <b>political</b> and economic <b>relations</b> of Europe and acknowledges that pre- 1989 migration from East European countries is part of European integration. By showing that migration policies and their impact on European national societies and economies cannot be fully understood without taking into account the EC framework, this book, therefore, contributes to migration studies as a whole...|$|R
40|$|The {{organisation}} {{and management}} of EC development co-operation is embedded within the broader, and more <b>political,</b> <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> framework. Current reforms include more strategic and streamlined approaches, reorganisation in headquarters, and "deconcentration" of implementation authority to the field. These reforms are more sharply defining the vision, responsibilities, and processes of European aid institutions. It will be a challenge to ensure that these organisational and management reforms are increasingly results-oriented. The transition to this new form of management culture has only begun and will require a longer-term political commitment from European leadership to be successful. To implement this more strategic and developmentally oriented mandate also requires more human resources. ...|$|R

Contrary to predictions based on the FDI and <b>political</b> <b>relations</b> literature, we find that SWFs prefer to invest in nations with which they have relatively weaker <b>political</b> <b>relations.</b> This indicates that SWFs behave differently than other economic agents. Despite this observed difference, we find that, consistent with the FDI and <b>political</b> <b>relations</b> literature, SWF investment has a positive (negative) impact for relatively closed (open) countries.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} political efficacy and social networks in rural China to understand the social characteristics that might affect an individual’s disposition to join in public deliberations.

Social networks have a moderating effect, individuals with a high social network status having an enhanced positive internal political efficacy-public deliberation involvement but weakened positive <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy-public deliberation involvement.

40|$|We examine between-country {{variations}} in overall levels of <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy and disparities in political efficacy by parental socio-economic status (SES). Furthermore, we identify the mediating role of individuals’ cognitive abilities and own SES, {{as well as}} how contextual characteristics determine the importance cognitive abilities and individuals’ own SES have for political self-efficacy beliefs. We use data from the 2012 OECD Survey of Adult Skills, a large-scale international assessment containing information on respondents’ SES, cognitive skills, their parents’ SES and their self-reported <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy in 28 countries worldwide. We find that <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy is strongly related to parents’ SES and that, on average, around 60 % of the parental SES gradient is mediated by cognitive abilities (which account for around 30 % of the parental SES gradient) and own SES (which account for the remaining 30 %). Such mediating role differs across countries. Cognitive abilities are less strongly associated with <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy in countries with greater respect {{for the rule of law}} and lower perceived corruption and individuals’ own SES is less strongly associated with <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy in countries with single-winner voting rules (such as winner-takes-all or first-past-the-post rules).

40|$|The {{trust of}} {{citizens}} in their governments has gradually eroded. One response by several North American governments {{has been to}} introduce egovernment, or web-mediated citizen-to-government interaction. This paper tests {{the extent to which}} online initiatives have succeeded in increasing trust and <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy in voters. An internetbased survey of 182 Canadian voters shows that using the internet to transact with government has a significantly positive impact on trust and <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy. Interestingly, though the quality of the interaction is important, it is secondary to internal political efficacy in determining Trust levels, and not significant in determining levels of <b>external</b> <b>political</b> efficacy (or perceived government responsiveness). For policy-makers, this suggests egovernment efforts might be better-aimed at citizens with high pre-extant levels of trust, rather than in developing better web sites. For researchers, this paper introduces political efficacy as an important determinant of trust as it pertains to e-government...|$|R

40|$|Anastasius' long rule at {{the turn}} of the sixth century has tended to be neglected, yet it was a {{critical}} time in the history of the Later Roman Empire. On his accession, there were many problems facing the state: conflicts, both internal and external, religious disputes, and financial and administrative chaos. It is the aim of this thesis to assess the significance of Anastasius' reign, with a systematic survey of the key areas of imperial government. After an introductory chapter examining the primary sources, the second and third chapters consider revolts and wars. Chapter Two looks at two internal uprisings, that of the Isaurians (491 - 498) and that of Vitalian (514 - 516). The third chapter concentrates on <b>external</b> conflicts and <b>political</b> <b>relations.</b> The first section considers the Persian offensive (502 - 506) and the role of the Arabs, while the second part examines the ambiguous position of Theoderic in Italy, and explores how Anastasius sought to stabilize the balance of power with counter-alliances with the Franks and Burgundians. Chapter Four deals with the doctrinal schism dividing the orthodox from the monophysite. It outlines the background to this crisis and investigates the vicissitudes of Anastasius' policy as he sought to reconcile increasing eastern monophysitism with the west's intransigent orthodoxy. Chapter Five examines Anastasius' financial rehabilitation of the state and concludes that his success lay in a much wider reorganisation of the empire's resources: he restructured the fisc and introduced changes to municipal administration, agrarian legislation and the organisation of the army. This chapter also considers measures to halt the escalating violence of the faction riots, and it closes with a survey of the emperor's building policy. The thesis concludes that Anastasius' reign resolved many of the problems facing the empire in the fifth century, paving the way for Justinian in the sixth. </p...|$|R
