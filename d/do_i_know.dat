All farm land colonization companies have disbanded because {{there is no longer a}} chance for steady long time employment.

500|$|Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of {{existence}} and assumes another. In the second chapter, he makes the point that, for all humans know, death {{may in fact be}} better than life: [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that loving life is not a delusion? How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?" [...] His writings teach that [...] "the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio. Levine later commented on writing the episode, [...] "At the time David and I were writing this, my son, Matt, was about Bart's age. [...] So for me {{there was a certain}} amount of guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to convince them that very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E

About halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me. In my films I've been trying to mix social satire and family drama. I {{realised}} that all along I had been trying to do Jane Austen without knowing it. Jane Austen was my destiny. I just had to overcome the cultural barrier."Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a [...] "director for hire", as he was unsure of his role and position. He spent six months in England [...] "learn how to make this movie, how to do a period film, culturally... and how to adapt to the major league film industry." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Blood Drive" [...] {{within a week}} of its original release. In the first 85-second clip, Dwight assures his office-mates that the blood taken in the bloodmobile will not be used in any [...] "ritualistic ways". Later, while giving blood himself, he asks the hospital employee, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it's not going to go into a person who will later come back to kill me?" [...] The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party. Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage-woman whom her kids now consider their real mother instead of herself, and Dwight said he believes his soulmate, [...] "probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai, {{or at the very least}} she lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes-Barre corridor." [...] In the final 90-second clip, Dwight shows off his bobblehead doll collection to a woman, Creed tries unsuccessfully to pick up Lynne, and Dwight gets rid of an attractive male visitor who Michael fears could be competition. Dwight tells him the party is cancelled [...] "due to a death in the elevator".|$|E
500|$|An {{entertainment}} {{might go}} beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience. [...] Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: [...] "What {{is the meaning}} of life?"; [...] "What {{does it mean to be}} human?"; [...] "What is the right thing to do?"; or [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include Shakespeare's influential play Hamlet, whose hero articulates these concerns in poetry; and films, such as The Matrix, which explores the nature of knowledge and was released world-wide. Novels give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers. An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Originally a radio comedy, this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, audiobook, LP record, adventure game and online game, its ideas became popular references (see Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and has been translated into many languages. Its themes encompass the meaning of life, as well as [...] "the ethics of entertainment, artificial intelligence, multiple worlds, God, and philosophical method".|$|E

500|$|In a DVD {{review for}} the {{individual}} episode DVD release Spongicus, Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said that [...] "In my previous SpongeBob reviews I have commented that series has lost its edge. This offering does nothing to change my opinion. But what the heck <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> Clearly, the show continues to maintain a large following and the franchise is a license to print money for Nickelodeon." [...] The DVD consists of eight episodes and praised the episodes [...] "Not Normal" [...] and [...] "Gone" [...] by describing them [...] "the best episode on the disc" [...] and [...] "a decent episode", respectively. Also from DVD Verdict, Gordon Sullivan, on the DVD release To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants, said that [...] " [...] a solid collection of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes." [...] He added that [...] "My only serious problem with this set is that it's only eight episodes long; a more complete season-style release would be more efficient. On the technical front everything is fine, with the bright, solid colors of Bikini Bottom shining through clearly and all the dialogue and effects clear and detailed." [...] Sullivan gave the episodes [...] "The Splinter", [...] "Slide Whistle Stooges", and [...] "The Krabby Kronicle" [...] an 8/10 rating, while [...] "Boating Buddies" [...] received the lowest rating with 3/10.|$|E
500|$|In {{her letters}} to her {{siblings}} in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease {{at the new}} restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg. She and her parents were searched by guards at the Ipatiev House and were warned they {{would be subject to}} further searches. A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. [...] "Oh, how complicated everything is now," [...] she wrote on May 2, 1918. [...] "We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it's all started again." [...] Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the Ipatiev House Guard. She showed them pictures from her photo albums and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she [...] "was a girl who loved to have fun." [...] Another of the guards recalled Maria's buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn't assume an air of grandeur. One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in [...] "severe and angry whispers," [...] apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg. Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, [...] "We're so bored! In Tobolsk there was always something to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> Try to guess the name of this dog!" [...] The teenage girls walked by the sentries, whispering and giggling in a manner that the guards considered flirtatious.|$|E

2500|$|Lee {{decided to}} take on a small-budget, {{low-profile}} independent film based on Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize-finalist short story, Brokeback Mountain. In a 2005 article by Robert K. Elder, Lee was quoted as saying, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about gay ranch hands in Wyoming?" [...] In spite of the director's removal from the subject at hand, Brokeback Mountain showcased Lee's skills in probing the depths of the human heart. The 2005 movie about the forbidden love between two Wyoming sheepherders immediately caught public attention and became a cultural phenomenon, initiating intense debates and becoming a box office hit.|$|E
2500|$|Brian is {{featured}} in a Family Guy parody in the South Park episode [...] "Cartoon Wars Part I". The scene depicted a conversation between Peter and Brian leading {{to one of the}} show's trademark cut-away gags; like Peter, Brian was rendered in the distinct animation style of South Park. Brian also appeared in one episode of Seth MacFarlene's other animated sitcom, American Dad! titled The People vs. Martin Sugar. When Stan Smith begins to mention his list of [...] "Top 10 Fictitious Dogs," [...] with the last one being Brian, he briefly appears confused asking Stan, [...] "Uh, <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you?", which is an homage to MacFarlane himself since he voices both characters.|$|E

How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're not George Plimpton?"

2500|$|Brando {{was an avid}} {{student and}} proponent of Stella Adler, from whom he learned the {{techniques}} of the Stanislavski system. This technique encouraged the actor to explore {{both internal and external}} aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed. Brando's remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on. Adler used to recount that when teaching Brando, she had instructed the class to act like chickens, and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them. Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg. Asked by Adler why he had chosen to react this way, he said, [...] "I'm a chicken—what <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about bombs?"
