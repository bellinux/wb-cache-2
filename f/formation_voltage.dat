30|$|In summary, a resist-free nonlithographic {{method for}} the {{fabrication}} of ordered silicon nanohole arrays {{by a combination}} of localized metal deposition and the subsequent metal-assisted chemical etching was demonstrated. The porous alumina formed directly on the Si substrate served as a mask for localized metal deposition and controlled the position and size of noble metals, which were deposited only in the exposed area at the alumina mask/silicon interface. After metal deposition, the pattern transfer of the self-ordered pore configuration of porous alumina into silicon was examined by metal-assisted chemical etching. In brief, the present process consists of two independent processes: (1) noble metal nanodot arrays are obtained by displacement plating using an alumina mask in HF solution containing the desired metal ion and (2) straight silicon nanohole arrays are formed by the site-selective etching of silicon using the deposited noble metal as the catalyst in a solution of HF and H 2 O 2. The dimensions of the resultant nanohole pattern can be controlled by changing the anodization conditions of aluminum for forming an alumina mask, which include electrolyte type and anodization voltage, and the chemical etching conditions such as catalyst type, catalyst amount, etchant concentration, and etching time. The periodicity of silicon hole arrays, which was basically determined by the pore interval of the upper anodic porous alumina, could be adjusted to 60 and 100 nm, corresponding to <b>formation</b> <b>voltages</b> of 25 and 40 V, respectively.|$|R
