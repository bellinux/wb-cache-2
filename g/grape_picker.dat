25|$|Petipa {{was offered}} the {{position}} of Premier danseur to the Grand Théâtre in Bordeaux in 1841. There, he studied further with the great Vestris, all the while dancing the leads in such ballets as La Fille Mal Gardée, La Péri and Giselle. While performing with the company his skills as not only a dancer but as a partner were much celebrated. His partnering of Carlotta Grisi during a performance of La Péri was much celebrated, particularly his almost acrobatic lifts and catches of the ballerina that dazzled the audience. While in Bordeaux, Petipa began mounting his own original full-length productions. Among these works were La Jolie Bordelaise (The Beauty of Bordeaux), La Vendange (The <b>Grape</b> <b>Picker),</b> L'Intrigue Amoureuse (The Intrigues of Love) and Le Langage des Fleurs (The Voice of the Flowers).|$|E

50|$|Martinez {{played a}} <b>grape</b> <b>picker</b> in 1982 on CBS's Falcon Crest, Native American Low Wolf on the {{short-lived}} Born to the Wind, {{and a police}} detective in the 1983-1984 series Whiz Kids. He was introduced to daytime viewers in Santa Barbara as Cruz Castillo, a role he played from the show's debut in 1984 until 1992; he won a Daytime Emmy in 1990. From 1999-2002, Martinez appeared on General Hospital playing mobster and FBI informant Roy DiLucca. During his time with General Hospital, he was awarded three consecutive ALMA Awards (2000, 2001, 2002). Since Martinez resembles Asher Brauner, who played the role 1978-1979, Martinez's flashbacks of his character {{did not need to}} be re-filmed. Martinez has also worked on prime time television, including starring roles in series such as Profiler and L.A. Law.|$|E

50|$|Rankin {{was born}} in Cardenden, Fife. His father, James, owned a grocery shop, and his mother, Isobel, worked in a school canteen. He was educated at Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. His parents were horrified when he then chose to study {{literature}} at university, expecting him to study for a trade. Encouraged by his English teacher, he persisted and graduated in 1982 from the University of Edinburgh, where he also worked on a doctorate on Muriel Spark but did not complete it. He has taught at the university and retains an involvement with the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. He lived in Tottenham, London, {{for four years and}} then rural France for six while he developed his career as a novelist. Before becoming a full-time novelist, he worked as a <b>grape</b> <b>picker,</b> swineherd, taxman, alcohol researcher, hi-fi journalist, college secretary and punk musician in a band called the Dancing Pigs.|$|E
25|$|When Filipino American {{farm workers}} {{initiated}} the Delano grape strike on September 8, 1965, to protest for higher wages, Chavez eagerly supported them. Six months later, Chavez and the NFWA led a strike of California <b>grape</b> <b>pickers</b> on the historic farmworkers march from Delano to the California state capitol in Sacramento for similar goals. The UFW encouraged all Americans to boycott table grapes {{as a show}} of support. The strike lasted five years and attracted national attention. In March 1966, the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor held hearings in California on the strike. During the hearings, subcommittee member Robert F. Kennedy expressed {{his support for the}} striking workers.|$|R
50|$|Tensions {{reached a}} peak on October 10 in Pixley when about 30 ranchers {{surrounded}} {{a meeting of}} striking workers. The ranchers fired on the strikers, killing three and wounded a number of others. That same day, a group of striking <b>grape</b> <b>pickers</b> faced a group of armed growers' men at a farm near Arvin, California, about 60 mi south of Pixley. After several hours confronting one another at {{the border of the}} employer's land, the two sides began attacking each other (the workers armed with wooden poles, the growers' men using the butt of their rifles). A shot rang out and a striking worker was killed. A sheriff's deputy threw a tear gas grenade at the group, and the growers' men opened fire. Several strikers were wounded.|$|R
50|$|Decker moved {{further up}} {{the ranks of}} the CAWI during the strike against grape growers in the Fresno area. Decker led a rally in Fresno on September 11 where “…four {{thousand}} thronged the speaker’s platform to hear this petite blonde, barely twenty-one”. One CAWIU organizer, Patrick Chaffee, remembers her “…fiery eloquence”, and within a month, “Comrade Decker had led six thousand off the job, the largest single agricultural strike to that point in the history of California”. <b>Grape</b> <b>pickers</b> sought a wage of 25 cents an hour, but growers held firm at 20 cents. Local authorities arrested much of the leadership of the CAWIU, and forcibly broke up picket lines. The editor of the Fresno Bee believed the CAWIU was plotting the overthrow of the U. S. government and encouraged the actions of authorities.|$|R

While his cousin Manuel and his friends Celestino and Willie spend their pay on gambling and women, Chu Chu buys new clothes and an encyclopedia. When grape season ends, Chu Chu takes a job clearing land for Ansel Ames (Wendell Corey) on Ames' farm near Sacramento. Ames and his wife (Claire Trevor) are having marital problems and the lonely Mrs. Ames, who initially regards Chu Chu with contempt as a [...] "foreigner", becomes attracted to Chu Chu over time. Chu Chu is friendly and kind to her, but does not return her affections and rejects her attempt to seduce him. Instead, Chu Chu is drawn to Nancy (Shelley Winters), a troubled waitress with a drinking problem whose former husband, a test pilot, was killed in a crash. Chu Chu puts up his prized possession, a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to get money for Nancy, and asks her to be his girl, although she protests that he shouldn't waste his time on a [...] "wino" [...] like herself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{growing season}} in Argentina usually last from budbreak in October to harvest {{beginning}} sometime in February. The Instituto Nacional de Vitivinicultura (INV), the main government controlling {{body for the}} wine industry, declares the beginning date for harvest in a region with the harvest season sometimes lasting till April depending on the variety and wine region. A sizable population of [...] laborers provides an abundance of <b>grape</b> <b>pickers</b> at low cost which has slowed the conversion to mechanical harvesting. After harvest, grapes often have to be transported long distances, taking several hours, from the rural vineyards to winemaking facilities located in more urban areas.

As the Argentine wine industry continues to grow in the 21st century, several related viticultural trends will involve improvements in irrigation, yield control, canopy management and the construction of more winemaking facilities closer to the vineyards.|$|R
5000|$|Brought up in Dijon, Marie François Maurice Emmanuel {{became a}} chorister at Beaune cathedral after {{his family moved}} to the city in 1869. According to his granddaughter, Anne Eichner-Emmanuel, he was {{influenced}} by the brass bands on the streets of Beaune and by the [...] "songs of the <b>grape</b> <b>pickers</b> which imprinted melodies in his memory so different from all the classical music he was taught in the academy of music." [...] Subsequently, he went to Paris, and he entered the Paris Conservatoire, where his composition teacher was Léo Delibes. However, Delibes' strong disapproval of his early modal compositions (Cello Sonata, Op. 2, Sonatinas No. 1, Op. 4 and No. 2, Op. 5) caused a rift between them and subsequently caused him to study with Ernest Guiraud also at the Conservatoire. At the Conservatoire he came to know Claude Debussy who was also a pupil there. In addition, he attended the Conservatoire classes of César Franck, about whom he wrote a short book in 1930 (César Franck: Etude Critique).|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} thesis represents {{two-thirds of}} a yet-to-be completed novel. During September, 1966, California {{is preparing to}} execute Eusebio Viramontes, condemned under a ???Little Lindberg??? law for kidnap, robbery, and sexual assault. He has authored two books and become a cause c??l??bre during eleven years on Death Row. His sister Felicia, a film student at UCLA and weekend participant in the Delano <b>Grape</b> <b>Pickers???</b> Strike, hopes to gain public sympathy for a reprieve, but she is hampered by pregnancy and a strained relationship with her boyfriend, Albert Brofield. In a separate thread, Philip Tseng was prosecutor at Eusebio???s trial. Now he is a superior court judge and husband of a candidate for state superintendent of schools. French-born and half-Chinese, he is facing mid-life self doubt. In his spiritual questioning, he is drawn to Tom Garcia, pacifist and {{a leader of the}} capital punishment abolition movement. Just as Felicia sets in motion a UFW-style march from San Quentin to Sacramento, both Felicia and Judge Tseng are visited by Anna Sorenson, once Eusebio???s kindergarten-aged victim. Though emotionally fragile, she claims forgiveness for Eusebio. The novel contains a cameo appearance by Episcopal Bishop James Pike and historical references to Cesar Chavez, Chinese expatriates in France, Charles De Gaulle, and Capital Punishment as it was practiced in mid- 20 th-century America.

2500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr., {{who had won}} the Nobel Peace Prize for {{his efforts}} to achieve {{equality}} of the races, was assassinated in 1968. Following his death others led the movement, most notably King's widow, Coretta Scott King, who was also active, like her husband, in the Opposition to the Vietnam War, and in the Women's Liberation Movement. There were 164 riots in 128 American cities {{in the first nine}} months of 1967. Frustrations with the seemingly slow progress of the integration movement led to the emergence of more radical discourses during the early 1960s, which, in turn, gave rise to the Black Power movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward integration, especially in government service, sports, and entertainment. Native Americans turned to the federal courts to fight for their land rights. They held protests highlighting the federal government's failure to honor treaties. One of the most outspoken Native American groups was the American Indian Movement (AIM). In the 1960s, Cesar Chavez began organizing poorly paid Mexican-American farm workers in California. He led a five-year-long strike by <b>grape</b> <b>pickers.</b> Then Chávez formed the nation's first successful union of farm workers. His United Farm Workers of America (UFW) [...] faltered after a few years but after Chavez died in 1993 he became an iconic [...] "folk saint" [...] in the pantheon of Mexican Americans.|$|R
40|$|For my {{research}} project, I plan {{to focus on}} Cesar Chavez, a Mexican-American activist born in Arizona. He was instrumental in reforming the treatment of immigrant farm workers through nonviolent means. He organized marches and boycotts against companies that produced table grapes, objecting to their unethical treatment of immigrant <b>grape</b> <b>pickers.</b> Immigrant workers often faced harsh work conditions, long hours, low wages, and exposure to harmful pesticides. Chavez roused a following of both immigrants and Americans that advocated for better treatment for farm workers and raised awareness about the abuses these workers endured. He gained social and political notoriety during his career as an activist, which won him the support of many liberal politicians, including Robert F. Kennedy. Chavez helped to form the National Farm Workers Association, which later became The United Farm Workers, an organization committed to regulating the treatment of immigrant laborers. He employed many nonviolent tactics throughout his career to aid the plight of farm workers, including a series of hunger strikes, the final of which led to his death in 1993. My presentation will center on intercultural conflict, but will also contain some elements of Spanish language and Latin American issues and culture. I would like to direct {{my research}} {{to answer the following}} questions: What were the main challenges Chávez faced in regards to intercultural cooperation? What strategies did he employ in overcoming these obstacles? Were they or were they not effective, and why, and how can these strategies be applied to contemporary intercultural conflicts...|$|R
40|$|In November 2003, the South African wine {{industry}} {{held its first}} consultative conference on 2 ̆ 018 Black Empowerment 2 ̆ 019. The press reported {{to the world that}} the industry was at last entering 2 ̆ 018 the new South Africa 2 ̆ 019. For years, it had been a byword for white power and black exploitation 2 ̆ 013 famous for the grim working conditions, poor wages, degrading institutions, and authoritarian, racist white farmers. In contrast to the past, when talk of change was the prerogative of white and male industry insiders, a wide range of industry stakeholders were invited, and the conference itself was dominated by new black faces and voices. A Wine Industry Plan was presented, in which 2 ̆ 018 Black Economic Empowerment 2 ̆ 019 (BEE) figured as a central element. In this paper, we argue that far from representing a decisive break with the past, BEE in the {{wine industry}} is in important ways continuous with it. BEE allows the industry to avoid potentially more uncomfortable options to redress current and past race-based imbalances 2 ̆ 013 such as land redistribution, import boycotts, and better working conditions for <b>grape</b> <b>pickers.</b> An essentialist racial discourse, pivoting on ahistorical and dislocated notions of 2 ̆ 018 blackness 2 ̆ 019 has been used to displace the transformation agenda away from challenging the impoverishment of the many to ensuring the enrichment of the few. What commitment to farm worker interests remains is couched solidly in self-amelioration discourse (education, training, combating alcoholism) rather than on farm worker organization {{and the nature of the}} labour regime on wine farms. At the same time, marketing and codification technologies are deployed to move the terrain of restructuring from a political realm to a managerial one 2 ̆ 013 where a small cohort of black entrepreneurs can operate with new legitimacy. This terrain is characterized by branding, advertising, image building on the one side; and by codes of conduct, a sectoral BEE charter, scorecards, and auditing on the other. In a way, these tools are allowing both the standardization and the de-racialisation of labour and social relations in the wine industry, an industry characterized by slavery and exploitation in the past, and by more or less benign paternalism in more recent history...|$|R
