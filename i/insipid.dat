5|$|Olivia had six novels {{published}} between 1894 and 1910, {{which as}} described by Foster are about women unhappy in love, with <b>insipid</b> and uninspiring male characters. The heroines—frequently orphaned, educated by elderly tutors, and depicted in country house libraries—fall in love with much older men in the later novels.|$|E
5|$|She {{dedicated}} The False Laurel, {{published in}} 1896, to Lionel Johnson. The plot features a poetess who {{falls in love}} with and marries an <b>insipid</b> young poet, giving up her own writing to attend to his needs. She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. The False Laurel was the least successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from The Bookman but a good one from The Athenaeneum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s however, Tucker's {{views of}} slavery changed notably with {{personal}} experience, and profit, realized in his purchase {{and sale of}} slaves for his account {{and that of his}} father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the <b>insipid</b> benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|The Dardanelles Commission, {{including}} Fisher, interviewed {{witnesses in}} 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919. It {{concluded that the}} expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by supply shortages and by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels. Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties. The report's conclusions were regarded as <b>insipid</b> with no figures (political or military) heavily censured. The report of the Commission and information gathered by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Wine critics {{considered}} white Zinfandel to be <b>insipid</b> and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels {{have more}} fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, {{the success of}} this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own {{at the end of the}} 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in a different way.|$|E
5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of <b>insipid</b> taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E
5|$|Celtic's league title win in 1998 {{gave the}} club their first {{opportunity}} {{to compete in the}} rebranded UEFA Champions League in 1998–99. Two qualifying rounds had first to be negotiated, however. St Patrick's Athletic were knocked out, but Celtic were then paired up against a strong Croatia Zagreb side comprising several players who had helped Croatia to third place at the 1998 World Cup. The first leg took place in Glasgow amidst a row between Celtic players and the club bosses over bonuses. A Darren Jackson goal gave Celtic a 10 win to take over to Zagreb, but an <b>insipid</b> second leg performance in match dominated by Robert Prosinečki saw Celtic beaten 30 to go out on aggregate. Only a fine showing from Jonathan Gould in goal saved Celtic from a more emphatic defeat. The club dropped into the UEFA Cup. Portuguese side Vitória de Guimarães were defeated 21 in both legs in the first round, but Celtic crashed out in the second round against Zürich 53 on aggregate as a public row between captain Paul Lambert and managing director Jock Brown raged behind the scenes.|$|E
25|$|Passiflora tarminiana is {{cultivated}} for its edible fruit. It is {{the second}} most common species in cultivation in South America after P. tripartita var. mollissima and is considered more disease resistant than that species. The fruit are also eaten in New Zealand but in Hawaii the fruit is considered to be <b>insipid.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were {{tensions}} {{in the relationship between}} young Alice and her stepmother, who had known her husband's previous wife and made it clear that she regarded her predecessor as a beautiful, but <b>insipid,</b> childlike fool. Edith once angrily told her that if Alice Hathaway Lee had lived, she would have bored Theodore to death.|$|E
25|$|Banana Shpeel {{was plagued}} with misfortunes, {{including}} original cast members and show creators being {{removed from the}} project. Prominent Broadway actors, Michael Longoria and Annaleigh Ashford, were written out of the production, along with original composer Laurence O'Keefe. The show premiered to scathingly poor reviews from both amateur and professional critics, who found the show drenched in <b>insipid</b> humour and lacking in cohesion.|$|E
25|$|Pope {{takes this}} idea of the personified goddess of Dulness being at war with reason, {{darkness}} at war with light, and extends it to a full Aeneid parody. His poem celebrates a war, rather than a mere victory, and a process of ignorance, and Pope picks as his champion of all things <b>insipid</b> Lewis Theobald (1728 and '32) and Colley Cibber (1742).|$|E
25|$|If {{the subject}} of a Poem is obscure, or not {{generally}} known, or not interesting, and if it abounds with allusions, and facts of this improper, and uninteresting character, the writer who chuses the subject, and introduces those improper, and unaffecting allusions, and facts, betrays a great want of poetical judgment, and taste. Mr. Gray had a vitiated fondness for such <b>insipid</b> fable, narrative, and references.|$|E
25|$|The sand {{was washed}} from Broken Hill, and {{laid down in}} a bed that is about 200 metres thick. Currents washed through it, {{leaching}} {{out most of the}} minerals and leaving a very poor rock that made an <b>insipid</b> soil. They washed out channels in some places, while in others, the currents formed sand banks that show a characteristic current bedding or cross-bedding that can often be seen in cuttings.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{appears as}} a minor fictionalized {{character}} in Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory Series. When he and his band escape from a Nazi-like Confederacy, they enhance the <b>insipid</b> mainstream music of the North. A young Armstrong also {{appears as a}} minor fictionalized character in Patrick Neate's 2001 novel Twelve Bar Blues, part of which is set in New Orleans, and which was a winner at that year's Whitbread Book Awards.|$|E
25|$|Their {{meeting is}} the {{opposite}} of what he had hoped for in his dreams; she is unattractive (due to her weight and pallor), foolish, and <b>insipid.</b> After a sullen day, she slyly proposes marriage to him at dinner, as they believe they are the last man and the last woman on Mars. Gripp flees, driving across Mars to another tiny town to spend his life happily alone, avoiding all contact with Genevieve and ignoring any phone he hears ringing.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, aged 16, Tsvetaeva studied {{literary}} {{history at the}} Sorbonne. During this time, a major revolutionary change was occurring within Russian poetry: the flowering of the Russian Symbolist movement, and this movement was to colour most of her later work. It was not the theory which was to attract her, but the poetry and the gravity which writers such as Andrey Bely and Aleksandr Blok were capable of generating. Her own first collection of poems, Vecherny Albom (Evening Album), self-published in 1910, promoted her considerable reputation as a poet. It was well received, although her early poetry was held to be <b>insipid</b> compared to her later work. It {{attracted the attention of}} the poet and critic Maximilian Voloshin, whom Tsvetaeva described after his death in A Living Word About a Living Man. Voloshin came to see Tsvetaeva and soon became her friend and mentor.|$|E
500|$|In the {{classroom}} {{boys and girls}} are confronted with books that have <b>insipid</b> illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children... All feature abnormally courteous, unnaturally clean boys and girls.... In bookstores anyone can buy brighter, livelier books featuring strange and wonderful animals and children who behave naturally, i.e., sometimes misbehave... Given incentive from school boards, publishers could do as well with primers.|$|E
500|$|The {{mushroom}} is mild to moderately toxic, and {{may cause}} gastrointestinal upset if consumed. David Arora {{has noted that}} much of the bitter taste can be removed with cooking, but [...] "the end product is <b>insipid</b> at best and indigestible or even poisonous at worst." [...] Despite this, however, the mushroom is sold as an edible species in Phayao Province and Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported antirheumatic activity.|$|E
500|$|Holst's {{interest}} in Indian mythology, {{shared by many}} of his contemporaries, first became musically evident in the opera Sita (1901–06). During the opera's long gestation, Holst worked on other Indian-themed pieces. These included Maya (1901) for violin and piano, regarded by the composer and writer Raymond Head as [...] "an <b>insipid</b> salon-piece whose musical language is dangerously close to Stephen Adams". Then, through Vaughan Williams, Holst discovered and became an admirer of the music of Ravel, whom he considered a [...] "model of purity" [...] on the level with Haydn, another composer he greatly admired.|$|E
500|$|Actor {{and writer}} Kevin Murphy, who {{provides}} {{the voice and}} puppetry of Tom Servo in the series, spoke disparagingly about the film in the book Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, writing, [...] "One of my darkest fears is that I'll one day make my own film, my story, my direction, my own crystalline vision of something so universal, it must needs be shared with {{the world on the}} silver screen. And I make the movie, and it turns out like Gunslinger, or any other Corman film—turgid, <b>insipid,</b> clichéd, confusing, every opportunity for artistic expression intentionally ignored." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson's authors became {{increasingly}} frustrated with him {{towards the end}} of his life, Wakefield calling him [...] "heedless, <b>insipid,</b> [...] inactive" [...] and Lindsey describing him as [...] "a worthy and most honest man, but incorrigably [...] neglectful often to his own detriment". Priestley, by then in Pennsylvania, eventually broke off his forty-year relationship with the publisher, when his book orders were delayed several years and Johnson failed to communicate with him regarding the publication of his works. Most of the authors who became upset with Johnson were those writing religious or literary works, the riskiest publishing ventures.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers noted its general zaniness and praised its customization options. Critics thought the setting was <b>insipid</b> {{and that its}} humor occasionally fell flat, and others thought the game perfected the Saints Row formula. It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from GamesRadar and G4. A complete edition including the [...] was released {{a year after the}} original release, and its planned Enter the Dominatrix expansion became the game's sequel, Saints Row IV.|$|E
500|$|The {{female to}} the left has had as much care taken with her {{clothing}} {{as any of the}} Sibyls. Her skirt is turned back showing her linen petticoat and the garter that holds up her mauve stockings and cuts into the flesh. She has a reticule and her dress is laced up under the arms. On {{the other side of the}} tablet sits the only male figure among those on the lunettes who is intrinsically beautiful. This blonde young man, elegantly dressed in white shirt and pale green hose, with no jerkin but a red cloak, postures with an <b>insipid</b> and vain gesture, in contrast to the Ignudi which he closely resembles.|$|E
500|$|However, Leila Cobo of Billboard {{magazine}} was critical {{about the fact}} that some tracks do not add much to the originals, but the album [...] "stays merely pleasant, notably in 'Desafinado' and 'Manhã de Carnaval / Gentle Rain'." [...] On a negative review by Mike Quinn of JazzTimes stated that the album should be renamed [...] "Brazilian Nightmares" [...] a it is [...] "impossible to escape the <b>insipid</b> vocal stylings of the 'New York Voices' or the cliched horn arrangements that can be heard on bossa nova records going back as far as the '50s." [...] Quinn was also critical of the repertoire since [...] "Brazil has produced more music than the usual 20 or 30 tunes that keep getting led to the butcher's block." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{orchestra}} {{made its}} first British tour in 1905, conducted by Sir Edward Elgar. Elgar's conducting was highly praised; as to the orchestra, Ernest Newman wrote in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "Its brass and its wood-wind were seen to be of exceptional quality, but the strings, fine as they are, have not the substance nor the colour of the Hallé strings." [...] The following year the LSO played outside Britain for the first time, giving concerts in Paris, conducted by Edouard Colonne, Sir Charles Stanford and André Messager. Richard Morrison, in his centenary study of the LSO, writes of [...] "stodgy programmes of <b>insipid</b> Cowen, worthy Stanford, dull Parry and mediocre Mackenzie"; they put the Parisian public off to a considerable degree, and the players ended up out of pocket.|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's {{positive}} {{reviews and}} good box-office performance, it {{was unable to}} recover its large production costs; Vasan remade it in Hindi {{in an attempt to}} do so. The Hindi version, distributed by The Screens (a company in Bombay, now Mumbai), was released on 24 December 1948. With over 600 prints it was a commercial success, setting box-office records. Vasan called Chandralekha [...] "a pageant for our peasants", intended for [...] "the war-weary public that had been forced to watch <b>insipid</b> war propaganda pictures for years." [...] It was selected by the Indian government for screening at the fourth International Film Festival in Prague in 1949. The film's success made Madras a production centre for Hindi films. Five years after Chandralekha success, Gemini paid its employees a bonus (one of the first studios in the world to do so).|$|E
500|$|Alternative Press {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} {{four out of five}} stars, while The New York Times called it [...] "...one of the most {{progressive}} rap projects to be released in the past year." [...] JazzTimes magazine lauded Thornton's lyrics, writing that his [...] "...oddball excursions reach near-cinematic levels." [...] Pitchfork reviewer James P. Wisdom wrote that [...] "Dr. Octagonecologyst is a fun-house ride in hell. All of the expected norms of G-rap have been violently removed and replaced with a healthy dose of creative perversity. It's throbbing and wet, snickering at your hangups, laughing at your conventions." [...] Additionally, Melody Maker called it [...] "bloody essential" [...] and stated [...] "While commercial American hip hop is slithering into an <b>insipid</b> mire of soulless, identikit swingbeat, Dr. Octagon has made an album swathed in character [...] Get yer prescription fixed." ...|$|E
500|$|William E. Pike, in his 2003 {{article in}} The Numismatist about the coin, deems the design [...] "uninspired" [...] and {{complains}} that the low relief {{of the coin}} leaves it without sufficient detail. [...] Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers states {{that because of the}} shallow relief, [...] "newly minted coins had an <b>insipid</b> appearance. [...] Few if any observers called them attractive." [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule also complained about the relief, stating that it made the allegorical figures on the reverse [...] "seem like mounted cut-outs... the way the females are contoured to achieve their appearance of continents is a clever tour de force of calligraphic relief but an aesthetic monstrosity, a bad pun in art." [...] He had no more praise for the obverse, [...] "Adams, with his staring eye, is scarcely a portrait, and Monroe would not be recognized even by an expert." ...|$|E
500|$|AllGame editor Brett Alan Weiss's {{retrospective}} {{review was}} critical {{as he called}} Slalom [...] "a rush job" [...] that did not capture the spirit of skiing. He felt that the game was repetitive, too simple, and not fun for adults. Weiss described the graphics as blocky and <b>insipid,</b> the sound as repetitive and derivative. He said that {{even though it was}} an early release in the console's lifespan, Slalom was on par with the 1979 Intellivision's capabilities. He recommended Konami's Antarctic Adventure for the ColecoVision in its stead. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer wrote that the game received little fanfare. The magazine's Stuart Hunt wrote in December2010, on Rare's 25th anniversary, that the game was [...] "fun but quite simplistic" [...] in its lack of race variety. He said, though, that the game showcased how the company could maximize the system resources of the NES. Slalom was included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015.|$|E
500|$|... "Buenos Amigos" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. In his book Latin Sensations, Herón Márquez said the commercial success of [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] helped Selena become a household name among Latinos in the United States. Angie Chabram-Dernersesian said [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] was a [...] "hit single", while writing about Selena's collaborations in her book The Chicana/o Cultural Studies Reader. Suzanne Michele Bourgoin said the track was a [...] "breakthrough hit" [...] for Selena, in her book Encyclopedia of World Biography: Supplement AZ. Lorena Flores of The Dallas Morning News called [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] a [...] "classic". An editor from El Diario de Hoy said [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] is a [...] "romantic track". An editor from Onet.pl named [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] as one of Selena's biggest hits. Billboard magazine called it a [...] "pop ballad" [...] and said it became her first big hit single. Joe Nick Patoski called the recording [...] "a pretty if somewhat <b>insipid</b> ballad" [...] in his book about Selena's life.|$|E
500|$|Delius's first orchestral {{compositions}} were, in Christopher Palmer's words, {{the work}} of [...] "an <b>insipid</b> if charming water-colourist". The Florida Suite (1887, revised 1889) is [...] "an expertly crafted synthesis of Grieg and Negroid Americana", while Delius's first opera Irmelin (1890–92) lacks any identifiably Delian passages. Its harmony and modulation are conventional, and the work bears the clear fingerprints of Wagner and Grieg. Payne asserts {{that none of the}} works prior to 1895 are of lasting interest. The first noticeable stylistic advance is evident in Koanga (1895–97), with richer chords and faster harmonic rhythms; here we find Delius [...] "feeling his way towards the vein that he was soon to tap so surely". In Paris (1899), the orchestration owes a debt to Richard Strauss; its passages of quiet beauty, says Payne, nevertheless lack the deep personal involvement of the later works. Paris, the final work of Delius's apprentice years, is described by Foss as [...] "one of the most complete, if not the greatest, of Delius's musical paintings".|$|E
500|$|The garden planting, {{laid out}} within the former {{forecourt}} {{and in the}} slightly sunken grassed parterre square, {{was the work of}} Mrs Ellen Phelips, who lived at Montacute from the 1840s to her death in 1911, and her gardener, Mr Pridham, who had worked for her at Coker Court. The avenue of clipped yews that reinforces the slightly gappy mature avenue of trees stretching away from the outer walls of the former forecourt to end in fields, and the clipped yews that outline the grassed parterre date from that time, though the famous [...] "melted" [...] shape of the giant hedge was inspired by the effects of a freak snowfall in 1947. The sunken parterre garden design, with its Jacobean-style central fountain, designed by Robert Shekelton Balfour (1869–1942), is of 1894; Balfour's dated design is conserved in the library of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Mixed borders in the East court were replanted by Phyllis Reiss of Tintinhull in powerful hot colours when the earlier tender colour scheme laid down by Vita Sackville-West proved <b>insipid</b> to modern taste.|$|E
500|$|The song earned {{mixed reviews}} from critics. A staff of Tourdates.co.uk gave a {{favorable}} review commending Ribbons' vocal display. The reviewer added [...] " [...] often we are bombarded with wannabes [...] with weak vocals and <b>insipid</b> songs, [...] {{shows us that}} there is life after pop idol and with 'a little bit' of cred." [...] Music Week also gave a positive review, noting the song was [...] "catchy". However, Ian Hyland, writing for the Sunday Mirror was critical of the song, giving it a grade of 6 out of 10. He remarked that Ribbons [...] "fails" [...] at doing [...] "sexy R'n'B". Similarly, Julie MacCaskill of the Daily Record dismissed it as [...] "a lacklustre affair with the wannabe star ditching her Mariah sound- a-like singing in favour of becoming a Kylie clone". The single debuted at number nineteen on the UK Singles Chart, the week dated January 25, 2003. The position became its peak position. The following week, the song dropped to number thirty-seven and the week after exited the top forty.|$|E
500|$|The song's balladry {{was also}} {{a focal point for}} criticism. Writers from the London Evening Standard wrote that [...] "instead of {{sweeping}} you up all misty-eyed" [...] like their previously released ballad [...] "Too Lost in You", [...] "Caught in a Moment" [...] "drifts by a bit inconsequentially". The Observers Kitty Empire was unfavourable of the sound and mature nature of the song, questioning: [...] "Who wants Sugababes to grow up gracefully, into the mini-Gabrielle poses of songs like 'Caught in a Moment'?" [...] A writer from Virgin Media criticised the song's [...] "trudging" [...] balladry and its orchestral backdrop as bland, elaborating: [...] "For a band who've previously put out some genuinely edgy and confident pop, this is inexcusably forgettable". A critic from The Scotsman regarded [...] "Caught in a Moment" [...] as a mediocre filler track, while The Independents Simon Price considered it <b>insipid.</b> Anna Britten of Yahoo! Music rated the song five out of ten stars and wrote that it [...] "has all the standard features of your average MOR lady ballad".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a mixed review, {{giving the}} film {{three out of}} four stars despite {{complaining}} that the film [...] "recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was very critical of the film, calling it <b>insipid.</b> He wrote, [...] "Anne Fletcher directs Peter Chiarelli's script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion." [...] New York Times writer Manohla Dargis felt that Bullock's character was awkward in comparison to her previous work. She continued: [...] "She’s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel [...] and take the spotlight , an independence that persists {{all the way through the}} last-act coupling. She can smile as brightly at a man as well as the next leading lady, though, like all genuinely big female stars, she’s really more of a solo act." [...] The Telegraph Tim Robey expressed disappointment towards the film, giving it a two out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|Some {{analyses}} {{have examined}} the relationship between Marco and his father. Alison Lurie asserts that Marco's factual reply to his father {{at the end of the}} story says that [...] "it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults", a message that appears again in The Cat in the Hat. [...] To Matthew Pierlot, [...] "The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth", a Socrates-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something more exciting than it is. [...] To Patrick Shannon, [...] "Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the <b>insipid</b> character and conformity of the adult world". [...] In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of Maurice Sendak and William Steig; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader.|$|E
