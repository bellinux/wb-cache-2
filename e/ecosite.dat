40|$|The <b>ecosite</b> unit in Ontario’s {{boreal forest}} {{ecological}} land classification system is a polygon of common vegetation type and soil conditions intended to provide a standardized provincial framework to inform meso-scale forestry and planning applications. To determine whether the physical factors used for <b>ecosite</b> classification relate to patterns in ecological function over finer spatial scales, we examined 14 soil properties in replicate boreal forest plots representing eight mineral soil <b>ecosite</b> classes and three organic soil <b>ecosite</b> classes in the Hearst Forest. Despite large differences in vegetation composition, we found few statistically significant differences in properties when compared for individual classes or for more general groupings based on vegetation type and soil texture or expected fertility status. However, some properties (soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N ratio) were approaching significance in the 0 – 10 cm depth increment, and there were distinct differences between organic soil and mineral soil sites. Overall, these results suggest few explicit links between ecosystem function and <b>ecosite</b> class at this scale of measurement, highlighting the potential importance of non-steady-state relationships between vegetation species and soil properties in disturbed forests and the potential need for finer-scale characterization to capture patterns in ecosystem function...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{planning}} {{to optimize the}} forest value chain requires accurate and detailed information about the resource; however, estimates {{of the distribution of}} fibre properties on the landscape are largely unavailable prior to harvest. Our objective was to fit a model of the tree-level average fibre length related to <b>ecosite</b> classification and other forest inventory variables depicted at the landscape scale. A series of black spruce increment cores were collected at breast height from trees in nine different <b>ecosite</b> groups within the boreal forest of northeastern Ontario, and processed using standard techniques for maceration and fibre length measurement. Regression tree analysis and random forests were used to fit hierarchical classification models and find the most important predictor variables for the response variable area-weighted mean stem-level fibre length. <b>Ecosite</b> group was the best predictor in the regression tree. Longer mean fibre-length was associated with more productive ecosites that supported faster growth. The explanatory power of the model of fitted data was good; however, random forests simulations indicated poor generalizability. These results suggest the potential to develop localized models linking wood fibre length in black spruce to landscape-level attributes, and improve the sustainability of forest management by identifying ideal locations to harvest wood that has desirable fibre characteristics...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMapping of oil {{reserves}} {{involves the use}} of seismic lines (linear disturbances) to determine both their location and extent. Conventional clearing techniques for seismic assessment have left a legacy of linear disturbances that cause habitat fragmentation. Little is known, however, about how local and landscape factors affect natural regeneration patterns of trees and shrubs on seismic lines that facilitate mapping and future projections of regeneration patterns. To understand factors affecting early forest regeneration and to predict future trends in regeneration of legacy seismic lines we used LiDAR, forest stand databases and a disturbance inventory of conventional seismic lines to model seismic line regeneration to a 3 m height in a 1806 km 2 area in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Regeneration to 3 m was inversely related to terrain wetness, line width, proximity to roads (as a proxy for human use of lines), and the lowland <b>ecosites.</b> Overall, terrain wetness and the presence of fen <b>ecosites</b> had the strongest negative effect on regeneration patterns; the wettest sites failed to recover even after 50 years post-disturbance. Predictions of future regeneration rates on existing lines suggested that approximately one-third of existing linear disturbance footprints in this boreal landscape will remain un-regenerated 50 years later resulting in persistent habitat fragmentation. Model predictions estimating regeneration probability are particularly valuable for estimating current and future forest regeneration trajectories on linear disturbances which are a conservation concern and a focus for restoration and planning by government, industry and conservation organizations...|$|R

The crowding index was the superior index for most species and ecosites. However, distance-independent in-dices, such as basal area of competing trees, were also effective. Distance-dependent light estimation indices, which estimate the fraction of seasonal photosynthetically-active radiation available to each tree, ranked intermediate to low. Determining separate competition indices for each competitor species accounted for more variation than ignoring species or classifying by ecological groups.

40|$|Preservation of {{ecological}} integrity and ecosystem diversity are guiding principles {{in the planning}} and managing of parks and protected areas. The measurement of biodiversity at the site-level is often used as the primary means of assessing success of our landscape-level management strategies. While there are many indices of biodiversity in common use (e. g. Richness, Shannon’s, Simpson’s), they are all influenced by the spatial scale over which measurements are made and the sample effort used in data collection. This raises serious concerns about calculating diversity statistics, in particular estimators that incorporate richness, from conservation datasets where site-level data is often of varying quality. However, the familiar diversity statistics are only a subset of possible moments from an underlying generalized information function (the Renyi entropy function) that is less sensitive to richness at higher order moments. In this paper, we examine the use of generalized entropy for incorporating site-level biodiversity data within a GIS decision support system (DSS). The foundation of the DSS consists of land cover units based on <b>ecosites</b> at a scale of 10 – 100 ha spatially delineated using enduring abiotic features (soil and landform) as well as biotic components (species composition and pattern).

A survey was conducted at 48 to 96 households. Informal seed supply was the only system in Jumla and Kaski and formal system existed only in Bara. The main sources of seed were farmer’s own saved seed (67 - 91 %), seed from neighbors and relatives. Exchange of germplasm was the main basis of fulfillment from other sources. All farmers obtained seed from their own village, while farmers introduced materials occasionally from outside village. Most of the farmers followed seed selection before or after crop harvest. Rice field selection and plant selection based on a fixed set of criteria was the common practice. Non lodged plants with more grain per panicle, bold grains, well-matured and uniform plants, long panicle, true to type, good looking grains, free from diseases and insects were the main rice seed selection criteria.

Context Reclamation criteria have been developed with an understanding that post-reclamation land use will be similar to pre-disturbance conditions. Successful reclamation of forested landscapes will involve the establishment of native vegetation representative of the disturbed <b>ecosite(s).</b> Successful reclamation of peatland and/or native grassland will involve the re-establishment of site conditions and vegetation species indicative of the anticipated land use. These criteria assess {{the development of the}} site along the trajectory towards the target community. To properly assess the effectiveness of reclamation practices on exploration sites three different criteria need to be evaluated. These criteria include landscape, vegetation and soils. Landscape and vegetation must be assessed on all sites and site access roads, but soil assessment is only required on sites where surface and/or soil disturbance has occurred. In addition to ground-truthing all soil-disturbed sites (i. e., soils stripped, compacted, rutted or other soil structure alterations), ten per cent (10 %) of the remaining sites within the exploration program must be ground-truthed to verify aerial assessment. It is also important that when sites are assessed for reclamation, the assessor should give attention to access roads as these may have suffered more damage than the exploration site itself...|$|R

Morphological variation for the fourteen qualitative characters that showed two or more phenotypic classes were estimated using the Shanon–Weaver diversity index (H).

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences between characters within all classifying variables and this contributed to the largest portion of the total variance. Cluster analysis based on ordinal variables grouped the landraces into five clusters. A higher proportion of landraces sharing similar altitude classes and similar ecosites were grouped together. Panicle compactness and shape as well as stalk juiciness were the predominant characters in grouping the landraces into their respective clusters.

40|$|Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are a {{threatened}} species in Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s boreal forest. Caribou require habitat that supports appropriate forage, including {{large areas of}} lichen rich forests. This research examines two dynamics that influence woodland caribou habitat in northwestern Ontario. These dynamics are forest fires and land use policies. The effects of forest fires are assessed quantitatively at both the <b>ecosite</b> and landscape scales within Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. Land use policy and management activities are evaluated using a case study and a policy analysis of protected area and forest management approaches to woodland caribou conservation in this region. Forest fires in Woodland Caribou Provincial Park exert tremendous influence on woodland caribou habitat. However, they vary significantly in their ecological effects and return intervals. Fire severity {{plays an important role}} in determining both structure and composition of forest communities, shaping forest openings, duff characteristics, and how terrestrial lichen (an important food source for woodland caribou) recolonize an area after a burn. Results show that the amount of terrestrial lichen able to regenerate varies depending upon canopy openness and duff accumulation on V 30 sites within Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. The amount of area burned within the park (measured by decade) in the 20 th century varied dramatically from 319 ha in the 1950 ’s to over 106, 000 ha in the 1980 ’s. These variations in site characteristics and stands of suitable ages have important implications for management and policy development. Forests suitable for woodland caribou habitat in this portion of Ontario are not in equilibrium. Land use policies intended to conserve caribou in this region must incorporate concepts of non-equilibrium forest dynamics. Management and policy development related to the conservation of woodland caribou is largely absent in Ontario Parks, due to a lack of information and limited strategic vision. The Forest Division of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources is making significant strides towards sustainable management of forests, but silvicultural constraints imposed by the sustained yield paradigm are limiting the management prescriptions attempting to mimic natural disturbances. Fire management continues to be problematic in both jurisdictions, as the cost of ecologically oriented management remains very high. Moreover, concepts of non-equilibrium forest dynamics have not been integrated into any land use management prescription, further limiting forest fire management. Adaptive management that integrates the complexity of this ecosystem at multiple spatial and temporal scales is necessary for effective long-term conservation of woodland caribou habitat in northwestern Ontario...|$|E

Vegetative characteristics affect productivity in birds {{for a variety of reasons}} (e. g., predator assemblages, nesting sites, song perches, food availability). I investigated the relationship between habitat quality and prey availability and the effect these parameters have on reproductive success in golden-cheeked warblers (Dendroica chrysoparia). My objectives were to 1) determine any differences in pairing and fledging success of warbler territories within two <b>ecosites</b> exhibiting two distinctive tree species composition 2) explore the relationship between tree species composition, arthropod density, and foraging effort, and the effect these parameters have on reproductive success in golden-cheeked warblers and 3) investigate the connection between preferred foraging substrates and changes in arthropod abundance within golden-cheeked warbler territories throughout the breeding season. I mapped individual warbler territories and searched for fledglings, observed foraging behavior, and collected arthropods in each territory to determine productivity, foraging effort, and food availability. I conducted these methods over two seasons in juniper-oak woodlands on Fort Hood, north-central Texas within 347 territories of two vegetative types: those marked by the predominance of post oak (Quercus stellata) and those marked by the predominance of Texas oak (Quercus buckleyi). Pairing and fledging success of territories differed substantially between the two vegetative types. Movement rates differed considerably between the two vegetative types, indicating a difference in prey encounter rate. Foraging data indicated a clear switch in preferred foraging substrates from oak species early in the breeding season, to Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) in mid-May. Arthropod sampling revealed a correlation between preferred foraging substrates and arthropod density. Results suggested that Texas oak was an important foraging substrate for golden-cheeked warblers, and territories that lack this tree species generally did not succeed in fledging young. My study can be used to indicate areas that should be targeted for conservation by local, state, and federal government because they provide high quality habitat based on warbler productivity...|$|R
40|$|Ecosystems are {{disturbed}} {{to extract}} {{synthetic crude oil}} from the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) in northern Alberta, Canada. Successful reclamation of mined oil sands sites depends on maximizing water storage and minimizing the potential for erosion. Soil water repellency in the AOSR affects undisturbed sites and consequently reclamation materials. Extreme water repellency may lead to low infiltration rates and hinder reclamation. There {{is a lack of}} information about the naturally occurring and pre-existing levels of soil water repellency in the AOSR. Thus, questions arise about the degree of naturally occurring water repellency and the potential for severe water repellency in reclamation soils. Studies were conducted on nine sites in the AOSR in the summers of 2008 and 2009. A range of undisturbed and reclaimed sites, as well as mineral and organic reclamation materials were examined. Five undisturbed Jack Pine stands (classified as A <b>ecosites),</b> four reclaimed sites and reclamation materials including mineral soil, peat and leaf and lichen covering the forest floor (LFH) were studied. For a comparison of methods, one grasslands site in central Saskatchewan was included. Mini and standard tension infiltrometers were compared as a means of measuring soil water repellency index (RI). There was strong variability in RI values between the infiltrometer methods. The mean RI values from the mini infiltrometers were higher than from the standard infiltrometer (9. 61 and 3. 46, respectively). The variability within sites dominated the variability in RI for the two methods. Despite these obvious trends, RI values between infiltrometer sizes were statistically different for only two individual sites. Increasing the number of sampling points in the second field season did not reduce the variability. The simpler, less expensive mini infiltrometer is as effective as the standard infiltrometer in measuring soil water repellency. This will enable more efficient and extensive monitoring of soil water repellency in reclaimed and undisturbed sites in the AOSR. Soil water repellency of reclaimed and undisturbed sites was investigated in situ using RI, the water droplet penetration time (WDPT) test, and the molarity of ethanol droplet (MED) test. These measures showed similar trends. Variability in soil water repellency was high at both reclaimed and undisturbed sites. The average RI value for the surface of reclaimed sites was higher than that of the subsurface at reclaimed sites; however, there were no statistical differences between RI values of surface reclaimed and undisturbed sites (P = 0. 213) due to high spatial variability. The critical water content (CWC) of reclamation materials was determined by measuring the contact angle (CA) and WDPT. Generally, CA and WDPT were inversely related to water content, though variability was high and the relationship between water content was weak. The clearest relationship between water repellency and water content was present for the mineral soil samples. Reclaimed mineral soil was generally wettable above gravimetric water contents of 5 - 10 %, while the coarse textured tarball affected materials were only subcritically water repellent. There was no relationship between water repellency and water content for peat and LFH. The degree of water repellency was statistically higher for peat materials with increasing decomposition levels. The average WDPT was 44, 128 and 217 s for fibric, mesic, and humic peat, respectively. With careful management and monitoring, water repellency may not be a major limitation to reclamation success. The mini tension infiltrometer is an effective method for monitoring soil water repellency in the AOSR...|$|R
40|$|Ce travail a porté sur l'application du lagunage anaérobie pour le {{traitement}} primaire des eaux résiduaires urbaines sous climat méditerranéen. Il a été réalisé sur les lagunes anaérobies de l' <b>Ecosite</b> de Mèze (Hérault, France). Les lagunes anaérobies constituent un traitement primaire satisfaisant avec des rendements moyens de 55 % pour les MES et 30 % pour la DBO 5, pour une faible emprise au sol. Le taux d'accumulation des boues est de seulement 0, 017 m 3 /EH. an, notamment du fait de l'efficacité de la dégradation anaérobie. L'équilibre du métabolisme anaérobie des boues est atteint après un an de fonctionnement. L'accumulation des boues se fait alors de façon saisonnière avec une forte accumulation en hiver et une digestion du stock en été. Cette évolution est liée à l'influence de la température sur la méthanogénèse. La production de biogaz (83 % CH 4) a pu être mesurée par des collecteurs à gaz mis au point pour cette étude et dépend également fortement de la température. Le bilan du carbone {{montre que}} 74 % du carbone organique épuré est converti en CH 4, 13 % en carbone inorganique dissous et seulement 15 % est stocké dans les boues. Toutefois, les lagunes anaérobies présentent un risque de créer des nuisances olfactives dues à l'émission de H 2 S. This project examined {{the application of}} anaerobic ponds for the primary treatment of urban wastewater under a Mediterranean climate. The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine removal performances and to study sludge accumulation and the production of biogas. Together, these results allowed us to calculate the carbon mass balance in the anaerobic ponds. This work was carried out in the two large primary anaerobic ponds of the waste stabilization pond system at the <b>Ecosite</b> of Mèze (Hérault, France), treating domestic wastewater for 13, 800 person-equivalents (PE). Anaerobic ponds were 5, 000 m 3 in volume, 3. 1 m in depth and presented a retention time of 4. 6 d with a mean volumetric organic loading of 83 g BOD 5 /m 3 ×d× The characteristics of the influent and effluent (including: suspended solids (SS); chemical oxygen demand (COD); biological oxygen demand (BOD 5); bicarbonate (HCO 3 -); total organic carbon (TOC); and volatile fatty acids (VFA)) were determined twice-monthly. The volume of sludge and its characteristics (including: SS; volatile solids (VS); TOC; and VFA) were measured monthly. The production of biogas and its composition (CH 4, CO 2, H 2 S) were measured with gas collectors specially developed for this study. Results showed that the anaerobic ponds constituted a good primary treatment with mean removal rates of 55 % for SS, 30 % for BOD and 22 % for COD. Removal performances were relatively constant over the year. Indeed, removal rates were essentially due to the removal of particulate organic matter by sedimentation. Anaerobic degradation occurred essentially in the sludge layer and the removal of soluble COD was low. The study of sludge characteristics showed that anaerobic digestion equilibrium was reached after one year of operation. The beginning of methanogenesis could be observed by the decrease in the concentration of volatile fatty acids. The accumulation of sludge showed seasonal variation with an important accumulation in winter and the digestion of the accumulated stock in summer. This evolution could be related to the influence of temperature on methanogenesis. The mean rate of sludge accumulation was only 3. 8 g SS/P-E×d or 0. 017 m 3 /P-E×yr. This rate was significantly lower than for the primary settling tank (50 - 60 g SS/P-E×d) and for the facultative ponds (0. 085 m 3 /P-E×yr) due to the intensive anaerobic degradation. The production of biogas was measured by gas collectors specially developed for this study. The biogas contained essentially CH 4 (83 %); CO 2 was less than 4 % because it dissolved in the water column and was converted into bicarbonate alkalinity. The concentration of H 2 S was less than 1 % (between 75 and 4770 ppm) but was the cause of unpleasant odours. The biogas production rate was strongly dependent on temperature. A non-linear relationship was obtained (Ebiogas= 4. 8451 × e 0. 1203 T, r 2 = 0. 92, n= 16). The mean annual biogas production rate was calculated to be 49 L/m 2 ×d. Seasonal variation in the biogas production rate could be related to seasonal variations in sludge accumulation. The carbon mass balance showed that 74 % of the removed organic carbon was converted into CH 4, 13 % into dissolved inorganic carbon (bicarbonates) and only 15 % was stored in sludge. The mass balance was well equilibrated and did not show the entry of atmospheric CO 2, which occurs in aerobic ponds where CO 2 is used by algae to produce their cell biomass. In an anaerobic pond, the low production of sludge was due to the efficiency of the anaerobic degradation but also to the low internal biomass production. To conclude, the use of a primary anaerobic pond was advantageous and permitted a reduction in the required surface area for a waste stabilization pond system. This process produced effluent for secondary treatment in a facultative pond with essentially the removal of the particulate organic matter.

40|$|Natural coarse {{textured}} soils {{comprise a}} significant portion (approximately 20 %) of the area to be mined at Suncor, Syncrude (aurora mine), Albian/Shell, and CNRL mines in the Alberta’s oil sands (Macyk, 2006). Although similar in soil textural classifications, the undisturbed areas support a range of <b>ecosite</b> types which exhibit different moisture regimes, suggesting that there are natural mechanisms controlling the plant available water sufficient for forest development. The global objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential for textural variability to enhance water storage in coarse textured soil. The observations of the infiltration and drainage behaviour of natural and reclaimed coarse-texture soils in this study have demonstrated that this potential exists and can be applied in reclamation design to achieve the ranges of soil water storage needed to establish different ecosites. Field based infiltration and drainage testing, pit excavation and sampling have been completed on 14 sites (7 natural and 7 reclaimed). Bulk saturated hydraulic conductivity and field capacity were estimated for each of the 14 sites based on the field test results. The observed transient water dynamics give an indication of the effect of layering on these material properties. Laboratory analysis of water content (650 samples), particle size (650 samples), water retention (35 samples), organic carbon (100 samples) as well as calibration of field instrumentation were completed on a large number of samples (approximate values shown in brackets above) across all sites. The laboratory analysis was used to characterize textural variability (mean and standard deviation of the particle diameter) for the layered sites and estimate the soil water retention curve (SWRC) relationships for the range of soil textures encountered at the study sites. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were used to investigate if there were significant differences in the residual sum of squares between estimated and measured SWRCs. The measured organic carbon was used to aid in estimating permanent wilting point (WP) used in the calculation of the available water holding capacity (AWHC) of all profiles. An investigation into the calibration of the moisture capacitance probe (MCP) was undertaken as part of a comparison of the measured and simulated volumetric water content (VWC) profiles. Water storage at the cessation of drainage was related to the soil texture and textural variability as measured in the laboratory. Sites with more textural variability generally stored more water for plant use. There appeared to be a limit to what can be considered ‘useful’ textural variability. If adjacent soil layers had too extreme a contrast in texture and therefore hydraulic conductivity, unstable/preferential flow (i. e. bypassing of some of the water and nutrients from plant roots) occurred. The total porosity calculated from field samples was often higher than the maximum measured VWC in each layer which may be indicative of one or more factors that resulted in less than full saturation being attained within the targeted 1 m depth of saturation during the test. Some of these factors include: errors in sampling leading to an overestimate of total porosity; lateral flow along textural interfaces; air entrapment within the rapidly advancing wetting front; unstable/preferential flow as a result of the high contrast in hydraulic conductivity (fine over coarse) between adjacent layers (i. e. Ks Ratio > 20) or where tests were conducted on slopes (i. e. funnel flow). This latter case was common at the reclaimed sites. A modelling study of one uniform (SV 10) and one layered (NLFH 1) natural site was conducted. The models were built by incorporating soil properties of the layers in the various soil profiles as estimated from field and/or laboratory testing. This study offers a comparison between various PTFs and their ability to capture the soil-water storage/dynamics during infiltration and drainage testing. The Arya PTF gave a better estimation of the laboratory measured SWRCs. However, when modeling the measured infiltration and drainage testing for the relatively uniform site SV 10, the Arya PTF and Modified Kovacs (MK) PTF performed similarly. The Arya PTF performing slightly better for the infiltration phase and the MK PTF performing slightly better for the drainage phase. Both PTFs gave a reasonable estimation of water storage but the MK PTF gave a better estimation of the water storage with time as compared to the Arya PTF. For the highly layered site NLFH 1, neither model performed well. The Arya PTF gave a substantially better estimation of the infiltration phase and gave the better estimation of the magnitude of water storage with time, the MK PTF performed marginally better for the drainage phase and gave a better estimation of the shape of the water storage with time. Generally, the study showed that the replication of the profile water storage requirements for the layered natural ecosites (‘b’ and ‘d’ ecosites) has been achieved and can be achieved by layering (or even mixing) available coarse textured reclamation materials. This study has indicated that replicating the highly uniform ecosites (‘a’ ecosites) is where the bigger challenge lies in reclamation. Reclaiming with a diversity of target ecosites is essential to achieving the pre-disturbance land capability standard that the mine operators are bound by. The temptation may exist to simply condone reclamation that has met or exceeded the pre-exisiting land capability. However, problems with ground water recharge and regional water distribution are likely to arise if large areas of lower functioning ecosites are replaced with higher functioning ecosites...|$|E
