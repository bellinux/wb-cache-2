When cylinders are filled with gas quickly, typically in 10 to 60 minutes at a dive filling station, the gas inside gets hot, which increases the pressure of the gas relative to its mass. When the cylinder cools, the gas pressure falls resulting in a reduced volume of breathable gas available to the diver.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} advance made in {{the early}} 19th century was developing a technique to remove the sediment caused by dead yeast after the secondary fermentation. Early Champagne producers chose not to remove the sediment, which left the wine cloudy and prone to off flavors if the sediment was shaken up or poured into the glass. At royal courts and banquets, servers would pour new serving of Champagne into a fresh glass to avoid the residue of sediment left over in the previous glass. To remove the sediments, some producers would <b>decant</b> the wine by pouring it a new bottle. However this process caused {{a considerable amount of}} carbon dioxide gas to escape and the resulting wine was noticeably less bubbly. With the aid of her cellar master, Madame Clicquot of the Champagne house Veuve Cliquot developed the process of riddling in the early 19th century {{to solve the problem of}} sediments without losing much gas. This technique, which involves collecting the sediment in the neck of the bottle and using the pressure of the wine to eject just the sediment, led to the popularity of adding sugar-sweet dosage to replace the wine lost during riddling. The Russians, in particular, were fans of very sweet Champagne and Veuve Cliquot was able to tailor the sweetness level of their wines for their customers by the composition of their dosage. At first the house of Veuve Cliquot tried to keep this technique of riddling a secret but by the late 1820s the secret was out and Champagne houses were settling up production lines for riddling. In 1854, the French national railroad system linked Reims with the rest of the country, including its coastal ports. From that point on, Champagne was connected to its worldwide market and sales grew by leaps and bounds. During the 1850s production was averaging 20 million bottles a year.|$|E

Many wine writers, such as author Karen MacNeil in the book The Wine Bible, advocate <b>decanting</b> {{for the purposes of}} aeration, especially with very tannic wines like Barolo, Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon, Port, and Rhône wines while noting that <b>decanting</b> could be harmful for more delicate wines like Chianti and Pinot noir.|$|R
40|$|Transport of {{fuel from}} distillation/storage plant to {{different}} parts of the world has always been challenging task for Engineers. Different methods have been proposed over the time for transporting fuel efficiently and at low cost which include Marine vessels, Pipelines, Rail Cars and Trucks. In order to transport useful amount of fuel in a reasonably sized tank, we have to liquefy it. While few fuels are easy to liquefy there are great number of fuels which liquefy only under extreme pressure/temperature conditions. Methane has a boiling point of - 161. 7 °C at atmospheric pressure which means it has to be cooled to a much lower temperature in order to turn it into to liquid that can be stored in a tank. In short, Methane is not stored in household tanks because it is hard to liquefy. So large carbon epoxy fiber tanks were developed to transport Methane around the world in gaseous state at high pressures. But when the tank <b>decanting</b> was done in places where ambient temperatures were well below 0 °C, it was found that ideal conditions for Methane liquefaction were formed. Gaseous Methane has to lose a lot of energy to liquefy which means that liquid Methane would be much colder than its gaseous counterpart. Now the liquid Methane would cool the tank walls more rapidly than its gaseous counterpart present in the tank and thus this difference in temperature would impart additional thermal stresses on the tank walls. These thermal stresses are result of uneven contraction/expansion of the tank walls and may lead to crack formation in the wall surface which we intend to avoid in all circumstances. The present study is concentrated in identifying different tank <b>decanting</b> conditions where there may arise favorable conditions for liquid Methane formation. Tank <b>decanting</b> simulations were performed for different system temperatures ranging from - 50 °C to 20 °C and flow rates of 0. 064 kg/s, 0. 11975 kg/s and 0. 3 kg/s respectively were selected for each system temperature. A similar study on Biogas tank <b>decanting</b> was performed and different system conditions were identified where possibility of liquefaction arouse within the tank. Through the tank <b>decanting</b> study carried out on Methane and biogas fuels, few <b>decanting</b> conditions were identified where there was a possibility of liquefaction within the tank. If the <b>decanting</b> was continued from these points of liquefaction, the tank walls would experience immense thermal stresses and there may arise a point where cracking in the tank wall takes place. The tank <b>decanting,</b> either has to be stopped or the <b>decanting</b> flow rate should be reduced further at these points. As the <b>decanting</b> flow rate is reduced the tank wall would have enough time to pump heat into the system and thus avoiding liquefaction within the tank. This process can continue only until the tank wall temperature and the fuel temperature within the tank reaches equilibrium or the fuel temperature reaches its critical point, whichever comes earlier. After this, <b>decanting</b> has to be stopped because any further temperature drop would result in liquefaction which has to be avoided under any circumstances as this would in turn result in tank liner failure.
