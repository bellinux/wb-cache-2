5|$|<b>Indium</b> {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some <b>indium</b> compounds, such as <b>indium</b> {{antimonide}} and <b>indium</b> phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. <b>Indium</b> is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper <b>indium</b> gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. <b>Indium</b> is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, <b>indium</b> does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. <b>Indium</b> tin oxide and <b>indium</b> phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic <b>indium,</b> though hydrated <b>indium</b> oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of <b>indium</b> introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. <b>Indium</b> compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of <b>indium</b> is about two weeks in humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolIn and atomic number 49. It is a post-transition metal {{that makes up}} 0.21parts per million of the Earth's crust. Very soft and malleable, <b>indium</b> has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium and tin. Chemically, <b>indium</b> is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two {{in terms of its}} properties. <b>Indium</b> was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods. They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. <b>Indium</b> was isolated the next year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of <b>indium</b> tin oxide (ITO) on glass. <b>Indium</b> has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which <b>indium</b> compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} <b>indium,</b> 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, <b>indium</b> becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, <b>indium</b> crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal crystal {{system in the}} space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each <b>indium</b> atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). <b>Indium</b> displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However {{it does have a}} size effect in bending and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E
5|$|Copper <b>indium</b> gallium {{selenide}} is {{a material}} used in solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{reaction}} of <b>indium</b> with the pnictogens produces the gray or semimetallic III–V semiconductors. Many of them slowly decompose in moist air, necessitating careful storage of semiconductor compounds to prevent {{contact with the}} atmosphere. <b>Indium</b> nitride is readily attacked by acids and alkalis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> {{is one of}} many {{substitutes}} for mercury in alkaline batteries to prevent the zinc from corroding and releasing hydrogen gas. <b>Indium</b> is added to some dental amalgam alloys to decrease the surface tension of the mercury and allow for less mercury and easier amalgamation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> wire {{is used as}} {{a vacuum}} seal and a thermal {{conductor}} in cryogenics and ultra-high-vacuum applications, in such manufacturing applications as gaskets that deform to fill gaps. <b>Indium</b> is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of <b>indium</b> with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators.|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and <b>indium</b> {{tin oxide}} (ITO) {{are used as}} a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. <b>Indium</b> tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} <b>indium</b> production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of <b>indium</b> at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of <b>indium</b> will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average <b>indium</b> price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of <b>indium</b> contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of <b>indium</b> is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{are used}} in lighting, lasers, and {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs). Flat panel displays incorporate a thin film of electrically conducting <b>indium</b> tin oxide. Fluorescent lighting relies on mercury vapour for its operation. Ruby lasers generate deep red beams by exciting chromium atoms; the lanthanides are also extensively employed in lasers. Gallium, <b>indium,</b> and arsenic; and copper, iridium, and platinum {{are used in}} LEDs (the latter three in organic LEDs).|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when <b>indium</b> is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, <b>indium</b> is able to wet glass. Like both, <b>indium</b> has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, <b>indium</b> accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> metal {{does not}} react with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. <b>Indium</b> is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} thermally unstable, in concordance {{with the}} trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and <b>indium</b> compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like <b>indium,</b> thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5|$|The primary {{consumption}} of <b>indium</b> worldwide is LCD production. Demand rose rapidly {{from the late}} 1990s to 2010 with the popularity of LCD computer monitors and television sets, which now account for 50% of <b>indium</b> consumption. Increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling (especially in Japan) maintain a balance between demand and supply. According to the UNEP, indium's end-of-life recycling rate is less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|A few non-essential {{heavy metals}} have been {{observed}} to have biological effects. Gallium, germanium (a metalloid), <b>indium,</b> and most lanthanides can stimulate metabolism, and titanium promotes growth in plants (though {{it is not always}} considered a heavy metal).|$|E
5|$|<b>Indium</b> {{is created}} by the {{long-lasting}} (up to thousands of years) s-process (slow neutron capture) in low-to-medium-mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 solar masses). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope that comprises approximately half of all silver in existence) catches a neutron, it undergoes a beta decay to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one. The stable <b>indium</b> isotope, indium-113, {{is one of the}} p-nuclei, the origin of which is not fully understood; although indium-113 is known to be made directly in the s- and r-processes (rapid neutron capture), and also as the daughter of very long-lived cadmium-113, which has a half-life of about eight quadrillion years, this cannot account for all indium-113.|$|E
5|$|Indium's high neutron-capture {{cross-section}} for thermal neutrons {{makes it}} {{suitable for use}} in control rods for nuclear reactors, typically in an alloy of 80% silver, 15% <b>indium,</b> and 5% cadmium. In nuclear engineering, the (n,n') reactions of 113In and 115In are used to determine magnitudes of neutron fluxes.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to <b>indium</b> in the {{workplace}} by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E
5|$|The known {{isotopes}} of cadmium {{range in}} atomic mass from 94.950 u (95Cd) to 131.946 u (132Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary decay mode is electron capture and the dominant decay product is element 47 (silver). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through beta emission producing element 49 (<b>indium).</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{chelator}} for binding a radioisotope can be attached. Pendetide, {{a derivative}} of pentetic acid, {{is used for}} example in capromab pendetide to chelate indium-111. If the drug contains a radioisotope, {{the name of the}} isotope precedes the name of the antibody. Consequently, <b>indium</b> (111In) capromab pendetide is the name for the above example including indium-111.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium-doped ZnO layers {{are used}} as {{transparent}} electrodes. The constituents Zn and Al are much cheaper and less toxic compared to the generally used <b>indium</b> tin oxide (ITO). One application which {{has begun to be}} commercially available is the use of ZnO as the front contact for solar cells or of liquid crystal displays.|$|E
5|$|Among other achievements, Bachelder {{developed}} {{methods for}} the purification {{of the rare}} elements tellurium and <b>indium.</b> Other aspects of her broad scientific expertise found application {{in the field of}} marine archaeology, when she determined the chemical composition of brass cannons found in the Aegean Sea on sunken ships. She also made contributions to astrochemistry, when NASA asked her to analyze the chemistry of Moon rocks which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|Gallium {{arsenide}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of optoelectronic infrared devices. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and <b>indium</b> gallium nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E
5|$|Gallium is {{predominantly}} used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive gallium nitride and <b>indium</b> gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers. Gallium is also used {{in the production of}} artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus {{reviewed the}} definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, <b>indium,</b> and osmium (too rare).|$|E
5|$|Some {{heavy metals}} are either {{essential}} nutrients (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc), or relatively harmless (such as ruthenium, silver, and <b>indium),</b> {{but can be}} toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining, tailings, industrial wastes, agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, paints and treated timber.|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{tends to}} oxidize to the +3 and +1 {{oxidation}} states as ionic salts. The +3 state {{resembles that of}} the other elements in group 13 (boron, aluminium, gallium, <b>indium).</b> However, the +1 state, which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of alkali metals, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K+) by ion pumps in living cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney failure and {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed {{over a period of}} two months to three years). Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory failure and death. <b>Indium</b> salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element <b>indium,</b> from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group. Nihonium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, <b>indium,</b> and thallium, and behave as a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. Unlike all the other p-block elements, it may be able to involve its d-electrons in bonding, although these predictions are disputed.|$|E
5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an atomic radius of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} thallium, even though periodic trends would predict it to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, but have been calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, <b>indium,</b> and thallium, following periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium has one stable isotope, rhenium-185, which {{nevertheless}} {{occurs in}} minority abundance, a situation {{found only in}} two other elements (<b>indium</b> and tellurium). Naturally occurring rhenium is only 37.4% 185Re, and 62.6% 187Re, which is unstable but has a very long half-life (≈1010 years). This lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of rhenium atom. decay of fully ionized 187Re: 187Re-187Os Cosmochronometry|date=1996|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=77|issue=26|pages=5190–5193|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5190|bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5190B|pmid=10062738}} The beta decay of 187Re is used for rhenium-osmium dating of ores. The available energy for this beta decay (2.6 keV) {{is one of the}} lowest known among all radionuclides. The isotope rhenium-186m is notable as being one of the longest lived metastable isotopes with a half-life of around 200,000 years. There are twenty-five other recognized radioactive isotopes of rhenium.|$|E
