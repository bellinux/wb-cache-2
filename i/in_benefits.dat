5|$|Grant {{was married}} five times. He wed Virginia Cherrill on February 9, 1934 at Caxton Hall {{registry}} office in London. She divorced him on March 26, 1935, following charges that Grant had hit her. The two {{were involved in}} a bitter divorce case which was widely reported in the press, with Cherrill demanding $1000 a week from her husband <b>in</b> <b>benefits</b> from his Paramount earnings. After the demise of the marriage, he dated actress Phyllis Brooks from 1937. They had considered marriage, and vacationed together in Europe in mid-1939, visiting the Roman villa of Dorothy di Frasso in Italy, before the relationship ended later that year.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction <b>in</b> <b>benefits,</b> including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only <b>in</b> <b>benefits</b> which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million <b>in</b> <b>benefits</b> for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E

When talks broke off between the NHL and the NHLPA the next day, there had been no progress in negotiations. On February 14, the union offered to accept a $52million salary cap under the condition that it was not linked to league revenues. The league proposed a counteroffer with a $40million cap plus $2.2million <b>in</b> <b>benefits,</b> which the players association refused. The next day, Bettman sent Goodenow a letter with a final proposal of a $42.5million cap plus $2.2million <b>in</b> <b>benefits,</b> setting a deadline of 11:00am the next day to accept or refuse the offer. The NHLPA presented a counter-offer involving a $49million cap, which the league rejected.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} liberal social reforms {{in areas like}} censorship, homosexuality, divorce, education, and worker {{participation}} in company management were introduced, whilst social security benefits were significantly increased. Increases were made in unemployment benefits, while substantial improvements <b>in</b> <b>benefits</b> were made for farmers, students, war invalids, the sick, families with many children, women, and pensioners between 1970 and 1975, {{which led to a}} doubling of benefit and social security payments during that period.

25|$|High blood {{pressure}} accounts for 35–50% of stroke risk. Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg systolic or 5 mmHg diastolic {{reduces the risk}} of stroke by ~40%. Lowering {{blood pressure}} has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It is equally important in secondary prevention. Even patients older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy. The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs —therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered. The routine use of beta-blockers following a stroke or TIA has not been shown to result <b>in</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 12, 2010, it was {{revealed}} that former Sheriff Mike Carona received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction. A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits. It was noted that the county's retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7 billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 <b>in</b> <b>benefits</b> in 2009.

40|$|Critical life events, such {{as cancer}} surgery, may result <b>in</b> finding some <b>benefit</b> <b>in</b> one's fate. In this {{longitudinal}} study with 117 cancer patients (73 men, 44 women) in hospitals in Berlin, we addressed three questions. (1) Do patients report benefit finding after surgery? (2) Are changes <b>in</b> <b>benefit</b> finding related to patients' well-being? (3) Is social support associated with finding <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> cancer? Patients were interviewed and completed a questionnaire in the week before cancer surgery. They {{were invited to participate}} in the follow-up by letter with a questionnaire at one month and again at 12 months postsurgery. Benefit finding was measured by a seven-item scale assessing different facets of positive changes attributed to experiencing grave illness. Although benefit finding increased over one year, change was substantial only for those who started off at a low level. Well-being was not associated with benefit finding at any point in time. However, changes <b>in</b> <b>benefit</b> finding predicted subsequent well-being. Received support was associated with <b>benefit</b> finding. Changes <b>in</b> <b>benefit</b> finding as well as initial support emerged as joint predictors of well-being. Social support Coping Benefit finding Posttraumatic growth Cancer Germany...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for {{performing}} arthroscopies is to repair or trim a painful and torn or damaged meniscus. The technical terms for the surgery is arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). Arthroscopic surgery, however, {{does not appear to}} result <b>in</b> <b>benefits</b> to adults when performed for knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis who have a meniscal tear. This {{may be due to the}} fact that a torn meniscus may often not cause pain and symptoms, which may be caused by the osteoarthritis alone. Some groups have made a strong recommendation against arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in nearly all patients, stating that the only group of patients who may - or may not - benefit are those with a true locked knee. Professional knee societies, however, highlight other symptoms and related factors they believe are important, and continue to support limited use of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in carefully selected patients.|$|E
25|$|During the {{austerity}} period, {{the aim of}} the Socialists {{was limited}} to that of safeguarding the position of beneficiaries as far as possible and of giving special consideration to the poorest amongst them. While further increases <b>in</b> <b>benefits</b> for the elderly, the handicapped, and in some family allowances later became possible, extra costs were also imposed. For instance, the duration of unemployment benefits was reduced, while a basic hospital charge (with exemptions) was introduced, and contributions from the early retired and unemployed towards health care were demanded although, once again, the worse off were exempt. Austerity measures also led to efforts to restrain family costs {{while at the same time}} trying to safeguard priority groups. In February 1982, a 25% increase was made in allowances for families containing two eligible children, but some benefits were abandoned and the starting and finishing dates for eligibility altered. Later, cash increases were less than the amounts necessary to maintain the real value of family benefits except for the poorest groups in French society. The limits on income assessed for social insurance contributions were raised and the income base upon which employers and the self-employed were assessed for contributions was changed. The cost of support for handicapped adults was transferred to the national government, although some taxation on tobacco and alcohol was also earmarked for this purpose. A 1% tax on personal incomes was imposed (although the poorest 33% of taxpayers was excluded), and a 1% “solidarity” contribution levied on civil servants towards the cost of unemployment insurance. In spite of austerity, however, the real value of social protection made modest increases. Within the total, the greatest benefits was reserved for the poorest whilst income was raised in ways which saw a modest shift from traditional financing methods towards general community financing.|$|E
