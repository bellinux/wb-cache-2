25|$|A variant named binary {{merge sort}} uses a binary {{insertion}} sort to sort groups of 32 elements, {{followed by a}} <b>final</b> <b>sort</b> using merge sort. It combines the speed of insertion sort on small data sets {{with the speed of}} merge sort on large data sets.|$|R

5000|$|A {{comparison}} sort {{is a type}} of sorting algorithm {{that only}} reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a [...] "less than or equal to" [...] operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the <b>final</b> <b>sorted</b> list.

5000|$|More {{efficient}} than the aforementioned are specialized partial sorting algorithms based on mergesort and quicksort. In the quicksort variant, {{there is no}} need to recursively sort partitions which only contain elements that would fall after the 'th place in the <b>final</b> <b>sorted</b> array (starting from the [...] "left" [...] boundary). Thus, if the pivot falls in position [...] or later, we recurse only on the left partition: ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{preserves}} the [...] expected time complexity of standard quicksort, because after running the quicksort_k procedure, the array A will be partially sorted {{in the sense}} that each element is at most [...] positions away from its <b>final,</b> <b>sorted</b> position. On such a partially sorted array, insertion sort will run at most [...] iterations of its inner loop, which is run [...] times, so it has linear time complexity.|$|R
5000|$|In quicksort, we recursively sort both branches, {{leading to}} best-case O(n log n) time. However, when doing selection, {{we already know}} which {{partition}} our desired element lies in, since the pivot is in its <b>final</b> <b>sorted</b> position, with all those preceding it in an unsorted order and all those following it in an unsorted order. Therefore, a single recursive call locates the desired element in the correct partition, and we build upon this for quickselect: ...|$|R

25|$|Shellsort {{was invented}} by Donald Shell in 1959. It {{improves}} upon bubble sort and insertion sort by moving out of order elements more than one position at a time. The concept behind Shellsort is that both of these algorithms perform in O(kn) time, where k is the greatest distance between two out-of-place elements. This means that generally, they perform in O(n2), but for data that is mostly sorted, {{with only a few}} elements out of place, they perform faster. So, by first sorting elements far away, and progressively shrinking the gap between the elements to <b>sort,</b> the <b>final</b> <b>sort</b> computes much faster. One implementation can be described as arranging the data sequence in a two-dimensional array and then sorting the columns of the array using insertion sort.|$|R
