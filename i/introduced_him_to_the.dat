5|$|Abbe {{was born}} on 15 December 1915 in a village in Tokushima Prefecture, {{on the island of}} Shikoku, Japan. He was the son of Toshizo Abbe, who was the local school's {{headmaster}} and a kendo instructor, and his wife, Kote Abbe. The couple had four sons and five daughters, and Abbe was the youngest child in the family. On 4 September 1919, when Abbe was not yet four years old, his father drowned in a flash flood while training in the mountains. A young schoolteacher, Manpei Hino, subsequently became a father figure for the young boy and <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> martial arts, including sumo. Abbe {{went on to become a}} local school champion in sumo.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{wrong side of the}} justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
5|$|Born in New York City, {{he spent}} much of his early {{childhood}} in Bogotá, Colombia before moving back to the United States at the age of 12. In his youth, Williamson developed an interest in comic strips, particularly Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon. He took art classes at Burne Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School, there befriending future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel, who <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work of illustrators who had influenced adventure strips. Before long, he was working professionally in the comics industry. His most notable works include his science-fiction/heroic fantasy art for EC Comics in the 1950s, on titles including Weird Science and Weird Fantasy.|$|E

Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.|$|E

His father, a police inspector, was {{inspired}} by the reformist thinking of Syed Ahmed Khan. In his early age, Khan's mother <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poetry of Maulana Hali and Muhammad Iqbal, the sermons of Abul Kalam Azad, and the Sufist philosophy of Rumi. This upbringing influenced his interest in historical as well as contemporary social, economic, and political affairs.|$|E
5|$|Wakeley saw Blast Corps as {{a puzzle}} game at its core. He was {{influenced}} by the 1994 Donkey Kong, in which the player begins each level with all the tools they need to finish but must learn how to use them. Wakeley said this was Blast Corp core game mechanic. He was also inspired by the Super Mario 64 demo at the 1995 Space World, which <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 3D analog stick and spurred him achieve something similar. The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance.|$|E
5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E

5|$|Around {{this time}} Henry Tippett decided {{to live in}} France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter {{remained}} at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. Sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when Tippett and another boy played a C minor Concerto for Two Harpsichords by Bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang in the chorus when Sargent directed a local performance of Robert Planquette's operetta Les Cloches de Corneville. Despite his parents' wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to Cambridge University, Tippett had firmly decided on {{a career as a}} composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by Sargent.|$|E
5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, {{as well as the}} sound of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley soon {{gave up his}} apprenticeship, {{and after}} a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here he picked up a working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E

After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, while {{attending}} Northwestern High School, {{he began working}} for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV), creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. After graduating from high school, Henson enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, as a studio arts major, thinking he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> craft and textiles courses in the College of Home economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he {{had been asked to}} create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character: Kermit the Frog. Henson would remain at WRC for seven years, from 1954 to 1961.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen was creatively active {{from his}} youth. He drew {{pictures}} with crayons on sidewalks, and invented stories {{for his friends}} about knights and legends. He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship. At school as well, he {{was more interested in}} telling stories and learning about art than anything else. His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who <b>introduced</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill.
