Family plans would not be considered even if the cost was above the 9.5% income threshold. This was estimated to leave 2–4 million Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers’ plans and ineligible for subsidies.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} on renal biopsy correlate with {{the severity of}} symptoms: those with asymptomatic hematuria may only have focal mesangial proliferation while those with proteinuria may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation. The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important prognostic factor <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> the patient will develop chronic renal disease.|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{function}} delegated by a public authority is crucial <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan (1975), it was accepted that the Board could establish a committee in order to investigate and conduct preliminary inquiries, {{and that it was}} not practical for the whole body to be engaged in such a task. On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E

The opinion of a central inspection team was an important factor <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> or not an official was disciplined, and the teams {{played an important role}} in the expulsion of Shanghai party chief (and Politburo member) Chen Liangyu from the party because of corruption.|$|E

5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: <b>In</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E
