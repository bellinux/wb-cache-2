25|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tube),</b> and is a variant of the neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{ultraviolet}} detectors {{use either}} a solid-state device, {{such as one}} based on silicon carbide or aluminium nitride, or a <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tube</b> as the sensing element. UV detectors that are sensitive to UV {{in any part of}} the spectrum respond to irradiation by sunlight and artificial light. A burning hydrogen flame, for instance, radiates strongly in the 185- to 260-nanometer range and only very weakly in the IR region, whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths; thus, a fire detector that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone. Virtually all fires emit some radiation in the UVC band, whereas the Sun's radiation at this band is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The result is that the UV detector is [...] "solar blind", meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun, so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors.|$|E

50|$|The Townsend {{avalanche}} {{can have}} a large range of current densities. In common <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tubes,</b> such as those used as gaseous ionisation detectors, magnitudes of currents flowing during this process can range from about 10&minus;18 amperes to about 10&minus;5 amperes.|$|R
50|$|In ring lasers, mirrors {{are used}} to focus and {{redirect}} the laser beams at the corners. While traveling between mirrors, the beams pass through <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tubes.</b> The beams are generally generated through local excitation of the gas by radio frequencies.|$|R

50|$|The {{starting}} of Townsend discharge {{sets the}} upper limit to the blocking voltage a glow discharge <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tube</b> can withstand. This limit is the Townsend discharge breakdown voltage, also called ignition voltage of the tube.|$|E
50|$|The branch-duplexer often {{includes}} a <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tube</b> that has high attenuation for high power microwaves but no attenuation for low power microwaves. This produces microwave noise during the setup-time {{at the end}} of the transmit pulse.|$|E
2500|$|Kimbark {{reports that}} this system {{operated}} quite reliably; however, the total {{end to end}} efficiency (at around 70%) was poor by today’s standards. [...] From the 1930s onwards, [...] extensive research started to take place into static alternatives using <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tubes</b> – principally mercury-arc valves but also thyratrons – which held the promise of significantly higher efficiency.|$|R
25|$|Tubes which {{generate}} {{relatively little}} heat, {{such as the}} 1.4-volt filament directly heated tubes designed for use in battery-powered equipment, often have shiny metal anodes. 1T4, 1R5 and 1A7 are examples. <b>Gas-filled</b> <b>tubes</b> such as thyratrons may also use a shiny metal anode, since the gas present inside the tube allows for heat convection from the anode to the glass enclosure.|$|R
25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on {{thermionic}} emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum <b>tubes</b> (evacuated); <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tubes</b> are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|R

40|$|A weakly {{nonlinear}} {{theory of}} the thermoacoustic instability in <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tubes</b> is developed in the time domain by exploiting {{the difference between the}} instability time scale and the period of standing waves. By carrying the expansion to fourth order in the perturbation parameter, explicit results for the initial growth, nonlinear evolution, and final saturation are obtained. The dependence of the saturation amplitude upon the temperature difference in the stack, the tube geometry, stack plate spacing, Prandtl number, and other parameters is illustrated...|$|R
25|$|As in all mercury-based <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{mercury is}} slowly adsorbed onto the glass, phosphor, and tube {{electrodes}} throughout {{the life of}} the lamp, until it can no longer function. Loss of mercury will take over from failure of the phosphor in some lamps. The failure symptoms are similar, except loss of mercury initially causes an extended run-up time to full light output, and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the mercury runs out and the argon base gas takes over as the primary discharge.|$|R
50|$|Needle valves {{may also}} be used in vacuum systems, when a precise control of gas flow is required, at low pressure, such as when filling <b>gas-filled</b> vacuum <b>tubes,</b> gas lasers and similar devices.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Gas-filled</b> <b>tubes</b> such as {{discharge}} {{tubes and}} cold cathode tubes are not hard vacuum tubes, though are always filled with gas {{at less than}} sea-level atmospheric pressure. Types such as the voltage-regulator tube and thyratron resemble hard vacuum tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still {{be referred to as}} [...] "electron tubes" [...] as they do perform electronic functions. High-power rectifiers use mercury vapor to achieve a lower forward voltage drop than high-vacuum tubes.|$|R
50|$|In {{electron}}ics, {{a vacuum}} tube, an electron tube, {{or just a}} tube (North America), or valve (Britain and some other regions), is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container.Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament.

50|$|A Townsend {{discharge}} can {{be sustained}} only over a limited range of gas pressure and electric field intensity. The accompanying plot shows the variation of voltage drop and the different operating regions for a <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tube</b> with a constant pressure, but a varying current between its electrodes. The Townsend avalanche phenomena occurs on the sloping plateau B-D. Beyond D the ionisation is sustained.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tube</b> {{can also}} be used as a shunt, {{particularly}} in a lightning arrestor. Neon and other noble gases have a high breakdown voltage, so that normally current will not flow across it. However, a direct lightning strike (such as on a radio tower antenna) will cause the shunt to arc and conduct the massive amount of electricity to ground, protecting transmitters and other equipment.|$|E
50|$|A {{thyratron}} {{is a type}} of <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tube</b> used as a high-power {{electrical switch}} and controlled rectifier. Thyratrons can handle much greater currents than similar hard-vacuum tubes. Electron multiplication occurs when the gas becomes ionized, producing a phenomenon known as Townsend discharge. Gases used include mercury vapor, xenon, neon, and (in special high-voltage applications or applications requiring very short switching times) hydrogen. Unlike a vacuum tube (valve), a thyratron cannot be used to amplify signals linearly.|$|E
25|$|Like other insects, the red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} breathes through {{a system of}} <b>gas-filled</b> <b>tubes</b> called tracheae connected to the external environment through spiracles.
