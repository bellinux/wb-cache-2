5|$|The {{state is}} a leader in {{renewable}} energy commercialization; it produces the most wind power in the nation. In 2014, 10.6% of the electricity consumed in Texas came from wind turbines. The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, is one of the world's largest wind farms with a 781.5 megawatt (MW) capacity. The <b>Energy</b> <b>Information</b> Administration states that the state's large agriculture and forestry industries could give Texas an enormous amount biomass for use in biofuels. The state also has the highest solar power potential for development in the nation.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the <b>Energy</b> <b>Information</b> Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
40|$|In {{quantum physics}} {{there are some}} {{experiments}} where speed of <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> transfer seems to be faster than light speed. In order to overcome this puzzle, the option proposed here is that <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> in these experiments are not carried by photon or other particles. Quantum space itself is the direct medium of <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> and transfer. This solution gives an original interpretation of the Einsten-Podolski-Rosen experiment and of causality problems for Fermi’s two-atom system. In both examples quantum space is a direct medium of <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> transfer between particles A and B. Time of <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> transfer between particle A and particle B is zero, speed is infinite.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and analyze a {{wireless}} <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> transfer system. To reduce the outage probability, compared to open-loop communication, we implement retransmission protocols {{both in the}} energy and in the information transmission phases.

Finally, under a packet transmission delay constraint, we derive the optimal power allocation and time sharing between the <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> signals such that the energy-constrained outage probability is minimized. The simulation and analytical results demonstrate that the retransmission-based protocols are efficient techniques to reduce the energy-limited outage probability of wireless <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> transmission systems...|$|R

40|$|Despite their {{constant}} evolution {{over the}} last few decades, wireless communication networks still struggle with energy conservation. The problem manifests itself in many applications, in particular wireless sensor networks, where communications do not occur frequently and nodes often remain idle, and small-scale communication networks, whose nodes need to to be minuscule. Such applications can achieve optimal energy-efficiency using passive (battery-less) receivers that wirelessly receive <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> at the same time. In this proposal, we present techniques to simultaneously deliver <b>energy</b> alongside <b>information</b> during wireless communications. First, we present mechanisms to consolidate <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> transfer in wireless sensor networks. We introduce iPoint, a communication system including a passive wireless receiver capable of establishing two-way communication with a commodity smartphone.

40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution happened {{in the middle of}} 18 th century, both the thermal equilibrium and ecologi-cal equilibrium of earth environment have been broken. The skyrocketing energy consumption and greenhouse gases emission are threatening the sustainable development of human beings. The only way out is to build up new energy structure. However, the new energy structure cannot be effectively built without the integration with the information. This paper proposes a correlation between <b>Energy</b> and <b>Information.</b> The paper begins with the introduction of the features of emerging new energy structure, namely, diversity of energy sources and diversity of energy flows. Then, essential roles of energy storage in new energy structure are identified. It is believed that energy storage is able to enhance the efficiency, cleanness, reliability and stability of whole energy system. To make energy storage systems function effectively, the key issue is to integrate <b>information</b> into <b>energy.</b> The pur-pose {{of this paper is to}} point out this uttermost importance of the correlation between <b>energy</b> and <b>information</b> in redirecting our way to sustainable development. The proposed correlation between <b>Energy</b> and <b>Information</b> is a fundamental principle that we should pay more attention, particularly in the current big data age.
