25|$|The {{technique}} of <b>gavage</b> dates {{as far back}} as 2500 BC, when the ancient Egyptians began keeping birds for food and deliberately fattened the birds through force-feeding. Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though it is produced and consumed worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the United States, and China.|$|E
25|$|The term ethical {{foie gras}} or humane foie gras {{is also used}} for gavage-based foie gras {{production}} that {{is more concerned with}} the animal's welfare (using rubber hoses rather than steel pipes for feeding). Others have expressed skepticism at these claims of humane treatment, as earlier attempts to produce fattened livers without <b>gavage</b> have not produced satisfactory results.|$|E
40|$|Fasting and {{ketogenic}} diet prevent seizures in epileptic children, magnesium-deficient {{rats and}} other animal models of seizure disorders. This effect has {{been attributed to}} increased levels of circulating ketone bodies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the role of serum ketone bodies, measured as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), in preventing audiogenically-induced seizures in weanling rats fed a magnesium-deficient diet for 17 days. The effect on seizure susceptibility was investigated by feeding a magnesium-deficient diet to weanling rats for 17 days. Fasting and ketogenic diet (dietary medium chain triglycerides, MCT) markedly decreased seizure incidence that was associated with increased serum BHB level. Also, rats fasted for 24 h or fed 28 percent dietary MCT had decreased seizure incidence as compared with rats fed 3 percent dietary MCT or rats fasted for 6 h. These effects were not caused by differences in caloric density or percentage of calories from fat in the diets. <b>Gavaging</b> 2 mmoles of BHB resulted in lower seizure incidence; as compared with rats <b>gavaged</b> with 0. 5 mmoles BHB when measured 30 min after dosing. In contrast, <b>gavaging</b> 5. 6 mmoles of glucose resulted in increased seizure incidence in 24 -h-fasted rats. <b>Gavaging</b> 5. 6 mmoles of glucose with 0. 5 mmole of BHB simultaneously resulted in higher seizure incidence than <b>gavaging</b> with 2. 0 mmole BHB and 1. 4 mmole glucose simultaneuosly. In addition, <b>gavaging</b> 5. 6 mmoles of glucose with 2 mmoles of BHB resulted in higher seizure incidence than <b>gavaging</b> 2 mmoles of BHB alone, which markedly reduced seizure incidence in fasted animals. Fasting, ketogenic diet (MCT) and <b>gavaging</b> BHB increase serum BHB and decrease serum glucose concentrations. <b>Gavaging</b> glucose reduced serum BHB and increased serum glucose concentration. There was an inverse relationship between serum BHB and glucose in all treatments of this study. Although some treatments affected serum minerals, these effects were not consistent among experiments. Therefore, fasting, ketogenic diet (MCT) and <b>gavaging</b> BHB or glucose does not affect serum minerals markedly or consistently; and modifications in serum minerals caused by these treatments do not account for this effect on seizure incidence and severity. Finally, increases in serum BHB and decreases in serum glucose were consistently associated with dose-dependent reductions in seizure susceptibility of rats fed a magnesium-deficient diet for 17 days...|$|R

Consumption is highest in females, thus my purpose was to define the concentration responsive effects of North American alcoholic and aqueous ginseng extracts on preimplantation development in vitro and on pregnancy and post-partum development in the mouse. 2 -cell embryos from female mice were cultured with 5 different concentrations of both extracts, ginsenosides Rb 1, Rg 1 and Re, a combinatorial ginsenoside solution and a polysaccharide fraction.

During feeding, efforts are made to avoid damaging the bird's esophagus, which could cause injury or death, although researchers have found evidence of inflammation of {{the walls of the}} proventriculus after the first session of force-feeding. There is also indication of inflammation of the esophagus in the later stages of fattening.

40|$|D ow nloaded from Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{high volume}} {{production}} chemical and {{has been identified as}} an endocrine disruptor, prompting concern that developmental exposure could impact brain development and behavior.

The aim of this study was to test whether the co administration of vitamin-E with amiodarone can reduce amiodarone-induced liver damage. Materials and Methods: Twelve male albino rats were divided into three groups (ml vegetable oil/day by oral <b>gavages</b> daily for 2 weeks and were used as control group. The rats of the second group received 5. 4 mg amiodarone/ 100 gm rat dissolved in vegetable oil daily by oral <b>gavages</b> for 2 weeks.

Two weeks after treatment, the rats were sacrificed and liver specimens were immediately taken and processed for transmission electron microscopic examinations. Results : Sections from the rat liver receiving amiodarone examined by electron microscopy showed disrupted hepatocytes with increased vacuolations. Degenerated organelles and disrupted nuclei were observed. The microvilli of bile canaliculi were disrupted and the hepatocytes showed increased lipid contents. Both endothelial cells and Kupffer cells were damaged. Phospholipids inside the mitochondria showed a loss of cristae. Sections from the liver of rats received amiodarone and vitamin-E showed lesser effects, especially in depositions of phospholipids in the mitochondria and the whole organelles and the nucleus showed minor damage in comparison to the previous group. Conclusion: Milder hepatotoxic effects are seen in rats administered amiodarone and vitamin E simultaneously suggesting that vitamin-E may play a role in amelioration of the effects of amiodarone...|$|R
