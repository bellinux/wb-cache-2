500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E

In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Lemmings as the 21st-top retro game, with the editors calling it [...] "perhaps Psygnosis' finest {{hour and a}} turning point in the puzzle genre." [...] In 1991, PC Format named Lemmings one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors wrote, [...] "Yes, we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> stupid, but you will like it — everyone else has." [...] In 1994, PC Gamer US named Lemmings the 30th best computer game ever. The editors called it [...] "one of the biggest puzzlers ever released for PC" [...] and [...] "cleaner and less complicated" [...] than its sequel. That same year, PC Gamer UK named it the 25th best computer game of all time, calling it [...] "a seminal title." ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{thing that}} we've learnt from touring {{over the last}} two years is that there are other ways to be {{powerful}} whilst making music, rather than being completely full on, 100 miles per hour.

500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> a bit mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E
500|$|Starting with Madonna's voice multi-tracked {{questioning}} – [...] "Am I gonna be a star?", [...] "Should I {{change my}} name?" [...] – the lyrics develop into what Rikky Rooksby of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{states is a}} complaint about modern-day life. She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity. I'm saying that's bullshit, and who knows better than me? Before it happens, you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E
