2500|$|Polyaniline and {{the other}} {{conducting}} polymers such as polythiophene, polypyrrole, and [...] have potential for applications due to their lightweight, conductivity, mechanical flexibility and low cost. [...] Polyaniline is especially attractive because it is relatively inexpensive, has three distinct oxidation states with different colors and has an acid/base doping response. This latter property makes polyaniline an attractive for acid/base chemical vapor sensors, supercapacitors and biosensors. [...] The different colors, charges and conformations of the multiple oxidation states also make the material promising for applications such as actuators, supercapacitors and electrochromics. [...] Although polyaniline has been historically considered as a battery material, its intrinsic pseudocapacitive behavior has shifted the energy storage potential to supercapacitors. Polyaniline is, in fact, the most common conductive polymer for the fabrication of supercapacitors. An interesting feature of polyaniline, {{as well as other}} conducting polymers, is the versatility in manufacturing electrically conducting yarns, antistatic coatings, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>shielding,</b> and flexible electrodes.|$|E
