While Harvard's decision to maintain its code made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to play McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series in 1874. Harvard won the first game, in which its rules were used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, {{did not have a}} winner as neither team managed to score.|$|E
5|$|Walter's granddaughters Maud and Margaret {{were due}} to inherit Walter's {{remaining}} estates on his death, {{but they were still}} unmarried, making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to hold property in their own right. Henry informally divided the lands up between them, giving Ludlow to Maud and marrying her to one of his royal favourites, Peter de Geneva, cancelling many of the debts they had inherited from Walter at the same time. Peter died in 1249 and Maud married a second time, this time to Geoffrey de Geneville, a friend of the Prince Edward, the future king. In 1260, Henry officially split up Walter's estate, allowing Geoffrey to retain the castle.|$|E

25|$|The {{elevator}} attendants currently {{serve as}} a way to reassure passengers as the elevators are the primary entrance to the platforms, and passengers often wait for the elevators with an attendant.

25|$|Purandar Singha {{was born}} in 1807 CE, at Silmari, located in British ruled Bengal. His {{grandfather}} Bijoy Barmura Gohain and his father Brajanath Gohain was living in Silmari as exiled princes, after their attempts to become king of Ahom kingdom failed. The family faced economic hardships during their exile, and life in Silmari was very <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Purandar Singha also spent his early life amidst economic hardships.|$|E
25|$|It is {{suggested}} that these workers should fight back and protect their own labour rights, yet {{a lot of them}} in developing countries are ignorant about their own right because of low education level. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016), most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to improve working conditions on their own.|$|E

25|$|At V Corps, Fanshawe {{oversaw the}} initial Actions of St Eloi Craters in late March 1916; the attack {{under his command}} by 3rd Division was successful, but terrible ground {{conditions}} made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> or for the relieving troops in the Canadian Corps, to hold ground, and after a month of heavy losses, the line stabilised at the original positions. Such a situation would normally result in the divisional commanders being sacked; it was 2nd Canadian Division under Richard Turner which had failed to hold the ground but for political reasons, the high command felt it impossible to sack a Canadian commander. Instead, Aylmer Haldane, the commander of 3rd Division, was lined up as a scapegoat; Fanshawe tried to intervene with General Haig and was sacked on 4 July. His replacement at V Corps was, somewhat unusually, his elder brother Edward.|$|E
25|$|He {{lived with}} his mother in Mecca for three years until she took him to Yathrib to visit some {{relatives}} (uncles from the mother side), and she died on the way back. Now orphaned, Muhammad, aged 6, was passed into the custody of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, who was eighty years old. According to traditional accounts, Muhammad was very close to his grandfather, as had been his father before him. However, two years later, his grandfather died. Muhammad then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 6th-century Arabia, there was general disdain for guardians who took care of the weaker members of the tribes in Mecca. Although Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to leave.|$|E

50|$|The gizmo key was {{introduced}} by Verne Q. Powell (Powell Flutes), in response to criticisms of the B foot joint by performers such as Jean-Pierre Rampal, who believed that the lengthened tube made it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to produce the highest notes. It is now common on the instrument.|$|R
50|$|The {{bill would}} create {{additional}} requirements {{as part of}} the legal process associated with patent infringement under United States law.

25|$|Sunny soon {{left the}} team and Droz, then known as Puke (Darren Drozdov, a former {{defensive}} end for the Denver Broncos who earned the name Puke when caught vomiting on Monday Night Football), started to accompany them to the ring. At the same time, Paul Ellering returned, but sided with the Disciples of Apocalypse (DOA), whom LOD were feuding with at the time; Ellering and Animal explained on the DVD it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to rip on each other on promos. For {{the second time in}} the history of the Road Warriors they participated in a storyline where tension arose between the members, teasing a break up. In this storyline, Hawk was seen by his partner Animal as unfit to wrestle and Puke was tapped to take Hawk's place in the tag team as an official member. The angle played off Hegstrand’s real life alcohol and drug issues, going so far as to faking a suicide jump off the top of the TitanTron. After the angle bombed and both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis voiced their objections to it, the angle was dropped. The Legion of Doom made a very brief return, first on the March 22, 1999 Raw is War by attacking Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco in a backstage skit after the two impersonated LOD in a handicap match against Shane McMahon, on the March 15, 1999 Raw is War. Both LOD entered the pre-WrestleMania battle royal with the last two participants getting a tag team title shot later at WrestleMania XV but both came up short. They would make one final appearance on the March 29, 1999 Raw challenging Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett for the tag team titles but failed them; they left the WWF afterwards.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, as a [...] "relatively short-lived" [...] experiment, {{the group}} {{franchised}} its concept to other countries. [...] They started in Taiwan, because as Cook stated, {{they thought the}} country [...] "was a small enough place, in case it didn't work out". [...] The Taiwanese group was successful, so they branched out to Latin America, casting Spanish-speaking Australians. [...] The Wiggles ceased to pursue additional franchising when they learned that viewers in other countries preferred the original versions of their songs and programs because they helped children learn English, and according to Cook, when it became too <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to control, and when it [...] "did not prove lucrative". [...] By 2012, they {{found that it was}} easier to simply dub their programs into other languages.|$|E
500|$|Swift and {{her love}} {{interest}} continued their relationship, but then went {{their separate ways}} because it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to see each other. To Swift, the song resembles much optimism regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism. She deemed [...] "Love Story" [...] {{one of her most}} romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song. In retrospect, Swift said the song is [...] "about a love that you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well", adding [...] "I spun it in the direction of Romeo and Juliet. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on — a love that maybe society wouldn't accept [...] maybe your friends wouldn't accept." ...|$|E

50|$|Sokoke {{cats are}} very active and enjoy climbing. They {{tend to be}} vocal toward human keepers and other cats with whom they live.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that {{there had not been}} many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how [...] "crummy" [...] the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how [...] "crummy" [...] and [...] "dismal" [...] Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The [...] "way they radiate out" [...] had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided {{to put it in the}} clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular".|$|E
500|$|Muhammad's father, Abdullah, died {{almost six}} months before he was born. According to Islamic tradition, soon after birth {{he was sent to}} live with a Bedouin family in the desert, as desert life was {{considered}} healthier for infants; some western scholars reject this tradition's historicity. Muhammad stayed with his foster-mother, Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, and her husband until he was two years old. At the age of six, Muhammad lost his biological mother Amina to illness and became an orphan. For the next two years, until he was eight years old, Muhammad was under the guardianship of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, of the Banu Hashim clan until his death. He then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of the Banu Hashim. According to Islamic historian William Montgomery Watt there was a general disregard by guardians in taking care of weaker members of the tribes in Mecca during the 6th century, [...] "Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, but it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{company had}} no {{standardization}} of level design tools. Leighton said, [...] "Some people used 3D Studio Max, some used Lightwave, and one designer even wrote his own custom modeler from scratch". This practice {{led to an}} inconsistent quality across the game's levels. For example, one designer would create structures with great geometry but bad texturing, while another would create the opposite. Once the structures were modeled individually, they were all imported into a custom editor, called D3Edit, so that the designers could [...] "glue everything together". The D3Edit editor received constant updates because it initially did not feature an intuitive interface for designers. It {{was not until the}} last third of the development period that the editor improved significantly. As Leighton notes, [...] "Even in the shipped game you can tell which levels were made early on and which were made {{near the end of the}} production cycle. The later levels are much better looking, have better frame rates, and generally have better scripts". Developers also considered the idea of shipping the game with a level editor based on the one they used to create the game's levels. However, due to the constant changes the developers made to their own editor, it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to design a more user-friendly one from the start.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} red bats have {{different}} migrating routines. Female bats are usually found in warmer climates {{during the month}} of June.

50|$|The £5 {{notes were}} of two {{different}} types, because in 1957 the British Government had begun to replace the large white notes with smaller blue ones.

50|$|Brujah: In ancient times, the Brujah were a clan {{of noble}} {{philosophers}} and warrior-poets. Since {{the loss of}} their city of Carthage, which was their crowning achievement, they have become a clan of malcontents, rebels, rogues, and anti-authoritarians. Brujah possess great passion, but this same passion makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to resist the Beast. Brujah are one of the seven founding clans of the Camarilla.|$|R
500|$|In April 2011, Mercy faces {{deportation}} to Nigeria, and Fatboy {{plans to}} save her by proposing. Norwood revealed that Mercy is shocked by the proposal, adding [...] "Mercy thinks he's lost his marbles, but soon comes round to the idea. Fatboy reckons that this isn't about his feelings, it's all about keeping her in the UK. Of course, he's also hoping that if she stays, maybe she'll end up liking him {{in the way he}} likes her. [...] You can get into a lot of trouble for , ut all Fatboy can think is, 'How can I save Mercy?' She's the girl he loves." [...] Although Fatboy is in love with Mercy, he does not believe that Mercy sees him as more than a friend and may call off the wedding if he tells her. He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so hard to prove they are genuine makes it [...] "very <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy have a dream come true, {{but at the same time}} it is a nightmare for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the ends of the earth to make this marriage work".|$|E
2500|$|Jolley {{began writing}} {{early in her}} twenties, but was not {{recognised}} until much later. [...] She had many rejections by publishers, 39 in one year alone. Delys Bird suggests {{that it was the}} post-modern features of her writing – [...] "motifs repeated within and between novels and short stories, self-reflexivity and open-endedness" [...] – that made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to be published at that time. She suggests that her eventual success owes a little to [...] "the 1980s awareness of 'women's writing'".|$|E

50|$|Like Persians more generally, the Himalayan {{tends to}} have a round (cobby) body with short legs, which makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to jump as high as other cats do.
