MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed with an average follow up of 36 months 22 patients (22 elbows) who had been treated conservatively after a first episode of posterior dislocation of the elbow. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (86 %) reported an excellent or a good subjective result, although 64 % suffered occasionally from pain. None had presented a recurrent dislocation. At physical examination, 27 % had a <b>restricted</b> <b>extension</b> of the elbow of 10 degrees and more, and 27 % {{had some kind of}} chronic laxity. Fifty percent had modifications visible on the X-rays. We found no correlation between laxity and duration of immobilization. At contrary, patients who were immobilized for a longer time than 3 weeks suffered more often of a painful <b>restricted</b> <b>extension</b> of the elbow. DISCUSSION: Conservative management of posterior dislocation of the elbow has a good prognosis. Occasional pain and chronic laxity are often present but well supported.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review the}} ability of various types of {{external}} immobilizers to restrict cervical spine movement. METHODS: With a systematical review of original scientific articles, data on range of motion, type of used external immobilization device and risk of bias were extracted. The described external immobilization devices were grouped and the mean restriction percentage and standard deviation were calculated. Finally, each device was classified based {{on its ability to}} restrict movement of the cervical spine, according to five levels of immobilization: poor (MIL /= 80 %). RESULTS: The ability to reduce the range of motion by soft collars was poor in all directions. The ability of cervico-high thoracic devices was moderate for flexion/extension but poor for lateral bending and rotation. The ability of cervico-low thoracic devices to restrict flexion/extension and rotation was moderate, while their ability to restrict lateral bending was poor. All cranio-thoracic devices for non-ambulatory patients restricted cervical spine movement substantial in all directions. The ability of vests with non-invasive skull fixation was substantial in all directions. No studies with healthy adults were identified with respect to cranial traction and halo vests with skull pins and their ability to restrict cervical movement. CONCLUSIONS: Soft collars have a poor ability to reduce mobility of the cervical spine. Cervico-high thoracic devices primarily reduce flexion and extension, but they reduce lateral bending and rotation to a lesser degree. Cervico-low thoracic devices restrict lateral bending to the same extent as cervico-high thoracic devices, but are considerably more effective at <b>restricting</b> flexion, <b>extension,</b> and rotation.

50|$|Some {{disadvantages}} of the sputtering process {{are that the}} process {{is more difficult to}} combine with a lift-off for structuring the film. This is because the diffuse transport, characteristic of sputtering, makes a full shadow impossible. Thus, one cannot <b>fully</b> <b>restrict</b> where the atoms go, which can lead to contamination problems. Also, active control for layer-by-layer growth is difficult compared to pulsed laser deposition and inert sputtering gases are built into the growing film as impurities. Pulsed laser deposition is a variant of the sputtering deposition technique in which a laser beam is used for sputtering. Role of the sputtered and resputtered ions and the background gas is fully investigated during the pulsed laser deposition process.|$|R

Whereas the wall pressure signal near the nozzle exit randomly alternates between its value in the backflow region and that above ambient (i. e., flow randomly alternates between a free shock separation and restricted shock separation transition condition and vice versa) as a function of time for a partially formed restricted shock separation condition, the wall pressure in a <b>fully</b> formed <b>restricted</b> shock separation condition fluctuates in values above ambient in the region of flow reattachment. Further, the transient conditions of free shock separation to partially formed restricted shock separation and end-effect regime are studied in detail.

A second separation bubble is also observed in the restricted shock separation condition, the formation and opening of which is seen to contribute toward side-load peaks. Results also indicate that the separation shock translates back and forth (flapping motion) and experiences spanwise perturbations (rippling motion).
