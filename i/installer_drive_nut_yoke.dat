50|$|Static load {{capacity}} {{can be added}} to a linear screw actuator using an electromagnetic brake system, which applies friction to the spinning <b>drive</b> <b>nut.</b> For example, a spring may be used to apply brake pads to the <b>drive</b> <b>nut,</b> holding it in position when power is turned off. When the actuator needs to be moved, an electromagnet counteracts the spring and releases the braking force on the <b>drive</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R
50|$|Generally {{it is not}} {{possible}} to vary the static load capacity of screw actuators without additional technology. The screw thread pitch and <b>drive</b> <b>nut</b> design defines a specific load capacity that cannot be dynamically adjusted.|$|R
40|$|A drive {{mechanism}} enables a socket-type wrench to rotate a shaft and prevents accidental {{rotation of the}} shaft when the wrench is not coupled to the shaft. In the original intended application, the shaft {{would be part of}} an attachment mechanism on a spacecraft, and the purpose to be served by the drive is to prevent back-driving of the shaft by launch vibrations while enabling an astronaut equipped with the appropriate wrench to actuate the shaft while in orbit. The design could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which it is necessary to prevent rotational back-driving. The mechanism includes a gear near the tip of the shaft, and a <b>drive</b> <b>nut</b> that constitutes the tip of the shaft. The gear and <b>drive</b> <b>nut</b> are positioned in a recess in a housing. The recess is sized to receive the wrench socket that mates with the <b>drive</b> <b>nut.</b> Also contained in the housing are four linkages that include pins that are spring-loaded into engagement with the gear to prevent rotation of the shaft. When the wrench socket is inserted in the recess, it pushes on the linkages in such a manner as to disengage the pins from the gear...|$|R

Experimental {{results show that the}} ISFD elastic damping support can effectively reduce shock vibration of the gear system. Additionally, resonant modulation in gear shafts caused by meshing impact was significantly reduced. Different vibration amplitudes of gear shafts with ISFD <b>installed</b> only on <b>driven</b> or driving shafts were compared.
