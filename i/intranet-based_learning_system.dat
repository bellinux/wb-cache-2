The tool {{has been designed to}} be used in the work place to complement and support traditional approaches to teaching and learning. The focus of the evaluation is how nurses use five learning objects within this resource: two short films and three interactive animations, to learn a specific nursing skill: tracheostomy suction. Four nurses participated in the study, two with no experience and two with experience in tracheostomy care. The findings of this pilot evaluation demonstrate that the use of media rich learning resources by nurses in clinical settings can contribute learning new skills, particularly when these newly learned concepts and knowledge were reinforced with actual supervised clinical practice. The use of technology facilitated learning resources was enthusiastically embraced, boosted confidence and prompted discussions with the clinical teacher...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Higher Education {{institutions}} {{increasingly are}} employing information <b>systems</b> to support <b>learning</b> and assessment. In particular, {{a great deal}} of interest has been expressed in intranethosted learning environments that support the educational experience. At the same time, university curricula and student assessment are increasingly defined and driven by <b>learning</b> outcomes. Most <b>intranet-based</b> <b>learning</b> environments use modules of study as the fundamental unit of construction. This results in a failure to record performance by learning outcome. There is therefore a mismatch between current educational thinking and the information systems that support the processes. This paper presents the findings of a pilot project that focuses on the building of a virtual learning environment that utilises learning outcomes in framing the delivery model and assessing student performance. Early feedback from the pilot project suggests that benefits for students and staff, and improvements in institutional quality, might be obtained from this novel delivery and assessment methodology. This paper further develops ideas that were presented at SITE 2003 and includes the results of student feedback and evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 How can {{end users}} {{efficiently}} influence the predictions that machine <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> make on their behalf? Traditional systems rely on users to provide {{examples of how}} they want the <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> to behave, {{but this is not}} always practical for the user, nor efficient for the <b>learning</b> <b>system.</b> This dissertation explores a different personalization approach: a two-way cycle of explanations, in which the <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> explains the reasons for its predictions to the end user, who can then explain any necessary corrections back to the system. In formative work, we study the feasibility of explaining a machine <b>learning</b> <b>system's</b> reasoning to end users and whether this might help users explain corrections back to the <b>learning</b> <b>system.</b> We then conduct a detailed study of how <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> should explain their reasoning to end users.

Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of Explanatory Debugging versus a traditional <b>learning</b> <b>system,</b> finding that explanations of the <b>learning</b> <b>system's</b> reasoning improved study participants' understanding by over 50 % (compared with participants who used the traditional system) and participants' corrections to this reasoning were up to twice as efficient as providing examples to the <b>learning</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{successfully}} {{navigate the}} world by making decisions {{based on what we}} have learned. In the brain, two prominent <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> have been identified and each is likely to guide decisions in different ways. Research on decision making has primarily focused on a reward <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> in the striatum. These studies have illuminated the how repeated choices and rewards build representations that guide choices and actions when encountering the same situation again. However, in a constantly changing environment, choices may not repeat themselves. Further, the environment may have more structure than simple reward learning can navigate. In these situations, decisions may be guided by a different <b>learning</b> <b>system,</b> namely a flexible <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> in the hippocampus which encodes episodes, or more broadly, relations between stimuli. However, investigations into the role of a reward <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> and a relational <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> in decision making have developed largely independently of each other. In the studies described below, I explore the function of these <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> in value-guided decision making. Complementarily, I also explore how ongoing reward learning may modulate memory formation in the hippocampal system. In these studies, I demonstrate that reward learning and decision making is influenced by relational learning, and that these effects are predicted by hippocampal-striatal connectivity during learning. Separately, I establish that episodic memory is, in turn, influenced by ongoing reward learning. Successful memory is predicted by modulations of reward and memory regions including the striatum and hippocampus. Overall, these results provide novel insights into the <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> encoding memories for future adaptive behavior...|$|R
