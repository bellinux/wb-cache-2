A cinematic venture was entered in April 1913 by park manager J.E. Monroe and the Cities and Towns Film Company to use the park as a movie backdrop. Starring Maclyn Arbuckle in a variation of The Round Up, it portrays a scene using the park in which a threatening brush fire is extinguished by the fire department.

30|$|Because outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> are {{considered}} a test for accelerated aging based on natural environmental conditions, the deterioration mechanism {{was thought to be}} similar to the deterioration that occurs when wood-based panels are actually used in housing construction. But outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> have many disadvantages; {{one of the most significant}} is that results are limited by the test location [4]. Even when outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> use the same panels at all locations, there are differences in the deterioration of panels among the locations. Thus, the results of outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at specific sites are not applicable to sites with different weather conditions.|$|R
30|$|Outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> {{have many}} {{disadvantages}} including the time consumed {{and the difficulty}} in implementing them. In addition, results from outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> are confounded with the test location [15]. In contrast, short-term tests assess changes in mechanical properties after accelerated aging treatments, such as water immersion, boiling, steaming, freezing, or drying. The results of outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> are sometimes used as basic indicators when selecting among standardized test methods [16, 17]. In Japan, to evaluate the durability of wood-based panels, outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> at eight sites using commercial wood-based panels have been conducted by the Research Working Group on Wood-based Panels of the Japan Research Society since 2004. In our previous reports, we discussed the results of 5 -year exposure in Shizuoka City and standardized accelerated aging tests [18 – 20].|$|R

Therefore, outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> started in 2004 as part of a project organized by the Research Working Group on Wood-based Panels from the Japan Wood Research Society. The boards used were particleboard, oriented strand board (strandboard), and medium-density fiberboard (fiberboard). Our research group [5 – 12], Kojima et al. [13 – 16], and Sekino et al. [17] recently reported the results.|$|R

The main component of this project is conducting outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> at eight sites in Japan, but indoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> and accelerated aging tests are also conducted. Previous papers have addressed thickness swelling [1], internal bond strength (IB) [2], and bending properties [3] after 5  years of outdoor exposure in Shizuoka City, along {{with the effects of}} accelerated aging treatment.

30|$|Recently, mat-formed wood-based panels such as {{particleboard}} (PB) and medium-density fiberboard (MDF) {{have been}} widely used in residential construction. Therefore, the design of the service life for these panels has become important. Thus far, many studies have predicted the durability of wood-based panels using laboratory accelerated aging tests [1, 2] and outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> [3 – 7]. In addition, several studies [6 – 9] reported that the deterioration behavior in outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> correlates with that of the laboratory accelerated aging test. The results of outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> are sometimes used as basic indicators when determining standardized test methods [5, 10]. Further, they play a role that exhibits the service life of the panels used outdoors on that site.|$|R

As a test specimen is exposed in a natural weathering environment for a long-term period, the deterioration of the test specimen strongly depends on the climate conditions of the exposure locations.

30|$|To {{investigate}} the influence wood preservatives on glued-laminated-timber (GLT), sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D.Don) laminae {{were treated with}} five kinds of wood preservative (ACQ, NCU, CUAZ 2, NZN, and AAC), and 5 -ply GLTs with low and high density were fabricated using resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) and phenol-resorcinol–formaldehyde (PRF) resin adhesives. They were subjected to 10  years of outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>testing,</b> and after 1, 3, 5, and 10  years of <b>exposure</b> block-shear <b>tests</b> were conducted. As the result, for GLTs treated with ACQ, NCU, or CUAZ 2, which contain copper as the main ingredient, the specimens sawn from both lateral sides were more degraded than the specimens sawn from the middle part. In GLTs treated with ACQ, NCU, or CUAZ 2 the glue-layers closer to the upper horizontal surface tended to show greater deterioration. In addition, in some GLTs the lower glue-layers also deteriorated. From {{the results of the}} specimens sawn from the west side of GLTs exposed outdoors, of <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> of 2  years, and of accelerated-aging tests using block-shear specimen with 10 and 25  mm width, reduction curves (plots of deterioration vs. exposure time) of shear-strength were obtained and compared.

40|$|Objective: Heat {{exposure}} {{has been}} shown to stimulate GH release, but the specificity and the reproducibility have not been determined, and the test has not been compared with validated GH stimulation tests in adulthood. We therefore tested the specificity and the reproducibility of the heat <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> in healthy subjects and compared the results with those obtained with the insulin-tolerance test (ITT). Design: Ten healthy non-obese men, aged 31. 3 6 4. 80 years, underwent four GH stimulation tests in random order: two ITTs and two heat exposure tests. In the heat test, subjects were placed in a hot bath with water temperature at 40. 3 6 0. 11 8 C for 45 min, resulting in an identical (P 0. 477) significant increase in tympanic temperature of 1. 26 6 0. 05 and 1. 41 6 0. 07 8 C in the two tests. Results: Peak GH response to the heat <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> was less than the peak GH response to ITT (5. 25 6 1. 72 vs 15. 5 6 3. 17 mg/l, P 0. 006). Furthermore the specificity (arbitrary cut-off level 3 mg/l) of the heat test was lower than of the ITT (8 / 17 vs 18 / 20, P 0. 006). The coefficient of variation did not differ between the two tests (heat test 0. 31, ITT 0. 36, P 0. 77). Peak GH values in the individual tests were highly correlated (heat, r 0. 908, P 0. 002; ITT, r 0. 815, P 0. 004). Reproducible increments in the circulating levels of stress hormones were observed during ITT, but these hormones remained largely unchanged during heat exposure. Conclusions: The heat <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> is not a reliable GH stimulation test compared with the ITT in adults. This study documents that the ITT has a high specificity and reproducibility in the diagnosis of GH deficiency in adulthood. We propose that the heat <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> is not used in the diagnosis of this condition in adulthood. European Journal of Endocrinology 139 605 – 61...|$|E

These data can be used for defining criteria or reference values for environmental management and for conducting specific risk assessment. Dose-response experiments formed the basis for evaluating the toxic effects and transfer of contaminants from soil into two trophic levels, taking bioavailability-modifying soil characteristics into account. Short-term <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted to explore the acute toxicity for the test organisms of TNT-spiked artificial soils and of the aged TNT-contaminated soil to be included in the subsequent long-term <b>exposure</b> <b>tests.</b> In these tests, plants were exposed for 10 days, and seed germination was determined.
