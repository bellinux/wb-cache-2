25|$|The {{chromosomal}} {{defect in}} the Philadelphia chromosome is a translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The result is that a fusion gene is created by juxtaposing the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to {{a part of the}} BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22 (region q11). This is a reciprocal translocation, creating an elongated chromosome 9 (termed a <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosome,</b> or der 9), and a truncated chromosome 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome, 22q-). In agreement with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN), this chromosomal translocation is designated as t(9;22)(q34;q11). The symbol ABL is derived from Abelson, the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein.|$|E
25|$|Chromosome {{abnormalities}} can be numerical, as in {{the presence}} of extra or missing chromosomes, or structural, as in <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosome,</b> translocations, inversions, large-scale deletions or duplications. Numerical abnormalities, also known as aneuploidy, often occur as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis in the formation of a gamete; trisomies, in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in homologous recombination. Both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person's body, or they can occur during mitosis and give rise to a genetic mosaic individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells.|$|E

Four distinct categories were delineated: terminal deletions, interstitial deletions, <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and complex rearrangements; each results in haploinsufficiency of the EHMT 1 gene and a characteristic phenotype. Interestingly, 25 % of our patients had de novo interstitial deletions, 25 % were found with <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and complex rearrangements and only 50 % were bona fide terminal deletions. In contrast to genomic disorders that are often associated with recurrent rearrangements, breakpoints involving the 9 q 34. 3 subtelomere region are highly variable. Molecular studies identified three regions of breakpoint grouping. Interspersed repetitive elements such as Alu, LINE, long-terminal repeats and simple tandem repeats are frequently observed at the breakpoints. Such repetitive elements may play an important role by providing substrates with a specific DNA secondary structure that stabilizes broken chromosomes or assist in either DNA double-strand break repair or repair of single double-strand DNA ends generated by collapsed forks. Sequence analyses of the breakpoint junctions suggest that subtelomeric deletions can be stabilized by both homologous and nonhomologous recombination mechanisms, through a telomere-capture event, by de novo telomere synthesis, or multistep breakage-fusion-bridge cycles...|$|R

40|$|To {{report the}} case of a prenatally {{detected}} de novo mosaic tetrasomy 18 p where a combination of different methodologies was used,including conventional cytogenetics and molecular genetics techniques. METHOD: Molecular rapid aneuploidy diagnosis, by quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR), conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS:Amniocentesis was performed at 22 + 5 gestational weeks, on a 37 -year-old woman, due to ultrasound detection of fetal interventricular communication, overlapped fingers and unilateral club foot. Molecular rapid aneuploidy testing, by QF-PCR, showed highly increased ratios for markers on the short arm of chromosome 18. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a male karyotype with mosaicism involving two cell lines: one with a supernumerary isochromosome 18 p and another with two extra <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosomes</b> 18. Parental karyotypes were normal and QF-PCR analysis indicated that the extra chromosome 18 p material was of maternal origin. After counseling the couple opted for pregnancy termination. Anatomopathological studies, as well as further characterization of the <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> are underway in order to provide more accurate genotype-correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of tetrasomy 18 p reported cases were ascertained postnatally, had a de novo occurrence and an isochromosome 18 p in all cells examined.

The case herein reported, where a mosaic is present and none of the cell lines is chromosomally normal, may provide further insight on this rare syndrome and help in the knowledge of the associated phenotype. The application of a combined strategy, using QF-PCR, conventional cytogenetics and FISH analysis allowed not only for the identification of the extra chromosome 18 p material, {{in the form of a}} mosaicism involving isochromosome 18 p, but also for determining its parental origin.

40|$|Abstract Background About 7  % of karyotypically {{balanced}} chromosomal rearrangements (BCRs) {{are associated}} with congenital anomalies due to gene or regulatory element disruption, and cryptic imbalances on rearranged chromosomes. Rare familial BCRs segregating with clinical features are a powerful source for the identifying of causative genes due {{to the presence of}} several affected carriers. Case presentation We report on a karyotypically balanced translocation t(2; 22) (p 13;q 12. 2) associated with variable learning disabilities, and craniofacial and hand dysmorphisms, detected in six individuals in a three-generation family. Combined a-CGH, FISH and mate-pair sequencing revealed a ten-break complex rearrangement, also involving chromosome 5. As the consequence of the segregation of the <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosomes</b> der(2), der(5) and der(22), different imbalances were present in affected and clinically normal family members, thus contributing to the clinical variability. A 6. 64  Mb duplication of a 5 q 23. 2 - 23. 3 segment was the imbalance common to all affected individuals. Although LMNB 1, implicated in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) when overexpressed, was among the 18 duplicated genes, none of the adult carriers manifested ADLD, and LMNB 1 overexpression was not detected in the two tested individuals, after qRT-PCR. The ectopic location of the extra copy of the LMBN 1 gene on chromosome 22 might have negatively impacted its expression. In addition, two individuals presenting with more severe learning disabilities carried a 1. 42  Mb 2 p 14 microdeletion, with three genes (CEP 68, RAB 1 A and ACTR 2),which are candidates for the intellectual impairment observed in the previously described 2 p 14 p 15 microdeletion syndrome, mapping to the minimal overlapping deleted segment. A 5 p 15. 1 deletion, encompassing 1. 47  Mb, also detected in the family, did not segregate with the clinical phenotype. Conclusion The disclosing of the complexity of an apparently simple two-break familial rearrangement illustrates the importance of reconstructing the precise structure of <b>derivative</b> <b>chromosomes</b> for establishing genotype-phenotype correlations...|$|R
