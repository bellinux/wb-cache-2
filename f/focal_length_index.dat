The term AI-S is now commonly {{used to refer to}} manual focus lenses, and Nikon continues to produce eight prime lens models in its AI-S line. All Nikon AF lenses with aperture rings (non-G) also meet the AI-S specification, except for their lack of a Meter Coupling Prong (which can be added).|$|R
40|$|Thermionic {{emission}} microscope (THEM) is {{an important}} analytical research tool for studying the electron emission uniformity of a thermionic cathode. The criticality of its design and development stems from the inhomogeneous emission nature of impregnated cathode surface. In this paper, a design approach of lens and deflection plate is described. The analytical equation for <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> refractive <b>index</b> and condition for beam convergence of the microscope is derived using electron-optical phenomena. Finally, all the parameters are optimized using TRAK simulation software. The microscope has been developed and tested in UHV chamber. The emission image of cathode shows {{the performance of the}} microscope. Thermionic emission microscope (THEM) comprises of subsystems: viz.

5000|$|Interoperability across systemsIt is {{possible}} to mount, say, a Canon flash directly on a Nikon body, and trigger it during the exposure. However, the ISO 518 hot-shoe standard does not govern electronic data transfer between the flash and the body (e.g. for charge and exposure status, TTL metering, ratio, <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> ISO exposure <b>index,</b> distance, pre-flash metering, modeling light, red-eye reduction burst, wireless control). Different camera makers' dedicated flash systems are, in fact, incompatible {{in terms of both}} the proprietary contact layout and the communication protocol. That said, many current wireless radio triggers for professional studio strobe systems remain a relevant real-world application of the basic ISO 518 hot-shoe design. Their use with Sony and Minolta DSLRs requires either the Minolta FS-1100 adapter, now discontinued, or the Sony FA-HS1AM adapter. Named FA-SA1AM (2-8944-030-1), Sony also provided a mechanical-only mount adapter (similar to the FS-1100 but without any contacts) with the HVL-RLAM. There are also various third-party adapters such as the Seagull SC-5 or the Yongnuo YN-H3.|$|R
40|$|Lens {{regeneration}} {{studies in}} the adult newt suggest that molecular aspects of lens regeneration are complete within 5 weeks of lentectomy. However, very {{little is known about}} the optical properties of the regenerated lens. In an aquatic environment, the lens accounts for almost all of the refractive power of the eye, and thus, a fully functional lens is critical. We compared the optical properties of 9 - and 26 -week regenerated lenses in the red spotted newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, with the original lenses removed from the same eyes. At 9 weeks, the regenerated lenses are smaller than the original lenses and are histologically immature, with a lower density of lens proteins. The 9 week lenses have greater light transmission, but significantly reduced <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and refractive <b>index</b> than the original lenses. This suggests that following 9 weeks of regeneration, the lenses have not recovered the functionality of the original lens. By 26 weeks, the transmission of light in the more mature lens is reduced, but the optical parameters of the lens have recovered enough to allow functional vision...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of effective camera <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> {{is crucial to}} the success of panoramic image stitching.

Numerical solutions of the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> demonstrate strong coupling between the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and the angles used to position each component image about the common spherical center. This paper demonstrates that parameterizing image position using distance over the sphere surface instead of angles effectively decouples the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> from the image position. This new parameterization does not require an initial <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> estimate for quick convergence, nor does it require a full circle panorama in order to refine the <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Experiments with synthetic and real image sets demonstrate the robustness of the method and a speedup of 5 to 20 times over angle based positioning...|$|R

50|$|One can {{see that}} if {{magnification}} remains constant, a longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> results in a smaller axial magnification, and a smaller <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> a larger axial magnification. That is, when using a longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> while moving the camera/lens away from the object to maintain the same magnification M, objects seem shallower, and the axial distances between objects seem shorter.
