5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E

40|$|Denaturing {{gradient}} {{gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and sequencing of the PAH locus has found 38 different mutations on 141 chromosomes in the PKU patients resident in Quebec; mutation analysis is now 92. 5 % complete. Two novel disease producing alleles (K 421, R 157 N) and one silent allele (IVS 6 nt- 55) {{were discovered in}} this project; these mutations remain unique to the Quebec population. Three novel mutation-(haplotype) combinations were also found (S 67 P (H 1), G 218 V (H 2), V 245 A (H 7)); they are not at hypermutable sites and are therefore compatible with a single homologous recombination event between two different haplotypes. Whereas mutation types (missense 64 %, nonsense 6 %, splice 9 %, frameshifts 6 %, silent 15 %), resemble those in world populations, the Quebec allele profile {{differs from that of}} any European population, reflecting range expansion, founder effects, <b>genetic</b> drift and <b>assimilation.</b> Furthermore, when analyzed by geographic region a stratification of PAH alleles is apparent, reflecting the different demographic histories of Western and Eastern Quebec and Montreal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An agro-hydrological {{simulation}} model {{is useful for}} agriculture monitoring. One issue in running such model is parameter identification, especially when the target area is large such as provincial or country level. Remote Sensing (RS) provides us with useful information over large area. RS cannot observe input parameters of agro-hydrological models directly. However, a method to estimate input parameters of such model from RS using data assimilation has been proposed by Ines [1] using the SWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant) model. Genetic Algorithm (GA) {{was used in this}} optimization process. The combined model of SWAP and GA is called SWAP-GA model. When dealing with sufficiently large and complex processing with RS data, single computers time processing extends to unacceptable limits. It becomes necessary to introduce methods for using higher processing power such as distributed computing. Cluster based computing support both high performance and load balancing parallel or distributed applications. Implementing SWAP-GA in Cluster computers will remove the computational time constraint, with this hypothesis three different parallel SWAP-GA approaches are proposed in this study. Distributed population (where GA will work on distributed manner), Distributed pixel (Pixels are processed in parallel) and Mixed of distributed population and pixel model called Hybrid model. The technical considerations of implementing such methodologies are visited here. Key words: SWAP, <b>genetic</b> algorithms, data <b>assimilation,</b> cluster computin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Following a toxic {{contaminant}} release, either accidental or intentional, {{predicting the}} transport and dispersion of the contaminant becomes a critical problem for Homeland Defense and DoD agencies. To produce accurate predictions requires characterizing both {{the source of}} hazardous material and the local meteorological conditions. Decision makers use information on contaminant source location and transport prediction {{to decide on the}} best methods to mitigate and prevent effects. The problem has both observational and computational aspects. Field monitors are likely to be used to detect the release and measure concentrations of the toxic material. Algorithms are then required to invert the problem in order to infer the characteristics of the source and the local meteorology. Here, a genetic algorithm is coupled with transport and dispersion models to assimilate sensor data in order to characterize emission sources and the wind vector. The parameters computed include two dimensional source location, amount of the release, and wind direction. This methodology is demonstrated for a basic Gaussian plume dispersion model and verified {{in the context of an}} identical twin numerical experiment, in which synthetic dispersion data is created with the same dispersion model. Error bounds are set using Monte Carlo techniques and robustness assessed by adding white noise. Algorithm speed is tuned by optimizing the parameters of the genetic algorithm. Specific GA configurations and cost function formulations are discussed. Index Terms—source inversion, <b>genetic</b> algorithm, data <b>assimilation,</b> sensor data fusion I...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{hybridization}} can be {{a serious}} threat to rare and endangered species because of the risk of extensive <b>genetic</b> swamping or <b>assimilation.</b> Hybridization, however, can be beneficial for rare species as it increases their genetic diversity, which in turn may improve their fitness and confer adaptive potential. Centaurea podospermifolia is a narrowly endemic, threatened, tetraploid species occurring only in two mountain ranges of northeastern Spain. This species may produce a highly unstable homoploid hybrid (Centaurea x loscosii) with the more widespread Centaurea cephalariifolia. Allozymes and nuclear DNA sequences (ETS and Agt 1) were used to test whether C. podospermifolia populations have undergone hybridization or introgression with C. cephalariifolia, which should have left an imprint in the genetic structure of the former. Nuclear DNA sequencing indicates that all the populations from one mountain range (the Ports Massif) are introgressed, whereas those from the second (the Cardó Range) should be regarded as 'pure'. Genetic variability detected in C. podospermifolia is low for a tetraploid species, and the occurrence of population bottlenecks may {{have played a role in}} this lack of diversity. Populations from the Ports are more variable than those from Cardó, the lower genetic variability observed for Cardó populations being unequivocally related to a lack of genetic material from C. cephalariifolia. We suggest that a management plan for C. podospermifolia should address the conservation of both the pure-bred and the introgressed populations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the methodological/statistical implications of adoptive parent knowledge for adoption methods used to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences. The sample used consisted of adoptees (n = 497) whose biological parents had been identified as either alcoholic, anti-social, or {{as a member of}} a control group in which neither alcoholism nor anti-social personality were diagnosed. The original purpose of the data set was content related in that it was intended to investigate genetic and environmental determinants of alcoholism and anti-social personality, as well as the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The present study represents a methodological approach in that the data was used, not to predict alcoholism and anti-social personality, but rather, to determine whether estimates of genetic and environmental influences can be biased, either upward or downward, depending on whether the adoptive parent was cognizant of biological parent characteristics;Baron and Kenny 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) models of moderation, mediation, and mediated moderation were used to identify potential pathways through which adoptive parent knowledge might bias the estimates of the relative contribution of genes and environment to individual differences in adoptee outcomes. Adoptee outcomes were represented by both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors and were as follows: child conduct disorder symptoms, child attention deficit disorder symptoms, aggression symptoms, adolescent self-esteem, adoptee alcohol use symptoms, and adoptee adult anti-social personality disorder;The results showed that bias does exist if one does not include estimations of adoptive parent knowledge. For females, environmental influences were underestimated, whereas for males genetic influences were underestimated. The findings were discussed within the context of already existing confounds identified in behavioral genetics research (e. g., selective placement, assortative mating, additive-nonadditive <b>genetic</b> effects, twin <b>assimilation)</b> and the potential bias these confounds might produce in estimating genetic and environmental main and/or interaction effects...|$|R

50|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> is {{a process}} by which a {{phenotype}} originally produced {{in response to an}} environmental condition, such as exposure to a teratogen, later becomes genetically encoded via artificial selection or natural selection. Despite superficial appearances, this does not require the (Lamarckian) inheritance of acquired characters, although epigenetic inheritance could potentially influence the result. <b>Genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> overcomes the barrier to selection imposed by genetic canalization of developmental pathways.|$|E
50|$|Waddington {{used the}} concept of {{canalisation}} to explain his experiments on <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation.</b> In these experiments, he exposed Drosophila pupae to heat shock. This environmental disturbance caused some flies to develop a crossveinless phenotype. He then selected for crossveinless. Eventually, the crossveinless phenotype appeared even without heat shock. Through this process of <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation,</b> an environmentally induced phenotype had become inherited. Waddington explained this as {{the formation of a}} new canal in the epigenetic landscape.|$|E
50|$|The {{classic example}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> {{was a pair of}} {{experiments}} in 1942 and 1953 by Conrad H. Waddington, in which Drosophila fruit fly embryos were exposed to ether, producing a bithorax-like phenotype (a homeotic change). Flies which developed halteres (the modified hindwings of true flies, used for balance) with wing-like characteristics were chosen for breeding for 20 generations, by which point the phenotype could be seen without ether treatment. More recent evidence appears to confirm the existence of <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> in evolution.|$|E
50|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} {{suggests that}} under certain circumstances, natural selection favours {{the evolution of}} canalization {{that is designed to}} fail under extreme conditions. If the result of such a failure is favoured by natural selection, <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> occurs. In the 1960s Waddington and J. M. Rendel argued for the importance of <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> in natural adaptation as a means of providing new and potentially beneficial variation to populations under stress, enabling them to evolve rapidly. Their contemporary George C. Williams argued that <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> proceeds at the cost of a loss of previously adaptive developmental plasticity, and therefore should be seen as resulting in a net loss rather than gain of complexity, making it uninteresting {{from the perspective of the}} constructive process of adaptation. However, the preceding phenotypic plasticity need not be adaptive, but simply represent a breakdown of canalisation.|$|E
50|$|It is, however, {{possible}} to explain <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> using only quantitative genetics and a threshold model, with {{no reference to}} the concept of canalisation. However, theoretical models that incorporate a complex genotype-phenotype map have found evidence for the evolution of phenotypic robustness contributing to <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation,</b> even when selection is only for developmental stability and not for a particular phenotype, and so the quantitative genetics models do not apply. These studies suggest that the canalisation heuristic may still be useful, beyond the more simple concept of robustness.|$|E

Other biologists such as Wallace Arthur disagree, writing that [...] "genetic assimilation, looks, but is not Lamarckian. It is a special case {{of the evolution of}} phenotypic plasticity". Adam S.

[...] In particular, according to Wilkins, Waddington felt that the Neo-Darwinians badly neglected the phenomenon of extensive gene interactions and that the 'randomness' of mutational effects, posited in the theory, was false.

50|$|Several {{instances}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> {{have been documented}} contributing to natural selection in the wild.

50|$|Waddington {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} canalisation, the ability of an organism to produce the same phenotype despite variation in genotype or environment.

5000|$|In another example, {{patterns}} of left-right asymmetry or [...] "handedness", when present, {{can be determined}} either genetically or plastically.

5000|$|Richard Benedict Goldschmidt (April 12, 1878 - April 24, 1958) was a German-born American geneticist. He is {{considered}} the first to integrate genetics, development, and evolution.

5000|$|Evolutionary {{capacitance}} is {{the storage}} and release of variation, just as electric capacitors store and release charge. Living systems are robust to mutations. This means that living systems accumulate genetic variation without the variation having a phenotypic effect. But {{when the system}} is disturbed (perhaps by stress), robustness breaks down, and the variation has phenotypic effects and {{is subject to the}} full force of natural selection. An evolutionary capacitor is a molecular switch mechanism that can [...] "toggle" [...] genetic variation between hidden and revealed states. [...] If some subset of newly revealed variation is adaptive, it becomes fixed by <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation.</b> After that, the rest of variation, most of which is presumably deleterious, can be switched off, leaving the population with a newly evolved advantageous trait, but no long-term handicap. For evolutionary capacitance to increase evolvability in this way, the switching rate should not be faster than the timescale of <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Waddington {{proposed}} an evolutionary process, [...] "genetic assimilation", as a Darwinian mechanism that allows certain acquired characteristic to become heritable. According to Navis, (2007) [...] "Waddington focused his <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation</b> {{work on the}} crossveinless trait of Drosophila.

5000|$|Learning biases phenotypes in a {{beneficial}} direction. But an exploratory flattening of the fitness landscape can also increase evolvability {{even when it}} has no direction, for example when the flattening {{is a result of}} random errors in molecular and/or developmental processes. This increase in evolvability can happen when evolution is faced with crossing a [...] "valley" [...] in an adaptive landscape. This means that two mutations exist that are deleterious by themselves, but beneficial in combination. These combinations can evolve more easily when the landscape is first flattened, and the discovered phenotype is then fixed by <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Insofar as genetic {{changes are}} concerned, {{emerging}} {{evidence suggests that}} a nexus between transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, and between transcription factors and DNA repair proteins {{that are part of}} large PINs, can facilitate such changes. With regard to <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation,</b> Waddington proposed that it is the process in which an environmental stimulus that affects the phenotype has been superseded by an internal genetic factor during the course of evolution. While such mechanisms could potentially account for permanent changes in the diploid genome of the cancer cell or other unicellular organisms, how information to activate such an internal genetic switch is transmitted to the germline for stable inheritance in metazoans reproducing sexually remains an important and intriguing question.|$|E
50|$|Waddington {{called the}} effect {{he had seen}} <b>genetic</b> <b>assimilation.</b> His {{explanation}} {{was that it was}} caused by a process he called canalization. He compared embryonic development to a ball rolling down a slope in what he called an epigenetic landscape, where each point on the landscape is a possible state of the organism (involving many variables). As a particular pathway becomes entrenched or canalized, it becomes more stable, likely to occur {{even in the face of}} environmental changes. Major perturbations such as ether or heat shock eject the developmental pathway from the canal, exploring other parts of the epigenetic landscape. Selection in the presence of that perturbation leads to the evolution of a new canal; after the perturbation is discontinued, the new canal continues to attract developmental trajectories.|$|E
