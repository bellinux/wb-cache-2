40|$|Abstract. We {{reported}} the preparation and electrochemical properties of fluorinated mesoporous carbon foams (F-MCFs) for application as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). By using fluorinated resol which {{was obtained from}} the polymerization of formaldehyde, phenol, and 3 -fluorophenol as the carbon source and <b>fluorin</b> precursor, and triblock copolymer F 127 as a template, F-MCFs were prepared through evaporation induced self-assembly strategy. The F-MCFs were characterized by N 2 adsorption and desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results indicate that the F-MCFs possess highly ordered mesostructure with a specific surface area of 675 m 2 /g, a uniform pore size of 2. 2 nm and a pore volume of 0. 12 cm 3 /g. The wettability of F-MCFs was investigated by contact angle analysis. The contact angle of F-MCFs for water is 111. 5 o, much lower than that of mesoporous carbon foams (MCFs) (141 o), indicating that the surface wettability of F-MCFs is improved by the introduction of <b>fluorin</b> into the carbon matrix. The enhancement of wettability would increase the surface contact of electrolyte and electrode and accelerate the ion transfer within the pore channel, and thus improve the electrochemical properties of F-MCFs. The electrochemical properties of the F-MCFs have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge in electrolyte of 6 mol/L KOH with a three-electrode system. F-MCFs present linear galvanostatic charge-discharge curve at a loading current of 10 mA, and possess good charge-discharge efficiency over 98 %. The specific capacitance of the F-MCFs is 220 F/g, significantly higher than that of the MCFs (140 F/g). F-MCFs show important prospect as electrode materials for the application in EDLCs...|$|E

Data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) were used to analyze 26 lines of sight lying both in the galactic disk and halo, including lines to Wolf-Rayet stars and through known supernova remnants. The equivalent widths of fluorine resonance lines at 951. 871 ˚A and 954. 827 ˚A were measured or assigned upper limits and combined with a nitrogen curve of growth to obtain F I column densities. These column densities were then used to calculate fluorine depletions. Comparisons are made to the previous study of F I by Federman et al.

Here, the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CuF 2 are studied by the first-principles calculations within both the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U frameworks. Our {{results show that the}} antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration of CuF 2 is more stable than the ferromagnetic (FM) one, which is consistent with experiments. The analysis of the electronic density of states (DOS) shows that CuF 2 is a classic Mott-Hubbard insulator with a large d-d type band gap, which is similar to the case of FeF 3.

40|$|We present {{nucleosynthesis}} {{calculations and}} the resulting 19 F stellar yields for a large set of models with different masses and metallicity. During the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase 19 F is produced {{as a consequence of}} nucleosynthesis occurring during the convective thermal pulses and also during the interpulse periods if protons from the envelope are partially mixed in the top layers of the He intershell (partial mixing zone). We find that the production of fluorine depends on the temperature of the convective pulses, the amount of primary 12 C mixed into the envelope by third dredge up and the extent of the partial mixing zone. Then we perform a detailed analysis of the reaction rates involved in the production of 19 F and the effects of their uncertainties. We find that the major uncertainties are associated with the 14 C(α, γ) 18 O and the 19 F(α, p) 22 Ne reaction rates. For these two reactions we present new estimates of the rates and their uncertainties. In both cases the revised rates are lower than previous estimates.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{resolution}} to the puzzle presented by the surface defects observed with STM at the (111) surface facet of CeO 2 single crystals. In the seminal paper of Esch et al. [Science 309, 752 (2005) ] they were identified with oxygen vacancies, but the observed behavior of these defects is inconsistent {{with the results of}} density functional theory (DFT) studies of oxygen vacancies in the literature. We resolve these inconsistencies via DFT calculations of the properties of both oxygen vacancies and fluorine impurities at CeO 2 (111), the latter having recently been shown to exist in high concentrations in single crystals from a widely used commercial source of such samples. We find that the simulated filled-state STM images of surface-layer oxygen vacancies and fluorine impurities are essentially identical, which would render problematic their experimental distinction by such images alone. However, we find that our theoretical results for the most stable location, mobility, and tendency to cluster, of fluorine impurities are consistent with experimental observations, in contrast to those for oxygen vacancies. Based on these results, we propose that the surface defects observed in STM experiments on CeO 2 single crystals reported heretofore were not oxygen vacancies, but fluorine impurities. Since the similarity of the simulated STM images of the two defects is due primarily to the relative energies of the 2 p states of oxygen and fluorine ions, this confusion might also occur for other oxides which have been either doped or contaminated with <b>fluorin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Applications for TiAlN- and TiO 2 -coatings with Nanoscale Surface Topographies F. Burmeister, C. Kohn, R. Kuebler, G. Kleer, Fraunhofer Institut für Werkstof fmechanik, Freiburg, Germany; B. Bläsi, A. Gombert, Fraunhofer Institut für Solare Energiesysteme, Freiburg, Germany This {{paper is}} {{to report on the}} {{development}} of nanostructured, multifunctional TiAlN- and TiO 2 -coatings where the multifunctionality stems from their nanoscale surface topography. The coatings were sputter-deposited on silicon and steel substrates by a reactive RF-magnetron-process. For both types of coatings deposition parameters which led to a columnar growth with mean column diameters between 100 nm and 500 nm were elaborated. The columns itself were terminated by pyramid-shaped tips where the geometric forms of the pyramids were determined by the crystal system of the coating material. In vestigations of microstructure and surface morphology were carried out with scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques. A power law was found for the dependence of the mean column diameter on coating thickness in qualitative agreement with phenomenological models for thin film growth. In order to test the coatings suitability for industrial applications, both coating materials were deposited on steel tools and replicated into the surfaces of PMMA sheets. The resulting sheets surface morphologies proved to be comparable to the antireflective surfaces of motheyes and led to a pronounced decrease in reflectivity. A second possible application, namely the modification of wetting properties of surfaces due to their structuring, was tested by <b>fluorin</b> ation of the nanostructured TiO 2 -surface which led to an ultrahydrophobic surface with water contact angles up to 150 °...|$|E

Despite the moderately high wt% of <b>fluorin</b> in the polymer structure (23. 8 %), these polymers had poor fuel resistance. In fact, swelling measurements indicate that these polymers had apparent solubility parameters of about 18. 2 J (exp 1 / 2) m (exp - 3 / 2) (toluene). Copolymerization of the disilanol monomers with fluorosilicone monomers afforded copolymers containing 20 - 30 wt% of the perfluorocyclobutane-containing structure displayed adequate fuel resistance, enhanced thermal stability, and a Tg low enough {{to meet the requirements}} of a High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) fuel tank sealant. In the second part of this work, trifluorovinylether-terminated oligomers were prepared and polymerized via cyclodimerization. Initially, an alpha, omega-silanol-terminated fluorosilicone was endcapped with trifluorovinylether end groups via a two-step synthetic sequence. The oligomer was thermally cyclodimerized to a polymer that displayed thermal stability similar to that of a fluorosilicone homopolymer. Second, 1, 3 -bis[4 -trifluorovinyl(oxy) phenyl]- 1, 3 -(3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropyl) dimethyldisiloxane and 1, 3 -bis{ 3 -trifluorovinyl(oxy) phenyl]- 1, 3 -(3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropyl) dimethyldisiloxane were prepared and cyclodimerized to afford polymers that contained pendant trifluoropropyl groups. The pendant trifluoropropyl groups did enhance solvent resistance in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, however, no improvement was observed in aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. These polymers also displayed excellent thermal stability. In the last part of this work, a series of monomers was prepared by the DCC-promoted esterification of 4 -[trifluorovinyl(oxy) benzoic acid with alpha, omega-functionalized hydrogenated and partially fluorinated alcohols. The monomers were cyclodimerized to the corresponding polymers. The polymers that did not contain beta hydrogens displayed significantly higher thermal stability than the fully hydrogenated polymers. A commercially-available alpha,omega-hydroxy-terminated perfluoropolyether was then functionalized with 4 -[trifluorovinyl(oxy) benzoylchloride. An attempt was made to polymerize the resulting oligomer via the cyclodimerization of the terminal trifluorovinylether moieties. Although the viscosity of the oligomer increased significantly during polymerization, Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis revealed that the Tetrahydrofuran (THF) soluble portion of the polymer did not have high molecular weight...|$|E
