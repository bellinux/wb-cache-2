25|$|Shure {{introduced}} the Automatic Microphone System (AMS) in 1983, {{one of the}} first automatic, high-quality mixer system using directional gating <b>for</b> <b>installations</b> utilizing multiple microphones. In 1987, Shure SCM810 Automatic Mixer installations begin at the United States Capitol, and by 1997, the US Capitol was one of the largest Shure automatic mixer installations in the world.

25|$|Mobile UDDTs are {{typically}} either fabricated of new materials {{in a factory}} or workshop using a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf parts—and then sold to the public either directly or via distributors or retail outlets; or fabricated at home out of wood, using new and re-purposed parts and materials. They {{are typically}} compact and lightweight, allowing one person to easily lift, transport, and maneuver them into place. Likewise, installation is a relatively simple process given that everything needed for the proper functioning of the toilet, except a source of electrical power for those models that include a fan and some allowance for exterior ventilation, is contained within the molded or wooden carcass. One advantage {{of this type of}} UDDT is that they are portable, making them an interesting option for remote or temporary installations and <b>for</b> <b>installations</b> aboard moving vehicles or non-stationary residences such as boats, recreational-vehicles (i.e. caravan, camper van, motor home) and tiny-houses.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, Spain, Italy, Greece—that enjoyed {{an early}} success with {{domestic}} solar-thermal installations for hot water needs—and France introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively {{less and less}} attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30-50% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic [...] "solar roof" [...] programme (adopted in June 2009 <b>for</b> <b>installations</b> up to 10kW) has internal rates of return of 10-15% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax free.|$|E
500|$|During the Parkview era several masterplans for {{the site}} were {{developed}} by various architects and subsequently discarded. One notable plan, called simply [...] "The Power Station", was masterminded by architect Nicholas Grimshaw. The scheme proposed a shopping mall, with 40 to 50 restaurants, cafés and bars, 180 shops, as well as nightclubs, comedy venues and a cinema. Cosmopolitan shops would have been sited in the A Station's turbine hall, and label name shops in the B Station's turbine hall. The boiler house would have been glazed over and used as a public space <b>for</b> <b>installations</b> and exhibitions. A riverside walkway would also be created, running continuously along the riverside from Vauxhall to Battersea Park.|$|E

2500|$|Eglin's east-west runway 12/30 {{was closed}} on 1 May 2015 to allow {{upgrading}} of aircraft arresting systems from obsolete BAK-9 systems to MB-100 textile brake systems.

[...] "Closing Runway 12/30 may slightly increase noise over Valparaiso for a few months," [...] said Mark Pohlmeier, acting {{deputy assistant secretary of}} the Air Force <b>for</b> <b>installations,</b> in a news release.
