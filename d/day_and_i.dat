It was a decision a second. It was so big and so unwieldy and everybody had a problem all the time, every <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was under so much pressure. It was unbelievable. ... I put too many fine details into something {{that was going to}} be seen (indicates tiny figure with his finger and thumb) this big." ...|$|E
500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E

I heard later on that Steven had watched a few girls on tape that <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{was the only one}} who ended up waking his {{sleeping}} wife off the couch, and she came running through the hallway to see if the kids were all right." [...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film. Robin Wright turned down a role in the film. Christina Ricci auditioned for a role, but did not receive it.|$|E

500|$|In January 1969, Kennedy {{defeated}} Louisiana Senator Russell B. Long by a 31–26 margin {{to become}} Senate Majority Whip, the youngest person to attain that position. While this further boosted his presidential image, he also appeared conflicted by {{the inevitability of}} having {{to run for the}} position; [...] "Few who knew him doubted that in one sense he very much wanted to take that path", Time magazine reported, but [...] "he had a fatalistic, almost doomed feeling about the prospect". The reluctance was in part due to the danger; Kennedy reportedly observed, [...] "I know that I'm going to get my ass shot off one <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't want to." [...] Indeed, there were a constant series of death threats made against Kennedy for {{much of the rest of}} his career.|$|E
500|$|Somalia was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Mohamed Daud Mohamed, a 5000 metres runner. It marked his first appearance at an international athletics competition, following a transition into athletics from football. He said prior to the Olympics, [...] "I am improving by the <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope to improve on my finish time. Running is hard and all athletes aim to win. My objective is to win; but there are different ways of winning. It is not about being first, second or third. If I set a new personal record, it is a win for me". Mohamed competed on 17 August in the first heat of the 5000 metres, finishing in 24th position out of the 25 runners, only ahead of Rosefelo Siosi of the Solomon Islands, thus eliminating him from the competition.|$|E
500|$|Andre Ethier, Russell Martin and Wilson Valdez {{managed to}} each earn three hits each during the Dodgers game. Ethier {{hit a home}} run which drove in the first four runs of the season for the Dodgers, who stole five bases — their most since August 23, 1999 when they stole seven in a game at Milwaukee. [...] "It's kind of cool to have a decent game on Jackie Robinson Day," [...] Martin said. [...] "I’m going to {{remember}} this probably {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Randy Wolf, who was playing for the Dodgers at the time (currently a free agent) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings and struck out seven. [...] "The whole team wearing No. 42, it kind of goes sour if we don’t win," [...] Wolf said. [...] "It was great. There were a lot of special people here. It's a special <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think they did it right." [...] The San Diego Padres' José Cruz, Jr. hit his 200th career home run.|$|E

500|$|The first logicians {{to debate}} {{conditional}} statements were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo. Writing five-hundred years later, Sextus Empiricus {{refers to a}} debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct antecedent had an incorrect consequent, and this meant a proposition such as [...] "if it is day, then I am talking," [...] is true unless it is <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fall silent. But Diodorus argued that a true conditional {{is one in which}} the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion – thus, because the proposition [...] "if it is day, then I am talking" [...] can be false, it is invalid. However, paradoxical propositions were still possible such as [...] "if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists." [...] Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible: to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent. This corresponds to the modern-day strict conditional.|$|E
500|$|Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on {{the streets}} of Canberra in 1984, while they were both {{attending}} university. Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> walked up to him and we did 'Wild Thing'. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E
500|$|According to Entertainment Weekly, MDNA World Tour {{shed light}} on the impact Madonna has had on the younger {{generation}} of artists, dancers, and general fans [...] "who refuse to conform for conformity's sake". Tull took the best moments from the 88different concerts of the tour, to create a cohesive documentary. He recalled that there were numerous footage available from the tour and they had to find the [...] "perfect" [...] shot for Madonna. He gave an example that the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] had cuts from 50 countries alone. [...] "It was really intense. I think I looked down one <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'Oh, my fingers are about to fall off'. But it was worth it", Tull concluded. A preview for the DVD was first shown at the Billboard Music Awards and another preview was released in June 2013, showing the singer performing [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] on the tour, the lead single from MDNA. Another video showed Madonna auditioning for the dancers, while singing an acoustic version of her 2001 single, [...] "Don't Tell Me".|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Robinson {{returned}} to the ring. Although he had been inactive {{for two and a}} half years, his work as a dancer kept him in peak physical condition: in his autobiography, Robinson states that in the weeks leading up to his debut for a dancing engagement in France, he ran five miles every morning, and then danced for five hours each night. Robinson even stated that the training he did in his attempts to establish a career as a dancer were harder than any he undertook during his boxing career. He won five fights in 1955, before losing a decision to Ralph 'Tiger' Jones. He bounced back, however, and defeated Rocky Castellani by a split decision, then challenged Bobo Olson for the world middleweight title. He won the middleweight championship for the third time via a second-round knockout—his third victory over Olson. After his comeback performance in 1955, Robinson expected to be named fighter of the year. However, the title went to welterweight Carmen Basilio. Basilio's handlers had lobbied heavily for it on the basis that he had never won the award, and Robinson later described this as the biggest disappointment of his professional career. [...] "I haven't forgotten it to this <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never will", Robinson wrote in his autobiography. They fought for the last time in 1956, and Robinson closed the four fight series with a fourth-round knockout.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> make it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E
