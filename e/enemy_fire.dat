5|$|Hospitalman Third Class (then Hospitalman) Phil Isadore Valdez, from New Mexico, was posthumously {{awarded the}} Navy Cross {{for his actions}} on January 29, 1967. On that date Valdez ran over seventy-five yards of open terrain, under {{constant}} <b>enemy</b> <b>fire,</b> to aid a fallen Marine. He then moved the wounded man to a safe area and, quickly and competently, rendered medical assistance. Again exposing himself to <b>enemy</b> <b>fire,</b> Valdez moved across approximately fifty yards of open ground to another Marine. While treating the second Marine, he positioned himself between {{the man and the}} hostile fire. It was at this time that Valdez was mortally wounded by enemy small-arms fire.|$|E
5|$|In rough {{seas and}} under <b>enemy</b> <b>fire,</b> the commandos began {{disembarking}} at Jig, some distance east of their intended position, at 09:50. Five of their LCAs were sunk by beach obstacles or <b>enemy</b> <b>fire,</b> {{at the cost}} of 76 casualties. Major P. M. Donnell temporarily took charge until Phillips and some others who had got separated from the unit rejoined the group at 14:00 along the Meuvaines–Le Carrefour road. The commando took additional casualties in several skirmishes, including at La Rosière, on the way to Point 72. They did not arrive there until 22:30, too late to launch an attack, so they dug in for the night. The town and port were captured in the battle of Port-en-Bessin on 7–8 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Daniel Keighran of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment {{was awarded}} the Victoria Cross for Australia on 1 November 2012 for actions in the Battle of Derapet (Oruzgan province, Afghanistan) in August 2010. Corporal Keighran {{deliberately}} exposed himself to <b>enemy</b> <b>fire,</b> drawing the fire away from an injured colleague {{and those who were}} attending to him. He is the third recipient, and the first non-Special Forces recipient, of the award.|$|E
50|$|Counterbattery fire: {{delivered}} for {{the purpose}} of destroying or neutralizing the <b>enemy's</b> <b>fire</b> support system.|$|R

5000|$|Rescued {{a wounded}} comrade who lay {{exposed to the}} <b>enemy's</b> <b>fire,</b> {{receiving}} a severe wound in the effort.|$|R
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{frequently}} carried torpedo tubes themselves. In theory, {{a line of}} battleships so equipped could unleash {{a devastating}} volley of torpedoes on an enemy line steaming a parallel course. In practice, torpedoes fired from battleships scored very few hits, {{and there was a}} risk that a stored torpedo would cause a dangerous explosion if hit by <b>enemy</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Forward Operating Base Chapman {{is located}} at the site of a former Afghan army {{installation}} with an airstrip. The base is named for Sergeant First Class Nathan Chapman, the first U.S. soldier killed by <b>enemy</b> <b>fire</b> during the Afghanistan war. Chapman was killed while fighting alongside the CIA in 2002. FOB Chapman is located near Forward Operating Base Salerno, a military base used by U.S. special operations forces.|$|E
5|$|Hichens {{lost the}} first boat {{under his command}} during the night action 2/3 October 1942. Engaging four {{trawlers}} MGB 78 went in for a depth charge attack and was lost to <b>enemy</b> <b>fire.</b> Another boat, MGB 76, was lost during the night of 5/6 October 1942, when the flotilla was ambushed by two German torpedo boats {{and a number of}} E boats.|$|E

60|$|The Baltimore {{suffered}} most at {{the beginning}} of this second round, because all the <b>enemy’s</b> <b>fire</b> was concentrated upon her.|$|R
5000|$|Border Down {{features}} difficulty {{settings that}} are switched during gameplay. There are three difficulties to a level, called [...] "borders", green being the easiest whereas red is the hardest. The green [...] "border" [...] {{is the longest}} variation on a level, but the <b>enemies</b> <b>fire</b> far less frequently. The red [...] "border" [...] is the shortest variation on a level, but the <b>enemies</b> <b>fire</b> at a frantic rate, making it increasingly more difficult to stay alive.|$|R
5|$|Later in the game, {{the player}} acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a {{standard}} fire mode, {{the ability to}} create force fields to block <b>enemy</b> <b>fire,</b> and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player {{to take advantage of the}} three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.|$|E
5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German units used the Rommelspargel for defense, by cutting them down and using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend described how his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and protect them from <b>enemy</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery. An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to <b>enemy</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was now fast {{becoming}} dark, and the flashes of the <b>enemy's</b> <b>fire,</b> {{from behind the}} rocks, showed how numerous were the assailants.|$|R

5|$|The first Victoria Cross for Australia {{was awarded}} to Trooper Mark Donaldson of the Special Air Service Regiment by Governor-General Quentin Bryce at Government House, Canberra on 16 January 2009. On 2 September 2008, Donaldson rescued an {{interpreter}} under heavy <b>enemy</b> <b>fire</b> in Oruzgan province during Operation Slipper, the Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering <b>enemy</b> <b>fire</b> became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|At 80years of age, Buckner memorized five of Shakespeare's plays because {{cataracts}} {{threatened to}} blind him, but an operation saved his sight. On {{a visit to}} the White House in 1904, Buckner asked President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint his only son as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed. His son would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the Battle of Okinawa, making him the highest-ranking American to have been killed by <b>enemy</b> <b>fire</b> during World War II.|$|E
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} a hot cross-fire was opened upon a company {{commanded}} by Captain Woodgate, which was stationed half-way between the laager {{and the upper}} fort, keeping open a communication between them, the <b>enemy's</b> <b>fire</b> from a height commanding this line being particularly galling. Two of Tremlett's guns were {{brought to bear on}} the point, and the <b>enemy's</b> <b>fire</b> speedily slackened. For another hour and a half the troops continued to be hotly engaged, for the enemy, when driven back from one flank, swept round in most perfect order and attacked another.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by <b>enemy</b> <b>fire,</b> and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Posen and several other battleships from the I Battle Squadron took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship had fired fifty-three 28cm shells, sixty-four 15cm rounds, and thirty-two 8.8cm shells. The ship and her crew emerged from the battle completely unscathed by <b>enemy</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the twelve}} LCPRs had been damaged. Three were soon repaired, {{but they could not}} be risked further, for without them, the {{reconnaissance}} force could not be evacuated. The emergency plan provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would clearly be a desperate measure indeed. Over the next four hours, the boats continued to make trips to the beach, but only when it was believed destroyers had suppressed <b>enemy</b> <b>fire.</b> Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility. The last destroyer was unloaded at 12:50. By this time, the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded.|$|E
60|$|Presently the <b>enemy's</b> <b>fire</b> became {{still more}} furious and, several times, {{some of them}} rose and ran two paces forward, but only to fall prone under the defenders' fire.|$|R
