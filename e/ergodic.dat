5|$|The {{field of}} <b>ergodic</b> theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that <b>ergodic</b> theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E
5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the <b>ergodic</b> axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The <b>ergodic</b> axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the <b>ergodic</b> assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the <b>ergodic</b> theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Polish Jewish family, Ulam studied {{mathematics}} at the Lwów Polytechnic Institute, where {{he earned his}} PhD in 1933 {{under the supervision of}} Kazimierz Kuratowski. In 1935, John von Neumann, whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he worked to establish important results regarding <b>ergodic</b> theory. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States a for the last time with his 17-year-old brother Adam Ulam. He became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1940, and a United States citizen in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied {{from this point of}} view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and <b>ergodic</b> theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of <b>ergodic</b> theory.|$|E
25|$|A state i {{is said to}} be <b>ergodic</b> if it is {{aperiodic}} {{and positive}} recurrent. In other words, a state i is <b>ergodic</b> if it is recurrent, has a period of 1, and has finite mean recurrence time. If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are <b>ergodic,</b> then the chain {{is said to be}} <b>ergodic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{concepts}} of ergodicity and the <b>ergodic</b> hypothesis {{are central to}} applications of <b>ergodic</b> theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties {{is equal to the}} average over the entire space. Applications of <b>ergodic</b> theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of <b>ergodic</b> theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. <b>Ergodic</b> theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} metric {{classification}} of systems {{is another important}} part of the abstract <b>ergodic</b> theory. An outstanding role in <b>ergodic</b> theory and its applications to stochastic processes is played by the various notions of entropy for dynamical systems.|$|E

25|$|Let (X, Σ, μ) be {{as above}} a {{probability}} {{space with a}} measure preserving transformation T, and let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. The conditional expectation {{with respect to the}} sub-σ-algebra ΣT of the T-invariant sets is a linear projector ET of norm 1 of the Banach space Lp(X, Σ, μ) onto its closed subspace Lp(X, ΣT, μ) The latter may also be characterized as the space of all T-invariant Lp-functions on X. The <b>ergodic</b> means, as linear operators on Lp(X, Σ, μ) also have unit operator norm; and, as a simple consequence of the Birkhoff–Khinchin theorem, converge to the projector ET in the strong operator topology of Lp if 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, and in the weak operator topology if p = ∞. More is true if 1 < p ≤ ∞ then the Wiener–Yoshida–Kakutani <b>ergodic</b> dominated convergence theorem states that the <b>ergodic</b> means of ƒ ∈ Lp are dominated in Lp; however, if ƒ ∈ L1, the <b>ergodic</b> means may fail to be equidominated in Lp. Finally, if ƒ is assumed to be in the Zygmund class, that is |ƒ| log+(|ƒ|) is integrable, then the <b>ergodic</b> means are even dominated in L1.|$|E

25|$|The law of equipartition holds {{only for}} <b>ergodic</b> systems in thermal equilibrium, which implies that all {{states with the}} same energy must be equally likely to be populated. Consequently, it must be {{possible}} to exchange energy among all its various forms within the system, or with an external heat bath in the canonical ensemble. The number of physical systems that have been rigorously proven to be <b>ergodic</b> is small; a famous example is the hard-sphere system of Yakov Sinai. The requirements for isolated systems to ensure ergodicity—and, thus equipartition—have been studied, and provided motivation for the modern chaos theory of dynamical systems. A chaotic Hamiltonian system need not be <b>ergodic,</b> although that is usually a good assumption.|$|E

(For type III0 calling this a classification is a little misleading, as it is known that there is no easy way to classify the corresponding <b>ergodic</b> flows.)

25|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} forms {{a separate}} field, {{which includes the}} theory of phase transitions.

25|$|Measure {{theory was}} {{developed}} in successive stages during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Émile Borel, Henri Lebesgue, Johann Radon, and Maurice Fréchet, among others. The main applications of measures are in {{the foundations of the}} Lebesgue integral, in Andrey Kolmogorov's axiomatisation of probability theory and in <b>ergodic</b> theory. In integration theory, specifying a measure allows one to define integrals on spaces more general than subsets of Euclidean space; moreover, the integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean spaces is more general and has a richer theory than its predecessor, the Riemann integral. Probability theory considers measures that assign to the whole set the size 1, and considers measurable subsets to be events whose probability is given by the measure. <b>Ergodic</b> theory considers measures that are invariant under, or arise naturally from, a dynamical system.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{assume that}} the measure space (X, Σ, μ) models the {{particles}} of a gas as above, and let ƒ(x) denote the velocity of the particle at position x.

25|$|Dispersing {{boundary}} {{plays the}} same role for billiards as negative curvature does for geodesic flows causing the exponential instability of the dynamics. It is precisely this dispersing mechanism that gives dispersing billiards their strongest chaotic properties, as it was established by Yakov G. Sinai.
