25|$|The Saturn V {{launch vehicle}} {{was guided by}} navigation, guidance, and control {{equipment}} located in the IU. A space stabilized platform (the ST-124-M3 inertial platform at location 21) measured acceleration and attitude. A launch vehicle digital computer (LVDC at location 19) solved guidance equations, and an analog <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer</b> (location 16) issued commands to steer the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Since 2004, South Korean firm LIG Nex1 {{has been}} {{manufacturing}} the F-15's Head-up display; a {{total number of}} 150 HUDs were delivered by 2011. LIG Nex1 had been {{a participant in the}} F-15K program as a subcontractor to Rockwell Collins. LIG Nex1 is also preparing to manufacture F-15's new multi-function display and <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer.</b> Also since 2004, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) has produced the wings and forward fuselages of the F-15; in 2008, KAI established another production line for Singapore's F-15SG. KAI is involved in the development and manufacture of the Conformal Weapons Bay (CWB) to be used on the F-15 Silent Eagle.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian and Italian {{aircraft}} differ {{considerably in}} their avionics, Italian aircraft being equipped with various NATO systems which were considered redundant in the South American theatre. AMXs in Brazilian service are often fitted {{with one of}} three pallet-mounted sensor packages, which contain various vertical, oblique, and forward-facing cameras, for performing the aircraft's secondary aerial reconnaissance role. A simple ranging radar is equipped for targeting purposes, however the specific radar also differs between both operators. The flight system employs a GE Avionics <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer.</b> Extensive electronic countermeasure (ECM) are fitted to protect the aircraft, include passive receiver antenna on the tailfin and an active jammer pod that is typically mounted {{on one of the}} aircraft's hardpoints.|$|E

25|$|The Saturn V Instrument Unit is a {{ring-shaped}} structure {{fitted to}} the top of the Saturn V rocket's third stage (S-IVB) and the Saturn IB's second stage (also an S-IVB). It was immediately below the SLA (Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter) panels that contained the Lunar Module. The Instrument Unit contains the guidance system for the Saturn V rocket. Some of the electronics contained within the Instrument Unit are a digital computer, analog <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer,</b> emergency detection system, inertial guidance platform, control accelerometers and control rate gyros. The instrument unit (IU) for Saturn V was designed by NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and was developed from the Saturn I IU. NASA's contractor to construct the Saturn V Instrument Unit was International Business Machines (IBM).|$|E
25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer.</b> The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E
25|$|Canted {{vertical}} stabilizers {{are another}} distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high {{angle of attack}} ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps and <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer</b> programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.|$|E

50|$|Mastracchio {{worked for}} Hamilton Standard in Connecticut as an {{engineer}} in the system design group from 1982 until 1987. During that time, he participated {{in the development of}} high performance, inertial measurement units and <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer</b> (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E
500|$|To {{counter the}} {{tendency}} to depart from controlled flight—and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a quadruplex (four-channel) fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FLCS). The <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer</b> (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces {{in such a way}} as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss. The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft's flight attitude to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path; leading to a common aphorism among pilots: [...] "You don't fly an F-16; it flies you." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{originally}} planned that the ports would connect to [...] modules {{derived from the}} Soyuz spacecraft. These modules would have used a Soyuz propulsion module, as in Soyuz and Progress, and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module. Following a February 1979 governmental resolution, the programme was consolidated with Vladimir Chelomei's manned Almaz military space station programme. The docking ports were reinforced to accommodate [...] space station modules based on the TKS spacecraft. NPO Energia {{was responsible for the}} overall space station, with work subcontracted to KB Salyut, due to ongoing work on the Energia rocket and Salyut 7, Soyuz-T, and Progress spacecraft. KB Salyut began work in 1979, and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983. New systems incorporated into the station included the Salyut 5B digital <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer</b> and gyrodyne flywheels (taken from Almaz), Kurs automatic rendezvous system, Luch satellite communications system, Elektron oxygen generators, and Vozdukh carbon dioxide scrubbers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the rear fuselage's internal area was used to house electronics, such as elements of the radio, equipment supporting the aircraft's radar functionality, and the crew's liquid oxygen life support system; the whole compartment was actively cooled by ram air drawn from the tailfin. [...] For redundancy, the Buccaneer featured dual busbars for electrical systems, and three independent hydraulic systems.

The solar arrays provide power for the aircraft's electric motors, avionics, communications and other electronic systems. Pathfinder also had a backup battery system that can provide power for between two and five hours to allow limited-duration flight after dark.|$|E

50|$|Multiple {{instructions}} {{operate on}} one data stream. Uncommon architecture {{which is generally}} used for fault tolerance.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is controlled}} by three primary <b>control</b> <b>computers</b> (captain's, first officer's, and standby) and two secondary <b>control</b> <b>computers</b> (captain's and first officer's). In addition there are two <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> data <b>computers</b> (FCDC) that read information from the sensors, such as air data (airspeed, altitude). This is fed along with GPS data, into three redundant processing units known as air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs) that act both as an air data reference and inertial reference. ADIRUs {{are part of the}} air data inertial reference system, which, on the Airbus is linked to eight air data modules: three are linked to pitot tubes and five are linked to static sources. Information from the ADIRU is fed into one of several <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computers</b> (primary and secondary <b>flight</b> <b>control).</b> The <b>computers</b> also receive information from the control surfaces of the aircraft and from the pilots aircraft control devices and autopilot. Information from these computers is sent both to the pilot's primary flight display and also to the control surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|From an {{avionics}} safety perspective, a CAT IIIc landing is the [...] "worst-case scenario" [...] {{for safety}} analysis because {{a failure of}} the automatic systems from flare through the roll-out could easily result in a [...] "hard over" [...] (where a control surface deflects fully in one direction.) This would happen so fast that the flight crew may not effectively respond. For this reason Autoland systems are designed to incorporate a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active) and a second failure can be detected - at which point the autoland system will turn itself off (uncouple, fail passive). One way of accomplishing this is to have [...] "three of everything." [...] Three ILS receivers, three radio altimeters, three <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computers,</b> and three ways of <b>controlling</b> the <b>flight</b> surfaces. The three <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computers</b> all work in parallel and are in constant cross communications, comparing their inputs (ILS receivers and radio altimeters) with those of the other two <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computers.</b> If there is a difference in inputs, then a computer can [...] "vote out" [...] the deviant input and will notify the other computers that [...] "RA1 is faulty." [...] If the outputs don't match, a computer can declare itself as faulty and, if possible, take itself off line.|$|R
25|$|A {{fly-by-wire}} (FBW) system replaces manual <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> of {{an aircraft}} {{with an electronic}} interface. The movements of <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computers</b> determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response.

50|$|For CAT IIIc, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer</b> will {{continue}} to accept deviations from the localizer and use the rudder to maintain the aircraft on the localizer (which is aligned with the runway centerline.) On landing the spoilers will deploy (these are surfaces {{on the top of}} the wing towards the trailing edge) which causes airflow over the wing to become turbulent, destroying lift. At the same time the autobrake system will apply the brakes. The anti-skid system will modulate brake pressure to keep all wheels turning. As the speed decreases, the rudder will lose effectiveness and the pilot will need to control the direction of the airplane using nose wheel steering, a system which typically is not connected to the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Radio-controlled {{aircraft}} have a transmitter {{operated by}} the controller, sending signals to a receiver in the model which in turn actuates servos which manipulate the model's <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> {{in a similar manner}} to a full sized aircraft. In traditional aircraft, the radio has directly controlled the servos. However, modern aircraft often use <b>flight</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>computers</b> to stabilize an aircraft or even to fly the aircraft autonomously. This is particularly the case with quadcopters.|$|R
50|$|Fly-by-wire (FBW) is {{a system}} that replaces the {{conventional}} manual <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> of an aircraft with an electronic interface.

The fly-by-wire system also allows automatic signals sent by the aircraft's computers to perform functions without the pilot's input, as in systems that automatically help stabilize the aircraft, or prevent unsafe operation of the aircraft outside of its performance envelope.|$|R
