40|$|The {{addition}} of insulation to {{the exterior of}} buildings is {{an effective means of}} increasing the thermal resistance of both wood framed walls as well as mass masonry wall assemblies. For thick layers of exterior insulation (levels greater than 1. 5 inches), the use of wood furring strips attached through the insulation back to the structure has been used by many contractors and designers as a means to provide a convenient cladding attachment location (Straube and Smegal 2009, Pettit 2009, Joyce 2009, Ueno 2010). The research presented in this report is intended to help develop {{a better understanding of the}} system mechanics involved and the potential for environmental exposure induced movement between the <b>furring</b> <b>strip</b> and the framing. BSC sought to address the following research questions: 1. What are the relative roles of the mechanisms and the magnitudes of the force that influence the vertical displacement resistance of the system? 2. Can the capacity at a specified deflection be reliably calculated using mechanics based equations? 3. What are the impacts of environmental exposure on the vertical displacement of furring strips attached directly through insulation back to a wood structure...|$|E
50|$|Radiant barrier {{may be used}} as a vented {{skin around}} the {{exterior}} of a wall. <b>Furring</b> <b>strips</b> are applied to the sheathing to create a vented air space between the radiant barrier and the siding, and vents are used at the top and bottom to allow convective heat to rise naturally to the attic. If brick is being used on the exterior, then a vented air space may already be present, and <b>furring</b> <b>strips</b> are not necessary. Wrapping a house with radiant barrier can result in a 10% to 20% reduction in the tonnage air conditioning system requirement, and save both energy and construction costs.|$|R
5000|$|In construction, <b>furring</b> (<b>furring</b> <b>strips)</b> {{are thin}} strips of wood or other {{material}} to level or raise surfaces of another material to prevent dampness, to make space for insulation, or to level and resurface ceilings or walls. Furring {{refers to the}} process of installing the strips and to the strips themselves. [...] "Firring" [...] is a U.K. term for wood strips which are usually 50 mm wide, tapered and fixed above wood roof joists to provide drainage falls below roof boarding. <b>Furring</b> <b>strips</b> themselves are typically referred to as [...] "battens" [...] in the U.K. and sometimes the material is called [...] "strapping" [...] in the U.S.|$|R
5000|$|For {{installing}} a radiant barrier under a metal or tile roof, the radiant barrier may be applied {{directly over the}} roof sheathing. Then <b>furring</b> <b>strips</b> (1x4s) are applied over the radiant barrier before the metal or tile roof is applied. The <b>furring</b> <b>strips</b> ensure that the radiant barrier faces into a sufficient air space. If an air space is not present or is too small, heat {{may be able to}} conduct through the radiant barrier. Since the metal in the radiant barrier is highly conductive, the heat transfer would be by conduction and the heat would not be blocked. According to the US Department of Energy, “Reflective insulation and radiant barrier products must have an air space adjacent to the reflective material to be effective.” ...|$|R

50|$|Significant mold growth {{requires}} {{moisture and}} food sources and a substrate capable of sustaining growth. Common building materials, such as plywood, drywall, <b>furring</b> <b>strips,</b> carpets, and carpet padding provide food for mold. In carpet, invisible dust and cellulose are food sources. After water {{damage to a}} building, mold grows in walls and then becomes dormant until subsequent high humidity; suitable conditions reactivate mold. Mycotoxin levels are higher in buildings which have had a water incident.|$|R

The spacing between the strips {{depends on the}} type of finishing material. Wider spacing is typically used behind the heavy boards that support ceramic tiles. Closely spaced strips are needed for thin panelling or plaster. The use of strips with plaster, however, is called either lath and plaster or wattle and daub.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{companies}} now offer hand-painted finishes for metalwork, {{as well as}} a more permanent look that can be achieved with powder-coated finishes. For {{the low end of the}} market, imitation panels are pressed from plastic or aluminum. Tin is now fashionably used for art work, back splashes, cabinet faces, wainscoting and much more. For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel, designed to overlap each other. Panels were nailed into wood <b>furring</b> <b>strips</b> which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood. Today, nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed, into plywood without the need for the original 1 x 2 in <b>furring</b> <b>strips.</b> There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywall/popcorn/plaster ceilings, without the need for extensive plywood installation. Tin panels today are made in 24 x 24 in and 24 x 48 in sizes for easier handling and one-person installation. Today, most tin ceiling manufacturers actually use recycled blackplate steel in a thickness of only [...]010 or 1/100th of an inch. There are some manufacturers who also use actual tin plated steel, which is simply the blackplate steel with a thin coating of bright tin plate adhered to the base metal. Other manufacturers utilize aluminum, as it is rustproof and will last a lifetime.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Large (3 by 4 m) {{residential}} building wall specimens {{were tested in}} a calibrated hot box to measure the thermal performance of vertical air spaces formed by siding and sheathing. Test results reveal that the irregular air space formed by beveled siding applied directly over sheathing does not significantly reduce wall heat transfer regardless of effective space emittance. On the other hand, plywood siding applied to sheathing over <b>furring</b> <b>strips</b> to form 19 mm (3 / 4 ") plane air spaces having effective emittances of 0. 03 ’and 0. 73, produced space thermal resistances (R-values) of 2. 45 and 0. 89 h-ft 2.

50|$|Exterior {{wall studs}} are the {{vertical}} members {{to which the}} wall sheathing and cladding are attached. They are supported on a bottom plate or foundation sill and in turn support the top plate. Studs usually consist of 1.5 x 3.5 in or 1.5 x 5.5 in lumber and are commonly spaced at 16 in on center. This spacing may be changed to 12 or 24 in on center depending on the load and the limitations imposed by the type and thickness of the wall covering used. Wider 1.5 x 5.5 in studs {{may be used to}} provide space for more insulation. Insulation beyond that which can be accommodated within a 3.5 in stud space can also be provided by other means, such as rigid or semi-rigid insulation or batts between 1.5 x 1.5 in horizontal <b>furring</b> <b>strips,</b> or rigid or semi-rigid insulation sheathing to the outside of the studs. The studs are attached to horizontal top and bottom wall plates of 1.5 in lumber that are the same width as the studs.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{exterior}} insulation on {{a building}} is an accepted and effective means {{to increase the}} overall thermal resistance of the assembly that also has other advantages of improved water management and often increased air tightness of building assemblies. For thin layers of insulation (1 " to 1 1 / 2 "), the cladding can typically be attached directly through the insulation back to the structure. For thicker insulation layers, <b>furring</b> <b>strips</b> have been added as a cladding attachment location. This approach {{has been used in}} the past on numerous Building America test homes and communities (both new and retrofit applications), and has been proven to be an effective and durable means to provide cladding attachment. However, the lack of engineering data has been a problem for many designers, contractors, and code officials.

Furthermore, water management details necessary to integrate windows, doors, decks, balconies and roofs were created to provide guidance on the integration of exterior insulation strategies with other enclosure elements...|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of insulation to {{the exterior of}} buildings is {{an effective means of}} increasing the thermal resistance of wood-framed walls and mass masonry wall assemblies. The location of the insulation on the exterior of the structure has many direct benefits, including better effective R-value from reduced thermal bridging, better condensation resistance, reduced thermal stress on the structure, as well as other commonly associated improvements such as increased airtightness and improved water management. For thick layers of exterior insulation (more than 1. 5 in.), the use of wood <b>furring</b> <b>strips</b> attached through the insulation back to the structure has been used by many contractors and designers as a means to provide a convenient cladding attachment location. Although the approach has proven effective, there is significant resistance to its widespread implementation {{due to a lack of}} research and understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of the vertical displacement resistance capacity. In addition, the long-term in-service performance of the system has been questioned due to potential creep effects of the assembly under the sustained dead load of the cladding and effects of varying environmental conditions. In addition, the current International Building Code (IBC) and International Residential Code (IRC) do not have a provision that specifically allows this assembly...|$|R

5000|$|Captain Marvin {{had married}} a local Burlington woman {{by the name of}} Ellen Blackman before {{purchasing}} Grasse Mount. Marvin hence financed a number of additions to the mansion, including an Italianate belvedere (cupola) structure upon the rooftop, a gas-powered illumination system, the replacement of older small-paned windows with larger-paned sash, and the replacement of wooden fireplace mantels with Italian marble. Where the exterior was painted pink with green shutters, the interior was painted with a number of ornate frescos throughout its eight main rooms, stairwell, and the cupola. Spending about $10,000 {{over the course of a}} decade, Marvin employed what historians estimate to have been at least two Italian professional artisans (most likely a master and an apprentice) who used watercolors and distempers to hand-paint numerous scenes from his seafaring years, including palm trees, shorelines, windmills, ships, international seaports, as well as cherubs, garlands, and other classical patterns in the form of Trompe-l'oeil (translated in French as [...] "trick of the eye"), where the images convey the optical illusion of having three-dimensions. [...] In the belvedere, the artisans employed a shadowing technique with the trompe-l'oeil panels, which suggested flooding sunlight emanating from the western windows. Because subsequent owners wallpapered, painted, added <b>furring</b> <b>strips,</b> fiberboard, and drywall over the imagery, all but that within the cupola remained undiscovered for over a century. [...] In 1858, Marvin mortgaged the estate for $20,000 to the Bank of Burlington. Historical records also indicate that the Marvins were a mobile family. In 1862, a daughter was born to them in San Francisco, and a son in 1865 in New York.|$|R

In the Nunivak, seabirds, particularly murres, nest in numbers, the natives paying annual visits to the nesting grounds to secure skins of puffins, murres and others for clothing. The bird skins most commonly used for clothing were those of the cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), common or Pacific eider (Somateria mollissima), king eider (Somateria mollissima), Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri), common murre (Uria aalge), horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata). Cormorant and eider were considered more valuable and gave more prestige to the owner. Bird skin parkas are light and comfortable to wear but tear easily. Such parkas were usually reversible, worn with the feathers next to the body in winter with a cloth garment over the parka to cover the rough, yet fragile, skin side. At night the parka was turned and slept in or used as a blanket with the feathers on the outside. Bird skin parkas were shaped like those made of animal skin, {{but because of the}} great thickness of the feathers and the general bulk, they did not have <b>fur</b> <b>strips,</b> beading, and other decoration. Cuffs and bottom borders tended to be plain except on murre parkas. Tufted puffin skins were counted and sold in [...] "knots" [...] or bundles of six. Thirty-four skins were necessary for a man's parka and 28 for a woman's. The common puffin is smaller, so six knots and four extra skins were required for a man's parka, five knots and four extra for a woman's. Puffins are found only along the cliffs near Nash Harbor, and residents of Mekoryuk had to trade for them with those living in the settlement there. Sufficient puffins for a parka could be obtained in exchange for one bearded seal skin. Parkas made of cormorant skins were worn only by women. The skins of these birds are larger than those of murres and puffins. When murre skins were prepared for parka use, they were roughly square in shape and included the breast and the sides. Two narrow black backs were sewn together to form the crown of the hood.|$|R

The female incubates and broods the eggs, but both sexes feed the nestlings and remove fecal sacs, although the female does the majority of caring for the young. The young birds are fed insects, with flies making up much of the regurgitated material according to one study. The incubation period is 13 days, followed by a fledging period of 13 days. The parent birds feed the fledglings for around two weeks after they leave the nest, but the young do not remain long in the parents' territory. The young are independent within 40 days of egg-laying.|$|R
