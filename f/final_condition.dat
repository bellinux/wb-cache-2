25|$|Classical {{kinematics}} {{does not}} primarily demand experimental description of its phenomena. It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and momentum spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a {{state as a}} physically existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability. Such a description of an initial condition, together with Newton's laws of motion, allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a <b>final</b> <b>condition,</b> with a definite trajectory of passage. Hamiltonian dynamics {{can be used for}} this. Classical kinematics also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and <b>final</b> <b>condition</b> description used by quantum mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics applies to this. For processes that need account to be taken of actions of a small number of Planck constants, classical kinematics is not adequate; quantum mechanics is needed.|$|E

25|$|Elinor Ostrom, and {{her colleagues}} looked at how {{real-world}} communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they {{identified a number of}} factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better. A <b>final</b> <b>condition</b> is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse.

25|$|For many experiments, it is {{possible}} to think of the initial and final conditions of the system as being a particle. In some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle might pass from initial to <b>final</b> <b>condition.</b> It is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision. An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.|$|E

Cruise in the stratosphere, and on transition to and from cruise at constant Mach number are discussed. The state vector includes altitude, flight path angle, and mass. Specific fuel consumption becomes a linear function of power approximating that of the cruise values. Cruise represents the outer solution; altitude and flight path angle are constants, and only mass changes. Transitions between cruise and the specified initial and <b>final</b> <b>conditions</b> correspond to the inner solutions. The mass is constant and altitude and velocity vary. A solution is developed which is valid for cruise but which {{is not for the}} initial and <b>final</b> <b>conditions.</b> Transforming of the independent variable near the initial and <b>final</b> <b>conditions</b> result in solutions which are valid for the two inner solutions but not for cruise.
