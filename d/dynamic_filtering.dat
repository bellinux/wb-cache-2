40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new abstraction {{to accelerate the}} readbarriers and write-barriers used by language runtime systems. We exploit the fact that, dynamically, many barrier executions perform checks but no real work—e. g., in generational garbage collection (GC), frequent checks are needed to detect the creation of intergenerational references, even though such references occur rarely in many workloads. We introduce a form of <b>dynamic</b> <b>filtering</b> that identifies redundant checks by (i) recording checks that have recently been executed, and (ii) detecting when a barrier is repeating one of these checks. We show how this technique {{can be applied to}} a variety of algorithms for GC, transactional memory, and language-based security. By supporting <b>dynamic</b> <b>filtering</b> in the instruction set, we show that the fast-paths of these barriers can be streamlined, reducing the impact on the quality of surrounding code. We show how we accelerate the barriers used for generational GC and transactional memory in the Bartok research compiler. With a 2048 -entry filter, <b>dynamic</b> <b>filtering</b> eliminates almost all the overhead of the GC write-barriers. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>filtering</b> eliminates around half the overhead of STM over a non-synchronized baseline—even when used with an STM that is already designed for low overhead, and which employs static analyses to avoid redundant operations...|$|E

The structure of the included filter for estimating the parameters of motion is determined by the mathematical model of the maneuvering target. At present time the kinematic models are widely used, but they do not fully correspond to the observed dynamics. This may lead to divergence of the estimation process and failure of the computational procedure. New <b>dynamic</b> <b>filters</b> of the combined maximum principle with the dynamic model of motion possess higher accuracy and stability and smaller amount of computational costs in comparison with common filters. The materials and methods We propose new mathematical model that determines the structure of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>filter</b> of the combined maximum principle.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of sparsity signal models and the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional streaming data, there are relatively few algorithms for <b>dynamic</b> <b>filtering</b> of time-varying sparse signals. Of the existing algorithms, fewer still provide strong performance guarantees. This paper examines two algorithms for <b>dynamic</b> <b>filtering</b> of sparse signals {{that are based on}} efficient l 1 optimization methods. We first present an analysis for one simple algorithm (BPDN-DF) that works well when the system dynamics are known exactly. We then introduce a novel second algorithm (RWL 1 -DF) that is more computationally complex than BPDN-DF but performs better in practice, especially in the case where the system dynamics model is inaccurate. Robustness to model inaccuracy is achieved by using a hierarchical probabilistic data model and propagating higher-order statistics from the previous estimate (akin to Kalman filtering) in the sparse inference process. We demonstrate the properties of these algorithms on both simulated data as well as natural video sequences. Taken together, the algorithms presented in this paper represent the first strong performance analysis of <b>dynamic</b> <b>filtering</b> algorithms for time-varying sparse signals as well as state-of-the-art performance in this emerging application.

40|$|In {{practical}} engineering, it {{is inevitable}} that a system is perturbed by noise signals. Unfortunately, filtering may fail to detect some faults when the noise distribution matrix are the same as the fault distribution matrix. In this paper, it is shown that the dynamic feedback gain of a <b>dynamic</b> <b>filter</b> introduces additional zeros to the filter, and both the filter poles and the additional zeros can be assigned arbitrarily. In order to attenuate band-limited noises, the zero assignment technique is used,and an optimal <b>dynamic</b> fault detection <b>filtering</b> approach is proposed by locating the zeros to the noise frequencies and optimizing the poles. Compared to other <b>dynamic</b> <b>filter</b> design approaches, the zero assignment technique gives a better tradeoff between more design freedom and computation costs.

A preprocessor using nonparametric estimation is used to reduce the effects of non-line-of-sight and multipath propagation on the location procedure.

40|$|Abstract—A Bloom filter is an effective, space-efficient data {{structure}} for concisely representing a set and supporting approximate membership queries. Traditionally, the Bloom filter and its variants {{just focus on}} how to represent a static set and decrease the false positive probability to a sufficiently low level. By investigating mainstream applications based on the Bloom filter, we reveal that dynamic data sets are more common and important than static sets. However, existing variants of the Bloom <b>filter</b> cannot support <b>dynamic</b> data sets well. To address this issue, we propose <b>dynamic</b> Bloom <b>filters</b> to represent <b>dynamic</b> sets as well as static sets and design necessary item insertion, membership query, item deletion, and filter union algorithms. The <b>dynamic</b> Bloom <b>filter</b> can control the false positive probability at a low level by expanding its capacity as the set cardinality increases. Through comprehensive mathematical analysis, we show that the <b>dynamic</b> Bloom <b>filter</b> uses less expected memory than the Bloom <b>filter</b> when representing <b>dynamic</b> sets with an upper bound on set cardinality, and also that the <b>dynamic</b> Bloom <b>filter</b> is more stable than the Bloom filter due to infrequent reconstruction when addressing dynamic sets without an upper bound on set cardinality. Moreover, the analysis results hold in standalone applications as well as distributed applications.

Moreover, as Steele [4] pointed out, the model in Elliott et al. [1] has theoretical emphasis and does not delve into the important verification of the market’s stylised facts.
