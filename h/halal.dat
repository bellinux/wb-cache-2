5|$|Most of {{the sheep}} meat {{exported}} from Australia is either frozen carcases to the UK or is live export to the Middle East for <b>halal</b> slaughter. PETA has stated that sheep exported to countries outside the jurisdiction of Australia's animal cruelty laws are treated inhumanely and that <b>halal</b> meat processing facilities exist in Australia, making the export of live animals redundant. Entertainer Pink has pledged to boycott all Australian sheep products in protest.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan, and the {{following}} Yuan Emperors in China forbade Islamic practices such as <b>halal</b> butchering and circumcision. This led Chinese Muslims to eventually take {{an active part in}} rebelling against the Mongols and installing the more tolerant Ming Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The Torah, {{although}} disallowing {{the use of}} most insects as food, {{permits the}} consumption of certain locusts; specifically, the red, the yellow, the spotted grey, and the white are considered permissible. In Islamic jurisprudence, eating locusts is considered <b>halal.</b> The Prophet Muhammad {{was reported to have}} eaten locusts during a military raid with his companions.|$|E
5|$|Hana {{currently}} {{owns and}} operates or sub-licenses over 200 restaurants on the Arabian peninsula, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. To accommodate the tenets of the majority Islamic population's faith in its markets, all of the locations operated and overseen by Hana feature <b>halal</b> meats and do not feature pork based products. Additionally, hamburgers are called beefburgers, avoiding the term ham and its association with pork.|$|E
5|$|KFC adapts its menu internationally to suit {{regional}} tastes, {{and there}} are over three hundred KFC menu items worldwide. Some locations, such as the UK and the US, sell grilled chicken. In predominantly Islamic countries, the chicken served is <b>halal.</b> In Asia there is a preference for spicy foods, such as the Zinger chicken burger. Some locations in the US sell fried chicken livers and gizzards. A small number of US outlets offer an all-you-can-eat buffet option with a limited menu.|$|E

The expo was initiated by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council by dedicating the previously <b>Halal</b> Section of Food Taipei Expo to become its very own expo.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, McDonald's quit serving <b>halal</b> food at {{the only}} two {{locations}} in the US that served <b>halal</b> food, both located in Dearborn, MI after a $700,000 lawsuit filed in 2001 where a customer alleged the menu items were not consistently <b>halal.</b> The case was brought to court by Michael Jaafar, a Detroit lawyer of Fairmax Law who filed a consumer protection class action lawsuit against McDonald's for advertising <b>halal</b> foods.|$|E

25|$|There {{are close}} to two dozen <b>Halal</b> {{certification}} authorities in Australia. <b>Halal</b> meat and meat product exports to the Middle East and Southeast Asia have greatly increased from the 1970s onwards; this expansion was {{due in part to}} efforts of the AFIC. <b>Halal</b> certification has been criticised by anti-Halal campaigners who argue that the practice funds the growth of Islam, results in added costs, a requirement to officially certify intrinsically-halal foods and with consumers required to subsidise a particular religious belief.|$|E
25|$|<b>Halal</b> {{restaurants}} {{are widely available}} around Taiwan, although {{most of them are}} highly concentrated in Taipei, with some other restaurants in Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung.

It had two Kuomintang party symbols on it.|$|E
25|$|One of Taiwan's <b>halal</b> {{certification}} body is the Taiwan <b>Halal</b> Integrity Development Association, inaugurated in May 2011 in Taipei, obtained the membership to a cross-border <b>halal</b> food certification program which {{is governed by}} the authorities from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The association is based in Taipei Cultural Mosque. Another type of <b>Halal</b> certification, the 'Muslim Friendly Restaurant' certification, is handled by the Chinese Muslim Association. The purpose of the certification, except to certify the Halal-ness of the food, is to let the world knows that there are Muslims in Taiwan too. The certification guidelines specify method, source, items, dos and donts in hosting Muslim customers according to their customs in dining in restaurants. The methods specified by the certification guidelines may make the cost of hosting Muslim travelers more costly, but it helps to attract more Muslim tourist visitors to Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|Muslims {{follow the}} Islamic law that lists foods and drinks that are <b>Halal</b> and {{permissible}} to consume. <b>Halal</b> foods are food items that Muslims {{are allowed to}} eat and drink under Islamic dietary guidelines.

25|$|There are {{currently}} four slaughterhouses in Taiwan that provide <b>halal</b> meat, which are one in Taipei and three in Yunlin.|$|E
25|$|Some {{schools of}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} consider scorpions haram, but eating locusts as <b>halal.</b> Others prohibit all animals that creep, including insects.|$|E
25|$|Practicing strict Islamic dietary laws {{is another}} problem {{due to the}} fact that Taiwan does not have many widely {{available}} <b>Halal</b> restaurants or dining places. However, the growing presence of Muslim Indonesian workers in Taiwan has helped to establish more <b>Halal</b> restaurants serving Indonesian cuisine around Taiwan. Muslims serving in the Republic of China Armed Forces are generally given separate utensils and supplied with fish, in which they will cook for themselves.|$|E

25|$|The cuisine of Singapore {{is often}} viewed by its {{population}} as {{a prime example of}} the ethnic diversity of the culture of Singapore. In Singapore's hawker centres – a technical misnomer, to be precise – for example, traditionally Malay hawker stalls selling <b>halal</b> food may serve <b>halal</b> versions of traditionally Tamil or Chinese food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay or Indian ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering. Some dishes introduce elements from all three cultures, while others incorporate influences from the rest of Asia and the West.|$|E
