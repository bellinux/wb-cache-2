40|$|Adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) {{release from}} keratinocytes has been {{observed}} in various stress models in vitro, but studies demonstrating epidermal ATP release in vivo are limited. To visualize extracellular ATP (eATP) in vivo, we developed enhanced green-emitting luciferase immobilized on agarose beads (Eluc-agarose). Subcutaneous injection of Eluc-agarose together with ATP into the dorsal skin of BALB/c mice following intraperitoneal luciferin injection produced detectable and measurable bioluminescence using an in vivo imaging system. Using Eluc-agarose, we demonstrated in vivo that bright bioluminescence was observed from 1 to 20 minutes after repeated tape stripping of murine skin. This bioluminescence was suppressed by the local administration of apyrase. Eluc-agarose bioluminescence was observed only in tape-stripped skin with transepidermal water loss (TEWL) between 100 and 140 gm 2 h− 1, indicating a loss of bioluminescence with <b>excessive</b> <b>tape</b> stripping (TEWL> 140 gm− 2 h− 1). Histologically, tape-stripped skin with detectable eATP had a viable epidermis and a subepidermal neutrophil infiltrate, and administration of apyrase reduced the inflammatory infiltrate. Neither a viable epidermis nor an upper dermal neutrophil infiltrate was observed after <b>excessive</b> <b>tape</b> stripping. These results suggest that tape stripping prompts ATP release from viable keratinocytes, which facilitates inflammatory cell migration.

Openness for innovation is more effective than bribery in helping a firm reduce red tape to secure bank finance. Based on a dataset of Chinese firms provided by the World Bank, our findings strongly support the argument. We find that openness for innovation has a positive relationship with both the access to bank finance and the size of bank finance, whereas bribery is related to neither. Supplementary tests further suggest that the positive relationship is mainly driven by private firms and manufacturing firms. Our findings help firms make decisions to select an effective and yet socially responsible approach to securing bank finance...|$|R

The article outlines the reactive and piecemeal character of the policy, its important weakness in dealing effectively with immigration flows and the <b>excessive</b> red <b>tape</b> that characterises it. It is noted that nearly 20 years after the first migrants arrived in the country, Greek immigration policy remains short-sighted, dealing with immigration as a necessary evil and not as an opportunity.

The two major parties have been until recently largely agreed in their exclusionary views towards immigrants. It is only since 2004 that the Socialist party has changed its plans but it remains uncertain whether and how it would implement its radical (by Greek standards) pro-immigrant policies if it came to power. Overall, Greek political elites lack the political will to adopt a proactive and realistic migration policy plan. This is partly because migration neither wins nor loses national elections. And partly because they fear that stating publicly that Greece should accept economic immigrants through legal channels and that immigrants should become part of Greek society on a basis of equality and plurality would cost them votes...|$|R

Subsequently, the South African government has taken various steps to encourage their growth and to improve access to finance for SMMEs.

Since SMMEs have unique financial needs, commercial banks and other funders are faced with difficulties in catering for them.

Over the medium to long term, Pakistan should grant most favored nation (MFN) status to India, which India already provides to Pakistan, and allow transit trade from India; India should significantly lower tariff rates for goods of particular interest to Pakistan (e. g., textiles) and remove nontariff barriers; and both countries should facilitate trade in energy, information technology, and services, remove obstacles to foreign direct investment flows, and harmonize customs procedures.

40|$|In {{the lead}} up to the March 2011 State election, the NSW Liberals and Nationals Fisheries Policy Statement, "Securing Sustainable, Viable and Healthy Fisheries", stated that their policy was "to ensure {{we have a strong}} and viable {{commercial}} fishing industry". Following on from this commitment, in March 2012 a review team, commissioned by the Minister for Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, issued a major report: Independent Review of NSW Commercial Fisheries Policy, Management and Administration. Responding to the review, in a Media Release from 14 November 2012 the Minister for Primary Industries said the Commercial Fisheries Reform Program will ensure the industry has long-term viability and sustainability of the State’s fisheries resources. According to Ms Hodgkinson:"A lack of investment, ageing commercial fishing fleets, too many fishers through poorly allocated fishing rights, and <b>excessive</b> red <b>tape</b> has stifled the industry [...] . With 85 per cent of seafood sold in NSW being imported, these new changes are needed to ensure that there is a continued availability of fresh, local seafood. "The same source set out the proposed key reforms as follows:linking shares in each fishery to either catch or fishing effort, meeting the original intention of share management as outlined when the former NSW Liberals & Nationals Government enacted the Fisheries Management Act in 1994; restoring confidence in decision-making processes through the establishment of a Ministerial Fisheries Advisory Council (MFAC), Peak Industry Body, and other improved consultative arrangements; an initial fee increase from July 2013, moving towards fees based on resource access; providing a way for some fishers to exit the industry and others to set-up their businesses for the future through the allocation of a 16 million structural adjustment package; andremoving unnecessary fishing controls and improving the general management of fisheries resources in NSW, which has hindered efficiency for far too long.

40|$|Increased {{interest}} in the issue of evaluation of public policies {{dates back to the}} 1990 s. This was partly due to budget stringency and the need to better allocate increasingly scarce public resources. More fundamentally, however, the focus on evaluation was emblematic of a broader reassessment and examination of the appropriate role of government and of market mechanisms across a number of policy areas. Accountability, transparency and the desire to minimise distortions arising from government policies while maximising their leverage effect were all driving this trend towards more evaluations (Papaconstantinou and Polt, 1997, p. 9). The aim of this Chapter is to define impact assessment and to position ex-post impact assessment - the focus of this work - in the broader activity of evaluation. The concept of ‘impact’ and methodological difficulties related to its measurement are highlighted. The focus of the Chapter is on the practice of impact assessment in Europe and particular attention is paid to the place of ex-post IA in the policy cycle. Like ex-post evaluation in the 1990 s, ex-post impact assessment is currently enjoying increased attention. Assessing the socio-economic impacts of public policy is becoming increasingly important as the changing role and position of government has resulted in a growing demand for evidence-based policies (OECD, 2007, p. 4). In the field of RTDI, expectations from public policies have increased along with public funding. As a result, impact assessment is being increasingly called for. Once the decision has been made to conduct a new policy, this should be done in the best possible way. Government intervention is {{based on the idea that}} it can remedy some of the aforementioned market failures. But government intervention itself can also fail and social costs may end up higher than social benefits. Examples include institutional inertia, a lack of reliable information (e. g. on the impact of policies), a lack of continuity and a long-term perspective, <b>excessive</b> red <b>tape,</b> bureaucratic rivalry, unintended side effects, and so on. Therefore, the benefits of solving market failures must exceed the costs of government failure. First, a careful choice has to be made as to the area of intervention. The combination of finite resources and a multitude of new emerging research opportunities mean that careful attention must be paid to funding priorities and requires wise choices by policy-makers. Is R&D support provided across the board, to all S&T areas, or is it concentrated in a smaller number of S&T priorities, and if so which ones? Is R&D support provided in research infrastructure, basic research, applied research, and human resources too, or is it concentrated in a single or just a few components of the innovation system, and if so which ones? Second, the right choice has to be made as to the instrument of intervention. A wide range of possible instruments have emerged since the shift from the linear to the innovation systems paradigm. Governments make use of a flexible and evolving toolkit of instruments adapting to the specific dynamics and composition of the innovation system and addressing existing bottlenecks in the system. Third, care should be taken not to introduce an excessive number of different instruments and to maintain clear and understandable policy intervention logic. Consistency across instruments should also be ensured (policy mix). Different instruments can work together to alleviate a particular problem, or they can counteract each other, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Finally and closely related to the third point, policy support has to be provided at the most appropriate level of governance, and consistency in support has to be ensured across all policy levels. In a world that is increasingly interlinked, government measures will generate effects that go beyond the sheer local, regional and national level. Multi-level governance means finding the most optimal combination of government intervention at all policy levels in order to create synergies which none of the policy actors will be able to achieve on their own. From the above it is clear that, prior to public intervention, government must carefully design the way in which it will intervene. This will help to ensure that R&D support is provided in the most appropriate areas (with large spill-over effects and where the private sector would not get involved on its own) and through the most effective instruments. A wide range of tools are available to optimise the research policy formulation process. These include the comparative analysis of S&T input and output indicators, foresight and technological assessment analysis, the benchmarking of national R&D policy actions and instruments, growth and competitiveness analysis, the consultation of stakeholders, the ex-post evaluation and impact assessment of past R&D programmes, and the take-up of the feedback thereof in ex-ante evaluation/impact assessment. status: publishe...|$|R
