5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and <b>fluorescence</b> <b>detection</b> with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E
25|$|Ligand binding assays (LBA) is an assay, or an {{analytic}} procedure, whose procedure or method {{relies on}} the binding of ligand molecules to receptors, antibodies or other macromolecules. A detection method is {{used to determine the}} presence and extent of the ligand-receptor complexes formed, and this is usually determined electrochemically or through a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>detection</b> method.

25|$|The {{dominant}} contemporary techniques, microarrays and RNA-Seq, {{were developed}} in the mid-1990s and 2000s. Microarrays that measure the abundances of a defined set of transcripts via their hybridisation to an array of complementary probes were first published in 1995. Microarray technology allowed the assay of 1000s of transcripts simultaneously, at a greatly reduced cost per gene and labour saving. Both spotted oligonucleotide arrays and Affymetrix high-density arrays were the method of choice for transcriptional profiling until the late 2000s. Over this period, a range of microarrays were produced to cover known genes in model or economically important organisms. Advances in design and manufacture of arrays improved the specificity of probes and allowed more genes to be tested on a single array. Advances in <b>fluorescence</b> <b>detection</b> increased the sensitivity and measurement accuracy for low abundance transcripts.|$|E

2500|$|Aminoallyl {{nucleotide}} is a nucleotide with {{a modified}} base containing an allylamine. They {{are used in}} post-labeling of nucleic acids by <b>fluorescence</b> <b>detection</b> in microarray. They are reactive with N-Hydroxysuccinimide ester group which helps attach a fluorescent dye to the primary amino group on the nucleotide.

The primary amine group in the aminoallyl moiety is aliphatic and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings (aromatic) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl nucleosides are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl.
