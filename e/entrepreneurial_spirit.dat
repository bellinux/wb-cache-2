The data show that the growth performance of many poor countries has been disappointing: most of the “developing” world, especially sub-Saharan Africa, has been getting poorer while the advanced economies have been getting richer. To reverse this trend requires finding ways to raise total factor productivity in poor countries; in turn, this implies letting entrepreneurs innovate—in the Schumpeterian sense—in order to bring about structural changes in the economy. The conclusion highlights several essential steps in creating a favorable environment for innovation and growth.

In recent years, we have witnessed an array of individuals and communities in the civil society, who are mobilizing identities, extant resources and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>spirits</b> towards new organisational forms that enable improving their wellbeing and reshaping their realities. entrepreneurs can always create ventures to help others in non-financial ways, their start-ups not only generate gains but also contribute to others by focusing their attention on future-oriented issues and solutions. Unlike command and control development favoured by exogenous actors, entrepreneurship in the plural sector is a socially and territorially embedded process, where social issues are owned and solved from the ground-up by means of collective venturing, driven by a sense of realization and a desire to repair local circumstances. These new civil society ventures are posing challenges to the current functioning of markets and support tools. Mixtures of informal and formal mechanisms, unbounded labour, non-economic transactions, purpose-driven profit, collaborative governance and ownership, territorial attachment, and non-scalability are some of the features local governments, established companies, formal economies and the very same field of entrepreneurship need to deal with looking forward...|$|R

40|$|Renowned for the {{potential}} in alleviating poverty, co-operative movement has been encouraged {{and supported by the}} government. This research investigates co-operative performances and efficiency in Malaysia using quantitative and qualitative methods. The first essay revealed that co-operatives’ role in economic development is still relevant. Credit and banking co-operatives had contributed to the movement’s growth and development. The National Co-operative Plans are important blueprint for co-operative development in the country. Investigation on factors influencing co-operative membership in the second essay revealed that membership is favourable to the older age groups as compared to younger age groups. Those working in government sector {{are more likely to be}} members. The duration of membership and frequency in annual general meeting attendance are found to be positively related to co-operative shareholding. An analysis on satisfaction and perception of co-operative performance showed that patrons are satisfied with the quality and reliability of goods and services. There are positive perceptions on the benefits of co-operation and on the role of co-operative in economic development and community wellbeing. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) of co-operative membership target groups in the third essay showed the co-operative groups’ efficiency score of 0. 605 or equivalent to 65. 3 percent inefficiency level in producing outputs. Co-operatives have operational “slacks” and inefficient resource usage. Tobit regression showed that turnover, equity and members are significant in influencing efficiency scores of co-operatives. Comparison of efficiency and productivity level of Bank Rakyat with conventional banks showed that Bank Rakyat was among the top five banks. Further analysis by including 5 other Islamic banks brought it to top six positions. The source of total factor productivity progress was technological progress while technical efficiency change remained stagnant. Tobit regression analysis revealed that loan intensity and assets were significant in determining the efficiency scores. Environmental factors are significant in influencing technological and scale efficiencies. Bank’s status (co-operative or Islamic) is significant in influencing technical and pure technical efficiency of banks. Action research in the last essay reviewed that co-operative establishment requires local communities involvement in decision-making process, human capabilities enhancement programmes, empowerment, <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>spirits,</b> leadership qualities and local community commitments. Of the three community co-operatives in Marine Park Islands, Tioman achieved highest while Redang experienced moderate progress.
