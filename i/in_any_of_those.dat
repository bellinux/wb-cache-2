2500|$|However {{materials}} {{in which all}} three refractive indices are different are termed biaxial and {{the origin of this}} term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the direction of what we call the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> principle directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as biaxial, with the two [...] "axes" [...] in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.|$|E
