50|$|The <b>induction</b> <b>stroke</b> is {{the first}} stroke in a {{four-stroke}} internal combustion engine cycle. It involves the downward movement of the piston, creating a partial vacuum that draws (allows atmospheric pressure to push) a fuel/air mixture into the combustion chamber.|$|E
50|$|Manifold vacuum is {{an effect}} of a piston's {{movement}} on the <b>induction</b> <b>stroke</b> and the choked flow through a throttle in the intake manifold of an engine. It {{is a measure of}} the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the manifold vacuum is also used as an auxiliary power source to drive engine accessories and for the crankcase ventilation system.|$|E
50|$|Most {{automobiles}} use four-stroke Otto cycle engines {{with multiple}} cylinders {{attached to a}} single inlet manifold. During the <b>induction</b> <b>stroke,</b> the piston descends in the cylinder and the intake valve is open. As the piston descends it effectively increases the volume in the cylinder above it, setting up low pressure. Atmospheric pressure pushes air through the manifold and carburetor or fuel injection system, where it is mixed with fuel. Because multiple cylinders operate at different times in the engine cycle, there is almost constant pressure difference through the inlet manifold from carburetor to engine.|$|E

This study shows {{the feasibility of}} inducing stroke by 2 [*]h of thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in aged (56 week old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with both acute (2 weeks) and chronic (36 weeks) diabetes. After modifying the streptozotocin dosing regimen to ensure that old SHRs survived the induction of diabetes, few died after <b>induction</b> of <b>stroke.</b> <b>Induction</b> of <b>stroke</b> is feasible in rats with multiple comorbidities.

40|$|Previous animal {{experiments}} {{have indicated that}} administration of fluoxetine and simvastatin at 20 - 26 hours post-stroke decreases the volume of ischemic infarcts. This experiment expanded on previous experiments by adding ascorbic acid to the post-stroke regimen, initiating simvastatin pre-stroke, and adding a third initiation time frame (48 - 54 hours). Male retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats were on simvastatin for 7 days prior to <b>stroke</b> <b>induction.</b> Combined medications of 5 milligrams/kilogram of fluoxetine, 1 milligram/kilogram of simvastatin and 20 milligrams/kilogram of ascorbic acid were orally administered at 6 - 12 hours, 20 - 26 hours, or 48 - 54 hours, respectively, following <b>stroke</b> <b>induction.</b> Adult rats that were treated 20 - 26 hours post-stroke showed a decrease in infarct volume (15. 67 ± 5. 622 millimeters cubed, P= 0. 0098) compared to the control. The combination of simvastatin, fluoxetine and ascorbic acid decreased the relative risk (RR= 0. 3704 (95 % confidence interval 0. 0987 to 1. 3905, p-value = 0. 1411) of bleeding after ischemic stroke if initiated 20 - 26 hours after <b>stroke</b> <b>induction</b> in rats...|$|R
50|$|Scavenging {{is equally}} {{important}} for both two- and four-stroke engines. However {{it is more difficult}} to achieve in two-stroke engines, owing to the proximity, or even overlap, of their <b>induction</b> and exhaust <b>strokes.</b> Scavenging is also equally important to both petrol and diesel engines.|$|R
5000|$|There {{will always}} be some {{compressed}} gas remaining in the cylinder and cylinder head spaces {{at the top of}} the stroke. The gas in this [...] "dead space" [...] will expand during the next <b>induction</b> <b>stroke,</b> and only after it has dropped below the supply gas pressure, more supply gas will flow into the cylinder. The ratio of the volume of the cylinder space with the piston fully withdrawn, to the dead space, is the [...] "compression ratio" [...] of the booster, also termed [...] "boost ratio" [...] in this context. Efficiency of the booster is related to the compression ratio, and gas will only be transferred while the pressure ratio between supply and discharge gas is less than the boost ratio, and delivery rate will drop as the inlet to delivery pressure ratio increases.|$|E
50|$|Watt {{solved the}} problem of the water spray by {{removing}} the cold water to a different cylinder, placed beside the power cylinder. Once the <b>induction</b> <b>stroke</b> was complete a valve was opened between the two, and any steam that entered the cylinder would condense inside this cold cylinder. This would create a vacuum that would pull more of the steam into the cylinder, and so on until the steam was mostly condensed. The valve was then closed, and operation of the main cylinder continued as it would on a conventional Newcomen engine. As the power cylinder remained at operational temperature throughout, the system was ready for another stroke as soon as the piston was pulled back to the top. Maintaining the temperature was a jacket around the cylinder where steam was admitted. Watt produced a working model in 1765.|$|E
50|$|For certain {{applications}} {{the valve}} stem and disk {{are made of}} different steel alloys, or the valve stem may be hollow and filled with sodium to improve heat transport and transfer. Although a better heat conductor, an aluminium cylinder head requires steel valve seat inserts, where a cast iron cylinder head would often have employed integral valve seats in the past. Because the valve stem extends into lubrication in the cam chamber, it must be sealed against blow-by to prevent cylinder gases from escaping into the crankcase, even though the stem to valve clearance is very small, typically 0.04-0.06 mm, so a rubber lip-type seal is used to ensure that excessive oil is not drawn in from the crankcase on the <b>induction</b> <b>stroke,</b> and that exhaust gas does not enter the crankcase on the exhaust stroke. Worn valve guides and/or defective oil seals can often be diagnosed by a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe on releasing the accelerator pedal after allowing the engine to overrun, when there is high manifold vacuum. Such a condition occurs when changing gear.|$|E

Ischaemic rats administered the same volume of tap water were used as a control group. Functional outcome tests (Pasta, forelimb flexion, cylinder, staircase) were performed. Rats were subjected to surgical procedures after 21 days’ treatment for analysis of stroke recovery. Results: Treatment with Camellia sinensis extract of 400 mg/kg PO significantly (P= 0. 000) enhanced neurological recovery in all tests performed. There was no significant difference of infarct volume among the experimental groups treated with Camellia sinensis extract 200 mg/kg PO. Conclusion: The outcomes of this study was vivid that Camellia sinensis extract is safe and effective mediator in clot dissolution and stroke reversal in rat model. It is the first agent found effective in no behavioural modification or adverse effects using its extract. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} evaluate, assess and appraise its desired characteristics and therapeutics in human subjects...|$|R
40|$|Anesthetics such as {{isoflurane}} {{are commonly}} used to sedate experimental animals during the <b>induction</b> of <b>stroke.</b> Since these agents are known to modulate synaptic excitability, inflammation and blood flow, they could hinder the development and discovery of new neuroprotection therapies. To address this issue, we developed a protocol for inducing photothrombotic occlusion of cerebral vessels in fully conscious mice and tested two potential neuroprotectant drugs (a GluN 2 B or α 4 β 2 nicotinic receptor antagonist). Our data show in vehicle treated mice that just 20 minutes of exposure to isoflurane during <b>stroke</b> <b>induction</b> can significantly reduce ischemic cortical damage relative to mice that were awake during stroke. When comparing potential stroke therapies, none provided any level of neuroprotection if the stroke was induced with anesthesia. However, if mice were fully conscious during stroke, the α 4 β 2 nicotinic receptor antagonist reduced ischemic damage by 23 % relative to vehicle treated controls, whereas the GluN 2 B antagonist had no significant effect. These results suggest that isoflurane anesthesia can occlude the benefits of certain stroke treatments and warrant caution when using anesthetics for pre-clinical testing of neuroprotective agents...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{ischemia}} stimulates endogenous neurogenesis. However, {{the functional}} relevance {{of this phenomenon}} remains unclear because of poor survival and low neuronal differentiation rates of newborn cells. Therefore, further studies on mechanisms regulating neurogenesis under ischemic conditions are required, among which ephrin-ligands and ephrin-receptors (Eph) are an interesting target. Although Eph/ephrin proteins like ephrin-B 3 are known to negatively regulate neurogenesis under physiological conditions, their role in cerebral ischemia is largely unknown. We therefore studied neurogenesis, brain injury and functional outcome in ephrin-B 3 -/- (knockout) and ephrin-B 3 ?/?

50|$|Air {{is drawn}} into the {{cylinder}} through the intake valve as the piston descends (the <b>induction</b> <b>stroke).</b> During the same stroke, fuel is sprayed into the vaporizer by a mechanical (jerk-type) fuel pump through a nozzle. The air in the cylinder is then forced through {{the top of the}} cylinder as the piston rises (the compression stroke), through the opening into the vaporizer, where it is compressed and its temperature rises. The vaporized fuel mixes with the compressed air and ignites primarily due to the heat of the hot bulb generated while running, or heat applied to the hot bulb prior to starting. By contracting the bulb to a very narrow neck where it attaches to the cylinder, a high degree of turbulence is set up as the ignited gases flash through the neck into the cylinder, where combustion is completed. The resulting pressure drives the piston down (the power stroke). The piston's action is converted to a rotary motion by the crankshaft-flywheel assembly, to which equipment can be attached for work to be performed. The flywheel stores momentum, some of which is used to turn the engine when power is not being produced. The piston rises, expelling exhaust gases through the exhaust valve (the exhaust stroke). The cycle then starts again.|$|E
50|$|The p-V diagam is a {{simplified}} and idealised {{representation of the}} events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a Carnot cycle. Starting at 1, the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed {{at the start of}} the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure. Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabatically—that is without heat transfer to or from the environment—by the rising piston. (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise. At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas. Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3. In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2. Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected. During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately). This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it. Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 3-4 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger). After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following <b>induction</b> <b>stroke)</b> are not shown on the diagram. If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram. At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air. The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2—this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine. Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the p-V loop. The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression. It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.|$|E

40|$|Single {{long-chain}} omega- 3 {{fatty acids}} (e. g. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) {{are known for}} their neuroprotective properties associated with ischemic stroke. This pilot study aimed to test the effectiveness of an acute treatment with a long-chain omega- 3 lipid emulsion (Omegaven 10 %®, OGV) that contains fish oil (DHA 18 mg/ml; EPA 21 mg/ml) and a-tocopherol (0. 2 mg/ml) in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic stroke in mice. For this purpose, female CD- 1 mice were anesthetized and subjected to 90 minutes of MCAO. To reflect a clinically relevant situation for an acute treatment, either after <b>induction</b> of <b>stroke</b> or after reperfusion, a single dose of OGV was injected intravenously into the tail vein (5 ml/kg b. w.). A neurological severity score was used to assess motor function and neurological outcome. Stroke-related parameters were determined 24 hours after MCAO. Microdialysis was used to collect samples from extracellular space of the striatum. Mitochondrial function was determined in isolated mitochondria or dissociated brain cells. Inflammation markers were measured in brain homogenate. According to control experiments, neuroprotective effects could be attributed to the long-chain omega- 3 content of the emulsion. Intravenous injection of OGV reduced size and severity of stroke, restored mitochondrial function, and prevented excitotoxic glutamate release. Increases of pro-inflammatory markers (COX- 2 and IL- 6) were attenuated. Neurological severity scoring and neurochemical data demonstrated that acute OGV treatment shortly after <b>induction</b> of <b>stroke</b> was most efficient and able to improve short-term neurological outcome, reflecting the importance of an acute treatment to improve the outcome. Summarising, acute treatment of stroke with a single intravenous dose of OGV provided strong neuroprotective effects and was most effective when given immediately after onset of ischemia. As OGV is an approved fishoil emulsion for parenteral nutrition in humans, our results may provide first translational data for a possible early management of ischemic stroke with administration of OGV to prevent further brain damage...|$|R

Experimental studies suggest that glatiramer acetate might also work in other neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative diseases apart from multiple sclerosis. Findings We evaluated the efficacy of glatiramer acetate in a mouse model of brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. 60 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice.

Before the <b>induction</b> of <b>stroke,</b> dendritic arbors were relatively stable over several weeks. However, after stroke, apical dendritic arbor remodeling increased significantly (dendritic tip growth and retraction), particularly within the first 2 weeks after stroke. Despite a threefold increase in structural remodeling, the net length of arbors did not change significantly over time because dendrite extensions away from the stroke were balanced by the shortening of tips near the infarct. Therefore, fully mature cortical pyramidal neurons retain the capacity for extensive structural plasticity and remodel in a balanced and branch-specific manner...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies using}} rats in stroke models {{have failed to}} {{translate}} into successful clinical trials in humans. The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) has produced guidelines on the rodent stroke model for preclinical trials {{in order to promote}} the successful translation of animal to human studies. These guidelines also underline the importance of anaesthetic and monitoring techniques. The aim of this literature review is to document whether anaesthesia protocols (i. e., choice of agents, mode of ventilation, physiological support and monitoring) have been amended since the publication of the STAIR guidelines in 2009. A number of articles describing the use of a stroke model in adult rats from the years 2005 and 2015 were randomly selected from the PubMed database and analysed for the following parameters: country where the study was performed, strain of rats used, technique of <b>stroke</b> <b>induction,</b> anaesthetic agent for induction and maintenance, mode of intubation and ventilation, monitoring techniques, control of body temperature, vascular accesses, and administration of intravenous fluids and analgesics. For each parameter (<b>stroke,</b> <b>induction,</b> maintenance, monitoring), exact chi-square tests were used {{to determine whether or not}} proportions were significantly different across year and p values were corrected for multiple comparisons. An exact p-test was used for each parameter to compare the frequency distribution of each value followed by a Bonferroni test. The level of significant set at < 0. 05. Results show that there were very few differences in the anaesthetic and monitoring techniques used between 2005 and 2015. In 2015, significantly more studies were performed in China and significantly fewer studies used isoflurane and nitrous oxide. The most striking finding is that the vast majority of all the studies from both 2005 and 2015 did not report the use of ventilation; measurement of blood gases, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, or blood pressure; or administration of intravenous fluids or analgesics.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} vibration signal patterns associated with a simulated piston slap test of a four-cylinder diesel engine. It is found that a simulated worn-off piston results {{in an increase in}} vibration RMS peak amplitudes associated with the major mechanical events of the corresponding cylinder (i. e., inlet and exhaust valve closing and combustion of Cylinder 1). This then led to an increase of overall vibration amplitude of the time domain statistical features such as RMS, Crest Factor, Skewness and Kurtosis in all loading conditions. The simulated worn-off piston not only increased the impact amplitude of piston slap during the engine combustion, it also produced a distinct impulse response during the air <b>induction</b> <b>stroke</b> of the cylinder attributing to an increase of lateral impact force as a result of piston reciprocating motion and the increased clearance between the worn-off piston and the cylinder.

Thereby, newborn cells migrated toward ischemic territory and differentiated in ischemic boundaries into doublecortin+ neuroblasts at higher rates in animals with MSCs compared to control group.

Male mice were socially isolated (housed individually) or pair housed with an ovariectomized female before <b>induction</b> of <b>stroke,</b> via transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), or SHAM surgery. In these experiments, peri-ischemic social isolation decreases poststroke survival rate and exacerbates infarct size and edema development. The social influence on ischemic damage is accompanied by an altered neuroinflammatory response; specifically, central interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) signaling is down-regulated, whereas peripheral IL- 6 is up-regulated, in isolated relative to socially housed mice. In addition, intracerebroventricular injection of an IL- 6 neutralizing antibody (10 ng) eliminates social housing differences in measures of ischemic outcome.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of advanced {{internal combustion engine}} mechanisms and powertrains may improve the fuel conversion efficiency of an engine and thus {{reduce the amount of}} energy needed to power the vehicle. The paper presents a novel design of a variable compression ratio advanced spark ignition engine that also permits an expansion ratio that may differ from the <b>induction</b> <b>stroke</b> therefore generating an Atkinson cycle effect. The stroke ratio and the ratio of maximum to minimum in-cylinder volumes may change with load and speed to provide the best fuel conversion efficiency.

Results of vehicle driving cycle simulations of a light duty gasoline vehicle with the advanced engine show dramatic improvements of fuel economy. The novel gasoline vehicle has close to diesel fuel energy usage and CO 2 production while retaining the after treatment advantages of the stoichiometric operation with spark ignition. Coupled to advanced powertrains using mechanical kinetic energy recovery systems to recover the braking energy thus reducing the thermal energy supply in the following acceleration phase, these engines may offer even better than current hybrid electric vehicles fuel economy (comparison of compact size passenger cars with a turbo direct injection diesel and a mechanical kinetic energy recovery system and a gasoline hybrid electric vehicle published in a previous paper).

40|$|AbstractEngine {{coherent}} flow {{structures such as}} swirl {{and tumble}} motions are key factors for the combustion process due to their capability to rise turbulence levels and enhance mixing which, in turns, severely influence both fuel efficiency and pollutant emissions. Automotive industry has therefore put great efforts over the last decades in evaluating air flow during <b>induction</b> <b>stroke</b> and air flow within the cylinder. Nowadays swirl and tumble motion characterizing a specific cylinder head are evaluated experimentally at design stage mainly using stationary flow benches. Such tests allow characterizing each head prototype using non-dimensional parameters like swirl and tumble ratios and, finally, to compare the different designs. In the present work the authors focused their attention on the swirl ratio characterization, firstly reviewing the two main methodologies for evaluating such parameter and more precisely the AVL and the Ricardo ones. A numerical method is then proposed in order to reproduce the stationary test bench with the final goal to develop a fast and accurate virtual test bench for cylinder head design. Simulations {{have been carried out}} on different VM Motori engine heads for which experimental data were available. The comparison between computational and experimental swirl ratios allowed to evaluate the suitability of using a virtual test bench as alternative or complementary to experiments. These results widened the understanding of the swirl fluid-dynamics and suggested that care must be taken when comparing duct designs having no geometrical similarity. Finally dynamic simulations have been performed for the head prototypes in order to compute the engine swirl in realistic conditions and to compare it with the steady bench results. This allowed evaluating the capability of the two different “static” swirl ratio definition (AVL/Ricardo) in correctly estimating real engine swirl...|$|E
40|$|Background: For {{successful}} translation {{to clinical}} stroke studies, the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Round Table criteria have been proposed. Two important criteria are testing of therapeutic interventions in conscious {{animals and the}} presence of a co-morbidity factor. We chose to work with hypertensive rats since hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor for stroke and influences the clinical outcome. We aimed to compare the susceptibility to ischemia in hypertensive rats with those in normotensive controls in a rat model for <b>induction</b> of ischemic <b>stroke</b> in conscious animals. Methods: The vasoconstrictor endothelin- 1 was stereotactically applied {{in the vicinity of the}} middle cerebral artery of control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYRs) and Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHRs) to induce a transient decrease in striatal blood flow, which was measured by the Laser Doppler technique. Infarct size was assessed histologically by Cresyl Violet staining. Sensory-motor functions were measured at several time points using the Neurological Deficit Score. Activation of microglia and astrocytes in the striatum and cortex was investigated by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against CD 68 /Iba- 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Results and conclusions: The SHRs showed significantly larger infarct volumes and more pronounced sensory-motor deficits, compared to the WKYRs at 24 h after the insult. However, both differences disappeared between 24 and 72 h. In SHRs, microglia were less susceptible to activation by lipopolysaccharide and there was a reduced microglial activation after <b>induction</b> of ischemic <b>stroke.</b> These quantitative and qualitative differences may be relevant for studying the efficacy of new treatments for stroke in accordance to the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Round Table criteria...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of {{long-term}} disability, with around three-quarters of stroke survivors experiencing motor problems. Intensive physiotherapy is currently the most effective treatment for post-stroke motor deficits, but much recent research has been targeted at increasing the effects of the intervention by pairing it {{with a wide variety of}} adjunct therapies, all of which aim to increase cortical plasticity, and thereby hope to maximize functional outcome. Here, we review the literature describing neurochemical changes underlying plasticity <b>induction</b> following <b>stroke.</b> We discuss methods of assessing neurochemicals in humans, and how these measurements change post-stroke. Motor learning in healthy individuals has been suggested as a model for stroke plasticity, and we discuss the support for this model, and what evidence it provides for neurochemical changes. One converging hypothesis from animal, healthy and stroke studies is the importance of the regulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA for the induction of cortical plasticity. We discuss the evidence supporting this hypothesis, before finally summarizing the literature surrounding the use of adjunct therapies such as non-invasive brain stimulation and SSRIs in post-stroke motor recovery, both of which have been show to influence the GABAergic system...|$|R
