25|$|The bloated stomach, {{as seen in}} the {{adjacent}} picture, represents a form of malnutrition called <b>kwashiorkor</b> which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake. Better medicine will prevent the pictured symptoms in which included is weight loss and muscle wasting from further taking form.|$|E
25|$|In humans, an {{unhealthy}} diet can cause deficiency-related {{diseases such as}} blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition {{can lead to the}} wasting of <b>kwashiorkor</b> in acute cases, and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|Adoption of the nixtamalization process did not {{accompany}} the grain to Europe and beyond, {{perhaps because the}} Europeans already had more efficient milling processes for hulling grain mechanically. Without alkaline processing, maize is a much less beneficial foodstuff, and malnutrition struck many areas where it became a dominant food crop. In the nineteenth century, pellagra epidemics were recorded in France, Italy, and Egypt, and <b>kwashiorkor</b> hit parts of Africa where maize had become a dietary staple.|$|E
25|$|The nixtamalization {{process was}} very {{important}} in the early Mesoamerican diet, as unprocessed maize is deficient in free niacin. A population depending on untreated maize as a staple food risks malnourishment, and {{is more likely to}} develop deficiency diseases such as pellagra. Maize also is deficient in essential amino acids, which can result in <b>kwashiorkor.</b> Maize cooked with lime provided niacin in this diet. Beans, when consumed with the maize, provided the amino acids required to balance the diet for protein.|$|E
25|$|In {{emergency}} situations {{where there is}} a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, protein-energy malnutrition is most common among young children. Marasmus, a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. <b>Kwashiorkor,</b> a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect physical and mental development. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal. In these situations, MSF sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.|$|E
25|$|Undernourishment is {{most often}} due to not enough {{high-quality}} food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and <b>kwashiorkor</b> (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} the egusi-itoo seed is 44% oil, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 4% ash and 3% fiber. The oil of this seed is 64.9% {{linoleic}} acid, 12.4% oleic acid, 11.8% stearic acid and 10.9% palmitic acid. Vitamins Thiamin, Niacin, B1 and B2 are also {{prevalent in the}} seed, {{as well as many}} micronutrients. Notable minerals include phosphorus, as the largest mineral component, with potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur, calcium, iron and zinc to follow. The bulk of carbohydrates are starch and soluble sugars. Egusi-itoo is the perfect complement to the largely starch-rich grain diet of Africa, providing a high-protein and high-energy concentrate. The seed contains every important macro and micro-nutrient in quantities ideal for nutrition. The amino acid content of egusi-itoo proteins makes it a sufficient vegetable protein. This composition is ideal for sick and growing bodies, providing essential amino acids and calories. Just 100 g of seed daily provides essential fatty acid, amino acid and Vitamin E requirements. There is potential for these seeds as a critical tool for interventions in diseases such as marasmus and <b>kwashiorkor.</b>|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the offensive, the ANC became {{involved}} in ethnic violence between the Baluba and Bena Lulua. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. In September, Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN Secretary-General who had recently deployed a large peacekeeping force to the Congo, referred to the massacres as [...] "a case of incipient genocide". The Baluba were also attacked by the Katangese from the south. In the ensuring massacres, in which ANC or Katangese troops often participated, around 3,000 Baluba were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of many thousands of Luba civilians who fled their homes to flee the fighting with more than 35,000 left in refugee camps in Élisabethville (the capital of Katanga) alone. As many as 100,000 sought refuge in Bakwanga. Diseases, notably <b>kwashiorkor</b> but also malaria, smallpox and anemia, were widespread and reached [...] "epidemic proportions" [...] among Luba refugees between October and December 1960.|$|E
500|$|The media {{coverage}} from the event brought national {{attention to the}} food insecurity issues in the Delta. Most Americans were shocked by the conditions described in the area. Almost immediately, the Field Foundation of New York dispatched a team of doctors to Mississippi to examine children and verify the senators' findings. They labeled the conditions they observed a [...] "national disaster," [...] documenting cases of <b>Kwashiorkor,</b> Rickets, and other signs of malnutrition and starvation. One doctor likened state of affairs to the worst {{he had seen in}} eastern Kenya. This countered initial public reactions of disbelief at the severity of the situation. The Citizens Crusade Against Poverty, an advocacy group already studying the problems in the Delta, quickly created a [...] "Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition in the United States." [...] In April 1968, the board published a report of its findings, entitled Hunger U.S.A.. This was shortly followed by a critique of the National School Lunch Program by a coalition of women's organizations.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Kwashiorkor</b> {{is mainly}} caused by {{inadequate}} protein intake. The main symptoms are edema, wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair. <b>Kwashiorkor</b> is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status. The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means [...] "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," [...] as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "severe malnutrition" [...] or [...] "severe undernutrition" [...] {{is often}} used to refer {{specifically}} to PEM. PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency. Two forms of PEM are <b>kwashiorkor</b> and marasmus, and they commonly coexist.|$|E
2500|$|Another area of {{uncertainty}} {{lies in the}} descriptions of disease given by tenants as {{to the cause of}} their relatives' deaths. Though the 1851 census has been rightly criticised as underestimating the true extent of mortality, it does provide a framework for the medical history of the Great Famine. The diseases that badly affected the population fell into two categories: famine-induced diseases and diseases of nutritional deficiency. Of the nutritional deficiency diseases, the most commonly experienced were starvation and marasmus, as well as a condition at the time called dropsy. Dropsy (oedema) was a popular name given for the symptoms of several diseases, one of which, <b>kwashiorkor,</b> is associated with starvation.|$|E

50|$|Marasmus {{is a form}} {{of severe}} {{malnutrition}} characterized by energy deficiency. A child with marasmus looks emaciated. Body weight is reduced to less than 62.36% of the normal (expected) body weight for the age. Marasmus occurrence increases prior to age 1, whereas <b>kwashiorkor</b> occurrence increases after 18 months. It can be distinguished from <b>kwashiorkor</b> in that <b>kwashiorkor</b> is protein deficiency with adequate energy intake whereas marasmus is inadequate energy intake in all forms, including protein. This clear-cut separation of marasmus and <b>kwashiorkor</b> is however not always clinically evident as <b>kwashiorkor</b> is often seen in a context of insufficient caloric intake, and mixed clinical pictures, called marasmic <b>kwashiorkor,</b> are possible. Protein wasting in <b>kwashiorkor</b> generally leads to edema and ascites, while muscular wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat are the main clinical signs of marasmus.|$|E
50|$|The bloated stomach, {{as seen in}} the {{adjacent}} picture, represents a form of malnutrition called <b>kwashiorkor</b> which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake. Children are more vulnerable to <b>kwashiorkor,</b> advanced symptoms of which include weight loss and muscle wasting.|$|E
50|$|Essential {{amino acid}} {{deficiency}} should {{be distinguished from}} protein-energy malnutrition, which can manifest as marasmus or <b>kwashiorkor.</b> <b>Kwashiorkor</b> was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories ("sugar baby syndrome"). However, this theory has been challenged by the finding {{that there is no}} difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to <b>kwashiorkor.</b> Still, for instance in Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) maintained by the USDA, lack of {{one or more of the}} essential amino acids is described as protein-energy malnutrition.|$|E
