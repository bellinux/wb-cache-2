40|$|Determination of {{residual}} renal function with <b>iohexol</b> clearance in hemodialysis patients. Residual renal function (RRF) may {{contribute significantly to}} the total dialysis prescription. Conventional quantitation of RRF in hemodialysis (HD) patients is measured by urea clearance and requires a 24 -hour urine collection which {{is often difficult to}} perform and inaccurate. The renal clearance of <b>iohexol</b> was evaluated as an alternative method for RRF assessment (iohexol-derived RRF) in hemodialysis patients. An intravenous bolus of <b>iohexol</b> (12 ml; 300 mg iodine/ml) was administered to 42 hemodialysis patients following routine HD. A single blood sample was obtained approximately 44 hours later (pre-HD) to determine the plasma clearance of <b>iohexol</b> using x-ray fluorescence methods. Total body clearance of <b>iohexol</b> (CTBio) and non-renal clearance of <b>iohexol</b> (CNRio) 2. 87 ± 0. 3 ml/min (mean ± sem) were used to calculate iohexol-derived RRF (CTBio – CNRio). Iohexol-derived RRF determinations were then compared to urea clearance-derived RRF measurements. The RRF contribution to the dialysis prescription was also calculated utilizing iohexol-derived RRF compared to urea-derived RRF. Iohexol-derived RRF did not differ from urea-derived RRF (2. 48 ± 0. 3 vs. 2. 64 ± 0. 4 ml/min, P = 0. 21). The RRF contribution to the weekly dialysis prescription (Kt/V) did not differ when iohexol-derived RRF was compared to urea-derived RRF (0. 94 ± 0. 1 vs. 0. 93 ± 0. 1, P = 0. 9). Additionally, the effect of <b>iohexol</b> on RRF was assessed in 17 HD patients.

Intravascular ultrasound is used for detection of complex vessel wall structures after catheter-based interventions; however, differentiation between the lumen and these wall structures can be difficult. Methods. In 12 anesthetized dogs, intracoronary ultrasound was performed during intracoronary bolus injection (3 and 6 ml) of different contrast agents (hand-agitated saline solution, standard <b>iohexol,</b> sonicated <b>iohexol,</b> hand-agitated <b>iohexol,</b> SHU 454, SHU 508). Contrast intensity was quantified by videodensitometry, and contrast homogeneity was assessed qualitatively (grade 0 to 3). Results. Peak contrast intensities for SHU 454 and SHU 508 (mean [± SD] 48 ± 9 and 36 ± 6 U, respectively) were higher compared with standard, sonicated or agitated <b>iohexol</b> (16 ± 3, 28 ± 7 and 20 ± 3 U, respectively) or with agitated saline solution (17 ± 4 U); intensities were higher for 6 ml compared with that for 3 ml. Contrast homogeneity was higher for SHU 508 (mean [± SD] 3. 0 ± 0) and SHU 454 (2. 7 ± 0. 5) compared with the other agents (standard <b>iohexol</b> 1. 2 ± 0. 4, sonicated <b>iohexol</b> 2. 0 ± 0. 5, agitated <b>iohexol</b> 1. 8 ± 0. 6, agitated saline solution 1. 0 ± 0. 4). Exact delineation of the vessel wall surface was possible in 100 % of SHU 508 and in 88 % of SHU 454 injections compared with 13 % of agitated <b>iohexol</b> and 8 % of sonicated <b>iohexol</b> injections. Accurate surface delineation was never achieved with standard <b>iohexol</b> or agitated saline solution. Shadowing of parts of the vessel wall by contrast material occurred at peak intensity of 75 % of SHU 508 and 46 % of SHU 454 injections {{but not with the}} other agents. No adverse physiologic reactions were noted, except for transient negative inotropic effects after 6 ml of SHU 508. Conclusions.

This {{study investigated the}} effects of low- vs iso-osmolar contrast medium (CM) exposure on NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by tubular cells. X-ray attenuation of <b>iohexol,</b> iopamidol, and iodixanol was assessed at equimolar iodine concentrations and their effects on human renal proximal tubular cells (PTCs) were evaluated with equally attenuating solutions of each CM. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and necrosis were investigated by trypan blue exclusion, MTT assay, and annexin V/propidium iodide assay, respectively. ROS production was assessed by DCF assay, NADPH oxidase activity by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method, and Nox 4 expression by immunoblot. Yielding the same X-ray attenuation, CM cytotoxicity was assessed in PTCs at equimolar iodine concentrations. More necrosis was present after incubation with <b>iohexol</b> and iopamidol than after incubation with equal concentrations of iodixanol. <b>Iohexol</b> and iodixanol at low iodine concentrations induced less cytotoxicity than iopamidol. Moreover, both <b>iohexol</b> and iopamidol induced more apoptosis than iodixanol, with a dose-dependent effect. ROS generation was significantly higher with iopamidol and <b>iohexol</b> compared to iodixanol. NADPH oxidase activity and Nox 4 protein expression significantly increased after exposure to iopamidol and <b>iohexol,</b> with a dose-dependent effect, compared with iodixanol. CM-induced Nox 4 expression and activity depended upon Src activation. In conclusion, at angiographic concentrations, iodixanol induces fewer cytotoxic effects on cultured tubular cells than <b>iohexol</b> and iopamidol along with a lower induction of Nox 4 -dependent ROS generation.

To {{determine}} 'true' glomerular {{filtration rate}} (GFR) in healthy adults as renal clearance following infusion of inulin, and compare that result with those obtained using other markers and clearance techniques and with estimations of GFR using creatinine-based prediction equations. Material and methods. Twenty healthy volunteers (11 females) {{with a median}} age of 27 years (range 19 - 36 years) received bolus doses of inulin and <b>iohexol</b> i. v. and 16 blood samples were taken after injection. Then, inulin and <b>iohexol</b> were infused to give stable plasma concentrations and blood and urine samples were collected. Residual bladder volume was estimated using ultrasound scanning. Plasma and urine concentrations of inulin and <b>iohexol</b> were determined using chromatography and resorcinol methods, respectively. Different methods of GFR determination were compared as well as four formulae for GFR estimation based on serum creatinine. Results. 'True' GFR, i. e. renal clearance of inulin during its infusion, was a median of 117 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (inter-quartile range 106 - 129 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). Similar values of GFR were obtained with renal clearance of <b>iohexol</b> during its infusion and also with plasma (body) clearance of inulin or <b>iohexol</b> following bolus injections and using 16 or five plasma samples. Endogenous creatinine clearance was higher (p< 0. 001) than true GFR (median 23 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). Plasma clearance of <b>iohexol</b> and inulin based on their concentrations in four blood samples underestimated their renal clearance considerably. All four creatinine-based formulae markedly underestimated renal inulin clearance. Conclusions. Plasma and renal clearance of <b>iohexol</b> and inulin were similar in healthy adults.

There {{were no differences}} noted between the 2 agents in the mean changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate during or immediately after any angiography. However, significantly more patients had a decrease in diastolic Mood pressure of > 20 mm Hg during left coronary angiography with iodixanol.

The {{aim of this study}} was to extend the drug residence time within the knee joint by using a liposome formulation. DPPC-based liposomes were prepared with the radio contrast agent <b>iohexol</b> as a drug marker. 8 sheep had their right knees injected IA with <b>iohexol</b> liposomes and the contralateral joints with either free <b>iohexol</b> or empty liposomes. Joints were radiographed at multiple time points up to 16 days post-injection. Iohexol-mediated radiopacity was quantified by densitometer. Sheep were sacrificed at the end of the study for microscopy of synovial tissues. Good visualization of iohexol-mediated radiopacity with fine anatomical definition was possible throughout the experiment.

Cellular and tissue localization with light microscopy was possible through use of frozen sections and because of the large liposome size. Residence of encapsulated <b>iohexol</b> within the knee joint was greatly prolonged. Liposomal <b>iohexol</b> declined bi-exponentially with a terminal elimination half-life of 134 hours.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exogenous tracer-based {{methods of}} {{measuring}} glomerular filtration rate (GFR) {{are difficult to}} perform, whilst creatinine-based estimation formulae are inaccurate. METHODS: We assessed a new technique of measuring <b>iohexol</b> clearance using timed dried capillary blood spots. A reference GFR was measured in 81 subjects (GFR 15 - 124 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2)) by <b>iohexol</b> clearance using three venous samples (2, 3 and 4 h after an intravenous bolus). GFR was estimated by six test methods; <b>iohexol</b> clearance using (i) 3 blood spots (2, 3, 4 h); (ii) 2 blood spots (2, 4 h) and (iii) 1 blood spot (4 h); (iv) the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula; (v) the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and (vi) a formula estimating GFR from serum cystatin C concentration. For each test method the bias and precision were calculated as the {{mean and standard deviation}} (SD) of the 'GFR differences' (test method GFR - reference GFR). RESULTS: The limits of agreement (bias +/- 1. 96 x SD; in ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2)) were: (i) 1. 1 +/- 15. 1 for 3 -spot <b>iohexol</b> clearance; (ii) 0. 6 +/- 14. 9 for 2 -spot <b>iohexol</b> clearance; (iii) 4. 5 +/- 21. 2 for 1 -spot <b>iohexol</b> clearance; (iv) - 15. 7 +/- 33. 3 for the MDRD formula; (v) - 9. 6 +/- 32. 9 for the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and (vi) - 12. 1 +/- 31. 7 for the Cystatin C formula. The accuracy of all six test methods was similar among individuals with GFR or = 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2), the MDRD, Cockcroft-Gault and Cystatin C formulae were all imprecise and systematically underestimated GFR. CONCLUSIONS: Blood spot <b>iohexol</b> clearance provides a potentially practical method of estimating GFR accurately in large-scale epidemiological studies especially among individuals without established chronic kidney disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{crossover}} study {{was performed to}} compare the hemodynamic effects of the isoosmolar contrast agent iodixanol (Visipaque(R)) 320 mg I/ml {{to those of the}} low-osmolar <b>iohexol</b> (Omnipaque(R)) 350 mg I/ml. The main hypothesis was that iodixanol and <b>iohexol</b> would affect left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) to different degrees. In 48 patients with reduced cardiac function (mean ejection fraction 33. 4 %), one ventricular injection was performed with each contrast medium, Ventricular, aortic and right atrial pressures and heart rate were measured continuously. Cardiac output (using Fick's principle) and systemic vascular resistance were calculated. LVEDP increased with both agents, but significantly less after iodixanol than after <b>iohexol</b> (P < 0. 01), also in subgroups of patients in whom baseline LVEDP was severely increased and in whom 3 -vessel disease was present. Immediate changes in variables reflecting vasodilatation were similar with both agents, In conclusion, both contrast agents influenced hemodynamics during ventriculography, but iodixanol had significantly less influence on LVEDP than did <b>iohexol.</b> (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. The authors {{established}} a rat {{model of the}} twitching reaction to contrast media in striated muscle and investigated the influence of nonionic contrast medium on the twitching reaction regarding the nonionic dimer iodixanol compared with the monomer <b>iohexol</b> and the dimer iotrolan. The authors also studied the influences from the electrolyte additions of iodixanol. METHODS. The interval from start of contrast medium injection to start of head movement was compared for <b>iohexol</b> (140 and 350 mg iodine/mL), iodixanol (150 and 320 mg iodine/mL), and iotrolan (300 mg iodine/mL). Comparison was made with mannitol and mannitol containing the same electrolyte concentrations as iodixanol (150 and 320 mg iodine/mL). RESULTS. No differences in latency period were found between <b>iohexol</b> 140 mg iodine/mL (isotonic) and 350 mg iodine/mL (880 mOsm/kg). Iodixanol caused a lesser effect on the twitching reaction than the <b>iohexol</b> solutions and iotrolan. When the electrolytes of iodixanol were added to mannitol (300 mOsm/kg), there was a later onset of the twitching reaction than with electrolyte-free mannitol. CONCLUSIONS. Differences in latency period caused by a change in osmolality were not found. The interval for a twitching reaction was longer with iodixanol than with <b>iohexol,</b> iotrolan, and iso-osmolar mannitol. The weak effect of the iodixanol solution was probably partially caused by the electrolyte content...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Determining renal {{function}} (i. e glomerular filtration rate) is in {{many ways}} essential in clinical practice, in terms of diagnosis and drug therapy. Exogenous markers, such as <b>iohexol,</b> are mainly used for a more accurate determination of GFR. A low dosage of <b>iohexol</b> is injected to the patient and GFR is determined by using an algorithm and plasma concentrations measured at 2 and 5 hours after administration. Non-parametric population pharmacokinetic models are invaluable tools for describing the pharmacokinetic properties of different drug and are suitable for identifying subpopulations deviating pharmacokinetic properties. Population models, unlike algorithms are not dependent on specific sampling times. Method: A standardized dose of <b>iohexol</b> is injected and up to 12 plasma concentrations of <b>iohexol</b> are measured with HPLC-UV. The pharmacokinetic properties are investigated using non-parametric population modeling (Pmetrics®). With the help of the MMopt function in Pmetrics®, the most informative sampling times for determining the AUC of <b>iohexol</b> are identified. The developed model is then utilized to investigate optimal sampling times to determine the AUC for <b>iohexol,</b> which is then used to determine individual GFR. The model is assessed against AUC determined with the trapezoidal method and also the standard method where GFR is determined using plasma concentrations 2 and 5 hours after administration. Results: 13 renal transplant recipients were included in the study. A 2 -compartment model with primary parameters allometrically scaled with centralized body weight described the pharmacokinetic properties of <b>iohexol</b> best. Individual observation-prediction plot showed r 2 -values at 0. 996. With the optimal sampling times determined {{with the help of the}} MMopt function, GFR was determined with both 2 -and 3 -point measurements. Predicted GFR showed close values to the reference for most but was massively underpredicted for certain patients. Conclusion: The massive underprediction was most likely due to the limited number of test subjects included in this study. Future work on building a better model will require the inclusion of more patients; especially more data in the later post administration phase in patients with low renal function...|$|E
