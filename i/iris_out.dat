2500|$|... is {{the eldest}} son of a noble family pledged to the {{protection}} of the Lucian royal family. While he acts as Noctis's guardian as tradition demands, his bond with Noctis is more akin to that between brothers. During their youth, Gladiolus disliked Noctis due to the latter's cold attitude, but warmed to him when Noctis kept Gladiolus' sister <b>Iris</b> <b>out</b> of trouble. During the course of the story, Gladiolus serves as both Noctis' most loyal companion and a foil for his impulsive nature. He is briefly demoralized when he is easily defeated by Ravus, and during the events of Episode Gladiolus proves himself to the first King's Shield Gilgamesh and regains his faith in his role as Noctis' King's Shield. The events at Altissia and Ignis' injury drive a brief wedge between Gladiolus and Noctis until Ignis forces a reconciliation. Gladiolus and Ignis later make their way through the Niflheim fortress Zegnautus Keep after being separated from Noctis, encountering the Daemon form of Emperor Aldercapt and seeing footage of Ravus' death. Gladiolus, along with Noctis' other companions, become Daemon Hunters until his return, and accompanies him to the final battle against Ardyn.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is {{an end to}} everything, my lord, in {{the world}} we live in. You have reached the end of my {{readiness}} to answer questions." [...] The Englishman and the Irishman looked at each other: the Anglo-Saxon was impenetrably cool; the Celt was flushed and angry. They might have been {{on the brink of a}} quarrel, but for Lord Harry's native quickness of perception, and his exercise of it at that moment. When he had called at Mr. Vimpany's house, and had asked for Iris, the doctor had got rid of him by means of a lie. After this discovery, at what conclusion could he arrive? The doctor was certainly keeping <b>Iris</b> <b>out</b> of his way. Reasoning in this rapid manner, Lord Harry let one offence pass, in his headlong eagerness to resent another. He instantly left Mountjoy. Again the carriage rattled back along the street; but it was stopped before it reached Mr. Vimpany's door.|$|E
60|$|Now, it is evident, that, in this case, the {{question}} of right is on the same ground as in that of gilding. If it be clearly understood that a marble facing does not pretend or imply a marble wall, there is no harm in it; and as it is also evident that, when very precious stones are used, as jaspers and serpentines, it must become, not only an extravagant and vain increase of expense, but sometimes an actual impossibility, to obtain mass of them enough to build with, there is no resource but this of veneering; nor is there anything to be alleged against it {{on the head of}} durability, such work having been by experience found to last as long, and in as perfect condition, as any kind of masonry. It is, therefore, to be considered as simply an art of mosaic on a large scale, the ground being of brick, or any other material; and when lovely stones are to be obtained, it is a manner which should be thoroughly understood, and often practised. Nevertheless, as we esteem the shaft of a column more highly for its being of a single block, and as we do not regret the loss of substance and value which there is in things of solid gold, silver, agate, or ivory; so I think the walls themselves may be regarded with a more just complacency if they are known to be all of noble substance; and that rightly weighing the demands of the two principles of which we have hitherto spoken--Sacrifice and Truth, we should sometimes rather spare external ornament than diminish the unseen value and consistency of what we do; and I believe that a better manner of design, and a more careful and studious, if less abundant decoration would follow, upon the consciousness of thoroughness in the substance. And, indeed, this is to be remembered, with respect to all the points we have examined; that while we have traced the limits of license, we have not fixed those of that high rectitude which refuses license. It is thus true that there is no falsity, and much beauty in the use of external color, and that it is lawful to paint either pictures or patterns on whatever surfaces may seem to need enrichment. But it is not less true, that such practices are essentially unarchitectural; and while we cannot say that there is actual danger in an over use of them, seeing that they have been always used most lavishly in the times of most noble art, yet they divide the work into two parts and kinds, one of less durability than the other, which dies away from it in process of ages, and leaves it, unless it have noble qualities of its own, naked and bare. That enduring noblesse I should, therefore, call truly architectural; and it is not until this has been secured that the accessory power of painting may be called in, for the delight of the immediate time; nor this, as I think, until every resource of a more stable kind has been exhausted. The true colors of architecture are those of natural stone, and I would fain see these taken advantage of to the full. Every variety of hue, from pale yellow to purple, passing through orange, red, and brown, is entirely at our command; nearly every kind of green and gray is also attainable: and with these, and pure white, what harmonies might we not achieve? Of stained and variegated stone, the quantity is unlimited, the kinds innumerable; where brighter colors are required, let glass, and gold protected by glass, be used in mosaic--a kind of work as durable as the solid stone, and incapable of losing its lustre by time--and let the painter's work be reserved for the shadowed loggia and inner chamber. This is the true and faithful way of building; where this cannot be, the device of external coloring may, indeed, be employed without dishonor; but it must be with the warning reflection, that a time will come when such aids must pass away, and when the building will be judged in its lifelessness, dying the death of the dolphin. Better the less bright, more enduring fabric. The transparent alabasters of San Miniato, and the mosaics of St. Mark's, are more warmly filled, and more brightly touched, by every return of morning and evening rays; while the hues of our cathedrals have died like the <b>iris</b> <b>out</b> of the cloud; and the temples whose azure and purple once flamed above the Grecian promontories, stand in their faded whiteness, like snows which the sunset has left cold.|$|E
50|$|The iris shot {{is divided}} into two types {{depending}} on their use. An <b>Iris</b> <b>out</b> is used {{at the end of a}} scene, and an Iris in is used at the start of a scene, often after a previous <b>iris</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

50|$|Much later, Bugs and Sam are in {{a single}} rowboat, Bugs in a deck chair like a {{steamboat}} passenger, Sam rowing the boat for Bugs' trip around the world.

50|$|The rabbit, big dog {{and little}} dog all end up {{crashing}} into each other, {{at which point}} both immediately attempt to pack everything back into Sham-Fu's trunk.

50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the cartoon, an unseen narrator asks the worm if he must go through this routine every day just to get something to eat.

5000|$|Despite his {{marriage}} to Laura, Iris wasn't far from his mind. Even when she met and married politician, Spencer Garrison, he still loved her.

50|$|The film is {{an affectionate}} {{parody of the}} classic horror film genre, in {{particular}} the various film adaptations of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein produced by Universal in the 1930s. Most of the lab equipment used as props was created by Kenneth Strickfaden for the 1931 film Frankenstein. To help evoke {{the atmosphere of the}} earlier films, Brooks shot the picture entirely in black and white, a rarity in the 1970s, and employed 1930s' style opening credits and scene transitions such as <b>iris</b> <b>outs,</b> wipes, and fades to black. The film also features a period score by Brooks' longtime composer John Morris.|$|R
5000|$|The tenth (and final) segment {{includes}} {{scenes that}} are again literal interpretations of certain marine boats {{and air force}} planes. A plane is shot into {{the air with a}} large catapult, another plane is shown with a tricycle landing gear (actually a small man riding a tricycle attached to the plane), an aircraft carrier is presented (which carries remains of crashed planes) and a mine sweeper (a boat with two mechanical hands operating a broom to sweep mines away).

5000|$|Finally, Henery decides {{the only}} way to settle the matter is to see who crows at dawn, and they all agree with Foghorn alone. Sylvester has his mouth open because he {{typically}} always has his mouth open, looking dumbfounded but Barnyard Dawg thinks Sylvester is crowing and walks off after hearing enough and Henery mistakes this for the sound of the rooster and he drags Sylvester away. However, it turns out that Foghorn was crowing, and he shows a book on ventriloquism. Foghorn tells the audience [...] "You gotta- I say -you gotta keep on your toes. Toes, that is!" [...] just before the cartoon <b>irises</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after Bugs walks away, lamenting how he can't abide a dishonest police officer, Elmer calls out: [...] "Oh, Judge, wiww you mawwy me?" [...] Elmer is now {{wearing a}} bridal veil. A top hat falls on Bugs, and he accepts the proposal. As with Rabbit of Seville, the [...] "Wedding March" [...] by Mendelssohn {{plays in the}} underscore, as Bugs is {{carrying}} Elmer toward a cottage. Bugs says to the audience: [...] "Ya know, I think it always helps a picture to have a romantic ending." [...] <b>Iris</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 4. Finally, the Coyote paints iron glue on an ACME Boomerang, {{but when}} he prepares to launch the boomerang, the glue droops down onto his hand, {{sticking}} the Coyote onto the boomerang and carrying him with it as he throws it. While still in the air, Wile E. attempts to free himself from the sticky boomerang, but only ends up getting both his hands stuck on his head. He crashes rear first on the ground, then walks away with the boomerang stuck on his back legs. An <b>iris</b> <b>out</b> shaped like a boomerang appears, then stops to show the words The End.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} {{no one else can}} understand it, Patricia grows closer to Marcus and when he is kicked out of his brother's home she invites him to stay with her, citing that he will be a positive male influence for her daughter. When Iris grows curious about what happened to her father, Patricia tearfully explains how he had murdered a police officer in retaliation for the murder of two Panthers. She explains that the police arrested her and Marcus tells Iris that he told them where her father was in order to save Patricia from going to jail and keep <b>Iris</b> <b>out</b> of the foster care system.|$|E

50|$|Confused, {{the alien}} {{goes back to}} his flying saucer and drills into the rock to rise up from {{underneath}} the campsite and take it back to his home planet. After some more confusion and chaos as Sylvester freaks out and realizes they are leaving Earth, which Porky is completely unaware of and blissfully ignores, they eventually are released from the saucer's top as they leave the gravity field of Earth. Sylvester is utterly panicking and praying at this point, but fortunately they land on an alien world and safely wake up to leave, unaware that they are being observed by a pair of giant bird-like aliens who probably have a surprise planned for them as the cartoon <b>irises</b> <b>out...</b>|$|R
5000|$|At this point, while Bugs is chuckling at Sam's misfortunes in the desert, the Sultan, {{who turns}} out to be none other than Yosemite Sam himself, tries to press the button to drop Bugs, only to find that Bugs has shut off the master switch, {{frustrating}} Sam. When Sam tries to find out what is wrong, Bugs resets the master switch, dropping Sam into the crocodile pit, from which he escapes, but not before one of the crocodiles also escapes, sending Sam running off. Bugs, now dressed with turbans covering each ear, describes Sam's act as a [...] "don't call us, we'll call you" [...] act, along with some other remarks as the camera <b>irises</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
