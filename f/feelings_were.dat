He was 33 {{years old and}} married when he joined her class; he later left {{his wife in the}} hope that he might marry Eddy, but his <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> not reciprocated. Spofford and seven other {{students}} agreed to form an association that would pay Eddy a certain amount a week if she would preach to them every Sunday. They called themselves the Christian Scientists' Association.|$|E
5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle failed, and that The Evil Queen will never be more powerful than him. She then tells him that {{she had nothing to}} do with Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> real) and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, leaping off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to {{form the}} new province's first government. As premier, his first task was to win a {{workable}} majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, which {{he did in the}} 1905 provincial election. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established everything from speed limits to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected Edmonton over rival Calgary as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> not salved when the government located the University of Alberta, a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of Strathcona, just across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton.|$|E

The first three types of brand <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> experiential and immediate: (a)'warmth' feeling (b)'fun' feeling (c)'excitement' feeling.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to discuss how <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> {{experienced}} and what feelings mean to the conscious experience of the world. To do so, this project examines A theory of the emotions, by Jean-Paul Sartre, which discusses emotions from a phenomenological standpoint. Sartre characterizes feelings as constituting a magical world where <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> ultimately understood as being internal conscious meaningful phenomena and sometimes determined by social experiences. In order to elaborate and discuss Sartre's ideas, perspectives on emotions and beliefs are examined through a cognitive psychological perspective. This project concludes that the significance of <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> best understood from a phenomenological standpoint where <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> approached as situated meaning, which is continually negotiated by situational demands and internal motives. Furthermore this project concludes that the individual person's ability to understand their subjective <b>feelings</b> <b>is</b> dependent {{on the ability to}} become aware and reflect on the situational, motivational and social nature of his or her feelings...|$|R
50|$|Smith {{presents}} {{the argument that}} approval or disapproval of the <b>feelings</b> of others <b>is</b> completely determined by whether we sympathize or fail to sympathize with their emotions. Specifically, if we sympathize with the feelings of another we judge that their <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> just, {{and if we do}} not sympathize we judge that their <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> unjust.|$|R
5|$|In Vaikom, a {{small town}} in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of {{untouchability}} in and around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised Satyagraha. Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On the fourteenth of April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation. In spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title Vaikom Veeran, given by his followers who participated in the Satyagraha.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, the English {{began to}} {{consider}} themselves {{superior to the}} Welsh, Scots and Bretons. The English perceived themselves as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, similar <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> expressed about the Irish, with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in 14th-century English legislation. The English also felt strongly about the foreign traders {{who lived in the}} special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages; the position of the Jews is described below, but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns. Even within England, different identities abounded, each with their own sense of status and importance. Regional identities could be important - men and women from Yorkshire, for example, had a clear identity within English society, and professional groups with a distinct identity, such as lawyers, engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London.|$|E
5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has {{the club}} split up into pairs to sing ballads to one another. As Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is absent, Will {{is forced to}} take his place and sing with Rachel (Lea Michele), who develops a crush on him. Will is dismayed, remembering Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), the last student who had such strong feelings for him. When her <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> not reciprocated, she was so distraught she ate an extremely hot pepper from Mexico, was hospitalized, and had to have an esophagus transplant. Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains {{that the two of them}} are similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for Will reflect her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her for who she is.|$|E

5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

As his career developed his arias grew much longer but a lyrical sense was still his overriding target.|$|E

25|$|The poem also captures some {{feelings}} in Coleridge's previous works, especially in analyzing a problematic childhood and {{an exploration of}} religion. Partly, these <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> fueled by his inability to accept his opium addiction and other problems. The poems also contain Coleridge's desires for Hutchinson, but these were later removed from the printed edition of the works. The editions are so different that they reflect the conflict and division that Coleridge felt during 1802. The tone of the poems are different, as the original was passionate and emotional, and the printed version was organized and philosophical.|$|E
25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> irrelevant. But it does mean that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E
25|$|Several {{enclaves}} of Indians existed to {{the east}} of the frontier, among the Moravians near Bethlehem and elsewhere. The nearest of these were the Susquehannock tribe at Conestoga Town. To the north, such anger was directed by the settlers against the Moravian Indians, for their suspected part in abetting Indian raids, that the Moravians were sent to be kept in protective custody in Philadelphia. In Lancaster County, <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> very much aroused against the Susquehannocks, the more so after the Moravians were protected by the Commonwealth — whose authority the frontiersmen doubtless felt should be exerted for their protection against Indians and not vice versa. Col. Elder wrote to the government in September 1763, urging for the Susquehannocks to be removed to Philadelphia as well, but the proposal was declined.|$|E
