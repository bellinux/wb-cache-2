40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of the}} project was to compile and collate the literature relating to the ecosystem effects of fisheries in a format that would enhance future marine resource planning and management. To achieve this primary objective required the pursuit of a series of secondary objectives to: • Identify areas of concern with respect to interaction between fisheries and the marine environment. • Provide a review of the status of knowledge for each of the identified areas both by type of interaction and by geographical location in community waters. • Identify major interested institutions within the community. • Identify gaps in the knowledge relating to interactions between fisheries and the environment in community waters. • Conduct a preliminary appraisal of the Common Fisheries Policy to look at implications for the regulation of interactions. • Identify priority areas to facilitate future planning in relation to the interests of <b>DG</b> <b>XIV.</b> APPROACH AND METHODOLOG...|$|E
40|$|Due to Greece’s {{geography}} {{the fishery}} sector has been traditionally the basic {{source of income}} for the inhabitants of the majority of coastal areas, especially the islands. Women’s involvement with fisheries is predominantly in the regional and rural labour markets in Greece, and the position of women in Greek fisheries does not differ a lot from the position of women in the countryside in general. The contribution of fisheries to GDP was 0. 28 % in constant prices of 1971 and 0. 36 % in current prices (1998). The contribution of fisheries to the Gross Agricultural Product is 5. 3 % in current prices (1998). The contribution of the fishery sector to the country’s employment and to rural employment is around 5. 1 % and 1. 2 % respectively. However, the fishery sector is locally important and it is mostly identified with the less favoured and the geographically distanced areas of the country (island and coastal zones). 1. 2 SELECTION OF FDAS: THE SMALL SCALE FISHERIES SECTOR We collected information on five small scale fisheries projects. 1 All of these are pilot projects financed by <b>DG</b> <b>XIV</b> of European Commission and were implemented mainly in 1998 and 1999...|$|E

Different structure preparation techniques were also tested. Mounting and polishing lapilli for preparing frontal sections required significantly less processing time than for the sagittae. The increments in lapillus were clearly visible from the primordium to the otolith margin, whereas the intermediate zone in the sagittae was more opaque and prevented the detection of all the increments. The back-calculated hatchdates for otolith ages showed a good correlation with the species reproduction {{in the area and}} provided indirect validation for the age determination. The vertebrae centra showed increments with higher periodicity than seasonal. A test of symmetry on the ages derived from the sagitta and vertebra of the same fish indicated that the vertebra significantly underestimated the age. Considering the structure processing time and increment definition, as well as the age-length relationships obtained, it was concluded that the lapilli were the best ageing structure for juvenile dolphinfish. However, validation experiments should be carried out before the accuracy of this method can be determined.

40|$|Ehrich, Siegfried [...] . et. al. [...] 70 pages, 50 figures, 18 tables, 1 appendixThe German Small-scale Bottom Trawl Survey (GSBTS) was {{initiated}} in 1987 {{in order to}} provide complementary investigations to the International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) in the North Sea, using the same methodology but focussing high-intensity sampling on selected survey areas. Over the last 20 years, the initial number of 4 survey areas (10 × 10 nautical miles; >Boxes>) has been increased to 12, which are distributed over the entire North Sea. This paper describes the survey methods of the GSBTS, summarizes the scientific outcome of the first 20 years, and suggests that international fisheries research institutions would join the GSBTS. The major outcomes of the survey include to date: - Documentation changes in the distribution of fish species and in species assemblages (e. g. changes in species richness, shifts in the southern species component). - Geostatistical evaluation of GSBTS data. - Analysis of spatial scale effects: the relevance of GSBTS survey results for interpreting large-scaled abundance and distribution data from the IBTS. - Description of benthic habitats, composition of invertebrate fauna and its variability. - Process studies, especially investigation of predator-prey interactions between fish through analyses of stomach contents. - Characterization of the typical hydrographic conditions in the survey areas and their variability, and description of the nutrient supply. - Observations of seabirds and their feeding habits. - Analysis of the effects of different parameters on catch rates for bottom fish and on the estimates of abundance indices (e. g. vessel and gear effects, towing time, hydrographic conditions, time of day, number of hauls per area). In continuing this interdisciplinary survey with simultaneous sampling of all faunal and environmental compartments and especially in making it an international effort, we see the possibility of contributing data for the implementation of the ecosystems approach to fisheries management. Particularly, the following aspects can be addressed and would further increase the scientific value of the GSBTS: - Combining the survey data with highly resolved data from the commercial fishery to separate the effects of fishing from natural variability. - Further interdisciplinary analyses of the entire data set. Main aspects include benthos-fish-bird-community changes over time and their relation to historic fisheries impacts, and the coupling of biological and physical habitat characterisation. - Collection of accompanying data (phyto-, zoo- and ichthyoplankton data) {{in order to make the}} GSBTS a true ecosystem survey in detecting temporal changes in nearly all major levels of the food web. © E.

40|$|Study Contract <b>DG</b> <b>XIV.</b> Ref N°. : PEM / 93 / 005 Objectives: 1. To {{estimate}} the discards {{of commercial and}} non-commercial species, including pinnipeds, cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds, incidentally caught by different fishing gears of the Spanish fleets in ICES Divisions. 2. To estimate of the total volume and/or number discarded by fleet in each ICES Division by scaling-up {{the results of the}} sampling programme using data on the fishing effort. 3. To obtain the size composition of the most significant species of discards of different fisheries unit. 4. To evaluate of the causes of discard procedures per fleet. 5. To evaluate {{of the impact of the}} fishing activity in each fishery unit in relation to the total biomass catches. Methodologies : A discard sampling programme, taking place during the year 1994, was applied based on stratified random sampling by fisheries unit. Fishing gears used were, Trawl, Long Line, Gill Net, and Purse Seine in the ICES Subareas: VI, VII, VIII and IX. Discards volume of all taxa, including target species and low or noncommercial interest species including marine mammals, marine reptiles and sea birds, were sampled and quantified by observers on board commercial Spanish fishing vessels. Results: In 1994 by-catches of marine mammals and sea turtles were no J recorded during the sampling period, and only 5 sea bird by-catches were seen by the observers.. The comparison of the fleets regarding their ratios of discards, in 1994 by Spanish fleets, shows that the larger percentages of discards relative to the total catches are produced in the trawler fisheries (about 35 to 59 %). Conversely, purse seining in Division IXa and Subdivision Vlllc west show the lowest discard rates (1 to 6 %). Long line (8 to 18 %) gill net (25 %) and purse seiners in Subdivision Vlllc East and Division Vlllb (4 to 30 %) have asome intermediate amount of discards). If we analyze the results of total discards made by the fleet, it is trawling which produces the highest discard values (11 155 to 28 006 n, whereas gill net and purse seine In Divisions Vlllc and IXa produces a low volume (146 to 321 t). Total discard estimations for long lining and purse seiners in Subdivision Vlllc East and Division Vlllb show asome intermediate discard values (503 to 5 788 t) The reasons for discarding in 1994 produced by the Spanish fleet were basically: - the lack of commercial interest in many of the species caught, - the length of the trips which mean that it is not possible to maintain certain species on board, - the Spanish fleet's lack of quota for fishing certain species in certain zones, - the size of the individuals caught being below the minimum legal size and/or below the size with a commercial value, - individuals which deteriorate during the fishing process, - the hold capacity of the vessel which means that discards are produced, particularly in the case of purse seining and trawling in coastal areas, - the economic demands or decisions (marked fall in price due to the abundance of discards on certain days), - in low commercial value species, when the haul catch is very low, this species is discarded. Data from this study will be made available to ICES Working Groups on Assessment of Southern Self Demersal Stocks for Hake Megrim and Monks, on Assessment of Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Sardine and Anchovy, on Assessment of Blue Whiting and in the Study Group on the Biology and Assessment of Deep-Sea Fisheries Resources...|$|E
