40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to carry out}} the Assembly, Integration and Verification of the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> of a technological experiment on-board the International Space Station. The <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> consists of three main subsystems, i. e. the on-board data handling, the electric power and the health management subsystem, and supports a technological experiment which focuses on the investigation of passive thermal control subsystem. The Assembly, Integration and Verification (AIV) campaign is a fundamental step of the design process, as the final objective of the AIV is to demonstrate that the end product meets the specified requirements. The selection of simple technical solutions and the necessity to keep cost down have driven the definition of the AIV plan, which has been tailored for the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> under consideration. Main purpose of the methodology for the Assembly, Integration and Verification is to provide the designer with a step-by-step procedure to accomplish the verification and validation of the <b>avionic</b> <b>system.</b> The methodology shall pursue an incremental approach, which defines the test plan from components to parts, subsystems and system levels through subsequent integrations. Being the AIV a crucial process for the mission reliability of any system, the proposed methodology shall pursue the enhancement of the system reliability and safety by defining, for instance, the most appropriate verification methods to verify the compliance with requirements, the tests to perform and the most correct tests sequence. Models philosophies are discussed and the most suitable model philosophy for the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> is selected. The methodology has been developed for the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> of a technological experiment but is flexible enough to be applicable to multi-purpose <b>avionic</b> <b>system,</b> capable to support different types of experiments.

For the data acquisition both onground and onboard <b>avionics</b> <b>systems</b> are developed for testing of a small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) helicopter. The onboard avionics record the helicopter state outputs namely accelerations, angular rates and Euler angles, in real time, and the on ground <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> record the inputs given to the radio controlled helicopter through a transmitter, in real time. The <b>avionic</b> <b>systems</b> are designed and developed taking into consideration low weight, small size, anti-vibration, low power consumption, and easy interfacing. To mitigate the medium frequency vibrations embedded on the UAV helicopter during flight, a damper is designed and its performance is evaluated.

40|$|Abstract. During {{last few}} years <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> {{research}} platform was invented at the Military University of Technology. This modular simulator allows user to design and verify <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> software using hardware-in-the-loop technique. Mathematical model of an airplane under tests is implemented on a high-performance computer which response to all control signals and environmental disturbances. Environment is simulated on a separate computer which can also visualize orientation and movement of the airplane. Plane structure and aerodynamic features as well as control data can be modified accordingly to user needs. The third PC is used as an interface unit between research platform and main computational unit of the <b>avionics</b> <b>system.</b> This device can send and receive information in real-time using various data protocols and interfaces depending on sensors and actuators that are planned {{to be used in}} real system. Those three computers work in a local area network and exchange data using Gigabit Ethernet standard. Possibility to simulate behavior of an UAV controlled by the developed <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> implemented on an embedded computer working in hardware-in-the-loop mode on the platform, allows software developer to debug any part of the application in various environment conditions very close to reality. Research platform gives also the possibility to modify algorithm and adjust its parameters in real-time to verify suitability of the implemented <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> software for the particular UAV. The <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> software developed using this simulation method minimize expensive in-flight tests and assure failsafe performance after first successful fligh...|$|R
