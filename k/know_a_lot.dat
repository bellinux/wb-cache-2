I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is {{to be open to}} everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed.

5|$|The other capture 10.Bxb5 {{has been}} {{subjected}} to extensive analysis and testing, which has led {{to the conclusion that the}} sequence 10...Nxe4 11.Nxe4 Qa5+ 12.Nfd2 Qxb5 13.Nxd6 Qa6 14.N2c4 Nd7 15.0-0 is more or less forced. In the resulting positions Black has found it difficult to generate any winning chances, and even finding equality has not been a simple task. The fact that one must <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of theory just to secure a draw has rendered the entire variation beginning with 9...b5 rather unattractive from Black's point of view, even though it appears to be objectively the best move.|$|E

25|$|Individuals <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{more about}} {{themselves}} {{than they do}} about others. Because information about others is less available, information about the self versus others leads people to make specific conclusions about their own risk, but results in them having a harder time making conclusions {{about the risks of}} others. This leads to differences in judgments and conclusions about self-risks compared to the risks of others, leading to larger gaps in the optimistic bias.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Marlena {{takes in}} John Black as her patient; he has amnesia {{and she is}} {{determined}} to help him recover his past. John and Marlena {{spend a lot of}} time together, and the pair fall in love. However, John seems to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about Stefano, leading Marlena to suspect he is Stefano. Later, Marlena finds a plastic surgeon's file containing before and after shots of both Roman and John. Marlena becomes convinced that John is Roman, and, over time, John took on the role of Roman. Marlena is later trying to talk down a suicidal jumper when she falls from a window ledge. Marlena lays in a coma, near death for a month. When she finally recovers, she and Roman renewed their vows on August 22, 1986. In his years with the ISA, Roman worked with a man named Orpheus. Roman accidentally killed Orpheus' wife while on assignment. To get back at Roman, Orpheus kidnaps Marlena and fakes her death. Roman shoots and kills Orpheus, but before he could rescue Marlena, she is presumed to have been killed in a plane crash.|$|E

500|$|The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was {{released}} that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies {{in its first}} week.

Corgan would later admit, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist.

[...] "We <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more about what we have to do than he did," [...] Kraft said. [...] "And we know where we're going." [...] The article described Kraft's role in the Gemini 5 mission, and drew on Kraft's frequent comparisons of his position as flight director with that of an orchestra conductor.|$|E

When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics.

500|$|The teleplay {{was written}} by Kenneth Biller and Taylor; Biller wrote the A-story {{that focused on the}} swarm of alien creatures while Taylor focused on the B-story of Kes' elogium. [...] Instead of writing from Digg's full prose story, Biller worked from a seven-page treatment. [...] Biller [...] reacted to the plot with the thought: [...] "a show about eating and sex — these are things I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about…" [...] Biller {{explained}} in a later interview that he fought for Neelix and Kes to already be living together and having sex when drafting the teleplay, but he was shot down by Taylor and Rick Berman out of concern for Kes' young age {{and that it would be}} more interesting to show the couple grappling with this for the first time.|$|E

I just remember someone telling me of the supposed fact that in the Hebrew language, especially in the Bible, you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th. [...] I didn't go to the library and figure it out". The song's numerology is alluded to on the single's cover, which features figures of five, six and seven, and also a monkey with a halo.|$|E

Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people have already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good.
