Variations in the abundances of all three <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> and their correlations with physico-chemical parameters indicated that although the creek was likely subject to some level of faecal contamination, tidal movement serves to limit faecal indicator and phytoplankton levels in the creek through physico-chemical stress and dilution.

50|$|Vultures {{possess a}} very acidic {{digestive}} system and their gut {{is dominated by}} two species of anaerobic bacteria that help them withstand toxins they ingest when feeding on decaying prey. In a 2014 study of 50 (turkey and black) vultures, researchers analyzed the microbial community or microbiome of the facial skin and the large intestine. The facial bacterial flora and the gut flora overlapped somewhat, but in general, the facial flora was much more diverse than the gut flora, which {{is in contrast to}} other vertebrates, where the gut flora is more diverse. Two anaerobic <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> groups that are pathogenic in other vertebrates stood out: Clostridia and Fusobacteria. They were especially common in the gut with Clostridia DNA sequence counts between 26% and 85% relative to total sequence counts, and Fusobacteria between 0.2% and 54% in black vultures and 2% to 69% of all counts in turkey vultures. Unexpectedly, both anaerobic bacteria were also found on the air exposed facial skin samples, Clostridia at 7% - 40% and Fusobacteria up to 23%. It is assumed that vultures acquire them when they insert their heads into the body cavities of rotten meat. The regularly ingested Clostridia and Fusobacteria outcompete other bacterial groups in the gut and become predominant. Genes that encode tissue-degrading enzymes and toxins that are associated with Clostridium perfringens have been found in the vulture gut metagenome. This supports the hypothesis that vultures do benefit from the bacterial breakdown of carrion, {{while at the same time}} tolerating the bacterial toxins.|$|E

40|$|Sample volumes as {{tested in}} routine {{microbiological}} methods {{for determining the}} presence and absence of <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> in water {{are too small to}} assess the actual concentration in the last stages of a water treatment. Consequently no accurate information can be obtained about the removal efficiency of a water treatment for micro-organisms. Therefore a method for on site isolation of <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> from large volumes (100 litre or more) of treated water using membrane filtration (MF-sampling) was developed and tested. The procedures for culturing the isolated microorganisms were similar to those applied in the routine methods for small volumes using membrane filtration (mf-method). The recovery efficiency of MF-sampling for E. coli, S. faecalis and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia ranged from 74. 6 to 100 % and only for E. coli a slight decrease with increasing sample volume was found. Field studies revealed that MF-sampling can easily be implemented in (routine) laboratory practice for an accurate determination of the concentration of <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> in treated water after various treatment stages. From these data the treatment efficiency of the involved processes and the overall treatment for those micro-organisms and the fluctuation in micro-organism removal were determined.

40|$|Water-borne {{pathogen}} contamination from untreated {{sewage effluent}} and runoff from farms {{is a serious}} threat to the use of river water for drinking and commercial purposes, such as downstream estuarine shellfish industries. In this study, the impact of climate change and land-use change on the presence of <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> in freshwater was evaluated, {{through the use of a}} recently-developed catchment-scale pathogen model. The River Conwy in Wales has been used as a case-study, because of the large presence of livestock in the catchment and the importance of the shellfish harvesting activities in its estuary. The INCA-Pathogens catchment model has been calibrated through the use of a Monte-Carlo-based technique, based on <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> measurements, and then driven by an ensemble of climate projections obtained from the HadRM 3 -PPE model (Future Flow Climate) plus four land-use scenarios (current land use, managed ecosystem, abandonment and agricultural intensification). The results show that climate change is not expected to have a very large impact on average river flow, although it might alter its seasonality. The abundance of <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> is expected to decrease in response to climate change, especially during the summer months, due to reduced precipitation, causing reduced runoff, and increased temperature, which enhances the bacterial die-off processes. Land-use change can also have a potentially large impact on pathogens. The “managed ecosystems” scenario proposed in this study can cause a reduction of 15 % in average water <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> and up to 30 % in the 90 th percentile of water <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria,</b> mainly due to the conversion of pasture land into grassland and the expansion of forest land.

40|$|Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium is an {{important}} enteropathogen that causes human morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is essential to study the interaction between Salmonella and the gut bacteria to elucidate the elements that influence {{the ability of the}} pathogen to overcome the colonisation barrier mediated by the gut microbiota and why Salmonella can persist in ‘healthy’ individuals in a carrier state after infection. In this study the effect of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> on the growth and survival of S. Typhimurium was investigated. Initially, experiments involved co-cultures of the pathogen and single strains of intestinal bacteria obtained from culture collections; results showed that when E. coli reached its maximum concentration density, the growth of S.

Typhimurium was then inoculated with multi-strain gut bacteria from culture collections and also with faecal samples in batch cultures mimicking the conditions of the human colon. A significant reduction of S.

The {{aim of this}} study was to use a combined field and modelling approach to determine the importance of Escherichia coli growth in dung-pats when predicting <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> accumulation on grazed grassland. To do this an empirical model was developed to predict the dynamics of an E. coli reservoir within 1 ha plots each grazed by four beef steers for six months. Published first-order die-off coefficients were used within the model to describe the expected decline of E. coli in dung-pats. Modelled estimates using first-order kinetics led to an underestimation of the observed E. coli land reservoir, when using site specific die-off coefficients. A simultaneous experiment determined the die-off profiles of E. coli within fresh faeces of beef cattle under field-relevant conditions and suggested that <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> may experience growth and re-growth in the period post-defecation when exposed to a complex interaction of environmental drivers such as variable temperature, UV radiation and moisture levels. This growth phase in dung-pats is not accounted for in models based on first-order die-off coefficients.

40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} biosolid and soil type on the {{movement}} of faecal coliforms through the vadose zone was investigated following the application of animal manure to soil. Two types of biosolid, solid and liquid manure, were applied to two soil types at {{a wide range of}} initial water contents. Bacteria present in the soil solution were collected using calibrated ceramic-porous-cup samplers. Estimated bacterial migration velocities in the soil profile were consistent with the hypo-thesis that bacteria move mostly through soil macropores, as the rate of transport was faster than the average pore-water velocity. Macropore transport was more likely to occur in wet soils, but it was not necessarily restricted to soils with high initial soil water content. A larger soil clay content, lower total soil porosity, and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity resulted in a greater likelihood that suspended bacteria would be funnelled through pores of larger diameter and faster pore water velocity, increasing the potential vertical transport length of bacteria through the vadose zone. Total porosity was not a significant factor in enhancing deep transport of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The potential of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> to be transported to depth in soil was correlated with the water content of the manure. We conclude that application of animal manure to soil can readily lead to groundwater contamination with <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> especially under moist soil conditions, and that macropores are important in the transport...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{to study the}} prevalence of circulating antibodies directed against different morphological groups ('morphotypes') of bacteria in fresh faeces is presented. The technique combines quantitative indirect immunofluorescence with digital image analysis. Plasma antibody titres and patterns of IgA, IgG and IgM isotype against morphotypes of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> were determined in ten healthy individuals. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} health risks {{associated}} with the non-compliance of bathing water quality have received increasing worldwide attention. However, it is particularly challenging to establish the source of any non-compliance, due to the complex nature {{of the source of}} faecal indicator organisms, and the fate and delivery processes and scarcity of field measured data in many catchments and estuaries. In the current study an integrated hydro-bacterial model, linking a catchment, 1 -D model and 2 -D model were integrated to simulate the adsorption-desorption processes of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> to and from sediment particles in river, estuarine and coastal waters, respectively. The model was then validated using hydrodynamic, sediment and <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> concentration data, measured in 2012, in the Ribble river and estuary, and along the Fylde coast, UK. Particular emphasis has been placed on the mechanism of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> transport and decay through the deposition and resuspension of suspended sediments. The results showed that by coupling the E. coli concentration with the sediment transport processes, the accuracy of the predicted E. coli levels was improved. A series of scenario runs were then carried out to investigate the impacts of different management scenarios on the E. coli concentration levels in the coastal bathing water sites around Liverpool Bay, UK. The model results show that the level of compliance with the new EU bathing water standards can be improved significantly by extending outfalls and/or reducing urban sources by typically 50 %...|$|E
2500|$|More recently, the {{chemistry}} behind enzymatic detection compounds has been updated {{so that the}} indicating component is redox active, {{as opposed to the}} more usual chromogenic format, allowing <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> such as E. coli and E. faecalis to be detected electrochemically without any sample pre-treatment. Since the colour of the detection compound is of no consequence, this allows detection in deeply coloured matrices.|$|R
30|$|This {{study shows}} that the Thoothukudi Corporation of Tamil Nadu has been {{affected}} by trace elements and microbiological contamination in groundwater. The study reveals that Arsenic, Selenium, Lead, Bismuth, Aluminium, Iron and Vanadium are, in general, concentrated above the permissible limit (WHO 2004) in groundwater of the area of investigation. The increasing concentration of these elements in the groundwater {{of the study area}} is mainly originating from industrial effluents of copper industries, alkali chemical industry, fertiliser industry, thermal power plant, sea food industries, shipping activities and also from municipal waste water. Faecal pollution was found that fishing old harbour, mappillaiurani beach and thirespuram are highly affected from total coliform <b>bacteria,</b> <b>faecal</b> coliform <b>bacteria</b> and E. coli. This might be due to the mixing of sewage from Thoothukudi town through the Buckle channel and fishing activity.|$|R
