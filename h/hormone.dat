5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary <b>hormone</b> together with a low <b>hormone</b> from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary <b>hormone</b> may be normal but the effector gland <b>hormone</b> decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector <b>hormone</b> changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of <b>hormone</b> replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth <b>hormone</b> deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid <b>hormone</b> replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic <b>hormone.</b> This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Chief cells, which {{synthesize}} {{and release}} parathyroid <b>hormone.</b> These cells are small, and appear dark when loaded with parathyroid <b>hormone,</b> and clear when the <b>hormone</b> has been secreted, {{or in their}} resting state.|$|E
5000|$|Releasing <b>hormones</b> and {{inhibiting}} <b>hormones</b> are <b>hormones</b> {{whose main}} {{purpose is to}} control the release of other <b>hormones,</b> either by stimulating or inhibiting their release. They are also called liberins (...) and statins (...) (respectively), or releasing factors and inhibiting factors. The principal examples are hypothalamic-pituitary <b>hormones</b> that can be classified from several viewpoints: they are hypothalamic <b>hormones</b> (originating in the hypothalamus), they are hypophysiotropic <b>hormones</b> (affecting the hypophysis, that is, the pituitary gland), and they are tropic <b>hormones</b> (having other endocrine glands as their target).|$|R
50|$|<b>Hormones</b> {{secreted}} by {{the anterior}} pituitary are trophic <b>hormones</b> (Greek: trophe, “nourishment”) and tropic <b>hormones.</b> Trophic <b>hormones</b> directly affect growth either as hyperplasia or hypertrophy on the tissue it is stimulating. Tropic <b>hormones</b> are named {{for their ability}} to act directly on target tissues or other endocrine glands to release <b>hormones,</b> causing numerous cascading physiological responses.|$|R
50|$|Upon secretion, certain <b>hormones,</b> {{including}} protein <b>hormones</b> and catecholamines, are water-soluble and {{are thus}} readily transported through the circulatory system. Other <b>hormones,</b> including steroid and thyroid <b>hormones,</b> are lipid-soluble; to allow for their widespread distribution, these <b>hormones</b> must bond to carrier plasma glycoproteins (e.g., thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)) to form ligand-protein complexes. Some <b>hormones</b> are completely active when released into the bloodstream (as {{is the case for}} insulin and growth <b>hormones),</b> while others are prohormones that must be activated in specific cells through a series of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated. The endocrine system secretes <b>hormones</b> directly into the bloodstream typically into fenestrated capillaries, whereas the exocrine system secretes its <b>hormones</b> indirectly using ducts. <b>Hormones</b> with paracrine function diffuse through the interstitial spaces to nearby target tissue.|$|R
5|$|Hormonal {{output from}} the thyroid is {{regulated}} by thyroid-stimulating <b>hormone</b> (TSH) secreted from the anterior pituitary gland, which itself is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> (TRH) {{produced by the}} hypothalamus.|$|E
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic <b>hormone</b> (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating <b>hormone</b> (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid <b>hormone</b> by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive <b>hormone</b> glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing <b>hormone,</b> corticotropin-releasing <b>hormone,</b> gonadotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> and growth hormone-releasing <b>hormone),</b> apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing <b>hormone</b> rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector <b>hormone</b> glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in <b>hormone</b> release.|$|E

5000|$|Peptide <b>hormones</b> {{and protein}} <b>hormones</b> are <b>hormones</b> whose {{molecules}} are peptides or proteins, respectively. The latter have longer amino acid chain lengths than the former. These <b>hormones</b> {{have an effect}} on the endocrine system of animals, including humans. Most <b>hormones</b> can be classified as either amino acid-based <b>hormones</b> (amine, peptide, or protein) or steroid <b>hormones.</b> The former are water-soluble and act on the surface of target cells via second messengers; the latter, being lipid-soluble, move through the plasma membranes of target cells (both cytoplasmic and nuclear) to act within their nuclei ...|$|R

5|$|Parathyroid <b>hormone</b> (PTH, {{known as}} parathormone) {{is a small}} protein that takes part in the control of calcium and {{phosphate}} homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid <b>hormone</b> has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin.|$|E
5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid <b>hormone</b> is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid <b>hormone.</b> This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid <b>hormone.</b> This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>hormone</b> {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth <b>hormone</b> deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying <b>hormone</b> deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E
50|$|They are {{different}} from <b>hormones,</b> which are also important cell signaling molecules, in that <b>hormones</b> circulate in less variable concentrations and <b>hormones</b> tend {{to be made by}} specific kinds of cells.|$|R
40|$|There are few {{instances}} in which a clear effect of <b>hormones</b> on cancer risk is known and in which the effects of those <b>hormones</b> on the cells concerned are also known. The best examples are the relationships between sex <b>hormones</b> and cancer in women. The effects of sex <b>hormones</b> both on the risk for endometrial cancer and on {{the cells of the}} endometrium are well understood, and the evidence strongly suggests that <b>hormones</b> act by altering the rate of cell division. The same mechanism may explain the relationships between sex <b>hormones</b> and the risk for breast cancer, but our understanding of cancers at this site is incomplete. Less still is known about the mechanisms of the effects of sex <b>hormones</b> on other hormone-related cancers, such as those of the ovary and cervix.

50|$|Plant <b>hormones</b> are {{signalling}} molecules produced {{within the}} plant (i.e. they are endogenous). <b>Hormones</b> regulate cellular processes in targeted cells locally {{and can be}} moved {{to other parts of}} the plant. Examples of plant <b>hormones</b> are auxins, cytokins,gibberellin, ethylene, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and jasmonates. <b>Hormones</b> naturally occur in extremely low, finely balanced, concentrations.|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of <b>hormone</b> deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary <b>hormone</b> deficiencies and require long-term <b>hormone</b> supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which <b>hormone</b> is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating <b>hormone</b> (FSH) and/or luteinizing <b>hormone</b> (LH) leading to sex <b>hormone</b> abnormalities. Growth <b>hormone</b> deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} thyroid <b>hormone</b> levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough thyroid <b>hormone</b> production.|$|E
50|$|Intracellular receptors are receptors located {{inside the}} cell {{rather than on}} its cell membrane. Classic <b>hormones</b> that use {{intracellular}} receptors include thyroid and steroid <b>hormones.</b> Examples are the class of nuclear receptors located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm and the IP3 receptor located on the endoplasmic reticulum. The ligands that bind to them are usually intracellular second messengers like inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and extracellular lipophilic <b>hormones</b> like steroid <b>hormones.</b> Some intracrine peptide <b>hormones</b> also have intracellular receptors.|$|R
40|$|Women’s <b>hormones,</b> also {{referred}} to as ovarian <b>hormones,</b> sex <b>hormones,</b> gonadal <b>hormones,</b> are steroid <b>hormones.</b> Steroids are lipids, thereby readily cross the cell membrane, and the nuclear membrane to interact with the blueprints of human body, the genes encoded in chromosomes. Women’s <b>hormones</b> have wide and complex effects on gene expressions. 1, 2 Moreover, modulation of expression of one gene will sequentially affect the expression of other genes. Therefore, changes or fluctuations in women’s <b>hormones</b> will have implications well beyond reproductive functions and can affect all body systems. It is imaginable that the hormonal changes occurring around menopause will cause changes in a woman that will be as complex as the period of sexual maturation.

40|$|Plant {{growth and}} {{development}} is influenced by mutual interactions among plant <b>hormones.</b> The five classical plant <b>hormones</b> are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene. They are small diffusible molecules that easily penetrate between cells. In addition, newer classes of plant <b>hormones</b> have been identified such as brassinosteroids, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and various small proteins or peptides. These <b>hormones</b> also play important roles in the regulation of plant {{growth and development}}. This review begins with a brief summary of the current findings on plant <b>hormones.</b> Based on this knowledge, a conceptual model about interactions among plant <b>hormones</b> is built so as to link and {{develop an understanding of}} the diverse functions of different plant <b>hormones</b> as a whole in plants...|$|R
5|$|Thyroid <b>hormone</b> is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid <b>hormone</b> receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the <b>hormone</b> binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid <b>hormone</b> (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid <b>hormone</b> is biologically active.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of {{hypopituitarism}} is threefold: {{removing the}} underlying cause, treating the <b>hormone</b> deficiencies, and addressing any other repercussions {{that arise from}} the <b>hormone</b> deficiencies.|$|E

50|$|Transgender women, {{known as}} kathoeys, {{have access to}} <b>hormones</b> through non-prescription sources. This kind of access {{is a result of}} the low {{availability}} and expense of transgender health care clinics. However, transgender men, known as toms, have difficulty gaining access to <b>hormones</b> such as testosterone in Thailand because it is not as readily available as <b>hormones</b> for kathoeys. As a result, just a third of all toms surveyed are taking <b>hormones</b> to transition whereas almost three quarters of kathoeys surveyed are taking <b>hormones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{motivation is}} influenced by <b>hormones</b> such as testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin. In most mammalian species, sex <b>hormones</b> control the ability to engage in sexual behaviours. However, sex <b>hormones</b> do not directly regulate the ability to copulate in primates (including humans). Rather, sex <b>hormones</b> in primates are only one influence on the motivation to engage in sexual behaviours.|$|R
5|$|Deficiency of luteinizing <b>hormone</b> (LH) and follicle-stimulating <b>hormone</b> (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to}} as the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E

5|$|Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based {{thyroid gland}} extract, most {{commonly}} from pigs. It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a <b>hormone</b> produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic <b>hormone</b> medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.|$|E
2500|$|Plant <b>hormones</b> are signal {{molecules}} produced {{within the}} plant, and occur in extremely low concentrations. <b>Hormones</b> regulate cellular processes in targeted cells locally and, moved to other locations, in other functional {{parts of the}} plant. <b>Hormones</b> also determine the formation of flowers, stems, leaves, the shedding of leaves, and the development and ripening of fruit. [...] Plants, unlike animals, lack glands that produce and secrete <b>hormones.</b> Instead, each cell is capable of producing <b>hormones.</b> Plant <b>hormones</b> shape the plant, affecting seed growth, time of flowering, the sex of flowers, senescence of leaves, and fruits. They affect which tissues grow upward and which grow downward, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, plant longevity, and even plant death. <b>Hormones</b> are vital to plant growth, and, lacking them, plants would be mostly a mass of undifferentiated cells. So they are also known as growth factors or growth <b>hormones.</b> The term 'Phytohormone' was coined by Thimann in 1948.|$|R
50|$|Four {{of the six}} {{anterior}} pituitary <b>hormones</b> are tropic <b>hormones</b> {{that regulate}} the function of other endocrine organs.
