40|$|The present work {{reviewed}} the connections {{of changes in}} consumption of high-fat food with changes in adiposity and lipaemia in adults with overweight or obesity. <b>Hyperlipaemia</b> from higher fat meals and excessive adiposity contributes to atherogenic process. Low-fat diet interventions decrease body fat, lipaemia, and atherosclerosis markers. Inaccuracy of physical estimates of dietary fat intake remains, however, a limit to establishing causal connections. To fill this gap, tracking fat-rich eating episodes at short intervals quantifies the behavioural frequency suggested to measure (by regression of changes in real time) direct effects of this eating pattern on adiposity and atherogenic lipaemia.

AIMS [...] To therefore analyse the influence of <b>hyperlipaemia</b> on the course of acute oedematous and acute necrotising pancreatitis in rats. SUBJECTS [...] Male Wistar rats were used in all experiments. METHODS [...] Six different groups of animals were used: two groups without pancreatitis (controls), two with acute oedematous pancreatitis, and two with acute necrotising pancreatitis. One group from each pair was treated with Triton WR 1339, which induces endogenous <b>hyperlipaemia.</b> Blood samples were taken from all subjects to measure triglyceride, cholesterol, amylase, and lipase. Pancreatic tissue samples were taken and the degree of pancreatic damage was judged microscopically. RESULTS [...] In the control groups no significant changes occurred, either in serum enzyme activities or in histology. The hyperlipaemic subgroup of animals with acute oedematous pancreatitis developed significantly higher (p < 0. 001) serum amylase activities and a greater degree of histological damage (p < 0. 01) than the animals of the non-hyperlipaemic acute oedematous pancreatitis group. In the animals with necrotising pancreatitis, serum lipase activity and the histological degree of pancreatic damage were significantly higher in the hyperlipaemic animals than in the non-hyperlipaemic animals.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of diabetes is increasing. But {{the impact of}} diabetes and prediabetes on survival of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has received little evaluation. Methods: In a cohort of 5, 860 patients, we compared the disease specific survival (DSS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients with diabetes, prediabetes and normoglycemia defined by pretreatment fasting plasma glucose (FPG) using Kaplan–Meier method, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Comparing to normoglycemic patients, the diabetic and the prediabetic were generally older, fatter, had hypertension, heart diseases and <b>hyperlipaemia</b> and usually received radiotherapy alone. But both the diabetic and the prediabetic had similar DSS, LRFS and DMFS to normoglycemic patients, even adjusting for such important factors as age, gender, smoking, drinking, hypertension, heart diseases, body mass index, <b>hyperlipaemia,</b> titer of VCA-IgA and EA-IgA, pathology, T-stage, N-stage, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (P. 0. 05 for all).

40|$|The {{study of}} this thesis {{concerns}} the dietary influence on lipid metabolism in horses. The main issue {{is the effect of}} dietary medium chain triacylglycerols (MCT) on triacylglycerol metabolism. In certain conditions high-fat diets can be beneficial for horses. Diets rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of soybean oil decrease plasma triacylglycerol concentrations and increase the activity of heparin-released lipoprotein lipase activity in horses. The metabolic adaptation to fat supplementation in the horse appears to proceed {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in response to training. The feeding of MCT versus soybean oil raised the plasma level of triacylglycerols in horses. There was no significant effect of carbohydrate source and no fat-carbohydrate interaction. However, when diets contained soybean oil, cellulose versus glucose produced significantly greater increase in plasma triacylglycerols. A major product of cellulose fermentation is acetic acid. In the liver acetic acid can be converted into Acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and be use for in de novo fatty acid synthesis. But when horses are fed isoenergetic amounts of MCT or cellulose, cellulose did not increase the triacylglycerol concentrations in plasma. Feeding of MCT instead of soybean oil would increase the production of plasma triacylglycerols together with an increase in the clearance rate of triacylglycerols. The rate of triacylglycerol clearance was on average about two-fold higher than the calculated rate of triacylglycerol production. The LPL activity was lower when the ponies were fed MCT. It was concluded that MCT versus soybean oil causes an increase in the triacylglycerol production, leading to an elevation of plasma triacylglycerol concentration and eliciting an increase in plasma triacylglycerol clearance as a secondary feature. When horses were fed high-fat rations with either soybean oil or palm oil, there was no difference in plasma triacylglycerol levels between the two diets. Thus, dietary soybean oil probably did not affect the hepatic secretion of very-low-density-lipoproteins with triacylglycerols. Apparently, plasma triacylglycerol concentrations in horses are not sensitive to the degree of saturation of dietary fatty acids. In a cross-over study with 6 adult horses, the effect of isoenergetic replacement of dietary glucose by beetpulp on the concentration of plasma triacylglycerol was studied. The test ration contained 25 % beetpulp, with 5 % pectine in the dietary dry matter. The feeding of beetpulp lowered the plasma concentration of triacylglycerol in fasting state and raised the activity of heparin-released LPL. It is suggested that beetpulp ingestion activates lipoprotein lipase followed by a drop in plasma triacylglycerols. <b>Hyperlipaemia</b> is a condition in ponies associated with a dysfunction in lipidmetabolism. A fat-free liquid diet was formulated for the treatment of <b>hyperlipaemia.</b> As sole source of nutrition the liquid diet fully counteracted fasting-induced <b>hyperlipaemia</b> in two healthy ponies. The liquid diet has potential in the treatment of <b>hyperlipaemia</b> -it provides energy and nutrients to counteract the negative energy balance and low nutritional status of patients. This thesis shows that MCT-rich rations increase the plasma level of triacylglycerols in horses by increasing de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver. The effect on triacylglycerol metabolism is different than when diets rich in soybean oil are fed to horses and indicates that MCT is not suitable for performance horses. Another result from this thesis is that the intake of beetpulp has similar effects on lipid metabolism than soybean oil...|$|E

One of the mechanisms could involve the control of postprandial <b>hyperlipaemia,</b> a well-defined risk factor for atherosclerosis, reasonably by reducing the absorption of lipid oxidised species from the meal. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether wine consumption with the meal is able to reduce the postprandial increase in plasma lipid hydroperoxides and cholesterol oxidation products, in human subjects. In two different study sessions, twelve healthy volunteers consumed the same test meal rich in oxidised and oxidisable lipids (a double cheeseburger), with 300 ml of water (control) or with 300 ml of red wine (wine).

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Acute laminitis is characterised by hoof lamellar dermal-epidermal separation at the basement membrane (BM) zone. Hoof lamellar explants cultured in vitro {{can also be}} made to separate at the basement membrane zone and investigating how this occurs may give insight into the poorly understood pathophysiology of laminitis. Objectives: To investigate why glucose deprivation and metalloproteinase (MMP) activation in cultured lamellar explants leads to dermo-epidermal separation. Methods: Explants, cultured without glucose or with the MMP activator p-amino-phenol-mercuric acetate (APMA), were subjected to tension and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Without glucose, or with APMA, explants under tension separated at the dermo-epidermal junction. This in vitro separation occurred via 2 different ultrastructural processes. Lack of glucose reduced hemidesmosomes (HDs) numbers until they disappeared and the basal cell cytoskeleton collapsed. Anchoring filaments (AFs), connecting the basal cell plasmalemma to the BM, were unaffected although they failed under tension. APMA activation of constituent lamellar MMPs did not affect HDs but caused AFs to disappear, also leading to dermo-epidermal separation under tension. Conclusions: Natural laminitis may occur in situations where glucose uptake by lamellar basal cells is compromised (e. g. equine Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s disease, obesity, <b>hyperlipaemia,</b> ischaemia and septicaemia) or when lamellar MMPs are activated (alimentary carbohydrate overload).

The aim of {{our study}} was to define the {{frequency}} of seizures in a population of outpatients attending a cognitive function clinic in Italy and to identify risk factors for seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods. In this retrospective study, we analyzed our clinical records to gather information on patients' demographic, metabolic, cardiovascular and cognitive features. We sought to determine the significance of abnormal neuroimaging findings {{and the use of}} potentially epileptogenic drugs on the onset of seizures. From the records of 583 patients referred to the clinic for cognitive disturbances, we identified 145 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Results. Of these 145 patients, 14 (9. 7 %) had a history of complex partial or generalised seizures, or both. Of the risk factors identified, onset of seizures was associated with male gender and none of the patients with seizures had diabetes. The risk of seizure onset was higher in Alzheimer's disease patients with <b>hyperlipaemia</b> and severe dementia.

Several incorporation rates of different fibre sources (cellulose, guar gum, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), pectins, beet fibre, beet pulp and chicory pulp) were studied. Furthermore, a blend of cellulose and guar gum was formulated to imitate the ratio of soluble-to-insoluble fibre of beet fibre to study {{the influence of the}} fibre solubility. Drinking water consumption was increased by beet fibre and inulin in the diet. With the exception of cellulose for dry matter (DM) concentration, the different fibres induced similar effects on faeces: increased daily excretion, decreased DM concentration and increased excretion of DM. Nutrient digestibility coefficients were diversely affected by fibre consumption and, excepted for the ether extract, decreased in nutrients digestibility were in relation with added total or insoluble fibre in the diet. Important metabolic effects were observed but were not in relation with the solubility of the fibre.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of both oxidative stress and <b>hyperlipaemia</b> in atherosclerosis development is well established. Oxidative burst is an innate immune response to infection, {{the latter being}} associated also with marked changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, aimed to neutralize endotoxin toxic effects. On the other hand, lipid overload may increase lipopolysaccharide circulating levels and oxidative stress. Whilst these changes may be beneficial {{from the perspective of}} host defense, if they become chronic, they likely increase the risk of atherosclerosis. In particular, oxidation of lipoproteins, resulting from an imbalance of the pro- and antioxidant equilibrium, is involved in the pathologic process of atherosclerosis, changing cellular functions. Lipid oxidation, induced by leukocytes derived reactive oxygen species, can amplify foam cell formation through oxidized low density lipoproteins LDL (oxLDL) formation and uptake. The main enzymes, operating during oxidative burst, involved in LDL oxidation are NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase. In vitro studies have shown that oxLDL are able to induce many proatherogenic processes, including modulation of oxidative burst. OxLDL may also induce maturation of dendritic cells and regulate the shift from classical (M 1) to alternative (M 2) macrophage activation and from T helper 1 to T helper 2 response, suggesting that these could act as a bridge between innate and adaptative immunity, both involved in plaque development. Understanding the relationship between oxLDL and leukocyte oxidative burst helps to explain the {{involvement of}} innate immune responses in the early phases of atherosclerosis.

Methods: Animals were randomized into eight groups (four adults and four pups) : control groups, water and basic diet; alcohol groups, 20 % ethanol and basic diet; alcohol folic acid groups, 20 % ethanol and diet supplemented with folic acid; control folic acid groups, water and folic acid-supplemented diet. We determined serum and liver total cholesterol (Chol), HDL, triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL) and bile acids (BA) levels {{in all of the}} groups. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was also measured in the livers. Results: Ethanol-fed rats have higher serum HDL and PL levels in pups and higher serum LDL, TG and PL levels in adults than controls and supplemented animals with or without alcohol ingestion. Ethanol provokes an increase in hepatic Chol and BA, and a decrease in hepatic TG and PL in pups; in adults it also provokes an increase in hepatic Chol and BA and a significant increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity. Alcohol intake plus folic acid supplementation has no effects on these values except BA levels that were significantly higher, in both pups and adult rats, than in the control group. Conclusion: Despite the fact that alcohol intake provokes different lipid alterations in adults and in pups whose mothers drank ethanol, folic acid contributes to the alleviation of these adverse effects reducing HMG-CoA reductase activity in adult rats and, except BA levels, to normalizing lipid...|$|E

Triacylglycerols (TAG), total cholesterol (Chol), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1) and soluble vascular adhesion molecule- 1 (sVCAM- 1) were determined in fasting serum samples and TAG and total Chol postprandial levels were measured. Results: Anthropometric data, serum lipid and sICAM- 1 presented significant higher values in PoW compared to PrW, but sVCAM- 1 did not significantly differ between groups. Postprandial TAG and Chol concentrations in PoW {{were significantly higher than}} in PrW (p < 0. 0001). There was a significant time influence (p < 0. 0001) in TAG in PrW and PoW, while time to peak and peak concentration were significantly higher in PoW than PrW. Chol concentrations showed a significant reduction after 1 h, to reach values similar to baseline after 6 h in PrW but not in PoW. Conclusions: Lipid postprandial response to a fat rich meal and soluble intercellular adhesion molecules concentrations indicate a higher cardiovascular risk pattern in postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women. Soluble vascular adhesion molecule levels seem to be influenced not only by age and menopause, but also other factors like usual diet. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A single high-fat {{challenge}} induces plasmatic pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative {{responses in}} the postprandial state, even in healthy men. This period is also associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, which is an early event {{in the development of}} cardiovascular diseases. However, knowledge about the mechanisms involved in postprandial hyperlipaemia-induced endothelial dysfunction is sparse. An objective of our study was to characterize the behaviour and gene expression of vascular endothelial cells exposed to postprandial hyperlipaemic sera. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in media containing 10 % serum from healthy men withdrawn either before or 4  h after a high-fat challenge. Endothelial cell proliferation, adhesion and migration were then assessed. The transcriptomic profiles of endothelial cells exposed to pre and postprandial sera were also compared. Exposure to postprandial hyperlipaemic sera significantly decreased HUVEC proliferation when compared to preprandial serum (P <  0. 0001), while no changes in migration or endothelial/monocyte interactions were observed. The transcriptomic analysis revealed changes in the expression of 675 genes, of which 431 have a known function. Among them, a set of differentially expressed genes was linked to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis and are regulated in favour of cell cycle arrest or death. This result was confirmed by measuring the induction of apoptosis after postprandial sera exposure (P =  0. 011). Taken together, the transcriptomic results and pathway analysis showed that postprandial serum promotes apoptosis in HUVECs, potentially through the activation of the p 53 network. We conclude that upon postprandial serum exposure, vascular endothelial cells transcriptionally regulate genes involved in the control of cell cycle and death to favour growth arrest and apoptosis. These findings support the hypothesis that postprandial <b>hyperlipaemia</b> is associated with vascular dysfunction and offer new insights into the mechanisms involved...|$|E
