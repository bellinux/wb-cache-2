40|$|We {{investigated}} the protective effect of fosfomycin (FOM) on cisplatin (CDDP) nephrotoxicity and the pharmacokinetics of CDDP. Thirteen patients with lung cancer underwent combined chemotherapy including CDDP (80 mg/m 2). FOM was administered (4 - 6 g/day) for 5 days by i. v. infusion <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1 st and 3 rd <b>courses,</b> but not <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2 nd <b>course.</b> Urinary 24 -hour excretion of NAG <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2 nd <b>course</b> remarkably increased and reached a peak at 2 - 4 days after treatment. The urinary NAG level <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2 nd <b>course</b> {{was significantly higher}} than <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1 st and 3 rd courses at 3 days after treatment. Area under the curve (AUC) of plasma total platinum (Pt) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2 nd <b>course</b> were significantly higher than <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1 st <b>course,</b> and that <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 3 rd <b>course</b> tended to be higher than that <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1 st <b>course.</b> <b>The</b> maximum level of plasma total Pt <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2 nd <b>course</b> tended to be higher than that <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1 st <b>course.</b> There was no difference in the AUC or the maximum level of plasma free Pt among <b>the</b> three <b>courses.</b> <b>The</b> maximum level of plasma Pt bound to proteins <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2 nd <b>course</b> was higher than that <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1 st <b>course.</b> There was a significant correlation between the AUC of plasma total Pt or plasma Pt level bound to proteins and the peak urinary NAG level. In conclusion, FOM protected against CDDP nephrotoxicity. It is suspected that FOM may affect the pharmacokinetics of plasma total Pt and plasma Pt bound to proteins without changing the antitumor activity of CDDP. Cisplatin(CDDP) の腎障害に対するfosfomycin(FOM) の軽減効果とその時のCDDPの血中動態について検討した. 対象はCDDP 80 mg/m^ 2 を投与された肺癌患者 13 例で, 1 ・ 3 コース目にFOMを 1 日 4 - 6 g, 5 日間静脈内投与した. 2 コース目はNAGの 24 時間尿中排泄量がCDDP投与 2 日目から 4 日目をピークとして上昇を示し, 3 日目で 1 ・ 3 コースコース目と比べて有意に増加した. 総platinum(Pt) 濃度のarea under the curve(AUC) については 2 コース目は 1 コース目より有意に高く, 3 コース目は 1 コース目より高い傾向にあり,最高血中濃度は 2 コース目は 1 コース目より高い傾向にあった. 非蛋白結合型Ptの血中濃度はいずれのコースでも明らかな差異は認めなかった. 蛋白結合型Ptの最高血中濃度については 2 コース目は 1 コース目より有意に高かった. また,総Ptおよび蛋白結合型PtのAUCは尿中NAGのピークと有意な相関関係を認めた. 以上よりFOMはCDDPの腎障害の軽減作用を示した. 薬物動態学的検討からはFOMが総Ptおよび蛋白結合型Ptに何らかの影響をもたらすことが示唆されたが,非蛋白結合型Ptに影響はなく抗腫瘍効果に影響を与えないものと考えられた...|$|R

40|$|The latex {{dilution}} reaction <b>during</b> <b>the</b> tapping flow <b>course</b> {{has been}} well documented and associated with the facilitation of tapping latex flow. However, its underlying mechanism has not experimentally examined. The latex total solid content, osmotic potential and phloem turgor pressure change <b>during</b> <b>the</b> tapping flow <b>course</b> were simultaneously measured to investigate the cause of water movement <b>during</b> <b>the</b> tapping flow <b>course.</b> It was found that there are three different stages for the laticifer water equilibrium <b>during</b> <b>the</b> tapping flow <b>course.</b> <b>The</b> tapping-induced rapid turgor pressure drop is the cause of the first stage water influx into laticifers, while osmoregulation prevails during water exchange {{in the second and third}} stages of tapping flow. Meanwhile, aquaporin expressions were, for the first time, investigated <b>during</b> <b>the</b> tapping flow <b>course.</b> <b>The</b> rapid transcript up-regulation of HbPIP 1, HbPIP 2; 1 and HbPIP 2; 3 contributes to the latex dilution reaction. However, their activity gating cannot be ruled out. Ethrel stimulation can significantly dilute the corresponding latex fractions <b>during</b> <b>the</b> tapping flow <b>course</b> due to its up-regulations of HbPIP 1, HbPIP 2; 1 and HbPIP 2; 3. Nevertheless, the latex dilution reaction pattern for the Ethrel treated trees did not change, except for a lower degree of dilution compared with the un-treated trees. All these results suggest that both phloem turgor pressure and aquaporins are involved in the latex dilution reaction <b>during</b> <b>the</b> tapping flow <b>course...</b>|$|R
