40|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>significance</b> {{determination}} lies at {{the heart}} of environmental impact assessment (EIA) but conflict and misunderstanding around the concept is common. This paper attempts to make sense of <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> in EIA based on four essential components of significance synthesised from the literature to ensure that: (1) a clear operational framework for significance determination applies throughout EIA, (2) attention focuses only on significant issues, (3) the term significance is specified and applied consistently, and (4) significance determinations are transparent to all EIA stakeholders. To provide a practical perspective, the extent to which EIA institutional provisions in Western Australia uphold these significance determination components is reviewed. Overall the Western Australian approach generally meets all four components, but areas for improvement include better guidance encouraging proponents to adopt a more consultative approach to determining relevant environmental factors and objectives to better focus EIA, and distinguishing between terms used for significance within EIA documentation. A new significance framework approach in Western Australia represents a clear attempt to uplift practice, but opportunity exists to improve the way <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> determinations are presented to stakeholders. EIA practitioners may benefit from mapping and making sense of <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> in their own jurisdiction using the four components presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Health {{and safety}} in the {{construction}} industry continue to fall behind many industries despite much effort to improve the status. A considerable amount of research has been conducted to try and contribute to addressing the problem of health and safety (H&S) {{in the construction industry}}. A number of studies have looked at the role of various construction project stakeholders and their contribution to H&S. However there is no clear identification {{of the extent to which}} various stakeholders could contribute and therefore influence the outcome of H&S on construction projects. In view of the above, the current Delphi study went a little bit further and sought to establish the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> of construction clients and designers on H&S. This paper will present findings from the study which is the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> of clients and designers on H&S consideration throughout the project life cycle...|$|E

40|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>significance</b> {{assessment}} {{is a combination}} of objective and subjective assessment, and can be characterized as a multi-criteria problem. In this article we propose a systematic and transparent approach where the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> {{assessment is}} realized together with experts and stakeholders. First, a preliminary significance evaluation framework is developed by the experts. Evaluation framework consists of criteria, indicators and scales. The framework is then refined based on the discussions with stakeholders and citizens. Thereafter, experts and stakeholders evaluate the significance of the impacts independently based on the criteria and scales defined earlier. In this phase Multi-Criteria Decision analysis can also be applied to support the evaluation task. MCDA can be used to calculate overall values with respect to severity/strength of the impacts and the value of the system. Finally, the results of the experts and stakeholders are compared and particularly the reasons for disagreements over the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> are identified and discussed. Finally a table and a x-y graph which summarize the significance assessment from experts and stakeholders perspectives are compiled. In this phase both parties can revise their earlier assessments. Experts’ and stakeholders’ opinions about the significance may differ because of differences in their knowledge, values as well as spatial and temporal assessment frames. One of the advantages of the proposed approach is that it enhances interaction and learning among experts and stakeholders during the process. The approach will be tested in a real-life EIA case...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{economic}} incentives to improve {{health and safety}} (H&S) performance {{in the construction industry}} in general has been investigated by various scholars. However, few studies have looked at the impact {{of economic}} incentives on construction clients, especially in the developing world. This paper reports findings on the feasibility of incentives to influence construction clients to perform on H&S. The investigation was conducted using a Delphi technique to determine the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> of economic incentives or disincentives on construction clients’ H&S performance. A panel of experts in construction H&S was assembled from most regions of the world. A three- round iterative Delphi study aimed at establishing consensus from the expert panel was then conducted. The study found that economic factors have critical <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> on clients’ H&S performance, and that clients were ‘very likely’ to implement various H&S elements {{as a result of the}} economic incentives and or disincentives. There is little research on the use of incentives to influence construction clients’ H&S performance and the effectiveness of such incentives. This gap in literature, and the need for improvement in construction H&S performance, motivated the current study. Therefore it was necessary to investigate specifically the extent to which economic incentives could be used to influence construction clients to become involved in H&S programmes. Economic incentives are considered to be a proactive way of improving H&S performance among other key parties, such as employees in the construction industry. The paper reports on the findings from an analysis of the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> of economic incentives on clients. It underscores the point that economic incentives or disincentives for construction clients are necessary to encourage them to actively participate in H&S programmes, hence resulting in performance improvement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Usually {{workflow}} {{activities in}} the scientific domain depend on a collection of parameters. These parameters deter-mine {{the output of the}} activity, and consequently the output of the whole workflow. In the scientific domain, workflows have exploratory nature and are used to understand a scientific phenomenon or answer scientific questions. In the process of a scientific experiment a workflow is executed multiple times using various values of the parameters of activities. It is relevant to identify (1) which parameter strongly affects the overall result of the workflow and (2) for which combination of parameter values we obtain the expected result. Foreseeing these issues, in this paper we present our methodology to estimate the significance of all scientific workflow parameters as well as to estimate the most significant parameter to the workflow. The estimation of parameter significance will enable the scientist to fine tune, and optimize his results efficiently. Furthermore, we empirically validate our methodology on Non-Invasive Glucose Measurement workflow and discuss our results. The NIGM workflow uses the neural network model to calculate the glucose level in patient blood. The neural network model has a set of parameters, which affect the result of the workflow significantly. But, unfortunately the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> of these parameters is commonly unknown to the user.

40|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>significance</b> {{determination}} is one key task {{required of}} all EIA undertakings. A {{major issue in}} EIA analysis is the subjectivity resulting in, inconsistencies in experts’ and stakeholders’ judgment. However, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) {{can serve as a}} check for inconsistencies and tool for aggregation of the different experts’ and stakeholders’ opinions on impact assessment. This study investigated the integration of AHP into EIA <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> determination to assess the effect of consistency and inconsistency in stakeholder judgments. A case study to investigate an application of the proposed method in a major oil pipeline’s replacement project is presented. It was observed that the opinions of both experts and stakeholders were uniform on some impacts such as land use, water contamination and an increase in the cost of health services, representing 18. 75 % of all the identified impacts. Conversely, there were differences in opinions on other impacts revealing what could be a cause of serious disagreement between the company and the community. It was also observed that, although consistency in judgment is critical, it is not always very easy to obtain when dealing with many stakeholders. This integration demonstrated the ability of AHP to serve as an excellent decision aid for managers during environmental impact assessment. This could also help authorities prioritise risk management plan and allocate resources optimally when dealing with identified impacts of a project...|$|E

Instead of identifying targets, this paper proposed an innovative approach, namely <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> analysis, {{to study the}} correlation between mature sequence, expression across patient samples or time and global function on cell cycle signaling of miRNAs. With three distinct types of data: The Cancer Genome Atlas miRNA expression data for 354 human breast cancer specimens, microarray of 266 miRNAs in mouse Embryonic Stem cells (ESCs), and Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) transfected by 776 miRNAs in MDA-MB- 231 cell line, we linked the expression and function of miRNAs by their mature sequence and discovered systematically that the similarity of miRNA expression enhances the similarity of miRNA function, which indicates the miRNA expression {{can be used as}} a supplementary factor to predict miRNA function. The results also show that both seed region and 3 ' portion are associated with miRNA expression levels across human breast cancer specimens and in ESCs; miRNAs with similar seed tend to have similar 3 ' portion. And we discussed that the impact of 3 ' portion, including nucleotides 13 - 16, is not significant for miRNA function. These results provide novel insights to understand the correlation between miRNA sequence, expression and function. They can be applied to improve the prediction algorithm and the <b>impact</b> <b>significance</b> analysis can also be implemented to similar analysis for other small RNAs such as siRNAs...|$|E
