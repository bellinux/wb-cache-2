40|$|This Thesis {{is devoted}} to the study of {{hydrodynamic}} transport in two-dimensional (2 D) electron liquids embedded in a solid state matrix. Chapter 1 presents a brief description of two laboratory systems in which a 2 D <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> can be realized: the first is a semiconductor (e. g. GaAs/AlGaAs) quantum well, which hosts an ordinary parabolic-band <b>electron</b> <b>liquid.</b> The other is graphene, which is an ideal 2 D system being only one-atom thick. The elementary excitations in a graphene sheet have a dispersion relation that resembles that of ultra-relativistic (i. e. massless) Dirac particles. In this Chapter we also introduce the basic concepts of the quantum theory of many-electron systems: linear response theory and the Landau theory of normal Fermi liquids. A key quantity in the hydrodynamic description of the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> is the electron-electron scattering time τee. This is evaluated from diagrammatic perturbation theory in the GW ap- proximation. All these concepts are presented with reference to the 2 D parabolic-band <b>electron</b> <b>liquid,</b> but apply as well to graphene when this is sufficiently far from the neutrality point. Chapter 2 contains a detailed discussion of the hydrodynamics of the 2 D <b>electron</b> <b>liquid.</b> Start- ing from a brief review of hydrodynamics and the derivation of its main equations from the Boltzmann transport equation, we present the main peculiarities of the hydrodynamics of an ideal <b>electron</b> <b>liquid.</b> The hydrodynamic description is valid in principle only at frequencies much smaller than 1 /τee. However a suitable generalisation of hydrodynamics has been shown to exist also for frequen- cies higher than 1 /τee, in the so-called collisionless regime. The relations between transport coefficients, such as bulk and shear viscosity, appearing in the Navier-Stokes equation and the microscopic linear-response functions of the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> have been studied in the literature both in the collisional and in the collisionless regime. We give a brief review of these relations and note the existence of two different behaviours of the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid.</b> In the low-frequency (collision dominated) regime the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> behaves like a normal liquid with a large shear viscosity and a vanishing shear modulus. Conversely, in the collisionless regime, the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> behaves like an elastic solid with a finite shear modulus and a small shear viscosity. We then discuss the regime of parameter space in which the hydrodynamic theory can be ap- plied to describe transport in a real laboratory system. The main issue here is related to the breakdown of momentum conservation in a solid state system due to collisions with impurities and phonons. A precise set of inequalities between different length scales must be satisfied for a 2 D <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> to be properly described by hydrodynamics. The last two Chapters present the main original results of this Thesis, which have been obtained by applying hydrodynamics to two transport setups. The first problem we tackle is the study {{of the impact of the}} viscosity of the 2 D <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> on non-local resistance measurements. This is motivated by the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, experimental measurements of the 1 viscosity of strongly interacting 2 D electron liquids are still missing. To this end, we study the effect of a current flow injected in a rectangular 2 D <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> from a pair of side contacts. We first investigate a steady-state (dc) situation and then a dynamical (ac) one. In the dc regime, a crossover between “Ohmic” and viscosity-dominated transport occurs as a function of the ratio between the kinematical viscosity ν and W 2 γ, where W is the width of the sample and γ is the rate at which momentum is damped by electron-impurity and electron-phonon collisions. In the ac regime, a finite oscillation frequency suppresses the impact of viscosity. The study of the ac regime leads to the identification of the normal modes of oscillation (plas- mons) of the 2 D <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> in a rectangular geometry. These depend strongly on the screening of the electron-electron interaction by nearby conductors and dielectrics. These elec- trostatic effects are discussed at a great length, both analytically and numerically. The main effect of viscosity is to damp these self-sustained oscillations. The excitation of these modes by an oscillating current of sufficiently high frequency is studied by taking the effect of viscosity into account. Due to the non-linearity of the Navier-Stokes equation, the response of the system to a pertur- bation at a given frequency contains, at second order, also a steady component. For this reason, the propagation of a plasmon mode generates a steady potential disturbance in the sample. As a final result, we calculate this steady component of the potential that can in principle pave the way for an all-electrical detection of plasmons. The results obtained in the steady and low-frequency regime can be applied to the determination of the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid</b> viscosity, while the ones relative to frequencies larger than the characteris- tic frequency of plasma waves can be relevant in the newly emerging field of graphene plasmonics...|$|E
40|$|We {{predict the}} {{existence}} of a second, low but finite frequency plasmon in a strongly coupled <b>electron</b> <b>liquid.</b> This excitation is maintained by the out-of-phase oscillations of the spin-up and spin-down densities of the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid,</b> but governed solely by the Coulomb interaction between the particles. Its frequency square is proportional to the overlap ($r= 0 $) (absolute) value of the spin-up/spin-down correlation function, and thus slightly affected by the degree of polarization of the <b>electron</b> <b>liquid.</b> We estimate the spectral weight of the mode, {{based on the assumption that}} interspecies drag is the main mechanism for damping in the strongly coupled domain. The spectral weight is manifest in the partial spin-resolved dynamical structure functions.

This same picture persists in the normal state being modified only by the presence of the quasiparticle width.
