5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look closely at the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E

Hearing about the escape, Scully and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) investigate. They learn that three men escaped from three prisons, all of whom had contact with a prison chaplain named Reverend Orison (Scott Wilson). Eventually, the US Marshals corner Pfaster and Orison at a diner, but Orison uses his power of persuasion to distract the Marshals, allowing the two to escape. Pfaster takes Orison's car and runs him over. Meanwhile, Scully keeps hearing the song [...] "Don't Look Any Further" [...] everywhere she goes, soon believing it is a sign.

2500|$|Ugolino's {{statement}} that hunger proved stronger than grief {{has been interpreted}} in two ways, either that Ugolino devoured his offspring's corpses after being driven mad with hunger, or that starvation killed him after {{he had failed to}} die of grief. The first and more ghastly of these interpretations has proved the more popular and resonant. For this reason Ugolino is known as the [...] "Cannibal Count" [...] and is often depicted gnawing at his own fingers ("eating of his own flesh") in consternation, as in the sculpture The Gates of Hell by Auguste Rodin, in Ugolino and his Sons by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and in other artwork, though this may also simply refer to Ugolino's own statement in the poem that he gnawed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> grief.|$|E

He participated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War. In 1903, he gained some attention for his participation in the rescue of a Venezuelan fisherman off the coast of La Guaira under bad conditions.

After the heavy defeat at Sydney the response of the Australian press was to [...] "Sack the Lot!", but the selectors kept all their failing batsman and reshuffled their limited bowling attack., dropping Garth McKenzie, their fast bowling spearhead of the 1960s who had been injured by Snow, and Ashley Mallett despite his 4/40. The fast-medium bowler Alan Thomson swopped his twelfth man position with Alan Connolly [...] The fast-medium bowler Ross Duncan made his Test debut, as did the leg-spinning all-rounder Kerry O'Keeffe who had taken 6/69 and hit 55 not out against the tourists earlier in the season. England recalled their vice-captain Colin Cowdrey (who had been in the nets for much of the Fourth Test) to replace Keith Fletcher, who had been injured in the tour match against North New South Wales.

2500|$|PEF {{also became}} embroiled in major battles with Governor Paterson {{over the state}} budget, which {{occupied}} much of the remainder of Brynien's first term and {{the first few years}} of his second. When the late-2000s recession severely depressed New York state tax revenues, Paterson demanded that PEF and other state employee unions re-open their contracts and adopt a wage freeze and other concessions to help the state balance its budget. PEF refused. PEF countered by suggesting a program of early retirement, which lawmakers began discussing. PEF also demanded that the state cut the number of independent contractors working for the state, arguing that New York could save up to $700 million by reducing the number of contractors or reducing payments to them. PEF also urged the state to adopt higher taxes on the very wealthy and for-profit health maintenance organizations, which the legislature did. Governor Paterson, determined to achieve spending cuts, ordered the layoff of more than 8,900 state workers on March 24, 2009. Brynien and other PEF leaders were deeply angered by Paterson's proposal. Led by PEF, the state's public employee unions produced television commercials and newspaper advertisements depicting Paterson with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his ears and unwilling to listen to voters. The New York Times said that attacks were some [...] "of the nastiest and most personal against a governor in memory ... rare even by Albany's relaxed standards of political decorum." [...] Brynien said Paterson should be faulted for forcing the unions into such an aggressive stand. Brynien also announced PEF would sue the state to prevent the layoffs from occurring. In response, Paterson said he would not lay off any workers if the state's unions agreed to a pension plan ("Tier V") for new workers that would provide much lower benefits. PEF reached an agreement with the governor under which Paterson agreed not to lay off workers in exchange for a $20,000 bonus to 4,000 highly paid workers if they retired early within the next year; the abolition of 2,500 vacant jobs; the creation of a new tier in the pension system which would save $440 million over two years; and the introduction of a plan for workers to voluntarily cut back their working hours.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Foley {{signed a}} {{contract}} with WWF and, this time, the WWF did not use Foley as [...] "enhancement talent". He was shown several designs for a new character—a man with a leather mask and chains. However, WWF said that it was too dark and only left the mask. Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 with a new gimmick and perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind, a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked [...] "Mommy!", spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair), wore a mask and lived in boiler rooms; hence, his specialty match, the Boiler Room Brawl. Mankind's finishing move was the mandible claw nerve hold, which involved sticking <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his opponent's mouth. Later in his career, Mankind began covering his hand with a dirty, smelly sock before applying the maneuver. His catch phrase was [...] "Have a nice day". The original name that Vince McMahon had for Foley was [...] "Mason the Mutilator", but Foley thought that Mankind would be a better name and McMahon changed it. On the April 1, 1996 edition of Raw is War, the day after WrestleMania XII, Mankind debuted and defeated Bob Holly, quickly moving into a feud with The Undertaker. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first ever Boiler Room brawl, in which the goal was to escape the arena's boiler room and reach the ring to take the urn from Paul Bearer. The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as [...] "Uncle Paul". Mankind then earned the number one contendership to face the then WWF Champion Shawn Michaels at [...] Michaels won by disqualification via interference by Vader and The Undertaker. For several years, Foley considered this match his best ever, saying: [...] "Sure, at 280 pounds I still looked like hell, but after a brutal cardiovascular training regimen, I was able to go full-tilt for twenty-seven minutes with a smaller, quicker, better athlete than me". Foley would later state he preferred his match with Randy Orton at Backlash 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Peter May {{had missed}} the two Tests in 1961 and {{declined}} to make the gruelling 8 Test tour of India and Pakistan in 1961–62, as did Colin Cowdrey, Fred Trueman and Brian Statham. Ted Dexter {{was put in charge}} of a weakened team, like Barrington he had made his name in the West Indies and they had shared several big stands together. In an odd schedule the England team played Pakistan before going to India for a 5 Test series and returning to complete the series against Pakistan. In the First Test at Lahore England made a slow 380 batting second with Barrington adding 192 with M.J.K. Smith until he ran out his partner for 99 and himself for 139 after batting for over 7 hours. Pakistan collapsed suddenly in the second innings and England won a surprise victory by 5 wickets. In India they played the Combined Universities at Poona and Barrington made 149 not out in 290 minutes, but mimicked Slasher Mackay (who had toured India two years before) and when he took two wickets there was a pitch invasion as the crowd gave him presents, including a pair of sunglasses, which he used {{for the rest of the}} match, even when bowling. The match was broadcast on radio and Barrington became a star, which he played up to throughout the tour with imitations of Gary Sobers and a pompous Colonel, playing football with the ball and putting <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his ears when the crowd shouted [...] "Mora, Mora" [...] (have a go). On a more practical side he forsaked local food, lived off egg and chips for almost the entire tour and kept an array of medicines to ward off illness (he lost 8lbs before the First Test). He was a great success in the series with innings of 151 not out, 52 not out, 21, 172, 113 not out, 14, 3, 20 and 48; a total of 594 runs (99.00). He made four centuries in four successive Tests for the first time, but the hosts won the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Returning to Pakistan he made 84 in the Second Test, but missed the Third due to fibrositis, an ailment suffered by Wally Hammond, Don Bradman and Len Hutton. He finished with 229 runs (76.33) in the series against Pakistan and 1,329 runs (69.94) on the tour, nearly 300 more than anyone else and top of the averages. It was no surprise that he was named the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year 1962.|$|E
