5|$|Before Hope and Liam's {{official}} legal {{wedding in}} the United States, Steffy spends {{a night on}} the town with Liam. Hope finds out and leaves Liam. Steffy and Liam are reunited, and she soon finds she is pregnant in early 2013. However, she keeps it to herself when she sees Hope and Liam kissing. Liam finds out about the pregnancy and recommits himself to Steffy, but shortly after their wedding she who loses the baby in a motorbike accident. Steffy then learns that her accident has left her infertile. Devastated, Steffy decides to divorce Liam and relocate to Paris. She returns to Los Angeles several months later for a brief visit, informing Liam that her infertility issues have been corrected, hoping that it could mean a second chance for them. Despite this, Liam insists that he is obligated to Hope, and Steffy leaves town again. After another short visit to Los Angeles in February 2015, Steffy returns months later to help Ridge take over Forrester Creations by overthrowing Rick. She becomes president of the company and rekindles her romance with Liam, ending his relationship with her cousin, <b>Ivy</b> Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer). Steffy's cousin, Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), resents Steffy, attributed to the fact that Taylor had accidentally killed her mother, Darla (Schae Harrison), years ago in car accident. An unstable Aly attempts to kill Steffy on PCH, resulting in Steffy killing Aly with a tire iron in self-defense. However, <b>Ivy</b> recorded a video of the accident on her phone, not seeing the rock Steffy killed Aly with. <b>Ivy</b> gets involved with Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks) and <b>Ivy</b> blackmails Steffy with the video, calling the accident a murder. <b>Ivy</b> decides to delete the video after Steffy tries to convince Wyatt to delete it. Thomas tells Steffy that he made out with <b>Ivy</b> while Wyatt was on a business trip. Steffy confronts <b>Ivy</b> and convinces her to tell Wyatt but tells Wyatt before <b>Ivy</b> has a chance. Wyatt breaks up with her and <b>Ivy</b> is angry at Steffy and confronts her in front of a broken electrical panel, resulting in an altercation in which <b>Ivy</b> gets electrocuted. <b>Ivy</b> survives and files a restraining order against Steffy while Wyatt resumes his relationship with <b>Ivy.</b> <b>Ivy</b> realized she never got over Liam and convinces Liam to give them another chance if she drops the restraining order. Quinn overhears <b>Ivy</b> telling Liam she loves him and exposes this in front of Steffy and Liam while Wyatt is proposing to <b>Ivy.</b> Wyatt breaks up with <b>Ivy</b> and she packs her bags for Australia. On top of the staircase, Steffy confronts <b>Ivy</b> and she tumbles down. Liam is angry at Steffy and breaks up with her. Liam hits his head on the plane with <b>Ivy,</b> while Wyatt comforts Steffy. Liam disappears (he was really kidnapped by Quinn after having passed out due to concussion symptoms he acquired by hitting his head while on a plane and passing out in the parking lot of Forrester Creations and losing his memory as a result) and Wyatt tells her that Liam must have once again let her down. He shows her how to have fun by surfing on the beach and even buys her a motorcycle, which she hasn't driven since her miscarriage. The two fall in love and eventually get married on the beach. Steffy's marriage to Wyatt eventually breaks down due to their differing opinions about Quinn and they separate while Steffy contemplates divorcing Wyatt. She eventually rekindles her love and relationship with Liam, Liam proposes to Steffy and she accepts, and after Steffy's divorce from Wyatt was finalized, Steffy & Liam got married in Sydney; Australia.|$|E

5|$|After being named, <b>Ivy</b> quickly {{intensified}} {{after its}} convection was {{drawn into the}} circulation. Late on February 23, the JTWC upgraded <b>Ivy</b> to {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and the FMS followed suit the following day by upgrading <b>Ivy</b> to a severe tropical cyclone as continued favorable conditions allowed for rapid deepening. On February 24 the cyclone began a turn to the southwest as it moved around the ridge, and the next day it turned to the south toward Vanuatu as an approaching shortwave trough passed to the south and created a weakness in the ridge. A nearby upper-level low temporarily cut off outflow, although once it moved further away the low enhanced ventilation. Strengthening continued and, late on February 25, the FMS reported that <b>Ivy</b> attained peak 10–minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) over the Vanuatu archipelago; this made it a Category4 on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph), after a 19km (12mi) eye developed.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{slowly through}} Vanuatu, <b>Ivy</b> began {{accelerating}} {{to the southeast}} and its eye passed {{very close to the}} capital city of Port Vila, after moving over the island of Epi. As the cyclone moved away from the island group, it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. In addition, the combination of cooler water temperatures, greater wind shear, less outflow, and land interaction with Vanuatu caused gradual weakening. Late on February 27, <b>Ivy</b> entered the area of warning responsibility of the Wellington Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. The convection rapidly diminished and left the circulation exposed, and <b>Ivy</b> transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on February 28. It remained strong and maintained a well-defined circulation as it passed just east of East Cape, New Zealand. Continuing southeastward, the extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline on February 29, and <b>Ivy</b> dissipated about 1800km (1100mi) southeast of New Zealand on March 2.|$|E

5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur, <b>Ivy</b> {{was raised by}} the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge, and worked himself to death. Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to <b>Ivy</b> {{that she was not}} their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, <b>Ivy</b> learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented sword, bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the sword in later games, <b>Ivy</b> was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV. Using an artificial soul to keep herself alive, she acts as a teacher to younger warriors when the sword re-appears years later.|$|E

Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of <b>Ivy</b> during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that <b>Ivy</b> has betrayed him over the death of wife. <b>Ivy</b> blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. <b>Ivy</b> is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment <b>Ivy</b> during their sentence.
