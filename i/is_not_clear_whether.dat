5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s old {{ammunition}} stocks for the D-1 {{were removed from}} the Soviet inventory. The only shells retained were the OF-530, O-530, G-530/G-530Sh, and possibly chemical shells. The Soviet Army also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|E

5|$|Oslac is said by the Historia Eliensis to {{have had}} a son named Thorth, that is, Thored.

5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E

5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929. The plot had {{formerly}} {{been part of the}} hunting grounds of the ruling family of Monaco, the Grimaldis, and contained wild olive and orange groves. The villa was built less than a year later. The final cost of the villa was 6 million francs, a large sum for the time. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, who sought to build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E
5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians seem to {{have offered}} Philip Pydna in {{exchange}} for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Philip agreed to this. By this stage, the Social War of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, and they would now {{have been unable to}} intervene to help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city. Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated {{the rest of the population}} considerately.|$|E
5|$|The French {{corvette}} {{had been}} struggling to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at Ceylon, the corvette was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a raking position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to Ceylon without reply. Rather than have his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Victor opened fire or not before the British surrender). Victors men boarded Ceylon and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to Vénus as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E

5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E
5|$|While it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether,</b> and to {{what degree}} or for what {{duration}} some of the passing Jastorf culture people settled at that time on Polish lands, their migration catalyzed, together with the accelerated at this point La Tène culture influence, {{the emergence of the}} Oksywie and Przeworsk cultures. Both new cultures were under a strong Jastorf circles influence. The increasingly common within the Przeworsk culture area presence of objects made by the Jastorf people reflects penetration by their population. Both the Oksywie and Przeworsk cultures fully utilized iron processing technologies, and, unlike their predecessor cultures, they show no regional differentiation.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month with}} his new wife, Sing {{returned}} to the trenches in France in August 1917, but was in very poor health due to his battle wounds {{and the effects of}} gas poisoning. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> he operated as a sniper on the Western Front, but in September 1917, he led a unit in the Battle of Polygon Wood in counter-sniper operations. For this action, he was awarded the Oorlogskruis (Belgian Croix de Guerre) in 1918, and was also recommended for the Military Medal—but never received it. In November 1917, he was confined to hospital again due to problems with his previously wounded leg. In mid-February 1918, he was hospitalised due to a gunshot wound in the back. Sing suffered lung disease from his exposure to gas, and it soon brought his military career to an end.|$|E

5|$|Between 1111 and 1117 {{the ancient}} clas church was granted by Gilbert fitz Richard to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester (a Benedictine house), as a cell or priory of St Peter's Abbey. This may have meant the {{construction}} of a stone church, perhaps the first on the site; a new tower and porch were built. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the Celtic monks and priests (married and single) were expelled, or whether they were joined by brethren of a new sort. A few years later, in 1141, Ewenny Priory, in the Vale of Glamorgan, was founded as a priory of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. As with Llanbadarn, there was a pre-existing church, in this case definitely one in stone, and probably dating from the 1120s, as it was consecrated 1126 by Bishop Urban of Llandaff.|$|E
5|$|Chesney died in 1174, {{having had}} three daughters {{with his wife}} Gilla. Her ancestry is unknown, and it is {{possible}} that William married another time, to Aubrey de Poynings, because a Lewes Priory charter dated to around 1165 names a William de Chesney and Aubrey his wife, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> this charter is referring to William de Chesney the sheriff or to another William. William and Gilla's daughters were Margaret, Clemence, and Sara, all of whom were unmarried {{at the time of their}} father's death. Margaret married twice– first to Hugh de Cressy and second to Robert fitzRoger. Clemence married Jordan de Sackville, and Sara married Richard Engaine. Margaret inherited the majority of her father's estates.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{two giant}} murals of Evita were {{unveiled}} {{on the building}} facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on 9 de Julio Avenue. The works were painted by Argentine artist Alejandro Marmo. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Evita's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of Julio Argentino Roca was replaced by that of Eva Duarte, making her the first actual woman to be featured on the currency of Argentina. The image in the notes {{is based on a}} 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist Roger Pfund. The printing totals 20 million notes; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the government will replace the notes that feature Roca and the Desert Campaign.|$|E
