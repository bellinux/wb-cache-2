25|$|The ladies' {{version of}} the roadster's design {{was very much in}} place by the 1890s. It had a step-through frame rather than the diamond frame of the gentlemen's model so that ladies, with their dresses and skirts, could easily mount and ride their bicycles, and {{commonly}} came with a skirt guard to prevent skirts and dresses becoming entangled in the rear wheel and spokes. As with the gents' roadster, the frame was of steel construction and the positioning of the frame and handlebars gave the rider a very upright riding position. Though they originally came with front spoon-brakes, technological advancements meant that later models were equipped with the much-improved coaster brakes or rod-actuated rim or <b>drum-brakes.</b>|$|E
50|$|In most respects, the {{principal}} mechanical elements followed conventional practice. The four {{speed gear box}} featured synchromesh on the top two ratios. Stopping power came from <b>drum-brakes</b> on all four wheels.|$|E
50|$|A few {{minor changes}} were made for the 1998 model year S-Series vehicles. Due to {{multiple}} complaints about the noise coming from the vehicle's trip odometer {{that had been in}} all of the Saturn S-Series since 1995, had replaced with a new type of trip odometer in an effort to correct the problem. For the 1998 model year, a new cluster with a digital trip odometer had been introduced. Rear disc-brakes were no longer available as an option on the S-Series due to high costs for them as well as very little improvement in braking performance over the conventional rear <b>drum-brakes</b> setup.|$|E
5000|$|The RD350 is a {{two-stroke}} motorcycle {{produced by}} Yamaha from 1973 to 1975. It evolved {{directly from the}} piston port (pre-reed valve intake tract), front <b>drum-braked,</b> five-speed Yamaha 350 cc [...] "R5".|$|R
50|$|Ferrari {{had built}} new cars for the 1952 season and BRM was then {{asked if it}} would be {{entering}} cars. BRM replied by preparing two cars for an April race at Valentino Park, Turin, one <b>drum-braked</b> car, and the other disc-braked, with Moss as one driver, and with Mays all the while attempting to enlist Fangio, who had until recently been driving for Alfa Romeo, as the other. This Mays succeeded in doing, but this meant missing the Turin race. Fangio came to Folkingham to test the car. At this point the BRM V16 was developing around 400-450 hp. As soon as he got in the car, Fangio seemed to take to the vehicle, driving the car with his usual élan. It was stated that all the drivers who had driven the car prior to Fangio had been in awe of it.|$|R
50|$|Jaguar {{returned}} with their C-Types {{and after the}} debacle of the previous year, were determined not to repeat those mistakes, having undertaken a lot of development work. Team manager ‘Lofty’ England employed the same driver pairings as 1952, with Peter Walker and Stirling Moss, Peter Whitehead and Ian Stewart, and Tony Rolt and Duncan Hamilton. The cars reverted to the aerodynamic design prior {{to that of the}} 1952 Le Mans cars, whose revised nose and tail had adversely affected stability at speeds over 120 mph. For 1953 the cars were lighter and more powerful (now developing 218 bhp), and they were the first-ever Le Mans cars equipped with disc brakes, from Dunlop, whose greater efficiency gave the C-Types a distinct advantage over their <b>drum-braked</b> competitors. The disc brakes had been available in 1952, but given the problems with the radiators they had been swapped out so the team could concentrate on just one potential issue in the race. The works cars were supported by a standard production-body car entered by the new Belgian Ecurie Francorchamps team.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} to the late-1970s, engine compression-releases {{were also used}} to {{supplement}} rear-wheel braking on many two-stroke engine powered motorcycles, primarily those used off-road or for various types of dirt-track racing, such as motocross and flat-tracking. Since two-stroke engines normally lack the compression braking effect of four-stroke engines when the throttle is shut off, {{the addition of a}} compression release brake on two-strokes essentially mimicked the four-stroke compression braking effect. Using throttle-off engine compression for at least some braking on both two-stroke and four stroke motorcycles was especially important during that era, since most motorcycles used <b>drum-brakes,</b> which would wear-out much more quickly than modern disc brakes.|$|E

5000|$|Though the ladies' {{version of}} the {{roadster}} largely fell out of fashion in England and many other Western nations as the 20th century progressed, it remains popular in the Netherlands; this is why some people refer to bicycles of this design as Dutch bikes. In Dutch the name of these bicycles is Omafiets ("grandma's bike") though in Frisia they often call them Widdofyts (Frisian for [...] "widow's bike"). The classic Omafiets is still in production in the Netherlands and has changed little since 1911: {{it comes with a}} single-speed gear, 28 x 1½ (ISO 635) wheels, black painted frame and mudguards (with white-blazoning {{at the back of the}} rear one), and a rear skirt guard. Modern variants, be they painted in other colours, with aluminium frames, <b>drum-brakes</b> or multiple gear ratios in a hub gearing system, will all conform to the same basic look and dimensions as the classic Omafiets. (The Dutch gentlemen's equivalent is called the Opafiets (Dutch for [...] "grandpa's bike") or Stadsfiets ("city bike") and generally has the same characteristics but with a [...] "diamond" [...] or [...] "gents'" [...] frame, thereby much the same as the gentleman's English roadster.) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} is presented {{a kind of}} cooling device for a vehicle’s brake cooling system, which comprises a thermoelectric cooling (TEC) chip and a heat exchange system. The disc-brake and <b>drum-brake</b> systems {{are discussed in the}} research. After inputting electric power, the TEC chip provides one cooling surface which is stick on the brake system and absorbs the heat from the brake pads or shoes. The other surface releases heat which is absorbed by a recycle water-cooling system to discharge the heat by water-cooled radiator to the surrounding. It decreased the working temperature of the brake system about 30 % at most after using this cooling device and increased the braking force about 30 % at least. There is a temperature control device for the device which can start the TEC chip when the temperature of the brake pads or shoes exceeded 50 ℃, which is the lowest temperature that the brake pads or shoes can maintain the most performance of the braking force. The device can efficiently keep the braking force when the driver uses the brake to reduce the vehicle’s speed {{for a long time and}} provide the safety for the driver. Introduction and Literature Review The braking system is one of the important kinetic control systems in the vehicle[1]. By transferring kinetic energy to friction work[2], the braking force can decelerate the speed of the vehicle...|$|R
40|$|In this article, the {{strategy}} {{followed by an}} automobile company for detecting {{the root causes of}} groan complaints related to rear drum brakes in commercial vehicles is presented using data collected from the sold troubled vehicles and from new vehicles from the production line, as well as the <b>drum-brake</b> test rig at the laboratory. Drum brake groan is often very intense and can cause large numbers of customer complaints. During a groan noise event, vehicle structure and suspension components are excited by the brake system and result in a violent event that can be heard and felt during brake application. This paper condenses experimental studies on a low frequency drum brake groan problem that has caused high warranty costs. First, the environmental conditions causing the groan were identified and the groan was reproduced. Vehicle tests were performed both at the factory and in traffic. To conclude the planned study, TVA (Total Value Analysis) and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) methods were used effectively. A strategy to determine the root causes was planned and implemented systematically to eliminate the secondary and tertiary effects of brake groan problems. In order to ge to the root causes, vibration and groan measurements were executed and interpreted according to TVA and FMEA charts. The sensitivity of the lining material of the brake shoes to different environmental conditions was investigated. Finally, the groan mechanism of the drum brake system is discussed and the solution to the low frequency drum brake groan problem is evaluated in detail...|$|R
