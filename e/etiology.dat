5|$|Differentiating between {{infectious}} and non-infectious illness, {{and identifying}} the underlying <b>etiology</b> of infection, {{can be quite}} challenging. For example, {{more than half of}} cases of encephalitis remain undiagnosed, despite extensive testing using state-of-the-art clinical laboratory methods. Metagenomic sequencing shows promise as a sensitive and rapid method to diagnose infection by comparing genetic material found in a patient's sample to a database of thousands of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact <b>etiology</b> of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

25|$|Another {{advantage}} of MRI is its utilization of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) sequences. MRCP provides useful {{information regarding the}} <b>etiology</b> of acute pancreatitis, i.e., the presence of tiny biliary stones (choledocholithiasis or cholelithiasis) and duct anomalies. Clinical trials indicate that MRCP can be as effective a diagnostic tool for acute pancreatitis with biliary <b>etiology</b> as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but with the benefits of being less invasive and causing fewer complications.|$|E

40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{highlight}} the various <b>etiologies</b> of maxillo-mandibular osteonecrosis, other than radiotherapy and biphosphonate related osteitis that have been abundantly reported. We performed a PubMed search from August 1, 1972 to August 1, 2012 using the following MeSH terms: "osteonecrosis", "bone", "necrosis", "jaw", "maxilla", "mandible", "palate", "oral", "avascular necrosis", NOT "bisphosphonate" NOT "osteoradionecrosis". Most cases of osteonecrosis were iatrogenic. Viral, mycotic, or bacterial infections were less frequent causes. Cocaine abuse, Wegener's granulomatosis, and N/K lymphoma were other <b>etiologies.</b> It is important to identify the various <b>etiologies</b> rapidly to manage this sometimes very mutilating condition adequately...|$|R

25|$|Executive {{dysfunction}} characterizes many of {{the symptoms}} observed in numerous clinical populations. In the case of acquired brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases {{there is a clear}} neurological <b>etiology</b> producing dysexecutive symptoms. Conversely, syndromes and disorders are defined and diagnosed based on their symptomatology rather than <b>etiology.</b> Thus, while Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative condition, causes executive dysfunction, a disorder such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a classification given to a set of subjectively-determined symptoms implicating executive dysfunction – current models indicate that such clinical symptoms are caused by executive dysfunction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{agents of}} human febrile illness can vary by region and country {{suggesting}} that diagnosis, treatment, and control programs {{need to be}} based on a methodical evaluation of area-specific <b>etiologies.</b> From December 2006 to December 2009, 9, 997 individuals presenting with acute febrile illness at nine health care clinics in south-central Cambodia were enrolled in a study to elucidate the <b>etiologies.</b> Upon enrollment, respiratory specimens, whole blood, and serum were collected. Testing was performed for viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. <b>Etiologies</b> were identified in 38. 0 % of patients. Influenza was the most frequent pathogen, followed by dengue, malaria, and bacterial pathogens isolated from blood culture. In addition, 3. 5 % of enrolled patients were infected with more than one pathogen. Our data provide the first systematic assessment of the <b>etiologies</b> of acute febrile illness in south-central Cambodia. Data from syndromicbased surveillance studies can help guide public health responses in developing nations...|$|R
