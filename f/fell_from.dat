5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that rain <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> the Heavens (i.e. where {{the stars were}} located). Wang argued that, although rain <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe's {{commercial}} farming {{sector was}} traditionally {{a source of}} exports and foreign exchange, and provided 400,000 jobs. However, the government's land reform program badly damaged the sector, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products. For example, between 2000 and 2016 annual wheat production <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> 250,000 tons to 60,000 tons, maize was reduced from two million tons to 500,000 tons and cattle slaughtered for beef <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> 605,000 to 244,000. Coffee production, once a prized export commodity came to a virtual halt after seizure or expropriation of white-owned coffee farms in 2000, and has never recovered.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the project}} was subject to {{significant}} delays due to cost overruns and contract re-negotiations.

5|$|Since its introduction, {{the euro}} {{has been the}} second most widely held {{international}} reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period, the share held in U.S. dollar <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> 71% to 64% and that held in Yen <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built {{on the status of}} the Deutsche Mark as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all currency reserves in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies.|$|E

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the head has long been debated, and has resulted in several scientific analyses.

5|$|The {{high-speed}} trains {{have successfully}} out-competed planes: by August 2008, {{half of the}} air routes between Taipei and the country's western cities had been discontinued, including all connections between cities with THSR stations except for a single daily connection between Taipei and Kaohsiung. Total domestic air traffic {{was expected to be}} halved from 2006 to 2008, and actually <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> 8.6 to 4.9million. In June 2012, officials announced the discontinuation of the last remaining commercial flight between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The share for conventional rail between Taipei and Kaohsiung <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> 9.71% in 2006 to 2.5% in 2008, while high-speed rail became the most common mode of transport at 50% of all trips by 2008. The opening of THSR led to a 10% reduction of traffic on the parallel expressway in 2007. Despite cheaper ticket prices, long-distance bus companies reported that passenger volumes had fallen by 20 to 30 percent by 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} Tkach’s tenure {{as the head}} of the WCG was notable. Church income dropped from a high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The {{circulation}} of The Plain Truth, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry. The number of employees at the church headquarters <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> 1,000 to about 50. Ambassador University, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 as the church could no longer provide its annual operating subsidy.
