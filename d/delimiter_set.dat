25|$|XML is {{a profile}} of an ISO {{standard}} SGML, and most of XML comes from SGML unchanged. From SGML comes the separation of logical and physical structures (elements and entities), the availability of grammar-based validation (DTDs), the separation of data and metadata (elements and attributes), mixed content, the separation of processing from representation (processing instructions), and the default angle-bracket syntax. Removed were the SGML declaration (XML has a fixed <b>delimiter</b> <b>set</b> and adopts Unicode as the document character set).|$|E

50|$|An SGML {{document}} may {{be composed}} from many entities (discrete pieces of text). In SGML, the entities and element types {{used in the}} document may be specified with a DTD, the different character <b>sets,</b> features, <b>delimiter</b> <b>sets,</b> and keywords are specified in the SGML Declaration to create the concrete syntax of the document.|$|R
50|$|As {{soon as the}} <b>delimiter</b> is <b>set</b> on a {{position}} where this condition is not met, we stop, move the delimiter to this position, and start again by marking this position as a new initial position (i.e., position 1). Keep iterating {{until the end of}} the sequence. The Lempel-Ziv complexity corresponds to the number of iterations needed to finish this procedure.|$|R
5000|$|Interwiki link {{notation}} varies, depending {{largely on}} the syntax a wiki uses for markup. The two most common link patterns in wikis are CamelCase and free links (arbitrary phrases surrounded by some <b>set</b> <b>delimiter,</b> such as [...] ). CURIE syntax -an emerging W3C standard- uses a single set of square brackets.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{implementation}} in the Coq proof assistant of type directed partial evaluation (TDPE) algorithms for call-by-name and call-by-value versions of shift and reset delimited control operators, and in presence of strong sum types. We {{prove that the}} algorithm transforms well-typed programs to ones in normal form. These normal forms can not always be arrived at using the so far known equational theories. The typing system does not allow answer-type modification for function types and allows <b>delimiters</b> to be <b>set</b> on at most one atomic type. The semantic domain for evaluation is expressed in Constructive Type Theory as a dependently typed monadic structure combining Kripke models and continuation passing style translations. ...|$|R
