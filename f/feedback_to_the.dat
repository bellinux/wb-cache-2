5|$|The {{production}} of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), {{released by the}} anterior pituitary gland. TSH release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide negative <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the neural system provides <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vascular system of its need for more glucose is partly the release of glutamate as part of neuron firing. This glutamate affects nearby supporting cells, astrocytes, causing a change in calcium ion concentration. This, in turn, releases nitric oxide at the contact point of astrocytes and intermediate-sized blood vessels, the arterioles. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator causing arterioles to expand and draw in more blood.|$|E

25|$|Wired gloves. These {{can provide}} input to the {{computer}} about the position and rotation of the hands using magnetic or inertial tracking devices. Furthermore, some gloves can detect finger bending {{with a high degree}} of accuracy (5-10 degrees), or even provide haptic <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> user, which is a simulation of the sense of touch. The first commercially available hand-tracking glove-type device was the DataGlove, a glove-type device which could detect hand position, movement and finger bending. This uses fiber optic cables running down the back of the hand. Light pulses are created and when the fingers are bent, light leaks through small cracks and the loss is registered, giving an approximation of the hand pose.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the Kodak Microelectronics Technology Division {{developed}} a 1.3 MP CCD image sensor, the first {{with more than}} 1 million pixels. In 1987, this sensor was integrated with a Canon F-1 film SLR body at the Kodak Federal Systems Division to create the first DSLR camera. The digital back monitored the camera body battery current to sync the image sensor exposure to the film body shutter. Digital images were stored on a tethered hard drive and processed for histogram <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> user. This first camera was created for the U.S. Government, and was followed by several other models intended for government use, and eventually the first commercial DSLR, launched by Kodak in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Biomechatronics mimics how {{the human}} body works. For example, four {{different}} steps must occur {{to be able to}} lift the foot to walk. First, impulses from the motor center of the brain are sent to the foot and leg muscles. Next the nerve cells in the feet send information, providing <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain, enabling it to adjust the muscle groups or amount of force required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of force are applied {{depending on the type of}} surface being walked across. The leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to set it down.|$|E

25|$|Bootcamp has two stages: in {{the first}} stage, acts are {{allocated}} into groups and must perform a song to the judges in their groups, with each act showcasing a few parts of the song solo. Those who pass this stage then must sing again on their own in the next stage {{in front of the}} judges. A live audience was added to the second stage from series 4 onwards (one exception in series 5 saw the live audience {{in the first}} stage instead, and another in series 7 saw it being axed altogether due to Cole's and Minogue's absences), and the performances at both stages now take place at Wembley Arena from series 7 onwards (the first use of the live audience at the arena was in series 8). Usually in both stages, the judges do not give any <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acts after performing, and only deliberate on which acts to send through after all the performances at each stage are finished. However, in series 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14, the judges give <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acts in the first stage and immediately decide who to send through. They also made the immediate decisions in the second stage In series 7, an intermediate stage was used in-between the two stages in which the acts were taught to do a dance routine by the creative director but were not judged on performance. In series 8 and 9, the judges reviewed the audition tapes of the acts and deliberated on who to send home before their arrival, only revealing their eliminated acts to the contestants just before the first stage. In series 13, the second stage of Bootcamp was cut down and the judges made the decisions on who to send through to the next stage of the competition.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet {{has three}} modules: a worm that executes all {{routines}} {{related to the}} main payload of the attack; a link file that automatically executes the propagated copies of the worm; and a rootkit component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes, preventing detection {{of the presence of}} Stuxnet. It is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected USB flash drive. The worm then propagates across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC. In the absence of either criterion, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer. If both the conditions are fulfilled, Stuxnet introduces the infected rootkit onto the PLC and Step7 software, modifying the codes and giving unexpected commands to the PLC while returning a loop of normal operations system values <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> users.|$|E
25|$|Android's default user {{interface}} is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, {{along with a}} virtual keyboard. Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB. The response to user input {{is designed to be}} immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> user. Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.|$|E
