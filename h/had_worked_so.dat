5|$|The Atlanta Falcons overcame a 20–7 halftime {{deficit to}} defeat the Buccaneers in {{overtime}} on a Mick Luckhurst field goal. The strategy of running out the clock with a conservative offense that <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> well against the Lions the previous week backfired against the Falcons. The Buccaneers' offensive line failed to dominate, and the Falcons wound up running 57 offensive plays in the second half, while the Buccaneers ran only 26. Twenty of those plays were runs by Gerald Riggs, who finished the day with 127 yards rushing. The Buccaneers outgained the Falcons 255 yards to 190 in the first half, but were outgained 300 yards to 68 in the second half, in which the Buccaneers never advanced beyond midfield. The win left Atlanta undefeated at 4–0.|$|E

Whilst recovering from this mishap, he developed tetanus and died on 4 December 1864, at his home in Ackworth. He died only months after his great triumph at the Newcastle ploughing trial, at the age of only thirty-eight.|$|E
25|$|When these federal pay for {{performance}} systems failed, many were surprised because it <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> {{well within the}} private sector. Much of this failure was attributed {{to the fact that}} most of the research on pay {{for performance}} had been done in the private rather than public sector. These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators that work for employees of private business firms.|$|E
25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on the Ides of March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement that had been signed {{less than six months}} before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany all sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall due to a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop's standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles treaty, and really only wanted peace with everyone, which <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, the Conservative M.P Alfred Duff Cooper {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times:"Some of us are getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take upon our shoulders the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in a position to do what she is doing today". Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned them, and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all credibility with its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.|$|E

25|$|Membership of {{the various}} Methodist {{branches}} peaked at 841,000 in 1910, then fell steadily to 425,000 in 1990 and only 202,000 in 2014. The {{second half of the}} 19th century saw many of the small schisms reunited to become the United Methodist Free Churches and a further union in 1907 with the Methodist New Connexion and Bible Christian Church brought the United Methodist Church into being. In 1908 the major three branches were the Wesleyan Methodists, the Primitive Methodists and the United Methodists. After the late 19th century evangelical approaches to the unchurched were less effective and less used. Methodists paid more attention to their current membership, and less to outreach, while middle-class family size shrank steadily. There were fewer famous preachers or outstanding leaders. The theological change that emphasised the conversion experience as being a one-time lifetime event rather than as a step on the road to perfection lessened the importance of the class meeting and made revivals less meaningful. The growth mechanisms that <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> well in the expansion phase in the early 19th century were largely discarded, including revivals and the personal appeal to decide for Christ class meetings, as well as the love feast, the Sunday night prayer-meeting, and the open-air meeting. The failure to grow was signaled by the flagging experience of the Sunday schools, whose enrollments fell steadily.|$|E

[...] After that, he went to live with his father Augustus Jones, a Welsh-born United Empire Loyalist. [...] There he learnt the customs and language of the white Christian settlers of Upper Canada and was taught how to farm. [...] Jones converted to Methodism at age 21 after attending a camp-meeting with his half sister. [...] Methodist leaders in Upper Canada recognised his potential as a bridge between the white and Indian communities and recruited him as a preacher. [...] As a bilingual and bicultural preacher, he enabled the Methodists to make significant inroads with the Mississaugas and Iroquois of Upper Canada, both by translating hymns and biblical texts in Ojibwe and Mohawk and by preaching to Indians who did not understand English. [...] Beyond his preaching to the Indians of Upper Canada, he was an excellent fundraiser for the Canadian Methodists, and toured the United States and Great Britain giving sermons and speeches. [...] Jones drew audiences of thousands, filling many of the buildings he spoke in, but came to resent the role, believing the audiences came to see Kahkewāquonāby, the exotic Indian, not Peter Jones, the good Christian he <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> hard to become.|$|E
500|$|Critics panned The Wiz {{upon its}} October 1978 release. Many reviewers {{directed}} their criticism at Diana Ross, who they believed {{was too old}} to play Dorothy. Most agreed that what <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen. Hischak's Through the Screen Door: What Happened to the Broadway Musical When It Went to Hollywood criticized [...] "Joel Schumacher's cockamamy screenplay", and called [...] "Believe in Yourself" [...] the score's weakest song. He described Diana Ross's portrayal of Dorothy as: [...] "cold, neurotic and oddly unattractive"; and noted that the film was [...] "a critical and box office bust". In his work History of the American Cinema, Harpole characterized the film as [...] "one of the decade's biggest failures", and, [...] "the year's biggest musical flop". The Grove Book of Hollywood noted that [...] "the picture finished off Diana Ross's screen career", as the film was Ross's final theatrical feature. In his book Blockbuster, Tom Shone referred to The Wiz as [...] "expensive crud". In the book Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, the author criticized the script, noting, [...] "The Wiz was too scary for children, and too silly for adults." [...] Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film, did not think highly of The Wiz, stating [...] "The Wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal that the classic MGM musical has obtained." ...|$|E

She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines.

Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch.

Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of the show's eighth season. Harrisson praised the character development in [...] "Roadrunners" [...] {{and noted that}} the episode [...] "effectively brings [...] together as partners." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two note that, [...] "for the first half-hour, this works as a slow burn horror story... It's the transition of Gillian Anderson's performance from wry exasperation to outright paranoia... which makes this so effective." [...] Shearman and Pearson did, however, slightly criticize the cutting of John Doggett's role to a minimum. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that it [...] "is an episode that’s dedicated to helping us move past the Mulder era." [...] He praised the creepiness of Gilligan's script, {{as well as the}} characterization of Scully, writing that even though she is in a situation that is over her head, she is still smart in her attempts to escape; he also praised Anderson's acting. However, VanDerWerff was more critical of the final scene, noting that it made Doggett come across as [...] "kind of an asshole". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, saying it features a [...] "return to the body horror stories that <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> well in the early seasons". Spragg added that [...] "Roadrunners" [...] is [...] "certainly close" [...] to the highly acclaimed first-season episode [...] "Ice".|$|E
