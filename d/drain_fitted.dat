40|$|A {{system for}} the {{experimental}} larval rearing of phyllosoma of southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) is described. Sea water filtered to 1 um, heated to 18 degrees C and disinfected with ultraviolet light, passes into circular 35 l vessels via a series of jets to achieve constant circular flow. Water exits through a screened <b>drain</b> <b>fitted</b> {{to the wall of}} the vessel and positioned to maintain a volume of 10 l with a turnover of 3 - 4 times per hour. Phyllosoma were cultured in this system from hatch to Stage XI when fed ongrown Artemia and pieces of mussel (Mytilus edulis). The system may readily and cheaply be replicated for experimental comparisons of several treatments...|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of sulphides in acid sulphate soils (ASS) {{causes the}} acidification of many Australian coastal river systems. The acidity negatively impacts upon coastal ecosystems, aquaculture, agriculture and concrete and steel infrastructure. In the low-lying floodplains, relatively deep surface <b>drains</b> <b>fitted</b> with one-way floodgates lower the watertable, thereby exposing the sulphidic minerals to oxidation. On the Broughton Creek floodplain in SE Australia, four distinct remediation strategies {{have been developed}} to tackle the issue of acidification by ASS: (i) simple V-notch weirs that raise the level of the watertable surrounding the drains thereby submerging the pyrite and preventing the further formation of acidity; (ii) modified two-way floodgates that allow the inflow of tidal water into the drains, thereby offering the acidity within the drain before it enters the river and raising the level of the watertable surrounding the drain; (iii) lateral impermeable lime barriers that both prevent oxidation of pyrite by stopping the downward movement of oxygen into the soil and neutralise the acidity in the groundwater; and (iv) permeable reactive barriers (PRB) that passively intercept the groundwater flow and neutralise the acidity. Each remediation strategy has a distinct role to suit the different terrain and groundwater conditions...|$|R
40|$|Between November and December 2015, {{an archaeological}} {{evaluation}} was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology on land at Radford, Semele, Warwick, Warwickshire. The work {{was carried out}} in order to inform a planning application {{for the construction of a}} solar farm with associated infrastructure. The fieldwork comprised the excavation of thirty-two trenches. Archaeological interest in the site is derived from its location close to the buried remains of a Bronze Age burnt mound dated through radiocarbon dating to around 950 BC. Subsequent geophysical survey revealed a number of anomalies of potential archaeological origin within the current evaluation and in the field to the south. Where archaeological features were encountered during the current trenching there was a good correlation with the results of the preceding geophysical survey. The earliest features encountered were undated pits located towards the southern boundary of the site. These were sealed beneath an extensive alluvial deposit. The evaluation identified ditches and agricultural features across the site. The alignments of these ditches suggest a co-axial field system aligned broadly north-east/south-west, north/south and east/west, forming parts of three contiguous fields. No dateable material was recovered from the features, which are attributed to the medieval and post-medieval/modern periods based on cartographic evidence and morphological characteristics. The remaining field boundary ditches, furrows and land <b>drains</b> <b>fit</b> within the general alignment of the surrounding field systems depicted on historic and current Ordnance Survey mapping...|$|R
40|$|Background: Axillary lymphadenectomy or {{sentinel}} biopsy {{is integral}} part of breast cancer treatment, yet seroma formation occurs in 15 - 85 % of cases. Among methods employed to reduce seroma magnitude and duration, fibrin glue has been proposed in numerous studies with controversial results. Methods: Thirty patients over 60 years underwent quadrantectomy or mastectomy with level I/II axillary lymphadenectomy; a suction <b>drain</b> was <b>fitted</b> in all patients. Fibrin glue spray were applied to the axillary fossa in 15 patients; the other 15 patients were treated with harmonic scalpel. Results: Suction drainage was removed between post-operative Days 3 and 4. Seroma magnitude and duration were not significant in patients receiving fibrin glue compared with the harmonic scalpel group. Conclusions: Use of fibrin glue does not always prevent seroma formation, but can reduce seroma magnitude, duration and necessary evacuative punctures. Background Axillary dissection represents an {{integral part of}} the treatment for breast cancer for prognostic and curative purposes. There is still a significant incidence (15 - 81 %...|$|R
40|$|Cellar {{conversion}} and new basement creation is {{widespread in the}} UK where basement living and working is frequent. All basements {{are at risk of}} elevated radon levels regardless of geographic location. In 1999, a landmark court ruling altered the approach to waterproofing, steering designers and contractors towards the use of internally <b>fitted</b> <b>drained</b> cavity drain membrane systems. Based on air-gap technology, these membrane systems are not appropriate for gas proofing; in part of continental Europe their use is specifically discouraged for that purpose. The author set about resolving the conflict between good waterproofing practice and radon gas management in basements, producing a successful solution. The paper explores the background of UK basement use, the key points of the landmark judgment and subsequent code of practice for below ground waterproofing. This code of practice now requires radon to be considered in waterproofing design and implementation, but overlooks how this might be achieved. The paper describes the process that was developed to solve the dilemma and illustrates with case studies. Although construction practices and basement usage differ across the globe, the principles involved may have relevant applications internationally...|$|R
40|$|French drains or infiltrating filter <b>drains</b> are {{commonly}} <b>fitted</b> with slotted plastic pipe {{to act as}} an overflow mechanism when rainfall is too great to allow complete infiltration. The release of the effluent from such pipes is commonly to surface water courses. Whilst there is expected to be some slight degree of protection against hydrocarbon release because of interaction with the drainâ€™s stone infill material this will be severely limited. This paper reports an experiment in which model filter drains with or without geotextile sleeves around the slotted drain are challenged with lubricating oil. The textile was a surface-treated non-woven geotextile manufactured from polyester. The models were challenged with very high loadings of oil, as would be anticipated in a motor vehicle collision occurring close to the drain. A series of simulated 10 - 20 mm rain events over 1 hour were applied and two sample types were collected which either included or excluded any free product. Additional aliquots of oil were added at each rain event. The un-sleeved models were found to release visible free product with the addition of as little as 100 ml of oil per linear meter of drain. For the models with geotextile sleeves there was no such release with as much as 2000 ml per linear metre. Analysis showed that under these conditions the geotextile sleeved pipes continued to produce effluent with hydrocarbon concentrations well below the 5000 g/l limit usually accepted in the UK...|$|R
