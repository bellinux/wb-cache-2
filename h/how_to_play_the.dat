5|$|Christopher Marquette plays Miles Caraday, a young jazz piano prodigy with Tourette Syndrome. Marquette learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> piano from Wolff.

In {{preparation for the}} role, Marquette practiced ticcing in public.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>The</b> rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{historian}} Bill James {{does not}} dispute this claim in apparently referring to Speaker and possibly Cobb, but {{says that the}} Klan had toned down its racist overtures during the 1920s and pulled in {{hundreds of thousands of}} non-racist men, including Hugo Black. James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours with the former second baseman on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> outfield.|$|E

5000|$|One day, Strauss {{goes away}} on a journey, leaving Tom in a serious predicament (knowing that without music, Johann wouldn't dance). He picks up a manual {{on top of the}} piano: [...] "How <b>To</b> <b>Play</b> <b>The</b> Waltz In Six Easy Lessons by Johann Strauss." [...] Tom charges upstairs into the attic and teaches himself <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> {{following}} <b>the</b> guidebook (which consists of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> correctly <b>play</b> <b>the</b> first eight/nine notes of The Blue Danube, in proper sequence), and after just six lessons, he is instantaneously an accomplished pianist.|$|R
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E

The role garnered Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony, losing to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman.|$|E

5|$|Moodu Pani marked A. R. Rahman's first {{association}} with Ilaiyaraaja; the former (then known by his birth name Dilip) {{worked as a}} keyboardist in the film. During the re-recording of Moodu Pani soundtrack and score, Ilaiyaraaja fired his original keyboardist, due to the person's drinking behaviour. At that time, another one of his troupe members asked Ilaiyaraaja to meet a boy named Dilip, who knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> keyboard. Ilaiyaraaja agreed and sent for Dilip, whom he instructed regarding the notes and tune he had to play. Dilip, under Ilaiyaraaja's supervision, successfully completed the re-recording process.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming {{of what they}} would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} months on board, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) {{repeatedly}} tries to seduce Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks). Daniel finally confronts Vala {{for what he}} believes to be her insincerity, teasing, and mocking of him. Vala's upset reaction makes Daniel realize the honesty of her feelings, and they share a passionate embrace. As the years pass, each team member attempts {{to deal with the}} isolation. General Landry develops a gardening hobby; Carter learns <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> cello; Daniel continues the translation of Asgard information in the database and develops his relationship with Vala; and Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) exercise and train while Mitchell is growing more frustrated and angry.

5|$|Inspired by {{the example}} of Daniel Johnston, Diamandis decided to compose her own music and stop going to auditions; she taught herself <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> piano and {{recorded}} music on a keyboard. She self-composed and produced her earlier demos with GarageBand, and independently released her debut extended play Mermaid vs. Sailor through Myspace in 2007. She held discussions with fourteen music labels, rejecting all but one as she believed {{it was the only}} one which would not dictate her image. She {{came to the attention of}} Neon Gold Records' Derek Davies in 2008, which managed her for six months, and was hired as the supporting act for Australian recording artist Gotye. In October, Diamandis finalised a recording contract with 679 Recordings (eventually renamed 679 Artists), a subdivision of Warner Music Group.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{played a}} mouth organ during a bus journey {{to visit his}} cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a {{harmonica}} he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, {{and it became a}} signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} all {{responded to this}} {{production}} method differently, with Iwadera and Kusakari finding the approach the easiest. Okazaki and Ejima both had trouble adopting this method. Okazaki was very anxious about her ability to create demos, having never used music software before, and not even owning a computer before moving to Tokyo. Yamaguchi bought her an iBook to help her with the process. Ejima found difficulty in recording demos due {{to the problem of}} recording drums at home for sound sampling. As a result, he learnt <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> guitar. In June, the band were creating songs on a daily basis, and in August were still in the pre-production stages of the album. The album was created at Yamaguchi's apartment in Noborito in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, which became a meeting place for all of the band members for the album. In total, around thirty demo compositions were produced for the album. This method of song production also led to Yamaguchi being able to think of the album as a whole, as opposed to their methods on Go to the Future and Night Fishing, in which each song was thought of in its own individual context.|$|E
