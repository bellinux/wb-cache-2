5|$|The teams {{moved on}} to Lord's for the Second Test and Australia {{compiled}} 350 in its first innings. Tallon came to the crease with Australia at 6/225 after Hassett and Bill Brown <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> quick succession, joining Johnson in the middle. Johnson struggled to score, while Tallon did so freely in the last hour. After Johnson fell for four at 7/246, Lindwall then joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 7/258 with Tallon on 25. Tallon had dominated the scoring late in day, making 25 of the 33 runs added. The crowd was optimistic about England's position and some immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by Colin Cowdrey, the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead twelfth man. In his place, England chose a fast bowler to {{strengthen}} their bowling attack. While the game was taking place, Doug Insole, the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's. The replacement for D'Oliveira, Barry Knight, performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, but critics believed his chance <b>had</b> <b>gone.</b> <b>In</b> July, as part of a standard procedure, the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted. According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.|$|E

Kaif needed to forge a partnership with Dhoni, India's last recognised batsman as they <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> with five specialist bowlers, but Dhoni was deceived by a straight ball from Chandana and lbw for 7. None of the batsmen from seven to eleven managed to get into double figures, Kaif was left to injudicious hitting and naturally top-edged one to midwicket, and India's chase - thought to be relatively simple fifteen overs before - ended a whole 18 runs short of Sri Lanka's total.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 pm, the 6th Foot and the Brunswick Oels {{from the}} brigade of Edward Barnes {{arrived on the}} {{battlefield}} from the west. Marching along the western extension of the Chemin des Anglais, these 1,500 soldiers struck Maransin's division from an unexpected direction. The battalion of the 103rd Line Infantry was badly mauled, losing 15 out of 20 officers. The 82nd Foot and the survivors of Cameron's brigade rallied {{and returned to the}} attack, pushing Maransin's surprised soldiers uphill. Finally, D'Erlon threw in one of Abbé's fresh brigades and Maransin's troops rallied behind it. The French corps commander also recalled one of Darmagnac's brigades which <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of Pringle's brigade. Fearing that he was confronted by two full divisions, d'Erlon refused to commit Abbé's division to an attack. The battle petered out about 8:00 pm with the French in possession of Maya Pass, but with the British in position nearby.|$|E
25|$|The {{visit to}} Bolton Wanderers was {{postponed}} after severe {{weather in the}} north-west left the ground waterlogged, so the next game was at home to Preston North End on 23 November. Wheldon, back to something approaching his best, scored twice from distance to lead 2–1 at half-time. During the interval, Preston's goalkeeper John Wright {{was found to have}} broken his wrist and could not continue. Lester turned the ball into his own net to bring the scores level, but despite the brilliance of Bob Holmes, playing on his own at back after Sandy Tait <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> goal, Preston could not prevent Small Heath exploiting their numerical advantage. The third goal ended with ball, goalkeeper and all five Small Heath forwards in the net, after which Jones scored twice to make the final score 5–2. Walton, now playing at centre half, drew particular praise for his judgment and the quality of his passing. The two points gained took Small Heath off the bottom of the table for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Benaud, who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> as nightwatchman, did {{not last}} long the next morning, but Simpson and O'Neill took the score to 154 before the former was third out for 91. So with seven wickets left, Australia only needed another 104. But wickets now fell steadily, {{including}} O'Neill for 48, Harvey and Davidson, all three dismissed by Worrell. When Burge was seventh out to Valentine for 53, Australia still needed another 8 runs to win. With four runs required, {{there was a moment of}} controversy. Grout late cut Valentine for two runs, but the off bail had fallen to the ground. The umpires consulted, but ruled that the batsman was not out. Thus Australia were 256-7 instead of 254-8. Valentine had Grout's wicket without further addition to the score: 256-8. Still without addition, an easy chance given by Martin was missed, the batsmen taking a single to bring the scores level. Australia then edged home by two wickets, the winning run being a bye. Australia had scored at only 29 runs per 100 balls. At the death, Mackay scored his 3 not out off 51 balls. Worrell bowled 31 8-ball overs in conceding only 43 runs for his 3 wickets, and Gibbs bowled 41 overs in taking 2/68. Valentine took 3/60 in 21.7 overs.|$|E
25|$|Tembo and Msonthi, {{the only}} two cabinet ministers left, opened the debate by proposing the motion of confidence, but Banda's lengthy speech {{dominated}} it. In this, he claimed that the ministers had conspired against him, because he had preventing them abusing their positions and because they were being controlled by China's ambassador in Dar es Salaam. In response, only Chiume set out any detailed criticism of Banda, the others concentrated on stating their continued loyalty to him, despite being denounced as traitors. Chipembere returned from Canada on 8 September. Banda had written to him, asking him {{to remain in the}} cabinet, but this was before the debate, when Banda was uncertain of what support he had. Chipembere wished to effect a reconciliation between Banda and the ministers, and approached the Governor-General, asking him to request Banda to postpone the debate. However, as {{the first day of the}} debate <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> Banda's favour, he decided against reconciliation and refused a postponement. Chipembere therefore resigned on the morning of 9 September and attended parliament as a back-bencher, sitting with the other ex-ministers. Chipembere's speech deplored the breakdown of party unity and that the ex-ministers had been reviled as traitors. He expressed his general support for their grievances, and although he expressed loyalty to Banda, he pointedly argued that cabinet responsibility should be collective and that there should be consultation on important issues.|$|E
25|$|In the County Championship {{match against}} Sussex at Hove in May, Botham {{came very close}} to his maiden century but was {{dismissed}} for 97, his highest score to date. The match was drawn. At the end of the month, Somerset played Gloucestershire in a remarkable match at Taunton. Batting first, Somerset scored 333 for seven (innings closed) and then, thanks to six for 25 by Botham, bowled out Gloucestershire for only 79. The follow-on was enforced but Gloucestershire proved a much tougher nut to crack second time around. With Zaheer Abbas scoring 141, they made 372 and left Somerset needing 118 to win. Botham took five for 125 in the second innings for a match analysis of 11 for 150, his maiden 10wM. This match ended {{the same way as the}} famous Test at Headingley in 1981 but the boot was on the other foot for Botham here because he was on the team that enforced the follow-on – and lost. Mike Procter and Tony Brown did the damage and bowled Somerset out for 110 in 42 overs, Gloucestershire winning by just eight runs. Botham scored his maiden first-class century at Trent Bridge on Tuesday, 3 August in the County Championship game against Nottinghamshire (Notts) who won the toss and decided to bat first. Derek Randall scored 204* and the Notts innings closed at 364 for 4 (Botham one for 59). Somerset were 52 for one at close of play. On day two, Somerset scored 304 for 8 (innings closed) and Botham, batting at number six, scored 80. At close of play, Notts in their second innings were 107 for four, thus extending their lead to 167 with six wickets standing. On day three, Notts advanced to 240 for nine declared (Botham one for 16), leaving Somerset with a difficult target of 301. At 40 for two and with both their openers gone, Brian Close changed his batting order and summoned Botham to come in at number four. Close himself <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> at three but he was out soon afterwards for 35. With support from Graham Burgess (78), Botham laid into the Notts bowling and scored an impressive 167 not out. Somerset reached 302 for four in only 65 overs and won by six wickets.|$|E

Petter-Bowyer's helicopters spotted the insurgents encamped by a stream beneath some dark, shady trees, leading Strong's 12 Troop, 3 Commando to be brought forward to contact them the following morning. Strong's fresh men were sent into the trees while Pearce was reluctantly forced to withdraw and provide back-up. Strong called back almost immediately after entering, [...] " [...] left about one minute ago – in a hurry. There is abandoned equipment—no time to collect—moving east on tracks."
