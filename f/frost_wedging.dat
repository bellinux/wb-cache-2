40|$|Sedimentary {{structures}} {{formed by}} the progressive primary infilling of thermal contraction cracks with sand are termed primary sand veins and sand wedges. In addition to simple vein- or wedge-shapes irregularities {{can be caused by}} sand veins branching from their sides and toes. Primary sand wedges form widely in sandy polar deserts, locally in sandy areas of tundra and probably in seasonally frozen ground. There are no unique criteria for distinguishing primary sand veins and wedges from sand veins and wedges of other origins. Identification of the former depends on the occurrence of distinctive features not always present and on evaluation of their lithofacies and palaeoenvironmental contexts. Care and caution are advocated in the use of ancient/relict primary sand veins and wedges as quantitative palaeoenvironmental indicators because modern active wedge distribution is poorly known and hence inferred thermal climatic threshold values are questionable. It is suggested that ancient/relict primary sand wedges exceeding 2 m in depth and with well-developed vertical lamination probably indicate the former occurrence of continuous permafrost, whereas sand veins and narrow sand <b>wedges</b> (<b>frost</b> cracks) are potentially ambiguous as they may form not only in the active layer above and within continuous permafrost but also in seasonally frozen ground in non-permafrost areas...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the usefulness of luminescence dating as a tool to establish reliable absolute chronologies for those sediments which provide a record of the earth’s climate, especially during cold and dry periods. This research focused on the sandy infill of <b>frost</b> <b>wedge</b> structures in Flanders and on loess from China. In {{the first part of this}} thesis quartz-based optical dating was used to establish an absolute chronology for these two sediment types. The second part of this thesis focused on testing the ability of two alternative luminescence techniques to date loess samples beyond the quartz optical dating range. The potential of applying quartz SAR OSL dating to the sandy infills of relict sand wedges and composite-wedge pseudomorphs in Flanders (Belgium) was first investigated. Only those wedges that showed evidence of having been, either exclusively or to a very large degree, filled with sand (primary aeolian infill) were selected for optical dating. Based on the luminescence chronology it was concluded that thermal contraction cracking and infilling with aeolian sediment appears to have been commonplace in Flanders during the Late Pleniglacial (MIS 2); more specifically during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~ 23 - 18 ka) and the transition period between the LGM and the start of the Late Glacial (~ 14 ka). This study also revealed the presence of two significantly older wedge levels, with a younger (MIS 3) wedge inset into an older (MIS 6) wedge; this clearly illustrates the often complex lithostratigraphy of periglacial sediments in the Belgium lowland and highlights the risks of misinterpretations of past periglacial processes in the absence of an absolute chronology. High resolution quartz SAR OSL dating was then applied to three sites (Zhongjiacai, Le Du and Tuxiangdao) in the western part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. In total, sixty-two optical dates were obtained ranging from ~ 12 to ~ 75 ka. The age-depth patterns at all three sites revealed that loess accumulation in the western part of the CLP had an episodic character and large variations in sedimentation rate within and between sites have occurred. Moreover, a convincing sedimentary hiatus between ~ 20 and ~ 30 ka was identified at the Tuxiangdao site; this was undetected in previous proxy-record and dating studies and clearly illustrates the importance of high-resolution absolute dating studies for palaeoclimatic research on Chinese loess. Unfortunately, due to the relatively high dose rates (~ 3 Gy/ka) of this material, it would appear that the quartz OSL age range is rather limited, probably up to only ~ 40 - 50 ka (~ 120 - 150 Gy). Another method was thus needed to date older loess succesfully. Two other approaches to luminescence dating, one based on quartz and the other on feldspar, were tested to investigate their potential to extend the age range of the luminescence dating of (Chinese) loess. The reliability of a different single aliquot protocol was tested; this used isothermal thermoluminescence (ITL) signals from quartz. Despite the fact that the shape of the growth curve suggests that much higher doses could be measured than with OSL, it seems that the De values obtained with ITL are overestimates. The protocol employed also failed the dose recovery test, overestimating the dose given prior to any heating; this was explained by a sensitivity change which occurred when the first heat treatment was applied to measure the natural signal. It was shown that one way to circumvent this sensitivity change is to use a multiple aliquot approach (the single aliquot regeneration and added (SARA) dose procedure) in which doses are given prior to the measurement of the ITL signal. The origins and the dosimetric characteristics of the ITL signal were also investigated into more detail for quartz extracted from several other sediments and it was concluded that some initial sensitivity change is common in quartz. The accuracy and precision of IRSL dating using sand-sized K-feldspar grain was tested on an Eemian coastal marine deposit in Denmark, with well-known independent age control (~ 125 - 130 ka). The uncorrected feldspar ages severely underestimated (by ~ 30 %) both the quartz ages and the independent age control. Using a site-averaged fading rate (g value = 3. 66 ± 0. 09 %/decade) to correct the optical ages of all samples provided good agreement between the average fading-corrected K-feldspar age (120 ± 3 ka random uncertainty; ± 6 ka total) and the independent age control (~ 125 - 130 ka); Nevertheless, this result is not considered significantly different from the quartz age (114 ± 4 ka; ± 7 ka total). Because of these encouraging results on a known-age site, it was decided to apply IRSL dating with anomalous fading correction to old (> ~ 70 ka) Chinese loess samples from two sites (Luochuan and Dongchuan) for which quartz OSL was thought to be inappropriate (see above). We showed that anomalous fading of the IRSL signal from polymineral fine-grains extracted from Chinese loess is ubiquitous and an overall average g value for these samples of 3. 10 ± 0. 13 %/decade was obtained. At both sites, the quartz OSL ages are always lower than the fading-corrected IRSL ages; the latter are also in better agreement with the pedostratigraphic age control (~ 75 and ~ 130 ka). Based on a comparison of the quartz OSL ages with the pedostratigraphic age control and the fading-corrected IRSL ages it is concluded that quartz OSL dating of Chinese loess from these sites should be restricted to samples not exceeding ~ 40 - 50 ka (~ 120 - 150 Gy). For IRSL dating using polymineral fine-grains with anomalous fading correction comparison with pedostratigraphic age control would suggest an upper dating limit of probably ~ 100 - 120 ka (up to ~ 300 Gy uncorrected dose). Ages older than this should be considered minimum ages...|$|R
40|$|Investigating {{openwork}} block accumulation has {{the potential}} to further our understanding of rock weathering, the control of geological structure on landforms, the production of substrates for biological colonisation and the impacts of climate change on landform development and dynamics. Various models for the development of these landforms have been proposed. This includes in situ weathering, <b>frost</b> heave and <b>wedging.</b> Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} cold-based ice {{has the potential}} to preserve these features rather than to obliterate them. Blocky deposits are also frequently used as proxy evidence for interpreting palaeoclimates. The morphology and processes acting on a blockfield located on the Northern Buttress of the Vesleskarvet Nunataks, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica (2 °W, 71 °S) were investigated and characterised. Given block dimensions and orientations that closely resembled the parent material and only small differences in aspect related characteristics observed, the blockfield was found to be autochthonous with in situ block production and of a young (Holocene) age. Small differences in rock hardness measurements suggest some form of aspect control on rock weathering. South-facing sides of clasts were found to be the least weathered. In comparison, consistently low rock hardness rebound values for the north-facing aspects suggest that these are the most weathered sides. Additional indicators of weathering, such as flaking and pitting, support analyses conducted for rock hardness rebound values. Solar radiation received, slope gradients and snow cover were found to influence weathering of clasts across the study site. Furthermore, ambient temperatures and wind speed significantly influenced near-surface ground temperatures dynamics. However, the lack of a matrix and paucity of fine material in textural analyses suggest a limited weathering environment. It is suggested that the retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet during the last LGM led to unloading of the surface, causing dilatation and subsequent fracturing of the bedrock along pre-existing joints, leading to in situ clast supply. Subsequent weathering and erosion along other points or lines of weakness then yielded fines and slight edge rounding of clasts...|$|R
50|$|Canyons {{are much}} more common in arid than in wet areas because {{physical}} weathering has a more localized effect in arid zones.

50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>frost</b> <b>wedging,</b> rain also sculpts these hoodoos.

It is this process that rounds {{the edges of}} hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles. Where internal mudstone and siltstone layers interrupt the limestone, you can expect the rock to be more resistant to the chemical weathering because of the comparative lack of limestone. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with {{a special kind of}} magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite, being fortified by the mineral magnesium, dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath it. Rain is also the chief source of erosion (the actual removal of the debris). In the summer, monsoon type rainstorms travel through the Bryce Canyon region bringing short duration high intensity rain.|$|E
50|$|Frost weathering, <b>frost</b> <b>wedging,</b> {{ice wedging}} or cryofracturing is the {{collective}} name for several processes where ice is present. These processes include frost shattering, frost-wedging and freeze-thaw weathering. Severe frost shattering produces huge piles of rock fragments called scree {{which may be}} located {{at the foot of}} mountain areas or along slopes. Frost weathering is common in mountain areas where the temperature is around the freezing point of water. Certain frost-susceptible soils expand or heave upon freezing as a result of water migrating via capillary action to grow ice lenses near the freezing front. This same phenomenon occurs within pore spaces of rocks. The ice accumulations grow larger as they attract liquid water from the surrounding pores. The ice crystal growth weakens the rocks which, in time, break up. It is caused by the approximately 10% (9.87) expansion of ice when water freezes, which can place considerable stress on anything containing the water as it freezes.|$|E
5000|$|All of the {{observed}} ringing rock boulder fields in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey are a form of felsenmeer. Felsenmeer is a German term meaning [...] "sea of rock". These barren block fields occur in periglacial environments where outcrops of resistant rock are exposed with a slope of less than 25°. <b>Frost</b> <b>wedging</b> breaks up the upper portion of the rock formation, and the slight dip of the field allows the fine weathering materials to be flushed away before soil can develop. Often the boulders are lifted and rotated by the accumulation of snow and ice, leaving {{a considerable amount of}} vacant space between them. The felsenmeer boulder fields form in-situ due to the low slope angles. In situations where the slope angles are steeper than 25°.gravity tends to move the boulders downhill to form scree or talus slopes. In fields where the angle is too flat the spaces between the boulders fills with soil and the boulders break down due to weathering.|$|E

This relationship is a balance between the sheer stress exerted on the clast and the normal pressure on the clast by a body of ice. Plucking is increased where there are preexisting fractures in a rock bed. As the glacier slides down a mountain, energy from friction, pressure or geothermal heat causes glacial meltwater to infiltrate the spaces between rocks. This process, known as <b>frost</b> <b>wedging,</b> puts stress on the rock structure as water expands when it freezes. Impacts from large clasts carried in the bedload can cause additional stress to the bedrock. [...] Additionally, plucking {{can be seen as a}} positive feedback system in which the increased action of rock removed from the landscape entrained in the glacier causes larger scale fracturing further down the glacier because of a heavier load of force pushing down on the rock bed.|$|E
