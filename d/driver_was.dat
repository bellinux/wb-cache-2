5|$|Civilian {{return to}} the town was slow, with shops still {{shuttered}} on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting only that two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned when the <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> shot dead.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of December 28, police {{informed}} news sources {{that she had been}} walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a semi-trailer just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit. She died at the scene. It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents' Kings Mill house, before being struck. The highway was closed {{for more than an hour}} after the incident. An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, while Alcorn's body was transported to the Montgomery County coroner, where an autopsy was scheduled. The truck <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> uninjured in the incident.|$|E

5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe the <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1999, a {{tractor-trailer}} {{carrying a}} backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{pre-season}} preparations were {{overshadowed by}} an accident involving Fernando Alonso {{on the final}} day of testing that saw Alonso hospitalised with a concussion and ruled out of the third and final test. Kevin Magnussen, McLaren's test and reserve <b>driver,</b> <b>was</b> drafted in as his replacement for the remainder of the test and the opening round of the season. Alonso later attributed the accident to a steering failure, although McLaren maintained that there was no evidence of a car failure in the telemetry data following the accident.|$|E

5|$|After {{his earlier}} crash Downie retired {{on the third}} lap with a broken wheel, while Thornycroft, who had also had first lap trouble, was forced to stop with a broken rear axle. Over the final two laps a number of cars ran out of fuel, and of the 42 {{starters}} only 18 completed the race. The first car to finish was the Rolls Royce of Percy Northey. He had started twenty minutes ahead of Napier's Arrol-Johnston so Napier had to finish within twenty minutes of Northey in order to win. He did so, passing the finish line eighteen minutes later, having run the fastest lap of the race at the end to win by just over two minutes. Napier's time was 6 hours 9 minutes 14.6 seconds, followed by Northey in 6:11:23 and Norman Littlejohn in a French Vinot-Deguingand, in 6:14:32.4. The three drivers had been consistently the quickest throughout the race and were separated by just over five minutes. The next quickest <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> E. J. C. Roberts in {{the second of the}} Arrol-Johnstons, but he was over 25 minutes behind his victorious team-mate.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{difference was that}} the charioteers themselves, the aurigae, {{were considered to be}} the winners, although they were usually also slaves (as in the Greek world). They received a wreath of laurel leaves, and probably some money; if they won enough races they could buy their freedom. Drivers could become celebrities throughout the Empire simply by surviving, as the life expectancy of a charioteer was not very high. One such celebrity <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> Scorpus, who won over 2000 races before being killed in a collision at the meta when he was about 27 years old. The most famous of all was Gaius Appuleius Diocles who won 1,462 out of 4,257 races. When Diocles retired at the age of 42 after a 24-year career his winnings reportedly totalled 35,863,120 sesterces ($US 15 billion), making him the highest paid sports star in history. The horses, too, could become celebrities, but their life expectancy was also low. The Romans kept detailed statistics of the names, breeds, and pedigrees of famous horses.|$|E

5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} break contact and withdrew after a five-hour battle. Both sides then fell {{back as the}} Viet Cong also dispersed, {{evacuating}} most of their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, under covering fire from the APCs of 2 Troop, B Company boarded the remaining carriers, moving into a night harbour near the landing zone with {{the remainder of the}} battalion at 19:25, as the last of their casualties were extracted by helicopter. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded to pound the abandoned battlefield into the evening. That night the body of the dead APC <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> evacuated by helicopter, as American AC-47 Spooky gunships circled overhead, dropping flares to illuminate the battlefield and strafing likely Viet Cong positions, while F-4 Phantoms dropped napalm. The airstrikes then continued in preparation for a further assault by the Australians planned for the following day. Otherwise there was no further fighting that night, and both sides remained unmolested. Ultimately no attack was made against the Australian base at Nui Dat that night either, while no unusual activity was reported in the area.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a fourth}} CH-21 {{returned}} to Ap Bac {{to attempt to}} rescue the downed helicopter crews, and it too was heavily damaged by ground fire and forced {{to land on the}} muddy rice field. The Viet Cong had set a new record: the battle was the first time they had either destroyed or downed five helicopters within a few hours. At 13:30, Ba's M113 formation finally closed in on the downed helicopters {{on the west side of}} Ap Bac. The M113s approached the landing zone in single file instead of in formation, and they were immediately fired upon by Viet Cong inside the hamlet who were able to concentrate their fire on one target at a time. The South Vietnamese M113 gun crews were exposed from the waist up, so they were easy targets for snipers; by the end of the day, 14 South Vietnamese M113 crewmen had been killed due to their exposure. The two leading M113s were able to pull up beside the downed helicopters, but one <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> killed while driving with his head outside of the hatch, and Ba was knocked unconscious inside his carrier.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was able to compete, after the Ferrari crew was able to change his gearbox in time for the session. Not running was Jenson Button, after his team decided not to go out, since a 55-place grid penalty would have placed him {{at the back of the}} grid at any case. Marcus Ericsson was more than half a second quicker than teammate Felipe Nasr, who failed to proceed into Q2, as did both Manor Marussia drivers. With Button out of the running, just one more <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> eliminated, and that proved to be his McLaren teammate Alonso, who barely missed out on making the cut. At the front, Rosberg set the fastest time ahead of Vettel, while Hamilton was the only driver not to use the soft compound tyre.|$|E
