25|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{powered by}} batteries are another alternative, and these {{have the advantage}} of having the highest well-to-wheels <b>efficiency</b> <b>rate</b> of any energy pathway and thus would allow much greater numbers of vehicles than any other methods. In addition, even if the electricity was sourced from coal-fired power plants, two advantages would remain: first it is cheaper to sequester carbon from a few thousand smokestacks than it is to retrofit hundreds of millions of vehicles, and second encouraging the use of electric vehicles allows a further pathway for scaling up of renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|Green {{vehicles}} {{are intended to}} have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when {{the environmental impact of}} a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle {{this may not be the}} case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce transport CO2 emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, gas, oil) mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO2 than petrol equivalent vehicles. The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission <b>efficiency</b> <b>rate</b> while maintaining a 17cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the <b>efficiency</b> <b>rate</b> of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBuilding energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>rating</b> {{systems have}} been {{established}} worldwide to systematically manage the energy consumption of existing buildings. This study aimed {{to develop a new}} energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>rating</b> system for existing residential buildings from two perspectives: (i) establishment of reasonable and fair criteria for the building energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>rating</b> system; and (ii) establishment of comparative incentive and penalty programs to encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign. Based on the analysis of the conventional energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>rating</b> system for existing residential buildings, this study was conducted in five steps: (i) data collection and analysis; (ii) correlation analysis between the household size and the CO 2 emission density (i. e., CO 2 emission per unit area); (iii) cluster formation based on results of the correlation analysis using a decision tree; (iv) establishment of a new energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>rating</b> system for existing buildings; and (v) establishment of incentive and penalty programs using advanced case-based reasoning. The proposed system can allow a policymaker to establish a reasonable and fair energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>rating</b> system for existing residential buildings and can encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign...|$|R
2500|$|Low efficiency: in general, the {{conversion}} to iPS cells has been incredibly low. For example, {{the rate at}} which somatic cells were reprogrammed into iPS cells in Yamanaka's original mouse study was 0.01–0.1%. The low <b>efficiency</b> <b>rate</b> may reflect the need for precise timing, balance, and absolute levels of expression of the reprogramming genes. It may also suggest a need for rare genetic and/or epigenetic changes in the original somatic cell population or in the prolonged culture. However, recently a path was found for efficient reprogramming which required downregulation of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex. [...] Overexpression of Mbd3, a subunit of NuRD, inhibits induction of iPSCs. Depletion of Mbd3, on the other hand, improves reprogramming efficiency, [...] that results in deterministic and synchronized iPS cell reprogramming (near 100% efficiency within seven days from mouse and human cells).|$|E
