The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E

The Award stated:For the past 30 years, the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been the bulwark against, and the main target of, a {{sustained}} and brutal terrorism campaign. The Force has suffered heavily in protecting {{both sides of the}} community from danger – 302 officers {{have been killed in the}} line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously. Many officers have been ostracised by their own community and others have been forced to leave their homes in the face of threats to them and their families. As Northern Ireland reaches a turning point in its political development this award is made to recognise the collective courage and dedication to duty of all of those who have served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and who have accepted the danger and stress this <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> them and to their families.|$|E

25|$|The refoundation is {{what lies}} behind an {{exceptionally}} elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar {{is presented as}} granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, {{such as the one}} granted by Coenwulf. The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. Simon Keynes in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called Orthodoxorum group of charters, so named after the initial word of their proem, which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of Æthelred II's reign. Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters. More recently, Peter Stokes <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced {{to make up for the}} loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in c. 1002 (see below).|$|E

500|$|The general {{critical}} reception was warmly enthusiastic. Felix Aprahamian in The Sunday Times {{called the}} performance [...] "a curiously moving spiritual and musical experience". Eric Roseberry, writing in Tempo magazine, found the music [...] "simple and memorably tuneful throughout... the writing for strings, recorders and percussion {{is a miracle}} of inspiration". Andrew Porter in Opera magazine [...] also found the music touched [...] "by high inspiration"; the evening was [...] "an unforgettable experience... extraordinarily beautiful, vivid and charming, and often deeply moving". The design and production, Porter reported, were [...] "brilliant", while Mackerras commanded his disparate forces masterfully. Several critics remarked favourably on {{the sound of the}} handbells. The Timess critic noted the effectiveness of Britten's setting of the mystery play: [...] "It is Britten's triumph that in this musically slender piece he <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> new life the mentality of another century by wholly modern means. These means included a miscellaneous orchestra such as he alone could conceive and handle".|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s the {{so-called}} modern synthesis connected natural selection and population genetics, based on Mendelian inheritance, into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis explained patterns observed across species in populations, through fossil transitions in palaeontology, and complex cellular mechanisms in developmental biology. The {{publication of the}} structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance. Molecular biology improved our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Advancements were also made in phylogenetic systematics, mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of evolutionary trees. In 1973, evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky penned that [...] "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution," [...] because it <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent explanatory body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet.|$|E
500|$|The English {{version of}} First Departure {{received}} mixed to average reviews, earning a 77% rating on GameRankings and a 74 out of 100 average from Metacritic. Many reviewers felt {{that despite the}} updated graphics and sound, the game still felt less refined than more modern role-playing games. IGN found the game to have a [...] "bland, awkwardly-told narrative" [...] with [...] "weak characters", but that it would appeal to fans of older games, stating [...] "If {{you can look at}} First Departure and understand that it's based on a very old title, you'll likely be able to overlook the problems and get a fair amount of satisfaction". GameSpot also stated that the title had [...] "limited appeal" [...] in addition to providing little challenge. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, called First Departure an [...] "overlooked classic" [...] with [...] "ridiculously engrossing crafting minutiae" [...] and numerous character party combinations that increase its replay value. GameSpy would additionally declare that [...] "Despite a couple of minor hitches, Star Ocean: First Departure {{is one of the best}} remakes Square Enix <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> portable consoles." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the banquet, the Globe {{published}} an interview with “Hike”’s high school football coach, Robert Reihsen. On the day of the banquet, the Bessemer Herald ran an editorial urging the city of Ramsay to name a street or park in Heikkinen’s honor: “Ramsay has never received the national publicity that its native son, Ralph Heikkinen, <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> it this fall. By newspapers, magazines and radio the Gogebic range’s first All-American football star has brought renown to himself, his home town and his school. If Ramsay has any street, public building, park or athletic field, that are now without title, or the names of which can be changed, why not dedicate something to Ralph Heikkinen who has so nobly proved himself to be Bessemer township’s leading citizen for 1938? Other communities have done as much for their heroes. As far as the University of Michigan is concerned Heikkinen has already written his name forever on the athletic scroll of honor. He takes his place with a long line of All-American Wolverines. They are never forgotten at the Ann Arbor institution.” ...|$|E

Rita Zekas of the Toronto Star also {{recommended the}} book as a Father's Day gift. Kerry J. Byrne noted that the book covers [...] "everything from bacon-curing methods to bacon blogs" [...] and includes [...] "easy recipes". Publishers Weekly reviewed called the book a [...] "voluminous look at all things bacon"; the review concluded, [...] "Readers who, like Lauer, possess a borderline-obsessive love for bacon are likely to embrace this as their new Bible, but anyone else will quickly get their fill." [...] Rachel Forrest of The Portsmouth Herald recommended the book in her [...] "Annual Summer Reading List for Foodies". [...] "Another of my favorites this year is 'Bacon: A Love Story: A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat' by Heather Lauer. A book all about bacon... she profiles chefs that use it, odd finds across the nation and plenty of recipes," [...] commented Forrest.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Systematic Chaos was generally positive. Writing for MetalReview.com, Jon Eardley called the album, [...] "another solid outing". He complimented Petrucci for [...] "Constant Motion", writing that it contains [...] "some {{of the best}} riffs Petrucci <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the table". In addition, he called {{the latter part of}} [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] "the most brutal part in any song to date". Reviewing for Metal Invader, Nikos Patelis called the album, [...] "energetic, sharp– edged, full of beautiful melodies and heavy riffs, long epic compositions". He called Dream Theater's instrumentalists [...] "four masters of music that use their instruments as if they were their limbs", in addition to stating, [...] "James LaBrie sounds more mature than ever". In conclusion, Patelis called Systematic Chaos, [...] "an excellent album that needs many times to be listened in order to be digested". Greg Prato, of AllMusic, wrote [...] " [...] 'Forsaken' proves wrong those who say that Dream Theater is all about instrumental gymnastics and not songwriting". He also compared riffs in [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] to the band Pantera. Overall, he states [...] " [...] the quintet sticks to the prog metal game plan that they've followed since their inception". Reviewer Chad Bowar of About.com, wrote that [...] "In the Presence of Enemies - Part I" [...] is [...] "an effective way to {{set the tone for the}} rest of the songs". Overall, Bowar gave the album four out of five stars, calling it, [...] "one of the best Dream Theater releases in quite a while".|$|E
500|$|According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "after all {{the nuances}} Madonna <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> {{the role of}} the bad girl, it's strange that she would settle now for such a restricted, unexamined version of respectability" [...] and [...] "for the first time, Madonna has let the deal dictate the music". Tan Gim Ean from New Straits Times noted that Madonna played against her {{strengths}} on the songs of the album. He described her vocals as [...] "competent", but felt that the songs required [...] "more range and agility than Madonna has at her disposal." [...] Dave Tianen from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the album as a [...] "mixed bag of period pieces, some of them too cute for their own good", adding that [...] "I'm Breathless never becomes {{more than the sum of}} its mannerisms". AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that the songs are just [...] "cutesy novelty numbers", and listing [...] "Vogue" [...] as a standout track. Rooksby panned the album, saying that it [...] "failed to transcend the sterile, preserved-in-amber quality of pastiche". Mark Cooper from Q magazine lamented, in its June 1990 review, [...] "It's something of a disappointment because the lady herself stays so firmly committed to a character who's less original than the persona she evolved during the '80s." [...] Nonetheless, in the same magazine's December 1994 issue, Madonna declared: [...] "I would have to say the favorite record that I've made is the soundtrack to Dick Tracy. I love every one of those songs... My judgment is never based on the world's reaction." ...|$|E
