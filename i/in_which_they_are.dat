The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|Set {{pieces in}} Noh {{such as the}} boats, wells, altars, and bells, are {{typically}} carried onto the stage {{before the beginning of}} the act <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> needed. These props normally are only outlines to suggest actual objects, although the great bell, a perennial exception to most Noh rules for props, is designed to conceal the actor and to allow a costume change during the kyōgen interlude.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> capable of reproducing.|$|E

Some divisions, such as the 1st Cavalry Division, are listed in multiple eras, as their organizations were drastically changed from one era to the next. Many divisions overlap the years listed in the era categories, mainly due to the slow pace <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> deactivated, inactivated, or otherwise disbanded.|$|R

Stromberg plans to destroy Moscow and New York, triggering nuclear war: he planned to then establish a new civilisation. Bond escapes, freeing the submariners captured from the other submarines and follows Stromberg to his headquarters, where he shoots the tycoon and a torpedo destroys the base.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Elihu Root, Austen Chamberlain, Charles G. Dawes, Frank B. Kellogg, and Norman Angell {{were all}} awarded their {{respective}} Prizes one year late because the Committee decided {{that none of}} the nominations in the year <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> listed as being awarded the Prize met the criteria in Nobel's will; per its rules the Committee delayed the awarding of the Prizes until the next year, although they were awarded as the previous year's Prize.|$|E

5|$|In May 2015, Josh Boone {{was hired}} to direct and write a film {{adaptation}} of The New Mutants comic-book series. Acting as a spin-off to the X-Men films, it is co-written by Knate Gwaltney, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber with Donner and Kinberg producing. By March 2017, pre-production had officially started. Boone said {{it will be a}} horror film involving the young mutants escaping a facility <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being held against their will. Filming commenced in July 2017 in Boston for an April 13, 2018 release.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to entertainment and artistic merit, LARP events may be designed for educational or political purposes. For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes can be taught by immersing students in a role-playing scenario <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> forced to improvise speech or writing in the language they are learning. Politically themed LARP events may attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E

Logan (Jason Dohring) beats up Piz, thinking that he posted it.

We analysed design protocols of six expert architects working {{on two different}} design problems under two different conditions, one <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> blindfolded and one <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sketching. Architects developed design ideas efficiently when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> blindfolded, {{as opposed to the}} common view that they would better develop ideas with sketching...|$|R

5|$|Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action-platformer that shares many {{similarities}} {{with its}} NES counterparts. The player, as Mega Man, {{is able to}} choose among four stages to complete in whatever order desired. Each stage contains various enemies to blast through and obstacles to overcome, such as leaping between disappearing blocks over deadly spikes and bottomless pits. Mega Man's primary weapon is an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's health or extra lives. At {{the end of every}} stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon. Each boss is weak to another's weapon, allowing the player to strategize the order <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> beaten.|$|E

5|$|Sesame Street {{international}} co-productions are educational children's {{television series}} {{based on the}} American Sesame Street but tailored to the countries <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> produced. Shortly after the debut of Sesame Street in the United States in 1969, television producers, teachers, and officials of several countries approached the show's producers and the executives of Sesame Workshop (2000-present) {{about the possibility of}} airing international versions of Sesame Street. Creator Joan Ganz Cooney hired former CBS executive Michael Dann to field offers to produce versions of the show in other countries.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stage}} {{involves}} 12 clubs {{in a series}} of two-legged knockout ties. The six survivors join 26 clubs in the second stage, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> divided into eight groups of four. The teams in each group play in a double round-robin format, with each team playing home and away games against every other team in their group. The top two teams from each group are then drawn into the knockout stage, which consists of two-legged knockout ties. From that point, the competition proceeds with two-legged knockout ties to quarterfinals, semifinals, and the finals. Between 1960 and 1987 the previous winners did not enter the competition until the semifinal stage, making it much easier to retain the cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies. Their value {{is reflected in}} their positioning in contemporary inventories, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> typically found {{at the top of}} the record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. Charles V of France had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white.
