Brian Zoromski of IGN rated [...] "Back from Vacation" [...] 9.7/10, {{an indication of}} an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. Stated highlights included the opening sequence, Carell's performance, and Pam's storyline with Jim and Karen. Zoromski concluded in his review that [...] "with so much attention to detail, realistic character reactions, and very few completely over-the-top comedy moments, 'Back from Vacation' {{is one of the}} best Office episodes yet this season.

500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish you <b>had,</b> <b>you</b> go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..." [...] Views on one, the early-in-show, eight-minute [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] – one of the few new material centerpieces – varied considerably.|$|E
500|$|Seattle Weeklys Joe Williams {{enjoyed the}} song, writing [...] "even with the slow, {{bubbling}} beat and energetic keyboards, topped with top-notch delivery by Jay and Kay, it's Redding {{in the background}} that gives the single its true life and flair." [...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! magazine commented that [...] "if the over-the-top aggression of [...] "H•A•M" [...] <b>had</b> <b>you</b> worried {{that this would be}} a Waka Flocka ripoff, fear not, as [...] "Otis" [...] makes the most of its Otis Redding sample with some soulful feel-good boom-bap." [...] Sam Gould The Independent remarked [...] "having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere, Eminem and old partner-in-crime Royce da 5'9" [...] start work on their own bruising , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y take steps in the same direction, Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged, and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast." [...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there. Not only do they not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't. There was that first line of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 'I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago,' and then, the relief after it, where you didn't have to worry about the rest of that album", and Billboard claimed [...] "Otis gets better with each play".|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... <b>Had</b> <b>you</b> chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1537 Elizabeth, Lady Ughtred {{had written}} to Thomas Cromwell from York to seek his favour in {{acquiring}} one of the soon-to-be dissolved monasteries.

The opportunity was not lost on Cromwell and he proposed instead that she marry his son and heir, Gregory. By June it appears that Cromwell's offer had been accepted, although Gregory had not been her only suitor.
