5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as bishop Foliot served for many years as a papal judge-delegate, {{especially}} in his later years. He was active in both of his dioceses in supporting his cathedral chapters and other religious houses of the dioceses. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> constant contact with his archdeacons and deans about {{the administration of the}} dioceses. He also gathered about himself a group of clerks who compiled a collection of decretals known as the Belvoir collection. This collection mainly relates to Foliot's activities at London, and probably dates to before 1175.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E

5|$|McKellar {{was also}} a keen fitness enthusiast and, despite his short stature, built up a great {{physical}} strength. Though he enjoyed wine and smoked the occasional pipe or cigar <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> peak physical shape until his death. Even {{at the height of}} the Battle of Britain he was always clean shaven and immaculately dressed. McKellar's spare time was used reading about sport and First World War fighter pilots. His interest in the flying personalities of the past spurred him to take up flying. He joined at his own expense the Scottish Flying Club, which had been founded in 1927; it leased and managed Renfrew Airport from 1933 until it was requisitioned during the Second World War. McKellar quickly acquired a pilot's licence. By the time he began his military career, McKellar was a very experienced pilot, and he soon began earning relatively quick promotions.|$|E
5|$|In East Anglia, Rædwald's {{conversion}} was {{not universally}} accepted by his household {{or his own}} queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from {{his commitment to the}} Christian faith. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the temple two altars, one pagan and another dedicated to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of Rædwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the regio of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke explains the dual nature of the temple by suggesting that Rædwald would have been unprepared to reject his old religion and fully embrace Christianity, as this act would have been a public acknowledgment of his inferiority to Æthelberht. Rædwald's lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.|$|E
5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E

25|$|Until 1935 {{he lived}} at Killermont, his Arts and Crafts house at Rowledge, Surrey. He then {{purchased}} {{a much smaller}} cottage, Woodhall Cottage on Woodhall Road, in Colinton, Edinburgh. Although <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> touch with developments in the Burnet Tait & Lorne office, he was unhappy in retirement. He died at home on 2 July 1938. His remains were cremated and his ashes were buried in his father-in-law's plot at Warriston Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|McGuinty {{replaced}} many of {{his young}} staff with experienced political professionals he recruited. The three <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> key positions were Don Guy, his campaign manager and a pollster with Pollara, Matt Maychak, his director of communications, and Bob Lopinski, his director of issues management. To develop his platform, he added to this a new chief of staff, Phil Dewan, a former policy director for Premier David Peterson and Ottawa veteran Gerald M. Butts. He also sought out Peterson-era Ontario Minister of Labour Greg Sorbara {{to run for president}} of the Ontario Liberal Party.|$|E

In 1930 the {{national}} convention included delegates from Stuttgart, Rostock, Hamburg, Schwerin, Karlsruhe, Göppingen, Bissingen, and from Vienna. The 1931 national assembly included four women and five men. In 1935 Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, re-organized the German community to cover Austria as well so they shared a regional national assembly.|$|E
25|$|His last book, Relics of an Un-Common Attorney, a {{collection}} of his later writings, was published posthumously by his friend Richenda Scott, while Hitchin Historical Society have been awarding the Reginald Hine Award since 1979. An embroidery <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> his home is now on display in his memory at St Vincent's church in Newnham, where he was born. Hine Way in Hitchin is named after him, while a small garden with an inset portrait plaque is dedicated to his memory in Lower Tilehouse Street in Hitchin. His biography, The Ghosts of Reginald Hine: An Uncommon Attorney by Richard Whitmore, was published in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the recurring motif of screaming mouths in many Bacons of the late 1940s and early 1950s was drawn {{from a number of}} sources, including medical text books, the works of Matthias Grünewald and photographic stills of the nurse in the Odessa Steps scene in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent The Battleship Potemkin. Bacon saw the film in 1935, and viewed it frequently thereafter. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> his studio a photographic still of the scene, showing a close-up of the nurse's head screaming in panic and terror and with broken pince-nez spectacles hanging from her blood-stained face. He referred to the image throughout his career, using it as a source of inspiration.|$|E

25|$|At Bathurst, Rutherford {{became a}} member of the council, had a term as mayor in 1868, and was {{treasurer}} to the Agricultural Society for 30 years. He encouraged the planting of trees in the town, and exercised an open-handed philanthropy. During his long period as governing-director of Cobb and Co., <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> touch with his large station-properties, riding large distances as a young man, and later often travelling in a kind of Cape cart. Even in his eighties he continued the supervision of his stations, and he died at Mackay, Queensland, on 13 September 1911, when returning from a visit to one of them. He left a widow, five sons, and five daughters.|$|E
25|$|The Llanstephan Collection of manuscripts was {{donated to}} the National Library of Wales by Sir John Williams in 1909. It had been his {{personal}} collection, which <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the library of his home, Llanstephan mansion, Carmarthenshire. The collection is composed of the 154 manuscripts which had belonged to Moses Williams (1685–1742), that were purchased from Shirburn Castle, Oxfordshire and other manuscripts of diverse origins collected by Sir John. Medieval Welsh prose is well represented in the Shirburn Castle collection, with chronicles, legends, fables, theological tracts and collections of works by eminent poets of the period. These manuscripts include a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia from the 13th century, the Gutun Owain Manuscript and the Red Book of Talgarth.|$|E
25|$|His last {{hiding place}} {{was in an}} {{apartment}} with his university friend Lion Nordheim, his wife Jeanne, and her sister Trusha van Amerongen. In {{the course of his}} hiding <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> touch with the scientific community through visits at his hiding place by Hendrik Anthony Kramers and Lambertus Broer. Jeanne and Trusha had blond hair and blue eyes and ventured out in public as non-Jews, while Lion and Pais hid in the apartment. In March 1945, however, they were betrayed and all four were arrested. The same week the Americans had crossed the Rhine and cut the rail lines, making impossible their transfer to a concentration camp. The women were soon released. After a month of interrogation by the Gestapo, Pais was released several days {{before the end of the}} war. Nordheim was executed ten days before the end of the war.|$|E

25|$|In 1951 {{he married}} the {{physiotherapist}} Astrid E. Kruse Andersen (born 1926). After a Research Fellowship at Yale University under Richard Foster Flint in 1954–1956, Andersen {{was a professor}} of Quaternary geology at the University of Oslo from 1956 to 1970, then at the University of Bergen from 1970 to 1982. Then {{he returned to the}} University of Oslo and worked there for 9 years until retirement. He headed the geological institutes both in Oslo and Bergen. He was responsible for the geological education of more than 30 year groups of students, and he continued to participate in academic society until autumn 2011, when he had developed cancer and was in poor health. Andersen was a sought after lecturer and was acclaimed by his students, some of whom <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> contact with until his death in January 2012.|$|E
25|$|After Krishna Varma's departure, the {{organisation}} {{found a new}} leader in Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, a law student who had first arrived in London in 1906 on scholarship from Krishna Varma. Savarkar was an admirer of the Italian nationalist philosopher Giuseppe Mazzini and a protégé of the Indian Congress leader, Bal Gangadhar Tilak. He {{was associated with the}} nationalist movement in India, having founded the Abhinav Bharat Society (Young India Society) in 1906 while studying at Fergusson College in Pune (these links put him in contact with the still largely unknown Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.) In London, Savarkar's fiery nationalist views had at first alienated the residents of India House, most significantly V.V.S. Aiyar. Over time, however, he became a central figure in {{the organisation}}. He devoted his efforts to writing nationalist material, organising public meetings and demonstrations, and establishing branches of Abhinav Bharat in the country. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> touch with B.G. Tilak in India, to whom he passed on manuals on bomb-making.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E
50|$|Cooke {{was born}} at Wirksworth and played cricket for Grimsby in 1873.
