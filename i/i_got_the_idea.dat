Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E

[...] The shows inspired Lytle to consider reactivating Grandaddy on a more permanent basis and to record a new studio album: [...] "I think because 2012 reunion was so brief—it was just, like, two weeks of all these festivals — that I could wrap my head around everything that was happening. We had our old crew with us and we had some cool vacation time that went along with it. It was just like, 'Alright, let’s just see what happens.' Maybe, subconsciously, something got planted in my head at that point. Right now it’s still an experiment, y’know?

60|$|P. S.--Among many curiosities I have {{unearthed}} one. It was a Face on the steamer--a face above {{a pointed}} straw-coloured beard, a face with thin lips and eloquent eyes. We conversed, and presently <b>I</b> <b>got</b> at <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of <b>the</b> Face. It was, though it lived {{for nine months}} {{of the year in the}} wilds of Alaska and British Columbia, an authority on the canon law of the Church of England--a zealous and bitter upholder of the supremacy of the aforesaid Church. Into my amazed ears, as the steamer plodded through the reflections of the stars, it poured the battle-cry of the Church Militant here on earth, and put forward as a foul injustice that in the prisons of British Columbia the Protestant chaplain did not always belong to the Church. The Face had no official connection with the august body, and by force of his life very seldom attended service.|$|R

In an interview with disco-disco.com, Holloway later recalled the song when speaking of her 1992 single [...] "Strong Enough". She said [...] "Strong Enough" [...] was a good song. We put a lot of energy and feelings into that song and really it was co-writers Yvonne Turner's idea... I had told her; 'Everybody's always sampling my voice and everything.' And I was like; 'Maybe we should sample something of mine?'. She said; 'No, just take something from the song', and she was saying; 'Just like, you know, certain parts of it that's like 'Strong Enough'.'

He wore a thick gold ring on the finger of one hand, and although he spoke good English, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> somehow that he was either a foreigner or had lived abroad.

There was a judge in the opening who was very funny, and he dropped out of the picture, and I decided to bring him back.

[...] It was all very mysterious and unfathomable, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the Wieroo were creatures of imagination--the demons or gods of her race, omniscient and omnipresent. This led me to assume that the Galus had a religious sense, and further questioning brought out the fact that such was the case. Ajor spoke in tones of reverence of Luata, the god of heat and life. The word is derived from two others: Lua, meaning sun, and ata, meaning variously eggs, life, young, and reproduction. She told me that they worshiped Luata in several forms, as fire, the sun, eggs and other material objects which suggested heat and reproduction.|$|E

The old man wouldn't understood. Besides, there was the young lady herself, and she seemed so forlorn and helpless that I kind of pitied her. I thought, What if it was one of my own girls? And I made up my mind that she shouldn't know from anything I said or did that she wasn't just as much at home and just as much in place on my ship as she would be in my house.

Nowadays this activity has been completely computerized and it probably takes only a few hours to print out the predictions of this kind of unified theory as an article in the desired format. TGD is something different and I am not ashamed to confess that I have devoted the last 32 years of my life to this enterprise and am still unable to write <b>The</b> Rules. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> basic <b>idea</b> of Topological Geometrodynamics (TGD) during autumn 1978, perhaps it was October. What I realized was that the representability of physical space-times as 4 -dimensional surfaces of some higher-dimensional space-time obtained by replacing the points of Minkowski space with some very small compact internal space could resolve the conceptual difficulties of general relativity related to the definition of the notion of energy. This belief was too optimistic and only with the advent of what I call zero energy ontology the understanding of the notion of Poincare invariance has become satisfactory...|$|R
2500|$|Harris holds nuanced {{views about}} Israel and Judaism. He has said, [...] "I don't think Israel should {{exist as a}} Jewish state.
