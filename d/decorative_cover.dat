The space has been redeveloped {{as part of}} the larger CityScape office and retail project; large portions of the park were demolished as of the spring of 2009. Before the CityScape project broke ground in the fall of 2007, Patriots Square Park was a 2.5 acre (1 hectare) mixed-use park containing open space, an outdoor performing arts stage, and food concessions. The park also served as a <b>decorative</b> <b>cover</b> for a public parking structure located underground which still remains and is in use.|$|E

5000|$|From George Washington's 1799 will, Martha Parke Custis Peter, {{received}} $8,000 (equivalent to $ {{in present-day}} terms). From Martha Washington's will, Martha Parke Custis Peter inherited 90 enslaved people. Her husband, Thomas Peter, {{may have used}} her $8,000 inheritance as well as money gained from selling many of the enslaved people Martha inherited in order to purchase the property that would become Tudor Place in 1805. They contracted with Dr. William Thornton, who also designed the United States Capitol as well as The Octagon House, to design Tudor Place. The decorations included four chair-cushions embroidered by Martha Washington in 1801 [...] "executed upon coarse canvas in a design of shells, done in brown and yellow wools, the highlights being flecked in gold-colored silk" [...] {{as well as a}} <b>decorative</b> <b>cover</b> for a bed whose trimmings also were embroidered by Martha Washington.|$|E
5000|$|A dance card [...] or {{programme}} du bal (also {{known by}} its German-language name, Tanzkarte) is used by a woman to record {{the names of the}} gentlemen with whom she intends to dance each successive dance at a formal ball.They appear to have originated in the 18th century, but their use first became widespread in 19th century Vienna, especially at the massive balls during Fasching before Lent. An actual dance card is typically a booklet with a <b>decorative</b> <b>cover,</b> listing dance titles, composers, and the person with whom the woman intended to dance. Typically, it would have a cover indicating the sponsoring organization of the ball and a decorative cord by which it could be attached to a lady's wrist or ball gown. From the 19th century until World War I, dance cards for the elite of Austria-Hungary were often very elaborate, with some even incorporating precious metals and jewels.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project investigates {{the influence of}} decoration and decorating on a fashion design practice, exploring the transformative effects of both in relation to surface and structure. Decoration is considered an after-effect, {{something that can be}} differentiated from the object it adheres to, sometimes making it superfluous to the object’s function. This project considers decoration as having its own function – the ability, through its link to the ‘exterior’ world, to transform the shape, appearance and context of materials and objects by modifying their façade. It is proposed that the act of decorating organises singular and disparate elements and transforms them into a whole which within the framework of this research is the garment. Gottfried Semper’s theories underpin this project. He proposes that it is the <b>decorative</b> <b>cover,</b> and not the hidden structure, which expresses the purpose, the nature and the origin of the object, and that the object itself results from the primeval urge to create order through decorating. In the practical experiments pursued as part of this project, these ideas are tested by investigating various examples of lace. Lace is regarded not only as a <b>decorative</b> <b>cover</b> but also symbolic of the act of decorating itself, in the manner by which it takes individual elements to create a unified whole, a characteristic embedded in its process of manufacture, with bobbin lace an example. In response to the initial investigations into decoration, ideas of replication, individualisation and transformation, are explored, in both the practical experiments and in the text, through an analogy between the decorated cake and the clothed body and decorated garment. This is contextualised against the writings of Robin Boyd, who expresses contempt at the act of changing the shape and appearance of manufactured objects through decoration, a process he terms Featurism. The findings of this research propose that decoration and decorating can inform fashion design practice. Decoration can be adjunct to the surface or structure of garments but it need not be a secondary consideration, and ultimately it is decoration and decorating that can be the catalyst in the design process either by representing an idea or through analysing its methods of manufacture to inform ways in which disparate elements can be combined to create a singular outcome...|$|E
40|$|Low {{pressure}} {{hot water}} radiators {{are the most}} popular type of heat emitter used in UK buildings. Because of high surface temperatures, or for aesthetic reasons, radiators are often encased in some form of architectural casing which reduces their output. An alternative method of reducing surface touch temperature and enhancing the appearance of radiators may be achieved by using decorative covers. This research examines how the heat output from a radiator is affected by the application of an innovative magnetic <b>decorative</b> <b>cover</b> to the radiator surface. A series of tests was run which compared the heat output from a bare radiator, to the output when the radiator is installed (a) under a magnetic cover, and (b) within a traditional wooden cover. Since the heat output from a radiator is by convection and radiation, thermocouples were located on radiator and supporting wall surfaces, {{as well as in the}} air spaces around the radiator. By this means the temperature differences which drive both heat transfer mechanisms could be determined. Additionally, temperatures were also monitored by a thermal imaging camera. The scenario tests were carried out under steady state conditions at closed room space, with controlled room temperature. Results from the tests showed that magnetically applied radiator covers efficiency increased by 13 - 20 % relative to traditional radiator wooden cover. In terms of space-heating, this can reduce energy input needed to achieve comfort temperature. This demonstrates that magnetic radiator covers can offer improved heating system energy performance.

5000|$|Belt buckles {{became more}} popular as fashion {{accessories}} {{in the early}} 20th century, as the tops of trousers moved more toward the waist. [...] "Western-style" [...] belt buckles were largely popularized by cowboy movies in the United States and are often awarded to winners in rodeo events as prize medals or trophies, a custom later adopted by the Western States Endurance Run {{and a few other}} ultra-marathons. The large, flat surface of the western-style belt buckles make them a popular ornament or style of jewelry. Decorative [...] "buckle sets" [...] may contain a metal buckle, one or more matching loops which sit next to the buckle and a metal tip for the opposite, [...] "tongue" [...] end of the belt. [...] "Belt plates" [...] may be <b>decorative</b> <b>covers</b> for a plain buckle or other decorative fittings affixed to the belt itself, similar to [...] "conchos" [...] (from a Spanish word for [...] "shell").
