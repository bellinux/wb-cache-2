5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b> Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

No significant difference between <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> was seen, but a mild prevalence of the foot over the hand was suggested by a cumulative analysis of our results.

Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b> It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E
5|$|Several twentieth-century writers {{explored}} {{possibilities of}} wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> called Wheelers. Their wheels {{are composed of}} keratin, which has been suggested by biologists {{as a means of}} avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E
5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> with extended pads on the digits, {{as well as}} claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E

Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> related to nerve injury.

5|$|After the kidnapping, {{the couple}} were beaten. Babli's brother Suresh forced her to consume pesticide, while four other family members pushed Manoj to the ground, her uncle Rajinder pulling a noose around Manoj's neck and {{strangling}} {{him in front of}} Babli. They wrapped the bodies in gunny sacks and dumped them in Barwala Link Canal in Hisar district. On 23 June, nine days later, their mutilated bodies, <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> tied, were fished out of the canal by Kheri Chowki police. After autopsy, police preserved Manoj's shirt and Babli's anklet and cremated the bodies as unclaimed on 24 June. On 1 July the family identified them by the remnants of their clothing. The accused were subsequently arrested.|$|E
5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E

5|$|During the Postclassic period, {{the most}} common form of human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b> The officiating priest would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolized the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Ecnomiohyla rabborum, {{commonly}} known as Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog, is an extinct species of frog in the family Hylidae. They were relatively large frogs that inhabited the forest canopies of central Panama. Like {{other members of the}} genus Ecnomiohyla, they were capable of gliding by spreading their enormous and fully webbed <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> during descent. The males of the species were highly territorial and would guard water-filled tree holes used for breeding. They were also the ones responsible for guarding and caring for the young, including providing food. They were the only known species of frog where the tadpoles derived nutrition by feeding on the skin cells of their fathers.|$|E
5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E

The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche' people.|$|E
