50|$|The FJR1300AE/AS {{model has}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>clutch,</b> which Yamaha calls YCC-S. There is no clutch lever on this model. Instead, the YCC-S system allows the rider to shift using {{a set of}} {{manually}} operated push buttons on the left handlebar or via the standard gear shift lever. The <b>electronic</b> <b>clutch</b> is controlled by an internal computer, allowing gear shifts to complete in approximately 0.2 seconds. The gearbox pattern is also unconventional in that neutral {{is at the bottom}} end of the range, otherwise the gearbox is identical to the A model. The ECU automatically controls the <b>electronic</b> <b>clutch</b> and ignition timing to ensure smooth gear shifting and will actuate the clutch at standstill. Stalling the engine is not normally possible.|$|E
50|$|The E mode {{functions}} as the D gear {{in a full}} automatic car. Via the onboard computer and <b>electronic</b> <b>clutch,</b> the car automatically selects the appropriate gear based on speed and gradient information. An MMT car limits the highest gear selectable, if the gradient is steep.|$|E
5000|$|Selespeed is {{the name}} of an {{electrohydraulic}} manual transmission used in Alfa Romeo cars, developed by Italian company Magneti Marelli. The Selespeed is a robotized manual gearbox with <b>electronic</b> <b>clutch.</b> In its current incarnation it can be operated via paddle shifters from the steering wheel or via a [...] "joystick" [...] like a sequential manual gearbox. The right-hand paddle shifter shifts upwards and the left side downwards. The gearbox also has a city-mode which self-shifts {{in a manner similar to}} a traditional automatic gearbox.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} Ford {{automatic}} to use an EEC-controlled torque converter lock-up <b>clutch.</b> <b>Electronic</b> shift control for the 3-4 shift was later added, another first, though other gears remained hydraulic.|$|R
50|$|Gliding is an {{energy-efficient}} driving operating mode of a motor vehicle, turning off the internal combustion engine when driving to save fuel. Coasting is disengaging the engine from the wheels in idle mode by disengaging the clutch or setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position, using the accelerated kinetic energy to keep the vehicle going, but lose speed {{to the existing}} drag. In hybrid electric vehicles this functionality {{is part of the}} concept and performed automatically by the engine controller. Vehicles with a conventional internal combustion engine, coasting can be performed manually, gliding when having a gear box. It is illegal in some states. An extra button to stop the engine was shown in 1979 on International Motor Show Germany, but newer standard in any vehicle. A so-called eClutch (<b>electronic</b> controlled <b>clutch)</b> uses an actuator to disengage the clutch when the driver leaved the accelerator.|$|R

50|$|In general, New Process {{transfer}} {{cases are}} identified by a three-digit code. The first digit (1 or 2) determines {{the number of}} gear ranges. The second digit is a series number that reflects design, and provides minimal information about torque handling. For example, if the second digit is a 1, there is no two-wheel-drive option; {{if it is a}} 2, 2WD is available. Other numbers have similar meanings. The third digit indicates differential type: 1 means locked (no differential), 2 means open, 3 means electric locked, 4 and 5 both indicate an asymmetrical torque split planetary gear and gear drive, 6 means an <b>electronic</b> <b>clutch</b> pack, 7 means a hydraulic clutch pack (except for the unique 207), and 9 means a viscous coupler.|$|E
5000|$|The D11R and D11R Carrydozer were {{introduced}} at the Las Vegas, Nevada at MINExpo International 1996. Both were [...] {{and that would}} be increased to [...] later in 1997. Other improvements made to the D11R were Fingertip Controls and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Clutch</b> and Brakes. The Finger Tip Controls (FTC) allowed the D11R to be steered with a single lever (joystick) on the left hand side. The D11R now weighed 230935 lb. The Carrydozer version has a special blade with a curvature that allowed 57 yd to be pushed. The [...] "Carrydozer" [...] had the structure strengthened considerably for the extra weight and much bigger blade that it carried up front. Both D11Rs received a new Caterpillar 3508B EUI diesel engine with electronic controls at 915 gross hp. The Carrydozer versions weight is just over 120 tons at 248,600 pounds. According to Caterpillar by the year 2000 over 3,000 D11s had been produced at their plant in East Peoria.|$|E
50|$|After initial tests by Ronnie Peterson and Jacky Ickx, both drivers {{complained that}} the car lacked 'feel' and that the <b>electronic</b> <b>clutch</b> was giving problems. The {{gearchange}} was modified, but both drivers persisted in claiming it was {{no better than the}} conventional clutch setup. Other problems with the engine installation were encountered, which led to mechanical failures and the car's weight bias being out of sync. The car made its debut at the 1974 South African Grand Prix, Ickx qualified 10th and Peterson qualified 16th, During the race the Swede retired after a collision with the Belgian who also retired when his brakes failed. At Spain, Peterson qualified 2nd and Ickx qualified 5th, but both retired when their brakes failed. The Belgian Grand Prix saw the Swede qualify 5th and the Belgian 16th. During the race Peterson retired with a fuel leak and Ickx disappointed his home crowd with overheating problems. Afterwards, both drivers insisted on going back to the Lotus 72, which Peterson promptly used to challenge for the world championship. Chapman responded by upgrading the 76 to 'B' spec, with enlarged sidepods and better cooling. It was not seen until the German Grand Prix with Peterson. He qualified 8th and finished 4th. At Austria, Ickx qualified 22nd and retired after a collision. At the Italian Grand Prix, Ickx qualified 16th and retired with a throttle problem. Lotus entered Tim Schenken for the United States Grand Prix. He failed to qualify but started illegally from 27th place on the grid and completed six laps before he was disqualified. The team eventually had to accept that the 76 was a step in the wrong direction, and the whole project was scrapped in favour of keeping the 72s competitive.|$|E
50|$|The Lancia Trevi (Type 828) was a {{saloon car}} which was {{produced}} between 1980 and 1984. It had transversely mounted in-line four cylinder engines driving the front wheels. Its engines had twin overhead camshafts and <b>electronic</b> ignition. The <b>clutch</b> {{was a single}} dry plate with diaphragm and a five-speed gearbox was standard. The suspension consisted of MacPherson struts all round with coil springs and anti-roll bar. The wheels were fitted with 185/65 14 inch tyres (Pirelli P6). Steering was rack and pinion. The manufacturer's estimated fuel consumption was 29.4 mpg (9,6l/100km)at 75 mph for the 1600 manual and 28 mpg (10,1l/100km) at 75 mph for the 2000 manual. The 2000 fitted with an automatic transmission had an official fuel consumption of 25.4 mpg (11,1l/100km)at 75 mph.|$|R
50|$|The lead optical {{engineer}} at Canon {{who led the}} design team for this lens was a fashion photographer, and his intention was to design a lens {{that would be the}} definitive lens for fashion photography. This required a completely new design that would take a new direction from Canon's previous 85mm lens designs. A new element was placed in the lens to give bokeh that was unlike any of the other lenses that fashion photographers had used before. This new large element required a new <b>clutched</b> <b>electronic</b> manual focusing mechanism that was only used on Canon's 50mm f/1.0 to handle the large specialized element. When it finally hit the market, it was the only lens in the industry that was explicitly designed for fashion photography.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{put forward}} an {{automobile}} intelligent <b>electronic</b> control automatic <b>clutch</b> systems, use the electromagnet controlled by circuit {{to replace the}} clutch pedal of manual car. Through the switch, we can automatically control the detachment and combination of the initiative part and the driven part of clutch, which makes the operation of automatic car more convenience. Research Background In {{the light of the}} rapid development of the modern era automobile, the paper analysis the problem that the advantages of car manual and automatic transmission are not compatible. Then, in order to reduce technical difficulty of the shift operation and labor intensity, and makes the driving comfortable, we carry out the study of intelligent electronic control system of automatic clutch. The automatic clutch system will not change the dry friction clutch and manual shift transmission of vehicle configuration, it realizes the automatic control by the clutch system constituted of mechanical, electronic and sensor. Because the coexistence of two sets of pedal and automatic control system are at the same time, and the operation of the two systems will not influence each other, the driver can choose to use at any time. Manual car installed electric vehicle intelligent automatic clutch system will give the left foot of the driver complete liberation, which makes th...|$|R
