500|$|The Soviet {{authorities}} {{sought to}} remove all trace of the Polish history of the area now under their control. The name [...] "Poland" [...] was banned. Polish monuments were torn down. All institutions of the dismantled Polish state, including the Lwów University, were closed, then reopened, mostly with new Russian directors. Soviet Communist ideology became paramount in all teaching. Polish literature and language studies were dissolved by the Soviet authorities, and the Polish language was replaced with Russian or Ukrainian. Polish-language books were burned even in the primary schools. Polish teachers were not allowed in the schools, and many were arrested. Classes were held in Belorussian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian, with a new pro-Soviet curriculum. As Polish-Canadian historian Piotr Wróbel noted, citing British historians M. R. <b>D.</b> <b>Foot</b> and I. C. B. Dear, majority of scholars believe that [...] "In the Soviet occupation zone, conditions were only marginally less harsh than under the Germans." [...] In September 1939, many Polish Jews had fled east; after some months of living under Soviet rule, some of them wanted {{to return to the}} German zone of occupied Poland.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{tie beam}} length, width and overlap stress on {{settlement}} of foundations have been inves-tigated. In this investigation square concrete footings {{have been used}} with dimensions (B × B × d) where (<b>d)</b> is <b>footing</b> depth and (B) is footing width (1, 1. 5, 2 m). Width of tie beam (b) has been taken equal to 0. 25, 0. 30, 0. 40, 0. 50 and 0. 75 (m). Tie beam length (L) has been taken varying from B till 3 B with same footing depth = 0. 50 m. Effect of overlap stress on settlement as well as effect of tie beam width and length on settlement has been determined. Also, the efficiency of tie beam length and width has been obtained. An equation is presented to compute the overlap stress zone in case of existing tie beam. It is found that the settlement increases with increasing the length of tie beam which is clear after {{the effect of the}} overlap stresses zone. The width of overlap stress zone case of existing tie beam {{has been found to be}} equal to (1. 6 - 1. 75) B. The settlement of foot-ings decreases with increasing tie beam width.

40|$|There is {{debate about}} how fossil hominin pedal {{morphology}} relates to terrestrial habits. Were early hominins adapted to a bipedal lifestyle {{with a significant}} arboreal component, or were they more dedicated to a terrestrial lifestyle? The proximal articular surfaces of the metatarsals (MT) are examined in Gorilla, Pan, Hylobates, and habitually shod and unshod Homo using three-dimensional morphometrics. The results for MT 1 show three trends. OH 8 (Homo habilis) is indistinguishable from humans, specimens SKX 5017 and SK 1813 (Paranthropus robustus) are apelike, and all other fossil 1 st metatarsals are intermediate in shape between humans and apes. The MT 2 and MT 3 analyses show that humans have a narrower surface that is expanded in the plantar aspect relative to apes. These features increase joint stability for the human longitudinal arch. The MT 2 fossils for Stw 573 <b>d</b> (Little <b>Foot)</b> and OH 8 are humanlike. The MT 2 specimen of SKX 247 (possibly Paranthropus) is apelike, while all other MT 2 fossils are intermediate between humans and apes. In the MT 3 analysis, Stw 387, Stw 496, Stw 388, and OH 8 metatarsals are humanlike in shape, while Stw 435 and Stw 477 are intermediate between humans and apes. The MT 3 surface of Hylobates is markedly convex, suggesting that the midfoot break in gibbons extends to include this joint {{in addition to the}} MT 4 and MT 5 tarsometatarsal joints. The results of the MT 4 analysis show a highly convex surface in apes, with Hylobates extending further to the dorsal aspect of this metatarsal, with a greater range of motion at the midfoot break compared to the African apes. The MT 4 specimens of OH 8 and Stw 628 show greater morphological affiliation with humans. The MT 5 analysis shows that Pan and Hylobates have a medio-laterally extended and concave articular surface that is convex in the dorso-plantar plane. The two human groups are narrower and flatter in the medio-lateral plane, with a little dorso-plantar convexity. There is overlap in shape patterns between groups in the MT 5 analysis. Greatest similarity is between humans and Gorilla. The MT 5 fossil specimens tend to show closer affiliation to humans and Gorilla...|$|R
40|$|This presentat ion {{will review}} briefly the current {{practice}} and {{state of the}} art in functional electrical stimulation (FES) as applied to s t roke, head injured or brain tumour opera ted patients. A similar application is used in paretic patients following t rauma or o ther aetiology. Over 20 years experience in the application of F E S, as practised in Ljubljana, will be highlighted and the devices currently in use will be described. The statistics show the results obtained on 2, 500 hemiplegic patients examined for FES application during the last 10 years. The statistics and results of the Slovenian populat ion indicate 0. 15 - 0. 20 % new cases annually or 1, 500 new cases per million inhabitants. U p to 6 3 % of annual cases are candidates for an FES based therapeutic locomotion rehabilitation programme.
