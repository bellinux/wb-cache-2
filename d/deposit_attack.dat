40|$|Over recent years, {{due to a}} {{constant}} desire for higher efficiency engines and hence increased turbine entry temperatures and a proportional reduction in [Carbon dioxide] emissions, {{there is a need}} to understand how molten slags (CMAS: Calcia magnesia alumina-silicate), including volcanic ash, affect engine life. Thermal barrier coatings (TBC) are employed together with cooling technology to protect engine hardware from the high temperature seen within the turbine and combustion zones. At current operating temperatures, CMAS can adhere to the TBC surface resulting in premature degradation of the coating. The columnar, high porosity microstructure of electron beam physical vapour deposited (EB-PVD) TBCs make them particularly susceptible to CMAS/molten <b>deposit</b> <b>attack.</b> CMAS attack of PYSZ is reported in literature to be characterised by penetration of the melt along the columnar structure, chemically attacking the TBC whereupon yttria is leached from PYSZ and into the melt, creating an yttria depleted interaction zone. A new approach for classifying and reporting CMAS attack on TBCs is introduced in this thesis and a degradation map is created to acknowledge that the mechanism and severity of CMAS damage is related to variation in the CMAS compositions. CMAS degradation of EB- PVD has been extensively studied by previous authors, all reporting similar degradation mechanism with varying degree of severity. In this study, this category of CMAS degradation mechanism is termed “classic” CMAS attack. The primary aim of this study has been to investigate the damage caused by volcanic ash and CMAS to materials used within an aerospace gas turbine engine. The thesis investigates two aspects. It is recognised that, debris ingested by the engine will cause erosion damage to components in the cooler section of the engine (compressor), thus the first part examines this issue. A series of erosion tests with Eyjafjallajokull volcanic ash and similar sized MIL spec silica sand have been undertaken with two compressor-typical materials (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Inconel 718). The results were consistent with volcanic ash behaving like fine silica sand both at room and at compressor operating temperatures. The measured erosion rates are consistent with a ductile erosion mechanism with peak rates of material loss at lower impact angle. The results would appear to fit classical ductile erosion models where the material loss depends on particle velocity and follows a power with an exponent close to 2. 4...|$|E

50|$|Toilet bowl {{cleaning}} {{often is}} aimed at removal of calcium carbonate <b>deposits,</b> which are <b>attacked</b> by acids. Powdered cleaners contain acids that {{come in the form}} of solid salts, such as sodium hydrogen sulfate. Liquid toilet bowl cleaners contain other acids, typically dilute hydrochloric, phosphoric, or formic acids. These convert the calcium carbonate into salts that are soluble in water or are easily rinsed away.|$|R

His effort, no doubt, had been to {{disengage}} her hand from the unfortunate mantle; but in doing so, he was led into some slight personal violence towards the lady. And now Miss Biles, having <b>deposited</b> her money, <b>attacked</b> him from behind, declaring that her friend would be murdered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tangential Radiographic Technique (TRT) {{principle}} was explored {{for evaluating}} <b>deposits</b> and corrosion <b>attacks</b> across {{the inner and}} outer walls of an insulated steel pipe using Iridium- 192. The research was performed on a designed test piece to simulate corrosion <b>attacks</b> and <b>deposits</b> on industrial pipes. Pitting corrosion measurements based on TRT were more sophisticated, and therefore magnification factor and correction were used to establish the estimated pit depth on the film. From the relationship curve drawn between the radiographic film density and the thickness of the pipe, the attenuation coefficient of the insulating material was negligible compared to the concrete deposit. The TRT method overestimated the degree of penetrated corrosion attack in the tangential position in the neighbourhood of 9 % and was within an accuracy of ± 0. 37 mm. This tolerance limit is 5 % less than the wall thickness of the pipe. From the results obtained, effective corrosion monitoring of insulated pipes can reliably be executed by the TRT without the costly removal of insulation material...|$|R

RNAi-based studies for therapy, after being examined for over a decade, are finally in the pipeline for developing a potential treatment for the mutated transthyretin (TTR) gene, which {{gives rise to a}} dysfunctional TTR protein. This dysfunctional protein causes TTR amyloidosis (ATTR), an inherited, progressively incapacitating, and often fatal genetic disorder. TTR is a protein produced in the liver, and functions as a carrier for retinol-binding protein and also thyroxine. This protein facilitates the transport of vitamin A around the human body. A mutation or misprint in the code of this protein results in an abnormal folding of the protein. Therefore, not only does the transportation of the vitamin A become disabled, but also there will be formation of clusters called amyloid <b>deposits,</b> which <b>attack</b> the heart and the nerves causing some patients to be unconditionally bound to bed. ATTR is a hereditary autosomal dominant disease with a 50 % chance of inheritance by offspring, even with just one of the parents having a single defective allele of this gene. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals worked on the concept of RNAi therapy for years, which led to the introduction of lipid nanoparticles encircling small interfering RNAs. The drug showed extremely positive results since the first trial, and a great percentage of defective protein reduction. This drug was later named Patisiran.
