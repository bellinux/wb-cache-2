50|$|Pioneer {{made another}} voyage to the North Pacific survey grounds {{later in the}} 1963 field season, {{calibrating}} her gravity meter, making <b>gravimetric</b> <b>measurements,</b> and experimenting with the design of Nansen bottles, bathythermograph collection speeds, {{the use of a}} thermoprobe at a depth of 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) and the use of a sea sled to capture specimens.

She also made 20 successful dredge hauls on the ridge atop the east rift of Kilauea Volcano, took deep-sea photographs of the rift, and made six dredge hauls along underwater volcanoes to the south and southwest of the island. She ran gravity transects northeast of Hilo and east of Oahu before departing Hawaii, concluding the 1962 season with deep-sea sounding lines during her return to California, where she arrived at San Francisco on 31 October 1962.

Methods For the validation exercise, in a simulated postpartum haemorrhage scenario using known volumes of artificial blood, the accuracy of <b>gravimetric</b> <b>measurement</b> was compared with visual estimation made by delivery suite staff. In the clinical observation study, the blood volume lost during postpartum haemorrhage was measured gravimetrically according to our routine institutional protocol and was correlated with fall in haemoglobin.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 16 March 1962, she resumed her survey of the North Pacific Ocean, running a sounding line to 35 degrees 30 minutes North latitude, and another sounding line to San Francisco, where she arrived on 25 March 1962. After 20 of her personnel attended Radiation and Decontamination School, she departed California on 20 April 1962 and conducted an investigation of Pacific waters which had seen recent underwater nuclear tests, including water temperature measurements, chemical analyses, measurements of radioactivity and of the different elements making up the radioactive water {{in the area of}} an underwater nuclear explosion, and study of the effects of radioactivity on plant and animal life in and near the test areas.

50|$|Pioneer {{then set}} out from Kodiak to conduct ocean surveys in the North Pacific Ocean between the Aleutian Islands and Hawaiian Islands to the limit of LORAN-C control, during which she again {{released}} weather balloons and made frequent meteorological reports, conducted bathymetric measurements, employed her magnetometer and gravity meter, took bottom core samples in Shelikof Strait, discovered a layer of warm water at depths of 320 to 440 feet (97.5 to 134 meters) between 50 degrees and 53 degrees North latitude, across all sounding lines, and discovered eleven seamounts. After a rendezvous with the Coast and Geodetic Survey ocean survey ships USC&GS Pathfinder (OSS 30) and USC&GS Surveyor (OSS 32) at Naval Station Kodiak in Kodiak, she departed Kodiak on 6 July 1961 to conduct bathymetry and oceanography in the Aleutian Trench. Arriving at Adak on Adak Island in the Aleutians on 11 July 1961, she conducted <b>gravimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> and investigated the westerly set of currents in the area, also launching weather balloons and making meteorological observations.|$|E

Since then, the gravity method has been extensively used for outlining various geological structures. A series of typical applications of this method is discussed by Heiland (1940, p. 157) Because of the relatively high density contrast between rock and ice, <b>gravimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> have been used recently for determining subglacial elevation contours.

40|$|Optical {{characteristics}} of stirred curd were simultaneously monitored during syneresis in a 10 -L cheese vat using computer vision and colorimetric measurements.

The results showed that computer vision and colorimeter measurements have potential for monitoring syneresis. The 2 different phases, curd and whey, were distinguished by means of color differences. As syneresis progressed, the backscattered light became increasingly yellow in hue for circa 20 min for the higher stirring speed and circa 30 min for the lower stirring speed.

50|$|Soil {{moisture}} sensors {{measure the}} volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct <b>gravimetric</b> <b>measurement</b> of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighting of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other {{property of the}} soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, {{as a proxy for}} the moisture content. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must be calibrated and may vary depending on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature, or electric conductivity.

40|$|The {{hygroscopicity}} {{of mineral}} aerosol samples has been examined by three independent methods: diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential mobility analysis. All three methods allow {{an evaluation of}} the water coverage of two samples, CaCO 3 and Arizona Test dust, as a function of relative humidity. For the first time, a correlation between absolute <b>gravimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> and the other two (indirect) methods has been established.
