50|$|Initially {{framed within}} the Cotonou Agreement (2000) {{covering}} sub-Saharan, Caribbean and Pacific countries but excluding South Africa, the EU’s co-operation with Africa is increasingly being organized {{in partnership with}} Africa’s own frameworks for co-operation, in particular the African Union, as well as within the <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy</b> adopted by African and European Heads of State at the Lisbon Summit in 2007. According to a progress report on implementation of this strategy, the EU’s contribution of €14 million between 2007 and 2013 enabled the African Union Commission to design and launch two successive €7 million calls for proposals to support research in post-harvest agriculture, renewable and sustainable energy and water and sanitation. Twenty collaborative research projects were funded through this programme. The EU’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research funded 565 collaborative research projects involving African participants. Altogether, some 1315 participants from 45 African countries had received a total of €178 million through the Seventh Framework Programme as of September 2013. Over the same period, the European Research Council allocated five grants to African researchers.|$|E

30|$|This {{reality and}} many other issues of global {{concerns}} brought the European Union and Africa to enter into strategic partnerships and adopted the <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy</b> as a guiding document to tackle many issues of common concern, inter alia, the Africa-EU Partnership on Climate Change. Given what has been accomplished so far in terms of concrete policies and deliverables based on the Action Plan 1 & II of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy,</b> the Partnership on climate change between the two continents {{can be considered a}} success considering that it has only been in operation for five years. However, {{this does not mean that}} there are no issues of concern and disagreements between the two parties that are not worth addressing in order to make the Partnership more effective and inclusive. For example, issues such as the incoherence of the EU policies in various fields towards Africa have been of great concern for both parties in their view of the Africa-EU Partnership on climate change.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> Strategic Partnership and Action Plan {{was adopted}} in Lisbon in 2007. This new strategy, {{which is often}} {{referred}} to as a ‘people-centred partnership’, was launched with the purpose of scaling-up political dialogue between the African Union (AU) and the EU in the interests of building a solid and sustainable continent-to-continent partnership. It aims to reinvigorate and elevate cooperation between Africa and Europe in the fight against poverty, injustice, human rights violations, lawlessness, insecurity and political and social instability. The priorities of the partnership programme are organised around eight themes: peace and security; democratic governance and human rights; trade, regional integration and infrastructure; the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); energy; climate change; migration, mobility and employment; and science, information society and space. The programme stipulates that Africa and the EU will pursue and implement policies and programmes that facilitate the active involvement of diaspora communities in the implementation of the strategy...|$|R
30|$|The Summit {{concluded}} {{by calling}} on the Partnership to specifically focus on the five components of the 13 priority areas identified by the <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Joint</b> Group on Climate Change in November 2008. The deliverable initiatives from the five components identified as priority areas of the Partnership are “the Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI); the CLIMDEV and AMESD programs; the activity of building and enhancing African negotiators´ capacity in negotiations under the UNFCCC; the GCCA and the fight against deforestationu.” It {{is worth noting that}} the Africa-EU Partnership on Climate Change second Action Plan addresses disparate issues from cross-cutting areas. One project that is worth mentioning as part of the capacity building, though initiated from the first Action Plan, emanating from the Africa-EU Partnership in favor of sustainable development is the Congo Basin Countries Capacity Building on GHG Inventories. This type of training initiative is a concrete example of how the EU assists African countries to build their capacity in taking stock of their emission and effectively participate in the international negotiations relating to the climate change governance. In particular, the Partnership for Forests of the Congo Basin provides support and capacity building to the member countries of the Commission of Forests of Central Africa in international negotiations over climate change. The partnership aims at assisting those countries in the calculation of GHG emissions and providing them with training on the so-called mechanism for Reduction Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries (REDD). Hence, the Africa-EU Partnership is only three to four years old, but the intensity and scope of the Partnership has been present throughout the latest international climate change negotiations, i.e., the Copenhagen and Durban Conferences.|$|R

30|$|The third Africa-EU Summit {{was held}} in Tripoli, Libya, in November 2010. During that Summit, the Heads of State and Government of Africa and the European Union reiterated their {{commitments}} to maintain the <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy</b> as the framework for their future cooperation and adopted as a result, the second Action Plan 2011 – 2013 as their firm commitment to pursuing the realization of their Partnership. They recognized the pressing issues {{that the world was}} facing {{at the turn of the}} last decade and called for the reaffirmation of their partnership to address them. Those issues were stated as tackling the effects of climate change, conflict prevention, good governance, achieving a sustainable energy market including investment particularly in renewable energy resources, providing food security, achieving the Millennium Development Goals, combatting HIV/AIDS and addressing the realities and challenges of migration and its links to development.|$|E
30|$|By {{recognizing}} {{the climate change}} challenges as a foreign policy concern, the EU came to the realization then that it would effectively advance its climate change policy agendas on a global level if it engaged Africa as a strategic partner via enhanced political dialogue. This {{is in contrast to}} the uncooperative stance that the United States government has taken against the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This realization resulted in an enhanced Africa-EU Partnership on climate change, drafted into the 2007 joint-Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) document. Thus, this would be the instrument that both continents would use in their cooperation to tackle their energy security challenges and environmental concerns, among which the climate change is of the highest priority. The Africa-EU Strategic Partnership and a <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy</b> document came about as a reaction to what Europe and Africa perceived to be a solution for the new threats and issues that required joint responses and coordinated efforts based on common vision and shared interests.|$|E
40|$|The core {{theme of}} this diploma thesis is the <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy.</b> This treaty was signed by the EU and the African Union in 2007 in order to {{transform}} mutual relations, establish partnership and cooperation in several thematic areas. Considering the partnerships between EU and Sub-Saharan countries embedded in the Cotonou Agreement and the partnership between EU and North-African states incorporated in the Mediterranean partnership {{as well as in}} the EU Neighbourhood policy, this paper examines the role and reasons for creation of the new partnership. Guidance is provided by the theory of partnerships, which defines the basic characteristics of the type of international relations called this name. To the main conclusions of this work belongs that the new partnership has brought before all the broadening of cooperation in the security area and that the main motivations for conclusion of the treaty was influence in Africa from the side of the EU and strengthening of legitimacy and position and deepening of development cooperation from the side of the AU...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy</b> (JAES), {{which was}} adopted in 2007, aimed {{to break with}} the {{traditional}} donor-recipient relationship between the EU and Africa {{and to develop a}} true partnership. The concept of partnership has been central in EU-Africa relations ever since the Lomé Agreement (1975), but many have argued that it has been eroded by conditionalities and the end of special trade preferences. Ideally, a partnership is characterized by shared values, equality and trust, but are these principles reflected in the JAES? This study investigates this question by focusing on the thematic partnerships on peace and security and democratic governance and human rights. The paper argues that, despite the power asymmetries between the EU and Africa, the JAES has been characterized by equality in decision-making and by African ownership in capacity-building. However, while the JAES may objectively be based on shared values, the EU and the AU have often differed on how to apply those values in concrete situations, more particularly on the question which type of intervention is acceptable (conditionality, military intervention, etc.). Moreover, the analysis identifies a general feeling of mistrust amongst both parties in the partnership...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{follows the}} causes, consequences and future impacts {{of climate change}} and desertification in Africa and globally. The work {{is focused on the}} Convention itself which deals with combating desertification and mitigating the effects of drought, especially in developing countries and the related <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>strategy</b> and priority measures. The thesis also deals with the issue of enlargement of deserts and provides a comprehensive overview of areas prone to desertification on all continents. It pays attention to adaptation and mitigation measures at the global level, but also on the African continent and simultaneously due to desertification on agriculture and food security. The last part of the research is a case study of the Sahel which is part of Africa between the 12 th and 20 th parallel of the northern latitude. It describes the characteristics of the landscape, desertification and possible solutions, eg. appropriate farming practices and habits of the population which is very important to change for development of this highly affected area. Abundant drought in this region had occurred in the 70 s, mid- 80 s and again in the early the 90 s of the 20 th century, in Sudan since the 70 s of the 20 th century, each year annual rainfall is reducing. Results based on analysis of historical observations indicate the presence of at least three particularly sensitive regions called the climate "hotspots" - places with the most apparent climate change (rainfall decrease in the dry season is almost one hundred percent) ...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{regional}} integration in Europe, Africa and Asia is a defining {{feature of the}} 21 st century. This increase has been followed by the growth of region-to-region collaboration (inter-regionalism) as a means of international cooperation. In the past, EU-Africa relations mainly served as a medium for economic cooperation however, this is now changing with the inclusion of security cooperation in EU-Africa relations. This new relationship was explicitly outlined in the 2007 <b>Joint</b> <b>Africa-EU</b> <b>Strategy</b> (JAES). Within the new relationship, security cooperation through inter-regionalism is founded on the principles of equality, partnership and ownership. Despite these shifts, academic research has not caught up to examining the reasons and implications of security through inter-regionalism. The thesis therefore explores the extent to which security cooperation has contributed to changes in contemporary EUAfrica relations. In this context, the thesis specifically evaluates security cooperation between the EU and Africa primarily through the African Union (AU). The thesis develops institutionalised interregionalism as a framework through which this new type of international cooperation is best understood. It assesses two cases of EU support for new security initiatives in Africa. The first case study examines the efforts to create functional battle ready groups for peace missions. The second case study evaluates the European Union’s commitment to small arms control initiatives through the African Union. It does this by applying the historical institutionalism theoretical approach to the empirical concept of inter-regionalism. The thesis uses a multi-method qualitative approach including elite interviewing, non-participant observation, documentary and narrative analysis. The thesis finds that while the inter-regionalisation of security cooperation constitutes a shift in EU-Africa relations, changes to the institution are more likely when the EU is internally coherent, coordinated and employs a division of labour model to implement its support for the African Peace and Security Architecture. The lack of division of labour among EU actors has been impeded by lack of political will on the part of EU Member States as well as a ‘turf war’ or competition between the European Commission and Member States. The competition within the EU has been particularly detrimental to a region-to-region approach in EU-Africa relations. The lack of a single or streamlined approach undermined some of the AfricanUnion’s peace and security aims. In addition, the limited capabilities of the African Union, has negative implications for the implementation processes of the peace and security cooperation as it undermines the aspirations of ownership and partnership. This research thesis makes a substantive contribution to the literature on EU external relations generating new insights into the changing nature of international cooperation based on regionalism. It moves beyond the discourses on EU challenges in achieving common positions on security matters. Rather, it focuses on challenges (and opportunities) occurring in EU external relations despite the common positions. Additionally, it contributes to the debates in EU-Africa relations beyond the development focus of the literature to consider insights from the empirical reality of security cooperation. Finally, the thesis contributes to the burgeoning literature on burden sharing in international security through division of labour among international actors. The thesis is therefore relevant to current trends in the study and practice of international relations...|$|E
