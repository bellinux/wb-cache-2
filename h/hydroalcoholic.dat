40|$|Introduction:Lipid oxidation, {{including}} LDL oxidation, plays {{a pivotal}} role in development of atherosclerosis. Supplementing diet with antioxidants, such as vitamin E and walnut husk <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract, may prevent LDL oxidation. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro effects of walnut husk <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract on serum LDL oxidation caused by copper sulfate. Method:Blood samples were obtained from healthy individuals after an overnight fasting. Serum LDL was isolated. A control group was created using the serum LDL alone, and experiment groups were created using serum LDL oxidized by CuSO 4 and walnut husk <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract at concentrations of 0. 2, 2 and 20 μg/mL. LDL oxidation was assessed through measuring conjugate dienes, lag times and malonedialdehyde (MDA) to provide a basis for comparing the effects of different concentrations of walnut husk <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract on serum LDL oxidation in the presence of copper. Results:Our findings indicate that walnut husk <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract reduces serum LDL oxidation, with lag times equal to 87 %, 178 % and 202 % for concentrations of 0. 2, 2 and 20 μg/mL, respectively.

Here we assessed the antiviral activity of leaf <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract, warifteine or methylwarifteine from C. sympodialis in an in vitro dengue virus infection model. The results demonstrated that leaf <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract or warifteine/methylwarifteine treatment did not reduce dengue virus-Ag+ hepatocyte (Huh- 7 cell) rates in present experimental conditions. However, we assessed the potential antiviral effect of leaf <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract or warifteine/methylwarifteine on dengue virus-infection by the production of inflammatory molecules, TNF-α, MIF, IL- 8 and PGE 2.

40|$|Aims: In {{traditional}} medicine, dill (Anethum graveolens) {{is known}} as the reducer of glucose, lipid and cholesterol. Physical exercises are also from the main methods of controlling and treating diabetes and hyperlipidemia. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of swimming exercises for 6 weeks, <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extracts of Anethum graveolens and their combination on lipid profile of diabetic rats. Materials & Methods: In this experimental research, 48 Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly chosen and were divided into 4 groups (swimming training, <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extracts of dill, swimming exercises with <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extracts of dill, control), one week after induction of diabetes. Interventions were 6 weeks (5 sessions per week for 30 min per session) of swimming exercises and intraperitoneal daily usage of 100 mg/kg <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extracts of dill. After that, blood sampling was done from all samples to analyze the lipid profiles. Data was analyzed by dependent T, one way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. Findings: Using <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extracts of dill, swimming exercises and their combination for 6 weeks had significant effect on reduction of LDL, VLDL, TG and Cholesterol of diabetic rats (p= 0. 001). Swimming exercises plus extract usage had more decreasing effect on LDL (p= 0. 008) and cholesterol (p= 0. 01) than extract usage alone had. In addition, The combination treatment had more increasing effect on HDL than just extract (p= 0. 001) and just exercise (p= 0. 01) had. Conclusion: Although 6 weeks of swimming exercises and usage of <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extracts of dill improves the lipid profile of diabetic rats, their combination treatment method is more effective...|$|E

This study investigated the anti-inflammatory activity and phenolic profile of the crude <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract and ethyl acetate fraction from E. brasiliensis leaves. Crude <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract and the ethyl acetate fraction were analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS in comparison to standard phenolic compounds. The anti-inflammatory activity of the crude <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract (1, 10 and 25 mg kg- 1) and the ethyl acetate fraction (10, 25 and 50 mg kg- 1) was evaluated in a swiss mouse model of acute pleurisy induced by carrageenan, being the total cell count, exudation and analysis of nitrite/nitrate the inflammation parameters. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealed apigenin, catechin, galangin, isoquercetin, myricetin, quercetin and rutin. Crude <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract and ethyl acetate fraction were effective in inhibiting cell migration in all tested doses. Crude <b>hydroalcoholic</b> extract was effective in inhibiting exudation only at the 10 mg kg- 1 dose; ethyl acetate fraction was effective in all tested doses. Results for nitrite/nitrate levels reveals that only the ethyl acetate fraction was effective at the tested doses. This is the first report {{of the presence of}} isoquercetin, galangin and apigenin in this species. Results from the phytochemical analysis enhance the chemical knowledge of this species. In the future, together with more studies, validation of its popular use in inflammatory diseases is possible...|$|E
