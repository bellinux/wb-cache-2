5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute <b>good</b> <b>management</b> practice.|$|E

On 30 June 2006 the equity was increased to €211,220, as the net loss {{was backed by}} a re-capitalisation of €9.3 million + €261,466 for previous net loss. On 30 June 2007 the equity was increased to €1,961,975, due to the net profit and a re-capitalisation of €288,780 (to make the share capital back to €500,000). On 30 June 2008 the equity was increased to €13,829,015 with a capital increase of just €1,000. The net income contributed the increase in equity on 30 June 2009, which was €24,763,537. On 30 June 2010 the equity was at €25,107,223. On 30 June 2011 the equity was increased to €29,305,052. Though less than €17 million equity contribution in total from Filmauro, Napoli achieved self-sustainability by <b>good</b> <b>management</b> and its large fans base.|$|E

25|$|Beekeepers may harvest honey from July until October, {{according}} to the honey flows in their area. <b>Good</b> <b>management</b> requires keeping the hive free of pests and disease, and ensuring that the bee colony has room in the hive to expand.

Success for the hobbyist also depends on locating the apiary so bees have a good nectar source and pollen source throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} park authorities have two roles: to conserve {{and enhance the}} park, and to promote its use by visitors. These two objectives cause frequent conflicts between the needs of different groups of people. It is estimated that the {{national park}}s of England and Wales receive 110 million visitors each year. Most {{of the time it}} is possible to achieve both the original two purposes by <b>good</b> <b>management.</b> Occasionally a situation arises where access for the public is in direct conflict with conservation. Following the ethos of the Sandford Principle, the Environment Act 1995 sets down how a priority may be established between conservation and recreational use. Similar provision has been made for Scottish national parks.|$|E

25|$|Romanian theatre also {{suffered}} from economic hardships, and its popularity decreased drastically {{due to the}} increased popularity of television and other entertainment channels. Some theatres survived due their prestige (and some continued subsidies); others survived through <b>good</b> <b>management,</b> investing in themselves and earning a steady audience through the high quality of their productions.

25|$|The Benedictine Rule was not austere in {{comparison}} with the discipline of the Cistercians and Augustinians, and Shrewsbury Abbey was markedly less isolated than its competitors, located {{as it was in the}} suburbs of a major town. Because of <b>good</b> <b>management,</b> the abbey did not get into serious difficulties in the 12th century, despite the underlying problems with many of its endowments. Even in the early 12th century the abbey owned a number of properties in and around the town: orchards, a vineyard and a sand-pit. In the 13th century the integration with Shrewsbury became closer still, as the abbey expanded its holdings of urban property in the Abbey Foregate, the market, and elsewhere in the town. The great majority of the rural holdings were let to small farmers or cultivated as demesne lands; only rarely did the community let entire manors to laymen, and it was reluctant to tolerate leases of more than one lifetime. The demesnes were managed by lay bailiffs and stewards on behalf of the abbey; there is no evidence that the monks themselves ever cultivated the land.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 40 rivers {{rise in the}} BMNP area, {{contributing}} to five major rivers: the Web, Wabe Shebele, Welmel, Dumal and Ganale. Additionally, the Bale massif is the source for many springs in the lowlands, which are of paramount importance as {{they are the only}} source of water year-round. People living south of the national park are completely dependent on <b>good</b> <b>management</b> of the water resources from the highland areas. If the flow of these rivers is altered in any way – through deforestation, overgrazing of pastures and/or over abstraction for irrigation (all of which are occurring at present) – a highland/lowland imbalance results with loss of perennial water in the lowlands. If such a situation arises, the dry season range of the people and their livestock reduces dramatically and they concentrate about whatever water source remains. It is widely recognized that such uneven distribution of people and livestock leads to rapid and lasting degradation. The people are, therefore, likely to become increasingly food-aid dependent if the water catchment areas of the Bale Mountains are insufficiently protected. There is already evidence that over abstraction of water in the Bale Mountains is occurring.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Richards Presidency, under the {{leadership}} of engineer, lawyer, and naturalist, Henry Sturgis Drinker ('71) (1905–1920) Lehigh witnessed strong growth, with the construction of the John Fritz Engineering Lab (1910), and Taylor Gym (1914). Furthermore, plans were made for the Gothic inspired Alumni Memorial Building, designed by alumni T. C. Visscher ('99) and J. L. Burley ('94). This was an elaborate project that would not be finished until the Richards Presidency. During Richards, Lehigh was not too negatively affected by the Depression, thanks to its stronger standing, <b>good</b> <b>management,</b> and the support of Bethlehem Steel. Internal development of the three undergraduate Colleges was emphasized. And critically, just before the Depression, two massive, and coterminous, projects were completed, lending the University much of its modern appearance. The first was a large addition to Linderman Library, doubling its size, and granting a Gothic reinterpretation to what was a Romanesque structure (1929); and secondly, Packard Lab (1929). Both enlargements of the Campus were designed by the firm of Visscher and Burley, again Gothic, with the latter accomplished through the generous gifts of James Ward Packard ('84), founder of the motor company.|$|E

However, Takahashi wrote that [...] "Blackley worked hard to inspire his team", and he described artist James Dollar's belief that, [...] "in contrast to other Looking Glass managers, he didn't take over tasks and make others feel stupid". During {{the first two years}} of production, the team was divided into small groups that worked on the game's elements separately. For example, Blackley programmed the game's physics, while Eric Twietmeyer and Tim Day created the terrain renderer. However, Doug Church later said that, while [...] "the team [...] a bunch of very cool stuff, the FBO, the flight model, the instructor, the renderer, so on", the result [...] "was almost like four separate programs, with no connection". Following the completion of the concurrently-developed System Shock, a significant part of that game's team—including Church, Marc LeBlanc and Rob Fermier—moved to Flight Unlimited to add connective material. At the time, Church said that it was difficult to meld the game's elements, but he later stated that they largely coalesced by the end.|$|E
