2500|$|It {{begins with}} Perry, {{sitting on the}} ground while mouthing the lyrics and staring at the camera. As she {{finishes}} the verse, the camera shifts to the ballroom, in which the dancers start to dance. The song's chorus kicks in, and she is now found in the ballroom, {{in the middle of all}} the dancers. As the second verse begins and she has an owl on her arm, which she lets go and flies. The bird represents [...] "something strong, free [...] powerful". Bonacorso added: [...] "She lets it go into the world and that literally letting this force within her go wild. That's an important part of love <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> let it go." [...] The video also shows Perry, with a golden dress and cross-shaped earrings, with flames on her body. By the second repetition of the chorus, a bed gets lit on fire, which the director included to refer to love that [...] "can burn you like an inferno". As the song reaches its climax, Perry gets hit by a car, with tiny broken debris from it shattering behind her, while she remains stationary and unharmed. This scene symbolizes the experience of true love, that changes [...] "your world" [...] and [...] "hits you out of the blue". This scene cuts to the ballroom, where Perry is surrounded by a similar explosion of [...] "colorful" [...] flowers, which is used to contrast the more violent nature of falling in love and the softer part of it, the [...] "joyful and wonderful" [...] feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I imagine," [...] {{the latter}} was saying drily, [...] "that we are fairly free from eavesdroppers here. Now {{tell me what it}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, Nigel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no idea," [...] she objected, [...] "what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> propose. Besides, I am {{only just}} {{a woman who}} has been {{entrusted}} with a few diplomatic errands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{come down}} from London by the {{newspaper}} train this morning, and the second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> received your injuries in a hansom cab accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Dick! How glad I <b>am</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come!" [...] gasped Anderson Rover, when {{he could}} speak. [...] "That towel nearly smothered me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} well, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> my thanks. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{prevented}} a disaster. Your name and service shall receive official mention." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then King Angus said: [...] "As to {{the matter}} of {{granting}} you a favor, that I would do in any case for the love I bear you. So let me hear what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He thinks so," [...] Jake answered, grinning. [...] "My opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{thank my}} sister Ida {{for the job}} of looking after me. She made this her {{business}} until I went to Yale, when, of course, she lost control. Ida has a weakness for managing people, for their good, but you ought to take it as a delicate compliment that she passed me on to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That may be," [...] {{said the}} manager, smiling, [...] "but you can't have made very much, for {{you must have}} a good many expenses. The {{principal}} reason why I think it won't pay you <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep up two stations, and you all live {{on this side of the}} creek. I've heard that one of you had a hard time getting over the creek last week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is as comforted {{as she can}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> Cranky and me; {{and then}} papa's being proud of <b>you</b> <b>has</b> cheered her--oh! so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|My notion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> [...] (Before she {{had this}} fit) [...] An {{obstacle}} that came between [...] Him, and ourselves, and it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose, miss," [...] he said, after pausing {{for some}} moments, [...] "that {{the meaning of}} this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got a young lover?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, why not? Anyway, {{the point}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{work from the}} inside, with what we have, {{rather than from the}} outside, with foreign ideas. The shell ought not to be forced on the spirit. It can't be! The bright shell has to grow out of the spirit, and express it. That means waiting. If we keep after the city council for another ten years they MAY vote the bonds for a new school." ...|$|E
5000|$|Why do {{they call}} it [...] "coding"? It is a {{preprocessing}} technique that performs transmit diversity and it is similar to equalization, but the main difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> optimize the precoder with a decoder. Channel equalization aims to minimize channel errors, but the precoder aims to minimize the error in the receiver output.|$|E
5000|$|Quast {{was named}} {{as one of}} the 25 Most Beautiful People for 1996 in Who Weekly {{magazine}}. In an article for the magazine he said, [...] "The problem with this business <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> supposedly look as good as you can all the time. And I hate that. My idea of doing my hair is sticking it out of the window of a car when it's wet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a {{neglected}} guest," [...] she explained coldly. [...] "I {{do not understand}} how it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> managed to remain undiscovered." ...|$|R
50|$|A further {{complication}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{an allowance}} per employer, unlike Income Tax where the allowance is split between employers via the person's tax code.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, it can't <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> captivated Joshua!" [...] she exclaimed, in a {{tone that}} implied the {{carrying}} of a stronghold hitherto thought impregnable.|$|R
5000|$|Al-Sane opposes Project Kuwait and {{allowing}} foreign oil companies into Kuwait. On December 23, 2005, Al-Sane {{told the press}} that he opposed the entry of these foreign companies because it is barred by the constitution: [...] "The step {{the government wants to}} take is against the law, and we have to stand against it strongly... The constitutional issue is the main one. We're not against foreign investments, but the problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stick to the constitution." ...|$|E
5000|$|Whoopi Goldberg {{addressed}} these protests on The View, {{saying that}} [...] "there's {{been a lot}} of protests all over New York against this show - a show that people have not seen. The people who are protesting this show, 90% of the people have not seen it. ... People are protesting saying that it shouldn't be a minstrel show, this is too serious. What people don't understand <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bring information to people in a most invigorating way." ...|$|E
50|$|Cylinder C1 is {{one inch}} in radius, and {{cylinder}} C2 is ten inches in radius. If the force exerted on C1 is 10 lbf, the force exerted by C2 is 1000 lbf because C2 is {{a hundred times}} larger in area (S = πr²) as C1. The downside to this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> move C1 a hundred inches to move C2 one inch. The most common use {{for this is the}} classical hydraulic jack where a pumping cylinder with a small diameter is connected to the lifting cylinder with a large diameter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Cis, Cis, Cis, how delightful! How glad I <b>am</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come! They {{only just}} told me! And {{how do you}} do, Mr. Morton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Tressilian, [...] "the course I would prefer, {{for my own}} sake, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> adopted; but {{the friends}} of this most unhappy lady--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, if you please, my dear Mr. Andrew," [...] she said, [...] "will {{you tell}} me what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done to my foolish little girl?" ...|$|R
5000|$|All {{aspects of}} {{documentary}} filmmaking involve choice {{and are therefore}} manipulative. But the ethical ... aspect of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ... try to make film that is true {{to the spirit of}} your sense of what was going on. ... My view is that these films are biased, prejudiced, condensed, compressed but fair. I think what I do is make movies that are not accurate in any objective sense, but accurate in the sense that I think they're a fair account of the experience I've had in making the movie.|$|E
5000|$|Beatty defended her {{decision}} to switch from the provincial NDP to the federal Liberals saying that the Liberals {{have a better chance}} of taking power and [...] "the one thing that I have found out <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be in government to have say when it comes to policy or budget decisions or raising issues at that level." [...] She said she was initially approached by the federal Liberals in the summer of 2007 but decided to run provincially in hopes that the Lorne Calvert-led Saskatchewan NDP government would be returned to office.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 2012 by Sarah Marshall, The People's Orchestra plays {{a variety}} of concerts, {{predominantly}} in Birmingham and West Bromwich, featuring music from film, TV and other sources. [...] TPO is a 'diverse mix' of talented musicians of all ages who come together as a full orchestra or in smaller groups to create and perform across the Midlands. The only requirement {{to become part of}} the orchestra <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have played towards Grade 7, plus good sight-reading of music. [...] As an independent charity it has also developed a volunteer programme which helps local unemployed people back into work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Louis," [...] I said, [...] "we are {{not only}} alone, but we are secure from interruption. Tell me exactly what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in your mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have thrown}} {{yourself}} away,' said Eugene, shaking his head. 'But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> followed the treasure of your heart. My justification <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> thrown <b>that</b> away first, dear girl!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Cox," [...] he said, [...] "I wish I could {{understand}} what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in your mind. Those are not real voices <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hear; you cannot believe that?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In-lens image stabilization, {{also known}} as optical image stabilization, is {{implemented}} in the lens itself and moves the lens elements {{in an attempt to}} counteract the sensed motion of the camera. The inherent advantage of this kind of image stabilization is that it steadies the viewfinder image, allowing for more accurate framing and autofocus. The disadvantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay the extra cost for every lens you buy for which you want image stabilization. Panasonic, Canon, and Nikon use lens-based image stabilization. Some third-party lenses from Sigma and Tamron also have lens-based IS systems.|$|E
5000|$|The Born in the U.S.A. 12" [...] Single Collection {{retrospectively}} received {{four and}} a half stars out of five from William Ruhlmann of Allmusic. He said that [...] "The remixes were trendy at the time -- even Bob Dylan employed remixer Arthur Baker (who also served here) in the mid '80s -- though they now sound like curiosities. But the B-sides are nearly the equal of some of the released tracks on Born in the U.S.A., and the addition of songs like [...] "Rosalita" [...] make this box a comprehensive sampler of Springsteen's work up to 1985. The only problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep getting up and changing the records." ...|$|E
50|$|De Négrier had a hasty temper, {{but it was}} {{redeemed}} by a ready {{sense of}} humour, and his troops relished his occasional volcanic eruptions. Second Lieutenant René Normand of the 111th Line Battalion (killed in action a month later in the Battle of Bang Bo) recalled a typical incident during the Lạng Sơn Campaign in February 1885:General de Négrier began to concentrate his brigade. The column was moving forward slowly, in single file, and as he watched it he remarked to us, 'The thing about warfare <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn to be patient.' No sooner were the words {{out of his mouth}} than a cannon bogged down. He spurred towards the wretched gun section. 'Oh, for God's sake! Keep the damned thing moving!' Then he burst out laughing, and that set us all off.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the sound}} the red blood flashed {{up into the}} Baron's face. [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> there?" [...] said he, {{pointing}} to the bundle upon the old woman's knees.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, we {{were fairly}} frightened here,' said Sedgwick. 'The first report <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone, but <b>that</b> seemed without foundation; but Coningsby was quite given up. Where are they now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend, {{it is not}} so easy," [...] she murmured. [...] "Tell me," [...] she continued, [...] "why it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{so little}} self-confidence. Is it because you are poor?" ...|$|R
