At the core of Meiklejohn's effort to create systems that promote <b>democratic</b> <b>citizenship,</b> Nelson argues, is [...] "the paradox of Socratic teaching": how a teacher can make a student want freedom and how a teacher can teach this while respecting the student's freedom in practice.|$|E

One year later, on 22 March 1955, he died at his Schloß.|$|R
2500|$|The term {{appeared}} in the 5th century BC, to denote the political systems then existing in Greek city-states, notably Athens, to mean [...] "rule of the people", in contrast to aristocracy ( [...] , [...] ), meaning [...] "rule of an elite". While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically. The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted <b>democratic</b> <b>citizenship</b> to free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In 1906, Finland became the first government to herald a more inclusive democracy at the national level. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, <b>democratic</b> <b>citizenship</b> consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, {{the process of}} {{institutional}} democratization prevailing in Western Europe {{since at least the}} end of World War II has spread to Southwestern, Southeastern and Eastern European countries. To what extent has this democratic transformation of polities been followed by a genuinely <b>democratic</b> transformation of <b>citizenship</b> education in these countries? Unfortunately, recent research on citizenship education does not provide a satisfactory answer, because it has mainly focused on institutional and organizational issues. Nothing was said about the question how well-sounding, but quite general – and therefore ambiguous – officially proclaimed goals and contents of citizenship education in transformation countries are educationally construed in textbooks and the teaching practice. However, {{there are quite a few}} empirical examples and indications which clearly show that citizenship education in transformation countries (and elsewhere) shows a number of facets which are hardly in line with core democratic values.

5000|$|Collaborative {{research}} from the Institute of Development Studies states that [...] "access to safe abortion {{is a matter of}} human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to international development". The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with <b>democratic</b> and <b>citizenship</b> rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.|$|R

6000|$|Children are {{not only}} {{prepared}} for <b>democratic</b> <b>citizenship</b> by being encouraged to think for themselves, but also to govern and discipline themselves. On the moral side, under the authoritative system of lay and religious training, character was acquired {{at the expense of}} mental flexibility--the Puritan method; our problem today, which the new system undertakes, is to produce character with open-mindedness--the kind of character possessed by many great scientists. Absorption in an appropriate task creates a moral will, while science, knowledge, informs the mind why a thing is [...] "bad" [...] or [...] "good," [...] disintegrating or upbuilding. Moreover, these children are trained for democratic government by the granting of autonomy. They have their own elected officials, their own courts; their decisions are, of course, subject to reversal by the principal, but in practice this seldom occurs.|$|E
6000|$|The {{prevailing}} {{system of}} education, {{which we have}} inherited from the past, largely fails to accomplish this. In the first place, it has been authoritative rather than scientific, {{which is to say}} that students have been induced to accept the statements of teachers and text books, and have not been trained to weigh for themselves their reasonableness and worth; a principle essentially unscientific and undemocratic, since it inculcates in the future citizen convictions rather than encourages the habit of open-mindedness so necessary for <b>democratic</b> <b>citizenship.</b> For democracy--it cannot be too often repeated--is a dynamic thing, experimental, creative in its very essence. No static set of opinions can apply to the constantly changing aspect of affairs. New discoveries, which come upon us with such bewildering rapidity, are apt abruptly to alter social and industrial conditions, while morals and conventions are no longer absolute. Sudden crises threaten the stability of nations and civilizations. Safety lies alone in the ability to go forward, to progress. Psychology teaches us that if authoritative opinions, convictions, or [...] "complexes" [...] are stamped upon the plastic brain of the youth they tend to harden, and he is apt to become a Democrat or Republican, an Episcopalian or a Baptist, a free trader or a tariff advocate or a Manchester economist without asking why. Such [...] "complexes" [...] were probably referred to by the celebrated physician who emphasized the hopelessness of most individuals over forty. And every reformer and forum lecturer knows how difficult it is to convert the average audience of seasoned adults to a new idea: he finds the most responsive groups in the universities and colleges. It is significant that the [...] "educated" [...] adult audiences in clubs and prosperous churches are the least open to conversion, because, in the scientific sense, the [...] "educated" [...] classes retain complexes, and hence are the least prepared to cope with the world as it is today. The German system, which has been bent upon installing authoritative conviction instead of encouraging freedom of thought, should be a warning to us.|$|E
40|$|For {{foreign-born}} {{residents and}} their children, attaining citizenship {{in the host}} country confers membership, rights and participation opportunities, and encourages {{a sense of belonging}} (Bloemraad 2006). From a destination country perspective, naturalisation is increasingly seen as {{an important part of the}} process of integrating immigrants. In order to optimise the use of what is sometimes termed the 'citizenship premium', actors in destination countries often advocate public policies that are aimed at increasing naturalisation rates among immigrants (OECD 2011; Sumption and Flamm 2012). The acquisition of citizenship is associated with better employment probability, higher earnings and higher occupational positions (Liebig and Von Haaren 2011).

There is a tension between a liberal ideal of free movement and democratic concerns about the integrity of citizenship. This text proposes first to break down the problem by introducing a typology of free movement regimes based on their personal and territorial scopes. Second, it argues that the tension can be partially overcome through supranational integration, toleration of multiple citizenship and international agreements on reciprocal free movement rights. Taken together, these three strategies can greatly expand free movement rights that are not in conflict with <b>democratic</b> 3 <b>citizenship</b> since they rely on an expanded conception of such citizenship. The analysis concludes, however, that even the best possible free movement regimes that can be imagined under present circumstances cannot fully overcome discriminatory features of immigrant admission policies...|$|R

With close attention to the impact of the ambiguities and distortions of governance at the local level and their broader implications at the international level, where a state's legitimacy depends on its <b>democratic</b> credentials, <b>Citizenship</b> and the Legitimacy of Governance initiates a comparative discussion of the relationship between established moralities, politics, law and civil society in a highly diversified region with a strong history of cultural exchange.
