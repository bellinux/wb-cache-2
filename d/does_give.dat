5|$|Little {{documentary}} {{evidence of the}} games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account {{in the form of}} his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial <b>does</b> <b>give</b> details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but <b>does</b> <b>give</b> him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|E

25|$|It {{has thus}} been claimed that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth {{predicate}} is only partial, it <b>does</b> <b>give</b> truth value (true/false) to propositions {{such as the}} one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent.

25|$|The {{degree of}} roast {{has an effect}} upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are {{generally}} bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times. Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but <b>does</b> <b>give</b> less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting.|$|E

25|$|While {{the current}} {{central role of}} the dollar <b>does</b> <b>give</b> the US some advantages, such as lower cost of borrowings, it also {{contributes}} to the pressure causing the U.S. to run a current account deficit, due to the Triffin dilemma. In a November 2009 article published in Foreign Affairs magazine, economist C. Fred Bergsten argued that Dr Zhou's suggestion or a similar change to the international monetary system {{would be in the}} United States' best interests as well {{as the rest of the}} world's.|$|E
25|$|The 1797 {{impeachment}} of Senator William Blount of Tennessee stalled {{on the grounds}} that the Senate lacked jurisdiction over him. No other member of Congress has ever been impeached. The Constitution <b>does</b> <b>give</b> authority to the Senate and House, so that each body may expel its own members. (see List of United States senators expelled or censured and List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded). Expulsion removes the individual from functioning as a representative or senator because of their misbehavior, but unlike impeachment, expulsion cannot result in barring an individual from holding future office.|$|E
25|$|Carroll {{sees this}} {{societal}} belief as vital {{in interpreting the}} final scene of the play, arguing that Valentine <b>does</b> <b>give</b> Silvia to Proteus, and in so doing, he is merely acting {{in accordance with the}} practices of the day. However, if one accepts that Valentine does not give Silvia to Proteus, as critics such as Jeffrey Masten argue, but instead offers to love Proteus as much as he loves Silvia, then the conclusion of the play can be read as a final triumphant reconciliation between friendship and love; Valentine intends to love his friend as much as he does his betrothed. Love and friendship are shown to be co-existent, not exclusive.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the arrest}} power {{is meant to}} ensure the defendant's {{presence}} in court, lawyers defending the white-collar criminals who have been perp-walked since the late 1980s have complained it is unnecessary and superfluous in their clients' cases, even if it <b>does</b> <b>give</b> the appearance of preferential treatment for wealthy defendants. Lea Fastow, the wife of former Enron executive Andrew Fastow, cited the perp walk she was made to take {{even though she had}} expressed her willingness to surrender to a summons in an unsuccessful motion for a change of venue. Some, like Martha Stewart, have still managed to avoid being perp-walked by responding to summonses, or surrendering in the courtroom as soon as the indictment is presented in open court.|$|E
25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO might think that as long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This <b>does</b> <b>give</b> exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{theories}} regarding this final scene, however. For example, in his 1990 {{edition of the}} play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Kurt Schlueter suggests that Valentine is indeed handing Silvia over to Proteus, but the audience {{is not supposed to}} take it literally; the incident is farcical, and should be interpreted as such. Schlueter argues that the play provides possible evidence it was written to be performed and viewed primarily by a young audience, and as such, to be staged at university theatres, as opposed to public playhouses. Such an audience would be more predisposed to accepting the farcical nature of the scene, and more likely to find humorous the absurdity of Valentine's gift. As such, in Schlueter's theory, the scene does represent what it appears to represent; Valentine <b>does</b> <b>give</b> Silvia to her would-be rapist, but it is done purely for comic effect.|$|E
