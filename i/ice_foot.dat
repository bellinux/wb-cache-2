50|$|The width (and the presence) of this ice zone {{is usually}} {{seasonal}} and depends on ice thickness, topography {{of the sea}} floor and islands. It ranges from a few meters to several hundred kilometers. Seaward expansion {{is a function of}} a number of factors, notably water depth, shoreline protection, time of year and pressure from the pack ice. The topography of the fast ice varies from smooth and level to rugged (when submitted to large pressures). The <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> refers to ice that has formed at the shoreline, through multiple freezing of water between ebb tides, and is separated by the remainder of the fast ice surface by tidal cracks. Further away from the coastline, the ice may become anchored to the sea bottom—it is then referred to as bottomfast ice. Fast ice can survive one or more melting seasons (i.e. summer), in which case it can be designated following the usual age-based categories: first-year, second-year, multiyear. The fast ice boundary is the limit between fast ice and drift (or pack) ice—in places, this boundary may coincide with a shear ridge. Fast ice may be delimited or enclose pressure ridges which extend sufficiently downward so as to be grounded—these features are known as stamukhi.|$|E

40|$|Coastal ice {{includes}} {{the parts of}} the sea ice that are stressed and deformed by tidal motion; the <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> (the inner part that is frozen to the ground) and the hinge zone (the zone where cracking occurs due to tidal elevation of the floating ice). This thesis presents in situ measurements of first-year coastal ice conducted in a sound close {{to the head of the}} fjord Van Mijenfjorden, Sval- bard, in the period between January and May 2014. During in total 6 field trips measurements of temperature, salinity, density, thickness and freeboard were done both on the coastal ice and on the free-floating ice. The latter was done at a point 200 m offshore. Temperature oscillations with periods similar to the tides and amplitudes up to 0. 5 ◦C were found inside the ice in the hinge zone during a 10 -days period, indicating a high permeability of the ice. Since the ice there was grounded at low tide and floating at high tide, the water level was constantly varying relative to the ice and could thereby drive a column of brine/seawater up and down through the ice cover. This observation corresponded well with the calculated average permeabilities, which were much higher before the temperature oscillations occurred (2. 3 · 10 − 11 m 2) than after they had disappeared (1. 1 · 10 − 11 m 2). Freeboard and surface water measurements discovered buckling of the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone, which varied with the tide. In May, the ice was clearly buckled at high tide and stretched out at low tide. Creation of new ice inside the tidal cracks, caused by inflow of water during the tidal cycle, and thermal expansion are factors suggested to cause elongation of the ice sheet. Since the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, the ice is more likely to be buckled at high tide than at low tide when it is lowered in the middle of the sound. Maximum recorded amount of surface water was 18 cm, and through the season at least 20 cm of superimposed ice had been accumulating on the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone. During cold periods, growth rates in the different parts of the ice varied; the <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> was hardly growing at all, the free-floating ice was growing in moderate rates, whereas in the hinge zone the maximum growth was very high. The largest recorded ice thicknesses were 84 cm in the free-floating ice and 171 cm in the hinge zone. In the lower parts of the hinge zone the average ice temperatures were warmer than in the free-floating ice. Both the rapid growth and the temperature differences are expected to be caused by frequent flooding of the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone, which often resulted in creation of a new layer of ice on top of the original layer. The release of latent heat connected to this process, in addition to direct heating by the warmer surface water, is believed to be the main reason for the warmer ice. Also along the shore, large spatial variations in ice thickness were observed; two shore- perpendicular sections going across the hinge zone, 11 m from each other, showed that the maximum ice thickness differed with 70 cm. Mean salinities in the <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> were relatively low, varying from 0. 6 to 1. 2 ppm, whereas in the hinge zone they varied between 4. 9 and 7. 2 ppm. In the free-floating ice, average salinities between 4. 7 and 6. 6 ppm were recorded...|$|E

40|$|Terrestrial {{influences}} of coastal cliff morphology and hydrological impact on coastal erosion in unlithified cliff sediments {{in the inner}} fjords of Svalbard are assessed. Differential global positioning system measurements have been taken annually {{over the past two}} to four years at four field sites in central Svalbard. Measurements were combined with aerial imagery using ArcGIS and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System to calculate rates of erosion in varying geomorphological cliff types. A total of 750 m of coast was divided into two main cliff types: ice-poor and ice-rich tundra cliffs and further divided based on their sediment depositional character and processes currently acting upon sediments. The results show that the most consistent erosion rates occur in the ice-poor cliffs (0. 34 m/yr), whereas the most irregular and highest rates occur in ice-rich cliffs (0. 47 m/yr). Throughout the study, no waves were observed to reach cliff toes, and therefore erosion rates are considered to reflect an effect of terrestrial processes, rather than wave action. Terrestrial hydrological processes are the driving factors for cliff erosion through winter precipitation for ice-poor cliffs and summer precipitation for ice-rich cliffs. Sediment removal {{from the base of the}} cliffs appears to be mainly conducted by sea ice and the <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> during break up as waves did not reach the base of the studied cliffs during the observed period.

40|$|The lithofacies of the {{uppermost}} Pleistocene (ca 11 800 to 10 400 14 C yr BP), cold-temperate, coarse-grained beach deposits of Lake Algonquin, the precursor {{of the present}} Lake Huron of North America, have been studied and interpreted based on analogous features of modern beaches from the same region. <b>Ice</b> <b>foot</b> and ice-cementation develop during winter but, unlike Arctic beaches, ice-related sedimentary features are seldom, if ever, preserved in the Pleistocene and recent deposits of the Great Lakes. Instead, the deposits retain the typical characteristics of wave-dominated, pure gravel and mixed sand and gravel beaches, there including the classical subdivision of infill zone, swash zone/sand run, imbricated zone, coarse flat-clast zone and coastal dunes. These zones form a regular succession {{on the surface of}} many modern beaches; however, they seldom occur as quasi-complete vertical successions in older deposits. In the studied uppermost Pleistocene deposits, the various components are separated vertically by erosional contacts (bounding surfaces) readily recognizable on working faces of large sand and gravel pits and mappable in the subsurface by ground-penetrating radar. The lithofacies are sufficiently diagnostic to allow recognition of depositional settings, and the lithofacies architecture allows the deciphering of important geological events, such as: (i) local input of fluvial material onto the shoreface, where it was partially reworked by waves and moved onto the beachface; (ii) occurrence of major storm events; and (iii) repeated rapid transgressions and regressions typical of the glacial-lake precursors of the modern Great Lakes...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} open a coal mine in Ispallen, a {{prospect}} of the company Store Norske, it will necessary to transport the coal across a tidal inlet, Sveasundet, in Svea, Svalbard. In anticipation of this challenge, Store Norske partly funded a PhD position at UNIS to study {{the action of the}} ice on a possible causeway across the inlet and, more generally, to better understand the action of sea ice on coastal structures. I designed and supervised the construction of a 50 -m-long, 8 -m-high and 25 -m-wide breakwater in this microtidal environment— 2. 0 m maximum tidal range—where the seaice period lasts between 4 and 6 months. At the tip of the breakwater I installed a cabin with a weather and ground temperature station and time-lapse cameras. On the seabed I installed a tide and wave gauge. I went on the site on a weekly basis during a full ice season and documented the ice conditions both visually and quantitatively. I used a differential GPS to monitor tidal ice movements, measured ice stresses and took cores to analyse the properties of the coastal ice. To my knowledge, nowhere in the world have ice conditions ever before been documented so thoroughly throughout a whole season. Most engineering literature on sea ice is related to offshore structures. There is so little literature on coastal sea ice that several terms lack a precise definition. In this thesis coastal ice is defined as the ice in the zone that is affected by the boundary conditions at the shore. I identified and documented a variety of coastal-ice processes, most notably the formation, growth and decay of the <b>ice</b> <b>foot,</b> the tidal movement, and the break-up. The observations of the <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> lead me to revise its definition. At the site of study, the term is essentially relevant during the formation of the sea ice cover and during the breakup. In between, it is more relevant to consider the hinge zone, which is the area where the tide cracks occur. The ice pile-ups that occurred during the break-up perpertrated little damage because that late in the season, the ice was rotten and soft. Since these were the most destructive events, the ice conditions may be characterised as mild. Measurements of the ice strength, elasticity and creep across the coastal zone revealed that the coastal ice was weaker, less stiff and crept less than the free-floating ice. From the shore to the free-floating ice, the measured value of strength ranged monotonously from about 3 to 4 MPa and the measured value of elasticity ranged monotonously from about 1 to 1. 5 GPa. Measuring the stresses in metre-thick ice was challenging but the peak stresses of about 150 kPa is in the range of those found in similar studies (Frederking et al., 1986; Sayed et al., 1988; Moslet, 2001; Nikitin et al., 1992). Surprisingly, the highest stresses were measured in the direction not perpendicular but parallel to the tide cracks. More work is needed to understand the process of stress-build up.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the processes controlling development of a cryo-conditioned rock coast system in Hornsund, Svalbard. A suite of nested geomorphological and geophysical methods have been applied to characterise the functioning of rock cliffs and shore platforms influenced by lithological control and geomorphic processes driven by polar coast environments. Electrical resistivity tomosgraphy (ERT) surveys have been used to investigate permafrost control on rock coast dynamics and reveal the strong interaction with marine processes in High Arctic coastal settings. Schmidt hammer rock tests, demonstrated strong spatial control on the degree of rock weathering (rock strength) along High Arctic rock coasts. Elevation controlled geomorphic zones are identified and linked to distinct processes and mechanisms, transitioning from peak hardness values at the <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> through the wave and storm dominated scour zones to the lowest values on the cliff tops, where the effects of periglacial weathering dominate. Observations of rock surface change using a traversing micro-erosion meter (TMEM) indicate that significant changes in erosion rates occur at the junction between the shore platform and the cliff toe, where rock erosion is facilitated by frequent wetting and drying and operation of nivation and sea ice processes (formation and melting of snow patches and icefoot complexes). The results are synthesised to propose a new conceptual model of High Arctic rock coast systems, with the aim of contributing towards a unifying concept of cold region landscape evolution and providing direction for future research regarding the state of polar rock coasts...|$|E
40|$|A {{decade has}} yielded much {{progress}} in understanding polar disturbance and community recovery—mainly through quantifying ice scour rates, other disturbance levels, larval abundance and diversity, colonization rates and response of benthos to predicted climate change. The continental shelf around Antarctica is clearly subject to massive disturbance, but remarkably across so many scales. In summer, millions of icebergs from sizes smaller than cars to larger than countries ground out and gouge {{the sea floor}} and crush the benthic communities there, while the highest wind speeds create the highest waves to pound the coast. In winter, the calm associated with the sea surface freezing creates the clearest marine water in the world. But in winter, an <b>ice</b> <b>foot</b> encases coastal life and anchor ice rips benthos from the sea floor. Over tens {{and hundreds of thousands}} of years, glaciations have done the same on continental scales—ice sheets have bulldozed the seabed and the zoobenthos to edge of shelves. We detail and rank modern disturbance levels (from most to least) : ice; asteroid impacts; sediment instability; wind/wave action; pollution; UV irradiation; volcanism; trawling; non-indigenous species; freshwater inundation; and temperature stress. Benthic organisms have had to recolonize local scourings and continental shelves repeatedly, yet a decade of studies have demonstrated that they have (compared with lower latitudes) slow tempos of reproduction, colonization and growth. Despite massive disturbance levels and slow recolonization potential, the Antarctic shelf has a much richer fauna than would be expected for its area. Now, West Antarctica is among the fastest warming regions and its organisms face new rapid changes. In the next century, temperature stress and non-indigenous species will drastically rise to become dominant disturbances to the Antarctic life. Here, we describe the potential for benthic organisms to respond to disturbance, focusing particularly on what we know now that we did not a decade ago...|$|E
