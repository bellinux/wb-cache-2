40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} common models for <b>data</b> sharing and <b>dissemination,</b> highlight the current operational, technical, and political issues surrounding existing <b>data</b> sharing and <b>dissemination</b> initiatives in a health care market, and suggest an ideal model for future data initiatives. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: A literature review and case studies of existing <b>data</b> sharing and <b>dissemination</b> initiatives that promote the collection and use of comparative information on provider cost and quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three broad types of common models for <b>data</b> sharing and <b>dissemination</b> have evolved {{over the past decade}} or so: (1) provider-initiated initiatives developed through collaboration among providers of health care; (2) purchaser-initiated activities driven by a coalition of purchasers; and (3) indirect collaboration-data-sharing initiatives between providers and purchasers with a significant facilitating or regulating role by a third group of stakeholders. The success of a data-sharing and dissemination strategy is determined by how the complex operational, technical, and political issues are addressed. General principles by which a health data initiative might abide include the following: standardized databases as the physical foundation, indicators that reflect the changing market; linkages between and across data sets for comprehensive and complete data; economic value; policy relevance; use of evolving technologies to collect, integrate, and disseminate data; and stakeholder support. CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory solutions alone will not overcome the complex political and technical challenges to <b>data</b> sharing and <b>dissemination.</b> The "ideal" model or process nurturing a market for health care information will incorporate compromise and negotiation to address the issues of data ownership and proprietary concerns, therefore securing the necessary political and financial support of the private sector...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cooperative {{communications}} {{have been}} demonstrated {{to be effective in}} combating the multiple fading effects in wireless networks, and improving the network performance in terms of adaptivity, reliability, data throughput and network lifetime. In this paper, we investigate the use of cooperative communications for quality of ser-vice (QoS) provisioning in resource-constrained wireless sensor networks, and propose MRL-CC, a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based multi-hop mesh Cooperative Communication mechanism. In MRL-CC, a multi-hop mesh cooperative structure is constructed for reliable <b>data</b> <b>disseminations.</b> The cooperative mechanism that defines cooperative partner assignments, and coding and transmission schemes is implemented using a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. We compare the network per-formance of MRL-CC with MMCC (Chen et al., 2009), a Multi-hop Mesh structure based Cooperative Communication scheme, and investigate the impacts of network traffic load, interference and sensor node’s mobility on the network performance. Sim-ulation results show that MRL-CC performs well in terms of a number of QoS metrics...|$|R
