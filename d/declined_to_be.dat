5|$|Between 1842 and 1845 while Griswold was {{collecting}} {{material for}} Prose Writers of America {{he discovered the}} identity of Horace Binney Wallace, who had been writing in various literary magazines at the time (including Burton's) under the pen name William Landor. Wallace <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included in the anthology but the two became friends, exchanging many letters over the years. Wallace eventually ghostwrote Griswold's Napoleon and the Marshals of the Empire (1847).|$|E

SF Signal Podcast, run by Patrick Hester, won the 2014 award, and Galactic Suburbia Podcast, run by Alisa Krasnostein, Alexandra Pierce, Tansy Rayner Roberts, and Andrew Finch, won the 2015 award. No award was given in 2016, and Tea and Jeopardy, by Emma Newman and Peter Newman, won in 2017 on its third nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, in {{the spirit}} of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more {{expansive}} history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E

5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|As the {{convention}} began, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, the floor {{leader for the}} Grant forces (known as the Stalwart faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from {{the convention}}. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense {{of their right to}} reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more than ever that he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E

5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interviewed for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of {{the running of the}} club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement {{that he would not be}} sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Spacey <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{paid for}} his work as actor, director, co-writer and {{producer}} on Beyond the Sea. A portion of the $25 million budget came from his own Trigger Street Productions. Producer Arthur Friedman, who had shepherded the biopic since 1987, commented that he and Spacey experienced creative differences during pre-production. Friedman remarked {{that he was not}} involved with Beyond the Sea once production began in Germany. Filming was originally set to begin in June 2003 before it was pushed to November 7, 2003, lasting until late-January 2004. 80% of Beyond the Sea was shot using sound stages at Babelsberg Studios in Germany and Pinewood Studios in England. Lulworth Cove, Dorset, South West England doubled for Darin's setting of reclusiveness in Big Sur, California. In an attempt to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during {{the early stages of the}} singer's life depicted in the film, Spacey hired prosthetic makeup designer Peter King from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Payne ran {{for reelection}} in 1876 but was {{defeated}} by Republican Amos Townsend. He remained involved in politics, however, and even considered running for the Democratic nomination for President in 1880. Tilden, while not officially a candidate, wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer. Tilden did tell some of his close supporters that, {{if he did not}} run, Payne would be his first choice and House Speaker Samuel J. Randall his second. With that, many of the Tilden loyalists pledged their support to Payne, at least until Tilden decided to enter the race. Although Tilden ultimately <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nominated, Payne's chances were hindered when Ohio's delegation remained loyal to Senator Allen G. Thurman. Although Payne place third on the convention's first ballot, on the second the delegates stampeded to General Winfield Scott Hancock, who was nominated.|$|E

5|$|Before casting Keira Knightley as Gretta, Carney {{considered}} {{casting a}} pop singer such as Adele {{in the main}} role, {{as well as a}} number of other actresses including Scarlett Johansson, who was at one point attached to the project. Knightley, who had never sung professionally before, prepared for the role by training with a vocal coach and learning how to play a guitar. Mark Ruffalo was Carney's first choice for the role of Dan, and agreed to star in the film after Carney sent him the first draft of the screenplay. Singer Adam Levine was also the only person Carney considered casting as Dave, and won the role after talking with Carney over Skype and recording some dialogue as an audition; he <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid for appearing in the film. Although he had had minor acting parts on television before, Begin Again marked his first role in a film. Carney approached James Corden to appear in the film after admiring Corden's performance in the lead role in a Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors.|$|E
