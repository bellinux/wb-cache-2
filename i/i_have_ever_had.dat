He and his father pilot Striker Eureka, [...] "the strongest and the fastest" [...] Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance's [...] "go-to team". Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, [...] "My immediate reaction was 'Holy crap, that's cool.' In the hands of somebody else, you might sit there and go, 'Well, this might be terrible,' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, 'This {{is going to be}} amazing.'". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, [...] "The most fun <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun." ...|$|E

I saw {{with one of the}} nastiest feelings <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E

500|$|Of {{particular}} {{note was}} Marseille's 158th claim. After {{landing in the}} afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, [...] "That was the toughest adversary <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> His turns were fabulous... I thought it would be my last fight". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.|$|E
500|$|The 59th Division {{was rushed}} to Ireland in {{response}} to the Easter Rising of April 1916, where Blackader's new brigade saw its first active service. Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just done one of the hardest tasks <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> to do. I have had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across. There must be something very wrong in the state of things that makes a man like that a rebel. I don't wonder that his pupils adored him." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the long range shoot at Vieques, Iowas new {{executive}} officer, Commander John Morse, directed a main battery drill, {{over the objections of}} his gun crews, in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15° off the starboard side of the ship's bow. At this angle, one of Turret Two's guns was firing over Turret One. During the shoot, according to Turret Two's left gun captain, Jack Thompson, one of the powder bags in the left gun began to smolder before the breechlock was closed. Thompson said that he was barely able to close and latch the breechlock before the gun discharged on its own. The concussion from Turret Two's guns shredded Turret One's gun bloomers (the canvas covers {{at the base of the}} main gun barrels) and damaged Turret One's electrical system. Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was [...] "the most frightening experience <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in my life. The shock wave blew out the turret officer's switchboard and the leads. We had no power, no lights for a time. Men were screaming. There was panic." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{especially}} appreciated by filmmakers and film critics {{associated with the}} French New Wave movement. André Bazin said [...] "as a conventional love story, the film {{could have been a}} success if the scenario had respected the rules of the movie game. But Renoir wanted to make his own style of drame gai, and the mixture of genres proved disconcerting to the public." [...] Film critic Claude Beylie called it [...] "the cornerstone of the work of Jean Renoir, the point of arrival and the swan song of the French cinema of the thirties...The Rules of the Game is a rare combination of satire, vaudeville and tragedy." [...] It was a major source of inspiration for Alain Resnais, who said seeing the film was [...] "the single most overwhelming experience <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> at the cinema";and [...] Louis Malle, who said [...] "for all of us, my generation of French filmmakers, La Regle du jeu was the absolute masterpiece." [...] François Truffaut articulated the film's enormous influence and said [...] "it isn't an accident that The Rules of the Game inspired a large number of young people who had first thought of expressing themselves as novelists to take up careers as filmmakers." [...] He also said [...] "It is the credo of movie lovers, the film of films, the film most hated when it was made and most appreciated afterwards, {{to the extent that it}} ultimately became a true commercial success." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{season finale}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it [...] "was hands {{down one of}} the most satisfying hours of television <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> the pleasure of watching," [...] explaining that it created [...] "entirely new dynamics" [...] for the fourth season, hit [...] "all major beats," [...] and had [...] "real story progression" [...] and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. And I know that it sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care. I am what I am – a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a [...] "good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam’s closeup reaction to Jim’s return during her interview was–like everything Jenna Fischer does on this show–winning and sweet." [...] Poniewozik disliked how the season left Karen, calling it [...] "an uncharacteristic way to end this love triangle, which was distinguished by the writers’ refusal to make anyone the bad guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} attacks are {{considered}} to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that {{he was planning to}} [...] "crown himself king" [...] and [...] "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne". However, Peter Shaw has argued that: [...] "he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) at the time he wrote 'Davila', though he did not directly reveal this in its essays. Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life." [...] In contradiction to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson: [...] "If you suppose that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Variety, Noel Holston said [...] " [...] is smarter and freakier {{than most of}} the prime-time {{animated}} series that have popped up in the past year." [...] Furthermore, most of the first season DVD reviews were positive towards the series as being one of the best American comedy shows. In a DVD review by Bill Treadway for DVD Verdict, he called the show [...] "the best animated American comedy since The Simpsons, it is a claim I stand behind." [...] Treadway said the show is [...] "accessible to all" [...] that [...] "adults will enjoy the witty satire and sly in-jokes subtly inserted into every episode." [...] He also mentioned that [...] "children will love the bright colors, spunky pace, and lively characters" [...] and that [...] "parents will {{not have to worry about}} violence or crude humor." [...] Jason Bovberg of DVD Talk called SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "the coolest Saturday morning cartoon since the heyday of Warner Bros." [...] In a separate review for the season's DVD release, Bovberg [...] "highly recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "I love the show so much, I can't see any way around giving this one a recommendation." [...] Bovberg was particular on the exclusion of the pilot episode [...] "Help Wanted", saying [...] "But why is 'Help Wanted' missing? I suppose I'll have to buy a [...] "theme" [...] disc down the road to secure that one. Sigh." [...] Furthermore, he described it as [...] "the only disappointment of the set." [...] Ron J. Epstein, also from DVD Talk, said that the character of SpongeBob is [...] "one of the strangest cartoon characters <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> the pleasure to watch." [...] He said that [...] "Unlike most cartoons today, SpongeBob SquarePants caters to both a child and an adult audience." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013's Gangster Squad, a crime thriller, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD {{officer who}} {{attempts}} to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in Crazy, Stupid Love. Stone {{has said she}} hopes they will find more projects to work together on. A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film {{as an excuse for}} the cast [...] "to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess." [...] Christy Lemire of the Boston Globe criticized Gosling's [...] "weird, whispery voice" [...] and his [...] "barely developed, one-note" [...] character. However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that there was [...] "a seductive power" [...] in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: [...] "But like too much else in the film, it's a scenario that is only half played out." [...] In The Place Beyond the Pines, a generational drama directed by Blue Valentines Derek Cianfrance, Gosling portrayed Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks to provide for his family. The shoot was described by Gosling as [...] "the best experience <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> making a film." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times praised the performance: [...] "Mr. Gosling’s cool self-possession— the only thing he was allowed to display in “Drive”— is complicated, made interesting, by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability." [...] Scott Foundas of The Village Voice was unimpressed: [...] "Gosling's character verges on parody ... Gosling uses a soft, wounded half-whisper that tells us this is all some kind of put-on ... It's a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refn's existential Hollywood thriller, Drive, where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker remarked that he [...] "reprises his inexorable-loner routine". The film has grossed $35 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision...
