25|$|The {{application}} of human security is highly relevant within {{the area of}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention,</b> as it focuses on addressing the deep rooted and multi-factorial problems inherent in humanitarian crises, and offers more long term resolutions. In general, the term <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> generally applies to when a state uses force against another state in order to alleviate suffering in the latter state (See, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in {{international}} affairs is varied. As discussed above, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is a contentious issue. Examples of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> illustrate, {{that in some cases}} intervention can lead to disastrous results, as in Srebrenica and Somalia. In other cases, a lack of clarity as to the rules of when intervention can occur has resulted in tragic inaction, as was witnessed during the Rwandan genocide. One example is of a successful <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> and also of humanitarian principles being applied is East Timor which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> but also an effective application of human security principles.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> has seen {{increased}} interest {{especially since the}} end of the Cold War. During the last two decades, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> have been at the centre of the emerging doctrine of the responsibility to protect. Through collecting and analysing the United Nations documents and historical experience, this thesis concludes that within contemporary representation of the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions,</b> inaction is not a viable answer to mass violations of human rights. However, as the case of Darfur shows, this renewed commitment towards collective action has not been translated into actions yet. The practice of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> and the role of the United Nations need to be consolidated so that the inconsistency and selectivity objections are eradicated...|$|R

25|$|The report {{illustrates}} {{the usefulness of}} the human security approach, particularly its ability to examine the cause of conflicts that explain and justify <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> In addition, it could also act as a paradigm for identifying, prioritizing and resolving large transnational problems, one of the fundamental factors that act as a stimulus for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in the first place. However, human security still faces difficulties concerning the scope of its applicability, as large problems requiring <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> usually are built up from an array of socio-political, cultural and economic problems that may be beyond the limitations of humanitarian projects. On the other hand, successful examples of the use of human security principles within interventions can be found.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{traditional}} security paradigm <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is contentious. As discussed above, {{the traditional}} security paradigm places {{emphasis on the}} notion of states. Hence, the principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention that are paramount in the traditional security paradigm make it difficult to justify the intervention of other states in internal disputes. Through the development of clear principles based on the human security concept, there has been a step forward in the development of clear rules of when <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> can occur and the obligations of states that intervene in the internal disputes of a state.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the determinants of livelihood vulnerability and exploring the connections between <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> and adaptation response to reduce climate vulnerability in Coastal Char Kukri Mukri union, Char fasson, Bhola, Bangladesh. Predominantly, <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> are aimed to ameliorate the human suffering with the "build back better" response. However, humanitarian actors are increasingly focusing on short term <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> rather adaptation to climate change. In the dilemma of short-term to long-term interventions play a critical role from saving lives to the capacity building of the community. To examine the interconnections between <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> and vulnerability, the study used a framework combining adaptation, institutions and livelihood perspectives with elements of community based adaptation (CBA). Moreover, the study employed qualitative research methods and explored through both PRA based focus group discussions and climate risk screening tools of affected livelihood resources to gain insight into the process of short-term emergency humanitarian relief to long-term adaption to climate hazards. In the dilemma of emergency relief and adaptation response, there remains a gap in the understanding of how institutions influence the transformation of short-term coping capacities to long-term adaptation among different livelihood groups. <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> have important implications for livelihoods, yet long-term adaptation should involve more households in the adaptation processes to reduce the vulnerability to climate hazards in the community. Findings suggest that, short- term <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> have important implications for livelihoods; yet long term adaptation should involve more households to enhance adaptive capacity in the study area of Char Kukri Mukri. Nevertheless, interventions should support the adaptation process beyond emergency relief on saving lives. M-D...|$|R
25|$|In September 2001 the Canadian {{government}} {{established an}} ad-hoc committee {{to address this}} balance between State sovereignty and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty published its final report in 2001, which focused not {{on the right of}} states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk. The report moved beyond the question of military intervention, arguing that a range of diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilized to protect civilian populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{humanitarian}} {{situation was}} not as acute in the other nations bordering Rwanda, though still very challenging.

25|$|The {{stipulation}} {{in favor}} of Armenian autonomy in the treaty of Berlin produced an immediate change. Unfortunately there were special difficulties for {{the realization of the}} so-called Ottoman liberal political program that could end with what article stipulated. For one thing not all the Armenians were under the Ottoman Empire. As the population considered, there was Armenians in the Russian Empire approaching to 900,000 at the nineteenth century. Ottoman subjects amounting perhaps to 1,200,000, were distributed through the six vilayets of Sivas, Bitlis, Erzerum, Harput, Diabekir, and Van. In some of these districts, they had the highest ethnic minority, among the Turks, Greeks, Assyrians, Jews, and Kurds but Armenians failed to represent more than %50 percent, a clear majority, in any district with which they were associated. Besides other difficulties, Armenians perceived the conditions of treaty (Article LXI) of Berlin as an early realization of their autonomy, if the powers should have proceeded straightway to enforce the Armenian provision. The rationalization of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> depended also to the Cyprus Convention besides the Treaty of Berlin, 1878. In 1879, one year of after the agreements, the only thing missing was the practical events to enable the articles for the demand of an Armenian state.|$|E
500|$|Sierra Leone also {{encouraged}} Blair's policy of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> Critics claimed that it led Blair to see military force as [...] "just another foreign policy option" [...] {{and that the}} apparent ease of the success shifted his focus towards {{the effectiveness of the}} use of force rather than the political and military risks. In his autobiography, Blair described the operation as one of the least-discussed aspects of his time in office {{but one of the things}} of which he is most proud. He was keen to intervene in other African nations where civilian populations were at risk, particularly Darfur and Zimbabwe, but a lack of political support, combined with the pressure of large deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq after the 11 September attacks on the United States, prevented further interventions in Africa. It was not until 2011—when Operation Ellamy was launched as part of a multi-national intervention in Libya—that the United Kingdom undertook another military intervention in Africa.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{barriers}} {{to the implementation of}} the Responsibility to Protect principle is the lack of a political will. Public attitudes towards intervention will have a crucial impact on elite willingness to prevent mass atrocities, yet we have little understanding of the factors that influence those attitudes. This article provides the first examination of UK public perceptions about the moral justifiability and effectiveness of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions.</b> The article shows that decisions about justifiability and effectiveness are very different. Attitudes towards justification were more easily explained suggesting that judgements about effectiveness are more contextual and less easily accounted for by individuals’ background characteristics and attitudes. Experiences with both Iraq and Afghanistan have contaminated public perceptions of both the ethics and effectiveness of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions.</b> Although the public is broadly supportive about the justifiability of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> they are extremely sceptical about the likelihood that those interventions will be successful...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{consequently}} welfarist criterion for morally justified <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> is developed {{and illustrated by}} its application to the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo. The criterion is justified {{on the basis of}} a historical conception of moral norms ("progressive norm welfarism"), which tells moral subjects to obey the morally good among the norms currently in force and encourages subjects to morally improve this stock of norms. According to this conception, properly restricted and regulated <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> (exact conditions are provided in section 7) can be a morally good means in extreme situations; and practising them in the current situation, even without UN authorisation, can be seen, besides the aspect of direct helping, as a policy to socially establish a morally good norm (in certain conditions to be obligated to help by <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions).</b> This was the case in the Kosovo intervention, as a rough empirical analysis shows...|$|R

500|$|The {{risks of}} Operation Barras were {{acknowledged}} by the MoD and by officers {{involved in the}} planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong". Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties where they felt the cause was just. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that [...] " [...] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [...] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept {{the rule of law and}} the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have [...] "raised questions" [...] regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b>|$|E

40|$|Why do interstate interventions, {{even when}} {{carried out with}} the best of intentions, so often fail to contain {{conflicts}} and support a peaceful settlement? We argue that the extent of local participation exerts a strong effect on the prospects for successful peace-building and reconstruction efforts in the wake of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions.</b> Even though the population in target countries may sympathize with the goal of the intervention, local populations are unlikely to feel a personal attachment to a solution externally imposed unless actively consulted or involved in the <b>intervention</b> strategy. <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> without some form of local participation are likely to create cognitive dissonance among the local population between the outcome and the means chosen to implement it. We evaluate our hypotheses about the relationship between local involvement and successful post-conflict reconstruction by looking at variation in conflict and local involvement over time in two <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions,</b> Bosnia (1991 – 95) and Somalia (1987 – 97). Consistent with our hypotheses about how lack of local involvement can undermine post-conflict reconstruction efforts in the wake of interventions, we find that phases with more local involvement are associated with lower levels of conflict. ...|$|R
