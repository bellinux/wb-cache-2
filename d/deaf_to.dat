5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man {{has given way}} to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E
5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E

5|$|Malini is an indigent {{woman whose}} father is in poor health. She is persuaded by her friend Sundari, an actress, {{to join her}} theatre company, Kala Mandhiram. Malini soon becomes very {{successful}} and popular. She is later befriended by Sampath, a charlatan, who is regularly involved in dodging creditors. <b>Deaf</b> <b>to</b> all advice, Malini allows herself to be led astray in professional, financial and moral terms. She is put out of Kala Mandhiram and sets up a theatre company of her own where Sampath appoints himself as general manager. She also severs ties with those who previously helped her, including Sundari. At first, the new company prospers, but its resources are soon squandered by Sampath and it falls under a weight of debt and disgrace. Sampath abandons Malini, who falls back to her previous poor condition. However, with Sundari's help, she returns to Kala Mandhiram and begins her life anew.|$|E
25|$|Several {{influential}} {{people of}} the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as {{something that should be}} eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort, they could teach the <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded. Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing Deaf culture.|$|E

The owner, who is treated as the polong's parent, must feed the spirit daily with blood from their neck. A {{person who has been}} afflicted by the polong will cry out and wildly strike at people nearby, all the while blind and <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> their surroundings, and unconscious of what they are doing. In such cases, a bomoh would be called into question the polong and find out who is its parent and where they are located. If the polong lies or conceals the identity of its owner, the victim will die after one or two days.|$|E

500|$|Getty's {{relationship}} with his own party was often stormy. [...] Shortly after he lost his riding in 1989, a group of Calgary Conservatives, including party budget director Jack Major and Getty's old leadership rival Ron Ghitter, began making plans to force party renewal, with or without Getty. [...] They felt that the party was perceived as being tired, directionless, arrogant, and <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> urban concerns, {{and that it was}} in political trouble in the crucial battleground of Calgary. [...] At the 1989 party convention, recently retired cabinet minister Marvin Moore, who had organized Ghitter's 1985 leadership campaign, advocated for a leadership review; after a speech by Getty, the convention voted to refer the recommendation to a committee for months of study. [...] Cabinet ministers, including Treasurer Dick Johnston and Education Minister Jim Dinning, began to consider leadership bids in the event that Getty retired or was pushed out.|$|E
500|$|When Nixon died in 1994, {{his daughters}} invited Agnew {{to attend the}} funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; {{over the years he}} had {{rejected}} various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. [...] "I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside", he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: [...] "I am not blind or <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve.

500|$|Abbott, {{unfamiliar}} with the Court of King's Bench (having been a regional lawyer rather than a London-based one), was initially a disappointment, but soon improved. By 1818 he showed [...] "the highest judicial excellence", although he was criticised for snapping at boring barristers and for taking the government's side in prosecutions. That year, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Ellenborough had a stroke, forcing his retirement. Most of the other judges and legal figures were inappropriate for the role; Sir Samuel Shepherd, for example, was while an able lawyer too <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> sit as a judge. As a result, Abbott was appointed, and formally took up his position on 4 November 1818. As Lord Chief Justice he saw the Court of King's Bench flourish, with competent Justices and his own abilities; [...] " [...] had more knowledge of mankind than any of , and was more skilful as a moderator in forensic disputation". Abbott's central weakness as a judge was seen to be his support of James Scarlett, his leader when Abbott was a barrister; [...] "The timid junior, become Chief Justice, still looked up to his old leader with dread, was afraid of offending him, and was always delighted when he could decide in his favour".|$|E
500|$|The film {{contains}} further self-referential material, as a {{film about}} a writer having difficulty writing (written by the Coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing Miller's Crossing). Barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and Capitol Pictures' need to use its standard conventions to earn profits. Audrey's advice about following the formula would have saved Barton, {{but he does not}} heed it. However, when he puts the mysterious package on his writing desk (which might have contained her head), she might have been helping him posthumously, in other ways. The movie itself toys with standard screenplay formulas. As with Mayhew's scripts, Barton Fink contains a [...] "good wrestler" [...] (Barton, it seems) and a [...] "bad wrestler" [...] (Charlie) who [...] "confront" [...] each other at the end. But in typical Coen fashion, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and the supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> the pleadings of his [...] "common man" [...] neighbor. By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience, the film subverts the [...] "simple morality tales" [...] and [...] "road maps" [...] offered to Barton as easy paths for the writer to follow.|$|E
500|$|Debut {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general. In 2013, John Hamilton of Idolator called the album [...] "highly influential", and wrote [...] "in spite of its advancing age, Debuts futurism has aged exquisitely." [...] The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote: [...] "House music didn't quite have critical respect before Björk came along, and plenty of American writers didn't know what to make of the sound of Debut when it came out. [...] Debut didn't just establish Björk; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music-dork universe that might've remained <b>deaf</b> <b>to</b> its charms otherwise. At this point, it's virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance-pop album for [...] "cheap electronic gimmickry," [...] and Debut is a big part of that change." [...] Celebrating the album's twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album [...] "put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter." [...] Dubbing it an [...] "influential masterpiece", she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: [...] "It's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you'll find [...] influence — not, as many would have you believe, in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice." [...] Mackay also noted that the album's legacy echoes through dance-pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn.|$|E
5000|$|Sign {{language}} is {{often viewed as}} a language subordinate to spoken language.
