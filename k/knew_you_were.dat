[...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars.
