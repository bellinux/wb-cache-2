5|$|Dzungariotherium orgosensis was {{described}} in 1973 based on fossilsmainly teethfrom Dzungaria in Xinjiang, northwest China. In 2017, a new species, P. huangheense, was named based on jaw elements from the Hanjiajing Formation in the Gansu Province of China; the name refers to the nearby Huanghe River. P. huangheense differs from P. bugtiense only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, {{as well as its}} larger size. A multitude of other species and genus namesmostly based on differences in size, snout shape, and front tooth arrangementhave been coined for various indricothere remains. Fossils attributable to Paraceratherium continue to be discovered across Eurasia, but the political situation in Pakistan <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> unstable for further excavations to occur there.|$|E

His father Tirupathi Naidu was a rice trader and his mother Veera Veni was a homemaker. Sukumar {{was the youngest of}} the six children of Naidu and Veni. At the age of 6, following the slaughter of a rooster he loved, Sukumar began practising vegetarianism. He did his schooling from a Zilla Parishad High School, Razole and graduated with a master's degree in mathematics. He later worked as a mathematics and physics lecturer in Aditya Junior college, Kakinada. After six years, Sukumar and his junior Prakash Toleti decided to do something creative as they opined that their life <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> mundane as a lecturer.|$|E

The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed.

5|$|Having {{staged a}} coup of New York after {{spreading}} his resources by exploiting Otto's reliance on technology, the Goblin King directly confronts Otto, angry {{that he was}} cheated out {{of the opportunity to}} defeat his enemy, but offering Otto the chance to join him. Otto rejects the offer, but when he finds that he cannot win against the Goblin King's resources, having had his new allies abandon him, and with his faith in his own abilities gone, he sacrifices himself to restore the original Spider-Man's mind. When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, the Goblin King quickly realizes that the original personality is back in control when Spider-Man responds to his nemesis' taunts with his own wisecracks. In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Goblin King, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as the CEO of Alchemax and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that Norman Osborn <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> publicly known as a supervillain. Spider-Man defeats and strips the villain of his powers with a serum devised by Otto, but Norman manages to escape through the discreet aid of Liz Allan. In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared for him when he returns with his new identity and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Green Goblin formula.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> commercialized.|$|E

500|$|Windsor {{has been}} {{described}} as the biggest [...] "name" [...] that EastEnders has ever added to its cast, and her arrival came at a time in the show's history that has been branded its [...] "worst creative period". Mark Lawson for The Independent wrote that Windsor's casting was intended to combat low ratings, commenting: [...] "The Windsor initiative seems to be a direct response to suggestions that EastEnders <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> gloomy: a view heavily advanced by Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader of the Labour Party, and fan of the BBC series' rival on ITV, Coronation Street. Certainly, Miss Windsor has been associated throughout her career with the lighter touch." [...] According to Windsor, 27 million viewers watched her first appearance as Peggy on-screen. Mark Lawson for The Daily Telegraph has stated that five million extra viewers watched her first scenes, reporting that initially: [...] "The critics said that she lacked the 'brassiness and vulnerability' for soap acting and that, stripped of her bubbly image, 'nothing much of interest was revealed'. Ironically, viewers complained that she was too upmarket." [...] Windsor has commented of the impact of her pre-existing celebrity status: ...|$|E
500|$|The Hall of Fame {{has been}} criticized for {{inducting}} several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to [...] "a shortage of true greatness". Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> exclusive. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League. A common statement is that it is more of an [...] "NHL Hall of Fame" [...] than a general Hockey Hall of Fame. Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame opened an International Hockey exhibit and announced that it would start looking at more international players for induction. Valeri Kharlamov was inducted in 2005, {{and is one of the}} few modern-day inductees to never play in the NHL. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking World Hockey Association players and over representing the Original Six era from 1942 to 1967. For several years, the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration. In 2010, Angela James and Cammi Granato were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|Whilst Gwen by {{the third}} series has become a more militant character, Rhys retains his everyman status and takes {{on the role of}} {{audience}} surrogate; press material describes him as [...] "the ordinary guy in the street" [...] and [...] "the normal person's eyes and ears" [...] who [...] "says what he thinks about the situations Torchwood find themselves in, bringing the reality back to them". Paul Collins comments of the significance of Rhys having the first dialogue in the serial, remarking that this is Torchwoods [...] "determination to establish its domestic credentials before subverting them". Rhys becomes a reluctant hero; Kai Owen states that he [...] "would rather not get involved if he had the choice", but when faced with the life-or-death situations in the serial [...] "he doesn't run away from it" [...] because the character has [...] "seen so many things". This, in Owen's eyes, makes the Rhys seen in Children of Earth a [...] "very brave hero who has grown in stature". Rhys retains core character status for the fourth series, [...] Whilst Kai Owen explains that Rhys will always be at the forefront of [...] "Gwen's troubles or fights or adventures" [...] because of his concern for her, he remains unafraid to tell her when she <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> consumed by her job. Davies links the relationship between Gwen and Rhys in the fourth series to the show's continued exploration of human sexuality, stating that [...] "open sexuality has to include everything" [...] including [...] "a husband/wife great big crime-fighting team... happily in love".|$|E

500|$|Rivera {{achieved}} {{a reputation as}} an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers. Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him [...] "the best ever, no doubt", while Trevor Hoffman said he [...] "will go down as the best reliever in the game in history". Torre said, [...] "He's the best I've ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse." [...] Writer Tom Verducci said, [...] "Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position {{in the history of}} baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer." [...] He compared Rivera's reputation for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, [...] "Clearly unequivocally, he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did {{it in a way that}} was remarkable." [...] Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said, [...] "He's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he was out there. I've never seen anyone who could affect a game like that." [...] Gossage said that Rivera [...] "might be the greatest closer of all-time" [...] but suggested that the modern closer's job <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning [...] "firemen" [...] from Gossage's era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America has historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of Fame, sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first year of eligibility. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players.|$|E

[...] In Barnyard Scene, Rockman depicts a raccoon mating with a rooster, and Jungle Fever shows a praying mantis mating with a chipmunk. [...] In the Biosphere series of paintings, Rockman alludes to the Biosphere 2 project in Arizona and envisions {{a situation where the}} Earth <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> toxic for human life, so life only exists in strangely mutated forms inside geodesic-dome structures. [...] Biosphere uses references from science fiction cinema, particularly the opening scene of the 1971 film Silent Running, as well as Stanley Kubrick's 2001, and Ridley Scott's Alien. [...] Biosphere: The Ocean (1994), influenced by H. R. Giger's work, depicts a shark with a long, bionic sawfish beak, suited for tearing through its food.|$|E

2500|$|Stovall {{remembers the}} events of 1942, when having {{recently}} arrived and been thrown into action, the 918th had gained the reputation of a [...] "hard luck group" [...] suffering from poor morale. One reason is the strategy of daylight precision bombing of German targets and the corresponding losses to anti-aircraft fire and enemy aircraft. The commander, Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill), <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> close to his men to instil discipline. When he is ordered to fly a mission at low altitude to increase accuracy, Davenport rushes to headquarters and confronts his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations. His behavior prompts Savage to go to General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command (Millard Mitchell) {{and tell him that}} he feels Davenport may not be fit to command. Following a disastrous mission in which the 918th loses seven bombers, General Pritchard relieves Davenport of command and the 918th is given to Savage.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the nation's Founding Fathers {{expected}} the Congress, {{which was the}} first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive. However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> powerful, unchecked, unbalanced, and [...] "monarchist" [...] in nature. Critic Dana D. Nelson believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards [...] "undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies". She criticizes proponents of the unitary executive for expanding [...] "the many existing uncheckable executive powers – such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements – that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress". Activist Bill Wilson opined that the expanded presidency was [...] "the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule".|$|E
2500|$|There is {{very poor}} {{data on the}} {{practice}} of Honor killing (also known as honor violence) {{due to the fact}} that many do not get reported or happen in remote areas or are classified as a different form of crime. This is the situation for the international data and American data, but for American data, no national or state agency collects data on honor violence. However, the practice of honor killings do occur with the family committing acts of honor killing believing that the daughter <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> Westernized and/or after she has refused to follow traditional customs such as arranged marriages. For example, in Phoenix, Arizona, the police arrested a man for murder after he ran down his 20-year-old daughter for refusing to accept an arranged marriage to a man in the family's native country of Iraq. The prosecution of such crimes are carried out in the United States, but the crimes are not identified as honor killings under a form of law. It has been argued that the lack of using the label [...] "honor killings" [...] and instead using the all-encompassing label of [...] "domestic violence" [...] prevents the public from seeing the key differences between honor killings and domestic violence and also prevents any policies limiting and ultimately, putting an end, to the honor killings.|$|E
