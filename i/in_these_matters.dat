He liberalised the Indian economy, allowing it to speed up development dramatically. During his term as Prime Minister, Singh continued to encourage growth in the Indian market, enjoying widespread success <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters.</b> Singh, along with the former Finance Minister, P.

Any rule broken resulted in a fine of 10 to 1000 pounds of tobacco, depending on the offense.

25|$|In January 1932, Rundstedt was {{appointed}} commander of Wehrkreis III, based in Berlin, and also given {{command of the}} 3rd Infantry Division. This brought him, at 57, into the highest ranks of the German Army, reflected in his promotion to Lieutenant General (Generalleutnant). It also inevitably brought him into close contact with the political world, which was in a disturbed state due to the Great Depression and subsequent rise of Hitler's Nazi Party. The Defence Minister, General Kurt von Schleicher, was intriguing to bring the Nazis into the government, and the Chancellor, Franz von Papen, was planning to overthrow the Social Democrat government of Prussia, Germany's largest state. Despite his dislike of politics, Rundstedt could not remain uninvolved <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters.</b> In July 1932 Papen used his emergency powers to dismiss the Prussian Government. Martial law was briefly declared in Berlin and Rundstedt was made martial law plenipotentiary. He protested to Papen about this and martial law was lifted after a few days. In October Rundstedt was promoted to full General and given command of Gruppenkommando 1, covering the whole of eastern Germany.|$|E

[...] His performance <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters</b> resulted in his appointment as governor of Massachusetts in March 1757.

500|$|Harriet Fane married Rt Hon Charles Arbuthnot, {{member of}} Parliament, at Fulbeck on 31 January 1814. [...] Born in 1767, {{her husband was}} 26 {{years older than she}} was, an age {{difference}} which had initially caused her family to object to the marriage. Another of the principal obstacles to finalising the arrangements for the marriage was financial. Her widowed mother delegated the arrangements for the marriage of her 20-year-old daughter to her elder son Vere, a 46-year-old widower who was considered qualified <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters</b> as he worked at Child's Bank. [...] It seems that Vere Fane and his mother were not initially prepared to settle enough money on his sister to satisfy her future husband, causing the prospective bridegroom to write to his fiancée: [...] "How can you and I live upon £1000 or £1200 and Fane [...] finds it so impossible to live upon her £6000 that she can offer you no assistance whatsoever?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{months leading}} up to the {{introduction}} of the ban had also seen a particularly intense period of Troubles-related violence. One of the bloodiest episodes of that time was the Ballygawley bus bombing which resulted in the deaths of several British soldiers. Another incident, the killing of two off-duty British soldiers who drove into an IRA funeral procession, brought the media into conflict with the government after journalists present at the funeral declined a Royal Ulster Constabulary request to hand over footage of the incident amid concerns doing so would put them at risk. In response the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, told the House of Commons journalists had a [...] "bounden duty" [...] to assist with the investigation. [...] "Either one is on the side of justice <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters</b> or one is on the side of terrorism".

500|$|Congregationalism {{became known}} as the [...] "New England Way", based on a {{membership}} limited to saved believers and a separation from all other churches in matters of government. Congregationalists wanted each church to have its own governance, but they generally opposed separation from the established Church of England. [...] The Puritans continued to view the Anglican Church as being the true church but needing reform from within. [...] Cotton became the [...] "chief helmsman" [...] for the Massachusetts Puritans in establishing congregationalism in New England, with his qualities of piety, learning, and mildness of temper. [...] Several of his books and much of his correspondence dealt with church polity, and one of his key sermons on the subject was his Sermon Deliver'd at Salem in 1636, given in the church that was forced to expel Roger Williams. [...] Cotton disagreed with Williams' separatist views, and he had hoped to convince him of his errors before his banishment. [...] His sermon in Salem was designed to keep the Salem church from moving further towards separation from the English church. [...] He felt that the church and the state should be separate to a degree but that they should be intimately related. [...] He considered the best organization for the state to be a Biblical model from the Old Testament. [...] He did not see democracy as being an option for the Massachusetts government, but instead felt that a theocracy would be the best model. It was <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters</b> that Roger Williams strongly disagreed with Cotton.|$|E
