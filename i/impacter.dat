40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} the relevance of <b>impacter</b> shape to nonvisible damage and tensile residual strength of a 36 mm (1. 4 in.) thick graphite/epoxy motor case. The shapes of the impacters were as follows: 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in.) and 25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.) diameter hemispheres, a sharp corner, and a 6. 3 mm (0. 25 in.) diameter bolt-like rod. The investigation revealed that damage initiated when the contact pressure exceeded a critical level. However, the damage was not visible on the surface until an even higher pressure was exceeded. The damage on the surface consisted of a crater shaped like the <b>impacter,</b> and the damage below the surface consisted of broken fibers. The impact energy to initiate damage or cause visible damage on the surface increased approximately with <b>impacter</b> diameter to the third power. The reduction in strength for nonvisible damage increased with increasing diameter, 9 and 30 percent for the 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in.) and 25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.) diameter hemispheres, respectively.
