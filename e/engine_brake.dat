25|$|The BMW i3 has two pedals {{like all}} cars with {{automatic}} transmission. The accelerator pedal acts as both accelerator and <b>engine</b> <b>brake.</b> When the driver releases the pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy is regenerated by the vehicle drivetrain to recharge the battery. This {{has the effect}} of slowing the car down. During the field testing of the Mini E, which features an accelerator that recharges the battery in this way, and consists of brakes that only apply to the rear wheels, BMW has learned that drivers tend to rely on the engine brake: around 75% of all deceleration maneuvers are initiated without the brake pedal in urban traffic areas. BMW also expected the i3 to use the same type of battery and powertrain that is being tested in the BMW ActiveE trials.|$|E
5000|$|VEB The Volvo <b>Engine</b> <b>Brake</b> is a {{compression}} type <b>engine</b> <b>brake</b> {{first introduced}} on D12A and since used on later designed OHC engines from 9 to 16 litre displacement. The brake operates on a principle where exhaust valve cam followers acts on secondary cam profile when <b>engine</b> <b>brake</b> is activated. Engine oil pressure {{is used to}} eliminate extra valve clearance thus this action forces the follower against secondary lobes and unseating exhaust valves temporarily to achieve so-called compression bleeding as employed by similar systems from Jacobs, Cummins and Mack however Volvo system has an extra cam lobe thus giving two openings of the exhaust valves and is designed to work in conjunction with an exhaust brake so two of the engine's four strokes are used to raise engine braking effect - Exhaust and Compression strokes.|$|E

50|$|Although Jake brake {{properly}} {{refers to}} the Jacobs brand of <b>engine</b> <b>brakes,</b> the term has become a genericized trademark and {{is often used to}} refer to <b>engine</b> <b>brakes</b> or compression release <b>engine</b> <b>brakes</b> in general, especially on large vehicles or heavy equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>braking</b> avoids wear on brakes, and {{can help}} a driver {{maintain}} control of the vehicle. Active use of <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> by shifting into a lower gear is can help control speed while driving down very steep and long slopes, saving the brakes from overheating or excessive wear. If it is applied before the brakes have been used, it can leave the brakes available to make emergency stops. The desired speed is maintained by using <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> to counteract gravitational acceleration. Potentially transmission wear caused by <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> can be mitigated by certain techniques. Slipping the clutch to complete a downshift wears the clutch plate as it slows the vehicle, doing {{the job of the}} brake pads or shoes. A well-executed rev-match in the same setting minimizes stresses on transmission components, so <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> does the work of slowing the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>braking</b> in a premix {{two-stroke}} engine {{can be extremely}} harmful to the engine, because cylinder and piston lubricant is delivered to each cylinder mixed with fuel. Consequently, during <b>engine</b> <b>braking,</b> the <b>engine</b> starves not only of fuel but also lubricant, causing accelerated wear. Many old two-stroke cars (Saab, Wartburg, etc.) had a freewheel device on the transmission to make <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> optional. Most two-stroke motorcycle engines since the 1970s have had lubrication by an oil pump, independent of the throttle and fuel system, such as Suzuki's Posi-Force system.|$|R

50|$|A {{compression}} release <b>engine</b> <b>brake,</b> frequently called a Jake Nett brake or Jacobs brake, is an engine braking mechanism installed on some diesel engines. When activated, it opens exhaust valves in the cylinders after the compression cycle, releasing the compressed air {{trapped in the}} cylinders, and slowing the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The truck has {{drum brakes}} on all wheels. The air brake system is {{hydraulically}} actuated, allowing for soft braking even when cold. A proportioning load device adjusts rear brake force to different loads. In addition, the 1017 has a spring-loaded parking brake {{on the rear}} wheels and a wear-free pneumatic <b>engine</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E

50|$|When activated, the Jacobs <b>Engine</b> <b>Brake</b> {{opens the}} exhaust valves {{near the top}} of the {{compression}} stroke, releasing the highly compressed air through the exhaust system. Little energy is returned to the piston, and as the cycle repeats, the energy of the trucks forward motion is dissipated, causing the truck to slow down.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was also}} the similar NS Class 500.

50|$|In April 1960, Jacobs Manufacturing Company {{made the}} {{decision}} to establish its new Clessie L.

5000|$|The Torsen-based quattro {{system also}} offers an advantage, in the {{opposite}} function of distributing torque to the road wheels, namely <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b> When <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> is used to slow the car down, with Torsen-based systems, the resulting [...] "reverse-torque" [...] loads {{on the front and}} rear axle are equally stabilised, {{in exactly the same way}} that engine [...] "propulsion" [...] torque is apportioned fully mechanically autonomously. This allows the spreading of the <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> effect to all four wheels and tyres. The Torsen-based quattro-equipped vehicle is able to execute a more stable high-speed turn under deceleration, with less risk of losing control due to loss of grip in the front or rear axles.|$|R

50|$|Technically the I-Shift is an unsynchronised manual gearbox, with an {{electronic}} control unit, responsible for controlling the pneumatic system that handles the clutch and shifts. It constantly receives information about vehicle speed, acceleration, weight, road grade, torque demand and more, and can adjust revs and <b>engine</b> <b>brake</b> effect. The I-Shift uses different software for different type of application.|$|E
5000|$|Units are {{equipped}} with two MAN six-cylinder engines of [...] per motor vehicle. Each train has four engines for traction, giving a total power of [...] The engines drive a hydromechanical Voith transmission.Additionally each vehicle also includes a [...] Perkins/Mecalte diesel generator for auxiliaries (lighting, air conditioning, door controls, etc..). The braking system is provided by mechanical disc brakes coupled to a hydrodynamic <b>engine</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{includes}} a new <b>engine</b> <b>brake</b> system, the Dual Power Brake (DPB) {{fed into the}} cylinder head, is electronically integrated into the turbocharger. [...] It is claimed that the advantages are: increasing the operational average speed, the brake force, safety, retaking with fuel reduction, and speed on downward slopes. [...] This means less gear shifts, lower maintenance costs, and helps improve the service life of the brakes and tyres.|$|E
50|$|Diesel engines do {{not have}} <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> in the above sense. Unlike {{gasoline}} engines, diesel engines vary fuel flow to control power, rather than throttling air intake and maintaining a constant fuel ratio as gasoline engines do. Because they do not maintain a throttle vacuum, they are not subjected to the same <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> effects. This is partly why non-turbo diesel engined vehicles can coast in-gear for longer than an equivalent gasoline engine.|$|R
50|$|Improper <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> {{technique}} {{can cause}} the wheels to skid (also called shift-locking), especially on slippery surfaces such as ice or snow, {{as a result of}} too much deceleration. As in a skid caused by overbraking, the vehicle will not regain traction until the wheels are allowed to turn more quickly. If the driver reduces <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> by shifting back up, or disengaging the clutch on a manual transmission, traction can be regained.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic retarders are {{extremely}} quiet, often inaudible {{over the sound}} of a running engine, and are especially quiet in operation compared to <b>engine</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Its Multi Turbo System (MTS) turbine with {{variable}} vane geometry, is electronically controlled. [...] This helps achieve faster responses, better performance, {{and better}} thermal efficiency. [...] This also works {{as part of}} the <b>engine</b> <b>brake</b> retarder in the exhaust system. [...] The water-cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, coupled with the cylinder block, reutilises part of the exhaust gasses, producing combustion at lower temperatures with less discharge rates.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{the engine}} went from {{carburetion}} to fuel injection, and the <b>engine</b> <b>brake</b> control system {{was replaced with}} an Idle Control System that automatically adjusted the throttle valve opening {{on two of the}} four cylinders to improve stability and handling during deceleration. M1 riders were Checa, Alex Barros, Olivier Jacque, Marco Melandri, Shinya Nakano and Norifumi Abe, and there were no wins and Yamaha came in third in the manufacturers' championship.|$|E
50|$|Brake-by-wire {{exists on}} heavy duty {{commercial}} vehicles {{under the name}} Electronic Braking System (EBS). This system provides electronic activation of all braking system components including retarder and <b>engine</b> <b>brake.</b> EBS also supports trailers and communicates between the towing vehicle and trailer using the ISO 11992 protocol. The communication between trailer and towing vehicle shall be done through a specific connector dedicated to ABS/EBS following either ISO 7638-1 for 24V systems or ISO 7638-2 for 12V systems.|$|E
50|$|Contrast a petrol engine, {{where the}} {{mechanics}} are different {{and a special}} valve is not necessary for <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> to occur when the driver releases the accelerator. In a gasoline engine, when the accelerator is released, the throttle prevents {{the free flow of}} air into the cylinders, so there is little pressure to release {{at the top of the}} compression stroke. The closed throttle provides <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> by forcing the engine to generate a vacuum between the throttle and the cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>braking</b> is a {{generally}} accepted practice {{and can help}} save wear on friction brakes. It is even used in some motor sports {{to reduce the risk}} of the friction brakes overheating. Additionally, fuel injected engines generally don't use any fuel while <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b> This is known as DFCO or Deceleration Fuel Cut-Off. It can be used as the coast part of Burn and Coast, though coasting in neutral is generally more efficient [...] and engine off coasting is always more efficient.|$|R
5000|$|In hybrid {{electric}} vehicles, {{like the}} Toyota Prius, <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> is simulated {{by the computer}} software to match {{the feel of a}} traditional automatic transmission. For long downhill runs, the [...] "B" [...] mode acts like a lower gear, using higher rpm in the internal combustion engine to waste energy, preventing the battery from becoming overcharged. Almost all electric and hybrid vehicles are able to convert kinetic motion into electricity, i.e. regenerative brakes, {{but this is not the}} same as <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{freewheel}} {{also produces}} slightly better fuel economy on carbureted engines (without fuel turn-off on <b>engine</b> <b>brake)</b> and less wear on the manual clutch, but {{leads to more}} wear on the brakes {{as there is no}} longer any ability to perform engine braking. This may make freewheel transmissions dangerous for use on trucks and automobiles driven in mountainous regions, as prolonged and continuous application of brakes to limit vehicle speed soon leads to brake-system overheating followed shortly by total failure.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} used {{saturated steam}} and had Walschaerts valve gear with slide valves. Like many other Central African locomotives of the day, they were wood-burners and some modifications {{were required to}} adapt them to coal-burning on the SAR. In addition, their tenders and brake gear had been lost at sea {{and they had to}} be fitted with SAR tenders, which were pirated from unserviceable engines awaiting or undergoing repair. The required <b>engine</b> <b>brake</b> gear was designed in the Pretoria drawing office and manufactured in the Salvokop workshops.|$|E
50|$|Exhaust brakes are simpler in {{operation}} than an <b>engine</b> <b>brake.</b> Essentially, the exhaust pipe {{of the vehicle}} is restricted by a valve. This raises the pressure in the exhaust system, forcing the engine to work harder on the exhaust stroke of its cylinders, so again the engine is acting as an air compressor, with the power required to compress the air being withheld from the exhaust pipe, retarding the vehicle. Turbocharger retarders that restrict the flow of exhaust gas can also help in increasing the exhaust pressure {{to achieve the same}} objective.|$|E
5000|$|... i-ELOOP is {{a unique}} {{regenerative}} <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> system that uses the free wheeling alternator to capture energy when you lift your foot off the accelerator.|$|R
5000|$|Engine braking: The HSD {{system has}} a special {{transmission}} setting labelled 'B' (for Brake), that {{takes the place of}} a conventional automatic transmission's 'L' setting, providing <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> on hills. This can be manually selected in place of regenerative braking. During braking when the battery is approaching potentially damaging high charge levels, the electronic control system automatically switches to conventional <b>engine</b> <b>braking,</b> drawing power from MG2 and shunting it to MG1, speeding the engine with throttle closed to absorb energy and decelerate the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>engine's</b> air <b>brakes,</b> {{fitted in}} 1979, were {{modified}} {{so that the}} <b>engine's</b> <b>brakes</b> work {{in conjunction with the}} air brakes when hauling a train. Every valve and component was dismantled and overhauled, with the intention of making the locomotive as reliable as possible for the future. The engine was returned to traffic in July 2005, before aesthetic completion.|$|R
