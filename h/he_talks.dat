There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless <b>he</b> <b>talks.</b> The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{then goes}} to the Android's Dungeon, {{with only a few}} cents extra, where he runs into Milhouse and Martin. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> them into pooling their money and buying the comic book.

60|$|Northwick {{understood}} this {{too little to}} believe it; when <b>he</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> business; even the jokes among the men {{he was used to}} meant business.|$|R
60|$|And while <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> {{and watched}} her as <b>he</b> <b>talked,</b> she answered, and behind her {{listening}} watched and thought about him. She liked the animated eagerness of his manner.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Howard is summoned for {{astronaut}} training by NASA. After {{his first}} day of training, <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> to Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) via webcam; he vomited while experiencing microgravity.

60|$|Our first reunited Christmas-day was {{the most}} {{delightful}} one we have ever passed together. Jemmy was never silent for five minutes, except in church-time. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> as we sat by the fire, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> when we were out walking, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> as we sat by the fire again, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> incessantly at dinner, though he made a dinner almost as remarkable as himself. It was the spring of happiness in his fresh young heart flowing and flowing, and it fertilised (if I may be allowed so bold a figure) my much-esteemed friend, and J. J. the present writer.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>talked</b> {{swiftly and}} clearly, and as <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> {{one by one}} his officers' faces became alight with eagerness. When he had done, they cried as with one voice that he had saved them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt it. Most likely <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> Brown into signing {{it just as}} <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> us. I {{tell you}} his ways are all crooked, like his ideas. Did you hear how he lied about Miss Lindsay?" ...|$|R
5|$|Tsamere {{comes out}} of character, thanks the audience, writers and {{producers}} of the show, and explains that the preceding story is a fiction. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> about his stage fright and goes off on a tangent about the bulbs around mirrors in dressing rooms; he asks a row of the audience to stand repeatedly to check whether pillars in the theatre are load-bearing. He ends by saying {{that he does not}} need the mirror, as he does not wear make-up.|$|E

Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) quickly notices Glenn's nervousness, and when <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> privately to Glenn, Glenn blurts out about the walkers as well as his knowledge that Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) is pregnant. Dale confronts Hershel (Scott Wilson) about the walkers. Hershel believes they are still people, including his wife and stepson, and can be cured, and refuses to kill them after Dale explains the danger. Meanwhile, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Lori argue on what to do with Hershel's demand to leave the farm, now that Carl (Chandler Riggs) is healed.|$|E

She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves {{in the middle of}} the performance. Backstage, <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).|$|E
5000|$|Perry {{responded by}} stating that his films were meant as {{entertainment}} {{and should not be}} taken so seriously. Stated Perry, [...] "I am sick of him talking about me. I am sick of him saying, 'This is a coon, this is a buffoon.' I am sick of him talking about black people going to see movies. This is what he said: 'You vote by what you see'—as if black people don't know what they want to see. I am sick of him. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> about Whoopi, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about Oprah, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about me, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about Clint Eastwood. Spike needs to shut the hell up!" ...|$|R
5000|$|When Xander tells Buffy [...] "I'm gonna marry that girl", Buffy misunderstands him, {{thinking}} <b>he's</b> <b>talking</b> about Dawn before {{realizing that}} <b>he's</b> <b>talking</b> about Anya. In the comic continuation Xander and Dawn {{do in fact}} end up together.|$|R

At his house, Peter sends his photos to the Bugle and tries to give Aunt May the money, but she insists that he uses 10% of every paycheck to save for a new camera.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, Tom {{sees his}} son Matt asleep and picks him up. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> to his friend, Anne who tells {{him about his}} son's drawings. Tom is then called by Col. Porter (Dale Dye) for a meeting. There, Porter {{discusses}} his plan {{to leave the city}} and break off into groups. The alien air ships can detect groups of humans over 600 persons so he splits his brigade into smaller groups consisting of 100 fighters and 200 civilians. He puts Weaver in charge of the 2nd Mass and Tom as his second-in-command.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} you think of our new head?" [...] They thought of the {{conversation}} at luncheon. It was hardly a conversation; it was a monologue. Perkins had <b>talked</b> incessantly. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> very quickly, with a flow of easy words and in a deep, resonant voice. He had a short, odd little laugh which showed his white teeth. They had followed him with difficulty, for his mind darted from subject to subject with a connection they did not always catch. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> of pedagogics, and this was natural enough; but he had much to say of modern theories in Germany which they had never heard of and received with misgiving. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> of the classics, but he had been to Greece, and he discoursed of archaeology; he had once spent a winter digging; they could not see how that helped a man to teach boys to pass examinations, <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> of politics. It sounded odd to them to hear him compare Lord Beaconsfield with Alcibiades. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> of Mr. Gladstone and Home Rule. They realised that he was a Liberal. Their hearts sank. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> of German philosophy and of French fiction. They could not think a man profound whose interests were so diverse.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{would you}} then be letting him come here as he likes, and {{settling}} nothing, and just maning {{to marry you}} or not, as he likes, and you and <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of over the counthry these four months back, and <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> about you, jist as his misthress, through the counthry?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas has a distinctive, {{high pitched}} voice; Emerson Dameron {{described}} Thomas's singing as [...] "James Stewart trapped in an oboe", and Greil Marcus writes, [...] "Mr Thomas's voice {{is that of}} a man muttering in a crowd. You think <b>he's</b> <b>talking</b> to himself until you realize <b>he's</b> <b>talking</b> to you." ...|$|R
5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E
5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes very nervous about going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> with Marge on the phone, and she says that he ought {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> about how the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E
50|$|Confucius was a {{sage and}} social philosopher of China whose teachings have deeply {{influenced}} East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan for two thousand five hundred years. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> of duty, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about action {{and not just}} idle action, but wise action…that leads to a happy populace and restores social order.|$|R
5000|$|News of Ivanišević's {{financial}} problems {{first appeared in}} summer 2005 after <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about it {{in an interview with}} Globus newsmagazine, admitting Lazarica 2 was a [...] "failed project", as well as later that year when <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to the Daily Telegraph about losing substantial amount of money in some of his investments.|$|R
60|$|John {{went back}} to his rooms {{fighting}} all the time against a sense of unreality, a sense almost of lost identity. He bought an evening newspaper and read it on the way. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> to the hall-porter, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to a neighbor with whom he ascended in the lift--he did everything except think.|$|R
5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed when <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about him.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Doggett {{wakes up}} and discovers that he now has a third eye {{in the middle of}} his forehead. Suddenly, it vanishes. At the FBI building, <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> to Skinner, hoping for reassurance. He expresses his fear that, despite Tipet being in a coma, Tipet may still be able to enter into his dreams. Skinner, however, dismisses his {{concerns}} and sends him home. While leaving, Doggett has a hallucination of Tipet, ordering him to kill Scully. Suddenly, Doggett finds himself in front of Scully. Rather than kill his partner, he turns the axe upon himself. Doggett is immediately awakened from his dark reverie and finds himself in his bedroom, with Scully standing over his bed. He begins to thank her for saving his life, but she informs him that Tipet died due to his coma.|$|E
5|$|Veronica meets Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo), who annoys both Veronica and Mac. Veronica, Parker, Mac, Wallace, and Piz go to a concert. Veronica {{talks about}} Piz’s {{problem at the}} concert, and three kids say that they saw a white girl who was faking being fat. Dick shows up at Mac’s door and tells her that Beaver never cared about her. Veronica finds Piz’s guitar, and they visit the seller. The seller’s {{description}} matches that of other people. Veronica talks to Piz about a suspect, {{but he says that}} it doesn’t match the woman he saw. Keith and the bail-jumper’s car gets stranded. Veronica signs up for the mentoring program in criminology class, and she notices that one of the kids at the concert has a criminal record.

60|$|I {{remember}} him now as talking, always talking, in those days. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> {{to me of}} theology, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of politics, of the wonders of science and the marvels of art, of the passions and the affections, of the immortality of the soul and the peculiar actions of drugs; but predominantly and constantly <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of getting on, of enterprises, of inventions and great fortunes, of Rothschilds, silver kings, Vanderbilts, Goulds, flotations, realisations and the marvelous ways of Chance with men--in all localities, that is to say, that are not absolutely sunken {{to the level of}} Cold Mutton Fat.|$|R
60|$|But John Harned. He {{was a quiet}} man. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> {{always in}} a low voice, and he never moved his hands when <b>he</b> <b>talked.</b> One would have thought his heart {{was a piece of}} ice; yet did he have a streak of warm in his blood, for he {{followed}} Maria Valenzuela to Quito. Also, and for all that <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> low without moving his hands, he was an animal, as you shall see--the beast primitive, the stupid, ferocious savage of the long ago that dressed in wild skins and lived in the caves along with the bears and wolves.|$|R
50|$|Massimino {{performed}} {{twice at}} a storytelling event of The Moth: on November 14, 2012 <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> {{about the high}} stakes in the repair the Hubble Space Telescope in A View of the Earth and on February 21, 2017 <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about the swimming test {{at the beginning of}} his astronaut training in Swimming with Astronauts.|$|R
