40|$|In our {{analytical}} {{general equilibrium model}} {{where two}} polluting inputs can be substitutes or complements in production, we {{study the effects of}} a tax on one pollutant in two cases: one where both pollutants face taxes and the second where the other pollutant is subject to a permit policy. In each case, we solve for closed-form solutions that highlight important parameters. We demonstrate two important ways that environmental taxes and permits are not equivalent. First, the change in the pollutant facing a tax increase depends on whether the other pollutant is subject to a tax or permit policy. Second, if that other pollutant is subject to a tax, then general equilibrium effects can increase or decrease its quantity (affecting overall welfare). However, when the second pollutant is subject to a permit policy that binds, then welfare is not affected by this spillover effect. Finally, a <b>numerical</b> <b>exercise</b> helps demonstrate these two ways that taxes and permits differ.

One WEC composed by three bodies is simulated, with two different <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>numerical</b> model schemes: a floating buoy and a submerged sphere placed at 25 meters below the water surface. The third body is the translator of the linear generator, which is located at the sea bottom and attached to the submerged sphere by a steel wire [...] For the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>numerical</b> model, the two bodies are allowed to move independently; heave and surge modes have been taken into account. The first scheme consists in the modeling with only three degrees of freedom, one per body only in the vertical direction (heave) and the other with five degrees of freedom, adding the horizontal component of movement for the buoy and the submerged body (surge). The results are compared with previous results of a WEC modeled as a single body system, with only one degree of freedom along the vertical axis. Preliminary results show that the produced energy in a simplified 1 DoF scheme is higher than results produced by the 3 DoF scheme, and is then approximately equal for the 5 DoF.

Historical change in the geomorphology, hydrodynamics, and surficial sediment of the tidal delta system of Tauranga Harbour are investigated with the general aim of analysing The general aims of this thesis are: firstly to analyse historical changes to inlet delta system geomorphology using historical hydrographic charts, secondly, to conduct <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>numerical</b> modelling using historical bathymetries to access changes in peak spring flow and potential net tidal sediment transport, and thirdly, to analyse historical changes in surficial sediment and bedforms. Geomorphic change was investigated through plotting difference in bathymetry graphs and conducting cross sections taken from digisitied bathymetries obtained from historical hydrographic charts from 1852, 1879, 1901, 1927, 1954 and a modern bathymetry from 2006. Two-dimensional <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>numerical</b> modelling was conducted to investigate the changes in peak tidal current flow and potential net sediment transport between 1852 and 2006. Changes in surficial sediment patterns were determined through completing a side scan sonar survey with associated sediment samples for ground truthing of grain size and underwater videography to gather surficial shell coverage information. This was used to produce a surficial sediment coverage map which was compared to historical studies Major geomorphological findings include that the shipping channel appears to have induced minor change in the geomorphology of the FTD but such changes {{are similar to those}} identified in the historical bathymetries of 1852, 1879, 1901, 1927, 1954 prior to dredging. Significant changes have occurred on the ETD, with the majority of the ETD showing scour of 1 m while the terminal lobe has extended seawards. This is associated with historical (since 1852) narrowing of the inlet from Panepane Point to Mt Maunganui by ~ 900 m. <b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>numerical</b> modelling has shown a significant increase in potential net tidal sediment transport in the Cutter Channel due to dredging, while the Maunganui Roads Channel shows a reduction of net potential tidal sediment transport that is associated with the dredging of this channel. The area surrounding Panepane Point undergoes significant increases and decreases in net potential tidal sediment transport both before and after dredging Investigation of the surficial sediment patterns over the FTD and ETD from sidescan sonar and bottom samples show that between 1983 and 2007 there has been a northwards extension of the area of major shell (greater than 50 %) converge in the main ebb channel as well as reduction in major shell converge in flood tidal delta ebb shield region.
