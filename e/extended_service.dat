5|$|This {{extension}} <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> {{to the end}} of Lower Manhattan {{and into}} Brooklyn, relieving crowding on the East Side Line, while opening up service to new areas. The Pennsylvania Railroad's new hub in Manhattan, Penn Station, could now be accessed by the subway. Additionally, Manhattan's West Side was rebuilt {{with the arrival of the}} line. To allow the wide four-track line to go through the area, new streets had to be mapped and built, and new buildings were constructed as a result. And finally, capacity on the IRT's subway system doubled, increasing its usage.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this period}} of <b>extended</b> <b>service,</b> Robinson was brought home, {{appointed}} Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the King for his Caspian Sea service, promoted again to Captain and posted to HMS Iron Duke. Robinson then served {{in a number of}} training establishments and dockyards, as well as a brief stint with the Far East Fleet, during which he received the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class for his services. In 1925, he was inducted into the Freemasons and remained a prominent member of the Navy Lodge {{for the rest of his}} life. The organisation still commemorates him in their publications. He retired at age 51 in 1933 as a rear-admiral, but when the Second World War broke out, Robinson immediately offered his services and for three years, commanded convoys across the Atlantic Ocean. For this service, he was later presented with the Norwegian King Haakon VII's Freedom Cross. Eventually a bout of ill-health caused by a combination of the strain of long service, his age, and the death of his son, Midshipman Edward Cordeaux Robinson, in the sinking of the cruiser HMS Neptune in December 1941, prompted a second retirement in 1942.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine, how <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> from vehicle {{manufacturers}} can enhance value and reduce risk for transportation companies. The research shows that some transportation companies found <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> useful in order to enhance value and to decrease risks, while some of the companies mentioned advantages of not using <b>extended</b> <b>services.</b> Increased customer service, increased up-time are some of the value factors. Decreased number of delays, decreased likelihood of breakdowns are some of the risk factors mentioned by the case companies. This study contributes the knowledge by examining the transporters’ experiences of using <b>extended</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

25|$|Although the Vendidad {{is not a}} liturgical manual, {{a section}} of it may be recited {{as part of a}} greater Yasna service. Although such {{extended}} Yasnas appears to have been frequently performed in the mid-18th century (as noted in Anquetil-Duperron's observations), it is very rarely performed at the present day. In such an <b>extended</b> <b>service,</b> Visparad 12 and Vendidad 1-4 are inserted between Yasna 27 and 28. The Vendidad ceremony is always performed between nightfall and dawn, though a normal Yasna is performed between dawn and noon.|$|E
25|$|The XTBD had a flat canopy {{that was}} {{replaced}} on production models by a higher, domed canopy over a rollover bar. Other than requests by test pilots to improve pilot visibility, the prototype easily passed its acceptance trials {{that took place}} from 24 April-24 November 1935 at NAS (Naval Air Station) Anacostia and Norfolk bases. After successfully completing torpedo drop tests, the prototype {{was transferred to the}} USS Lexington for carrier certification. The <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> trials continued until 1937 with the first two production aircraft retained by the company exclusively for testing.|$|E

Intermediate stops included Wauwatosa, Elm Grove, Pewaukee, and Oconomowoc. Amtrak extended {{four of the six}} daily Hiawathas over the route. The Canadian Pacific Railway, which owned the tracks, estimated that the route would require between $15–33 million in capital investment before it could host the <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> permanently. Money was not forthcoming and service ended July 11. The three-month trial cost $1.4 million and carried 32,000 passengers.|$|E

40|$|The {{transportation}} {{industry is a}} rapidly changing business. As {{a result of the}} increased demand for transportation and the tougher demands on transportation companies’ performance, it is important that they have good and reliable processes that are able to live up to those demands in a highly competitive market. Increased performance is important for transportation companies in order to create value for its customers and steps that can help them to achieve this can be seen as valuable. In Sweden, vehicle manufacturers offer <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> in order to respond to the changes on the transportation market. However, there is a knowledge gap about the experiences of using a product together with <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> that has a more service dominant logic compared to buying and using only the product. This research is conducted as a multiple-case study with five companies within the freight {{transportation industry}} to investigate their experiences of using <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> regarding risk and value concepts. To be able to conduct this research, literature and empirical study has been conducted through the collection of secondary- and primary data such as face-to- face interviews. The result of this study shows that there are several determining factors, which the case companies consider when determining how to resolve the issues of <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> such as financial aspects, location of workshop, flexibility, size of transporter, and control. Fur- thermore was advantages of using <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> offered by vehicle manufacturers found that related to financial advantages, increased customer service levels, assurance that best service will be provided, and increased up-time. In addition to that it was found that these services could help transportation companies to reduce some risks related to the financial- and goods/physical risk categories. In contrast were advantages of not using <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> offered by vehicle manufacturers found such as financial benefits, possibilities to cooperate, flexibility, increased up-time as a result of location, and control. The loss of control was a risk found that could be decreased if not using vehicle manufacturers <b>extended</b> <b>services.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of schools}} in {{providing}} <b>extended</b> <b>services</b> to their communities continues to undergo change and development.

The project used a case study approach to gather data from primary and secondary schools providing <b>extended</b> <b>services.</b> From these case studies training materials were developed and trialled with focus groups of students in initial teacher training. Findings demonstrate the importance for tutors in initial teacher education {{to have access to}} authentic school-focused materials to assist them in equipping students for the realities of school lif...|$|R
25|$|Notable {{incidents}} with damaged ice piers at McMurdo Station {{include an}} event 10 years earlier. The ice pier {{had been in}} use four seasons in 1983 when the freighter USNS Southern Cross docked at Winter Quarters Bay. Operation Deep Freeze officials pressed the pier into <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> {{in order for the}} freighter to make an unprecedented two supply runs in one season from Port Lyttelton, New Zealand, to McMurdo. However, efforts to extend the ice pier’s lifespan resulted in a cargo truck breaking through the ice. The driver of the truck standing atop the container leapt to safety, receiving minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|The wide {{destruction}} wrought on {{the city}} by Hurricane Katrina and subsequent floods from the levee breaches in August 2005 knocked all the streetcar lines out of operation and damaged many of the streetcars. Service on {{a portion of the}} Canal Street line was restored in December of that year, with the remainder of the line and the Riverfront line returning to service in early 2006. On December 23, 2007, the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> from Napoleon Avenue to the end of historic St. Charles Avenue (the “Riverbend”). On June 22, 2008 service was restored {{to the end of the}} line at South Carrollton Avenue & South Claiborne Avenue.|$|E
25|$|The {{years after}} World War II brought major changes. In 1945, rural {{electricity}} {{was extended to}} the farms around Pea Ridge. City water and fire departments were initiated in the early 1950s. Televisions began appearing in homes circa 1951. By 1954, the Pea Ridge Telephone Company had <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> to most rural homes in the school district. In place of the disappearing apple orchards, large poultry farms appeared, as did modern dairy farms and beef cattle operations. The formation of Beaver Lake on the White River enhanced the area's tourist and retirement attractions and provided abundant water supplies for Pea Ridge and other area cities.|$|E

25|$|Because legions {{were not}} {{permanent}} units until the Marian reforms (c. 107 BC), and were instead created, used, and disbanded again, several hundred legions were named and numbered throughout Roman history. To date, about 50 have been identified. The Republican Legions were composed of levied men that {{paid for their}} own equipment and thus {{the structure of the}} Roman army at this time reflected the society, and at any time there would be four Consular Legions (with command divided between the two ruling Consuls) and in time of war extra Legions could be levied. Toward the end of the 2nd Century BC, Rome started to experience manpower shortages brought about by property and financial qualifications to join the army. This prompted Consul Gaius Marius to remove property qualifications and decree that all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for service in the Roman army with equipment and rewards for fulfilling years of service provided by the state. The Roman army became a volunteer, professional and standing army which <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> beyond Roman citizens but also to non-citizens that could sign on as auxillia (Auxiliaries) and were rewarded Roman citizenship upon completion of service and all the rights and privileges that entailed. In the time of Augustus, there were nearly 50 upon his succession but this was reduced to about 25–35 permanent standing legions and this remained the figure for most of the Empire's history.|$|E
