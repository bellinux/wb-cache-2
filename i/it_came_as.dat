5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|Rebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker {{challenged}} the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to {{a match for}} the title. Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed {{to a series of}} reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz' earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz' part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money. The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses {{in the middle of the}} match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion, and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re-match in 1896–97 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).|$|E

25|$|A slogan having {{political}} overtones {{seems to}} have been heard repeatedly in the gatherings of Ayyavazhi. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a declaration from Ayya Vaikundar {{that he was going to}} dethrone the king and rule the country under a Single Umbrella. Among the many accusations raised against Ayya Vaikundar, the one that he would overthrow the rule of kings was among the most serious.|$|E
25|$|To {{gain the}} passage of the Connecticut Plan its proponents needed support of three {{southern}} states, Georgia and the two Carolinas, complementing the small state coalition of the North. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that Ellsworth favored the Three-Fifths Compromise on the enumeration of slaves and opposed the abolition of the foreign slave trade. Stressing that he had no slaves, Ellsworth spoke twice before the Convention, on August 21 and 22, in favor of slavery being abolished.|$|E
25|$|When Trygve Lie {{resigned}} {{from his post}} as UN Secretary-General in 1953, the United Nations Security Council recommended Hammarskjöld to succeed him. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a surprise to Hammarskjöld. Seen as a competent technocrat without political views, he was selected on 31 March {{by a majority of}} 10 out of 11 Security Council members. The UN General Assembly elected him in the 7–10 April session by 57 votes out of 60. In 1957, he was re-elected.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Ferdinand I of Romania {{declared}} war on Austria-Hungary, the German Empire and the other Central Powers. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a shock for the Germanophiles. Although subject to the Romanian Army draft, Bassarabescu managed to avoid being called into active duty, and was instead appointed captain of a military reserve in Mogoșoaia train station. Through their personal contacts, both Mehedinți and Maiorescu tried to get Bassarabescu appointed to an even safer position, at a postal censorship bureau.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} Moroccan reaction came from Mustapha Ramid, who {{released a statement}} on Friday 2 August, in which he announced that the pardon was the King's decision which was dictated by national interest. He later denied being involved in drafting the list of pardoned prisoners, and stressed that the pardon was an exclusive prerogative of the King, adding that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> part of strategic relations linking Morocco and Spain and must have been done for higher interests {{of the nation and}} came {{as a result of the}} relations between two kings.|$|E

25|$|Thus <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> no real {{surprise}} when his Man at the Crossroads became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes {{and a clear}} portrait of Lenin, not apparent in initial sketches. After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln), {{and so he was}} paid for his commission and the mural papered over at the instigation of Nelson, who was to become the Center's flamboyant president.|$|E

Edur Velasco, a 56-year-old labor {{economist}} and university professor, was on a 42-day-long hunger strike sitting in a tent outside Mexico City's stock market, demanding that the government guarantee greater access to higher education among the youth. Days after his initiative, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a surprise to see the multiplication of tents setting up outside the stock exchange building. Police remained discreetly around the corner sitting in their trucks.|$|E
25|$|Although Pat Davies is {{counted as}} Sale's first international, having been picked {{to play for}} England in 1927, it was G.A.M. Isherwood who was Sale's first {{representative}} in an international Test match, when he played in all three tests of the 1910 British tour to South Africa at scrum-half. The club has consistently provided international players and, during the 1930s, had {{one of its most}} dominant periods, fielding players of the calibre of Hal Sever (England), Claude Davey and Wilf Wooller (Wales) and Ken Fyfe (Scotland). <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> little surprise when they took out the 1936 Middlesex Sevens.|$|E

25|$|Former West Ham {{player and}} Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley officially {{took over the}} vacant West Ham job on 13 December 2006, just 48 hours after Pardew had been sacked by new {{chairman}} Eggert Magnússon. Curbishley had been the odds-on favourite for the West Ham job straight after Pardew's departure, so <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that Curbishley was unveiled {{at a press conference}} on 13 December. Curbishley served as manager of local rivals Charlton for 15 years leading up to May 2006. During that time, he took Charlton from a struggling side languishing in old Second Division to a recognized Premiership side.|$|E
25|$|The ball mouse {{replaced}} the external wheels {{with a single}} ball that could rotate in any direction. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> part of the hardware package of the Xerox Alto computer. Perpendicular chopper wheels housed inside the mouse's body chopped beams {{of light on the}} way to light sensors, thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball. This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted trackball and became the predominant form used with personal computers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both hands to type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a {{shock when}} the first case of local HIV {{infection}} was reported in 1985. It galvanised a group of healthcare personnel (both gay and straight) {{to set up a}} non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Action For AIDS (AFA) in 1988 which provided support and counselling for AIDS victims as well as educating the public on safe sex. AFA was not technically part of the Singapore gay movement and has been careful to present itself as an NGO dealing with a public health issue. However, {{a significant portion of the}} energy and leadership behind it has been provided by gay people and in many practical ways AFA has rallied homosexuals around a cause.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> {{a terrible}} blow to Mrs. Logan when the General became sick and died. She decided {{a change of}} scene would help her and so she {{traveled}} through Europe, chaperoning George Pullman's daughters. On her return, Mrs. Logan became the editor of The Home Magazine, of Washington, which ran from 1888 to 1908, writing reminiscences of historic events. She served on the syndicate staff of Hearst news service, was a contributor to other magazine and newspapers, and wrote several books. President Benjamin Harrison appointed Mrs. Logan {{one of the women}} commissioners of the District of Columbia to the Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893). She also worked on plans for the Garfield Memorial Hospital, having been president of the board nine years. Logan died in 1923.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the ARL's stance on not {{selecting}} players who had signed with Super League, Canberra Raiders players Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Bradley Clyde, Steve Walters and Brett Mullins, won a court order against the ARL making SL players eligible for representative games. However, despite assurances from the ARL that all players were considered, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> no surprise when only ARL loyal players made the Kangaroos World Cup squad. As one unnamed ARL official allegedly said, the court decision only forced the ARL to consider Super League players, they were not forced select them. As the list of players considered for the squad was never made public by the ARL it remains unknown how many, if any, SL players were actually considered for World Cup selection with rumours persisting that no SL player was actually given any consideration.|$|E
25|$|Between 1990 and 1994, the ANC began {{preparing}} for the first democratic elections. It was an adjustment period and Mbeki {{played a crucial role}} in transforming the ANC into a legal political organisation. In 1991, the ANC was able to hold its first legal conference in the country after 30 years of being banned. The party now had the task of finding a middle ground for discussion between all the various factions: the returning exiles, the long-term prisoners and those who had stayed behind to lead the struggle. Mbeki was chosen as national chair while Cyril Ramaphosa was elected secretary general and the ANC's chief negotiator at the multiparty talks. Mbeki had up to this point been handling much of the diplomatic talks with the apartheid regime, and given his diplomatic experience and the level of bargaining that was expected, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> a surprise that Mbeki was sidelined in favour of Ramaphosa.|$|E
