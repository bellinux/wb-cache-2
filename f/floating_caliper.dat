2500|$|A <b>floating</b> <b>caliper</b> (also {{called a}} [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line {{parallel}} to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. <b>Floating</b> <b>caliper</b> (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|E

2500|$|Mountain bike {{disc brakes}} may range from simple, {{mechanical}} (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on downhill racing bikes. Improved technology {{has seen the}} creation of vented rotors for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid heat fade on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties. Discs are thin, often about 2mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a <b>floating</b> <b>caliper,</b> others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad {{into contact with the}} disc. Because the [...] "motor" [...] is small, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual drag when the brake is released. In contrast, most other brakes drag the pads lightly when released so as to minimise initial operational travel.|$|E

They were semi-floating discs with a diameter of 320 mm and a thickness of 4 mm. The rear brake system consisted of a floating single piston Brembo 34 mm caliper with high friction sintered pads and a 245 mm disc (bigger rear disc for two-up riders).|$|R

5000|$|More bespoke {{than the}} prior Ford Focus SVT (badged as the Focus ST170 in Europe), the Focus RS {{upgraded}} or replaced 70% {{of the standard}} Focus mechanicals. The turbocharged straight-4 engine produced a minimum of [...] and 310 Nm of torque, which was then mated to the 5-speed MTX-75 and not the Getrag transmission used in the ST 170. Mechanically, most notably, the car incorporated a Quaife automatic torque biasing differential to improve traction from the front-wheel drive setup. The steering used a similar quick-ratio rack as the ST170 while the brakes used fixed-caliper, four-piston Brembo units with 324 mm discs at the front and single-piston <b>floating</b> <b>calipers</b> and 280 mm discs at the back. Wheels were 18" [...] alloys specially developed by OZ Racing. The engine was heavily modified with forged aluminium pistons, hardened valve seats, sodium-filled exhaust valves, stainless steel exhaust system. The forced induction system comprised a Garrett turbocharger with a water-cooled charge air cooler and an electric water pump. To transmit the higher torque an upgraded AP clutch was used.|$|R

The bike has a front 110/70 R17 and a rear 150/60 R17 tyre. The braking of the bike features anti-lock braking system, with the front using a single 300 mm discs, radially-bolted 4-piston fixed caliper brake and the rear, a single 240 mm disc, single-piston <b>floating</b> <b>caliper</b> brake.

50|$|Another type of <b>floating</b> <b>caliper</b> is a {{swinging}} caliper.Instead {{of a pair}} {{of horizontal}} bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|E

5000|$|For the 1987 model year, the 944S [...] "Super" [...] was introduced. The 944S {{featured}} a high performance naturally aspirated, dual-overhead-cam 16-valve [...] {{version of the}} 2.5 L engine (M44/40) featuring a self-adjusting timing belt tensioner. This marked the first use of four-valve-per-cylinder heads and DOHC in the 944 series, derived from the 928 S4 featuring a redesigned camshaft drive, a magnesium intake tract/passages, magnesium valve cover, larger capacity oil sump, and revised exhaust system. The alternator capacity was 115 amps. The wheel bearings were also strengthened and the brake servo action was made more powerful. <b>Floating</b> 944 <b>calipers</b> were standard, but the rear wheel brake circuit pressure regulator from the 944 turbo was used. Small '16 Ventiler' script badges were added on the sides {{in front of the}} body protection mouldings. Performance was quoted as 0 - 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds (Best) and a 232 km/h top speed due to a 2857 lb weight. It also {{featured a}}n improved programmed Bosch Digital Motronic 2 Computer/DME with dual knock sensors for improved fuel performance for the higher 10.9:1 compression ratio cylinder head. Like the 944 Turbo, the 944S received progressive springs for greater handling, Larger front and rear anti-roll bars, revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 2.5 L DOHC higher 6800 rpm rev limit. Dual safety air bags, limited-slip differential, and ABS braking system were optional on the 944S.|$|R
50|$|Mid-'77 {{the front}} forks {{had a major}} redesign, fork tube {{diameter}} increased from 34 to 35 mm and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same tube size).

Also the brake caliper changed from a 48 mm dual piston cast iron design for the 34 mm fork to a 40 mm aluminum single piston <b>floating</b> <b>caliper</b> for the 35 mm forks. The brake caliper mounting lugs on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the 34 mm and 35 mm forks so the calipers can't be swapped.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the onset}} of the dynamic {{instability}} in a <b>floating</b> <b>caliper</b> disc brake system is studied. The disc is modelled as a flexible rotating plate, the pad is taken as a small mass and a distributed stiffness, and the motion of the caliper is also taken into consideration. The linearized equations of motion about the equilibrium position are derived assuming a constant braking force. The equations are subsequently discretized with the help of appropriate shape functions. The eigenvalue problem is then solved to detect {{the onset of}} instability. The effects of damping on the stability of motion are investigated as well...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that the application of open-loop dither control to a brake provides an effective means of suppressing brake squeal. Dither control is a method by which high frequency disturbances are introduced into a system. Dither suppresses the friction induced squeal response at lower frequencies, thus eliminating audible brake squeal. Dither control when applied at 100 % duty cycle {{has been shown to be}} an effective means of suppressing brake squeal. This paper documents an investigation into the use burst-mode dither control for suppression of brake squeal. Burst mode dither control is characterized by duty cycles of less than 100 %. Dither is introduced to a brake by placing a piezoelectric stack actuator in the piston of a <b>floating</b> <b>caliper</b> brake. The piezoelectric stack actuator is driven by a 20 kHz burst mode signal, and the impact upon the squeal is assessed. Burst mode dither with duty cycles as low as 50 % are shown to be as effective in suppressing brake squeal as dithering at 100 % duty cycle...|$|E
40|$|Dither {{control is}} a method of {{introducing}} high frequency control efforts into a system to suppress a lower frequency disturbance. Dither {{control is a}}n effective means of suppressing automotive brake squeal. Brake squeal is a problem that has plagued the automotive industry for years. In fact many makers of materials for brake pads spend up to 50 % of their engineering budgets on noise, vibration and harshness issues. A normal dither signal may be introduced to an automotive braking system by placing a piezoceramic stack actuator in the piston of a <b>floating</b> <b>caliper</b> brake. Many theoretical models indicate a reduction in the braking torque due to the dither signal. Under the assumption of Hertzian contact stiffness the loss in braking torque is due to lowering of the average normal force. There are also theories that the dither signal eliminates the stick-slip oscillation causing an effective decrease in the friction force. Yet another theory indicates that the effective contact area is reduced, lowering the mean coefficient of friction. It is not apparent whether any of these models accurately portrays the interaction of the brake pads and rotor. M. S.
