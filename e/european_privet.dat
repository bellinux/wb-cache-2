50|$|Steppe-like {{vegetation}} grows here mostly. The {{place is}} also valued {{for one of}} the richest populations of Greater Anemone (Pulsatilla grandis) in Central Moravia; in the 2004 census 19,699 blooms were counted here. Other notable plants growing here are Snowdrop Anemone (Anemone sylvestris), European Michaelmas Daisy (Aster amellus), Sickle Hare's Ear (Bupleurum falcatum), Blue Sedge (Carex flacca), Downy-fruited Sedge (Carex tomentosa), Carex michelii, European Dwarf Cherry (Prunus fruticosa), Dorycnium herbaceum, Field Cow-wheat (Melampyrum arvense), Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa), Military Orchid (Orchis militaris), Knapweed Broomrape (Orobanche elatior), Pilosella macrantha, Primula veris subsp. canescens, Fragrant Scabious (Scabiosa canescens) and Thesium dollineri. Bigger stones are covered by saxicolous lichens, which are an important indicator of the level of air pollution. The grasslands need to be maintained and shrubs of Black Locust (Robinia pseudacacia), Common Dogwood (Cornus sanguinea) and <b>European</b> <b>Privet</b> (Ligustrum vulgare) have to be regularly removed here.|$|E

This study focuses on quantifying current distribution, rate of dispersals, and economic losses caused by four major invaders ? Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera (L.) Small), Chinese Privet (Ligustrum sinense Lour.), <b>European</b> <b>Privet</b> (Ligustrum vulgare L.), and Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.). Using data from USDA Forest Service?s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and USGS Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), I first used logistic regressions to build occupation models for these four species. Second, I used VB. NET? (Microsoft, 2003) and Environment System Research Institute (ESRI) Arc View? 9. 2 Geographical Information System (GIS) to model spatially explicit dispersal dynamics of these species. Finally, I evaluated economic losses {{associated with these}} invasions. The results of occupation models showed that landscape features, climatic conditions, forest and site conditions, forest management activities and disturbances, and forest ownership have statistically significant impacts on current distributions of all four species. The results of dispersal models showed that invasions of Chinese tallow, Chinese and European privets, and Japanese honeysuckle will be likely to appear on approximately 6. 65 million acres of forest land in East Texas and Louisiana, 3. 81 million acres in Mississippi and Alabama, and 12. 55 million acres in Mississippi and Alabama, respectively, during the next 20 years. The estimated timber losses resulting from the invasion with no control for the next 20 years at 5 % discount rate is 518 million dollars for Chinese tallow, 2. 72 billion dollars for Chinese and European privets, and 11. 05 billion dollars for Japanese honeysuckle. From an economic point of view, it would be most cost effective to execute high intensity control for these invasive species. Based on these findings, strategies for monitoring and mitigating these invasive species are proposed...|$|E

Korištenje drugih vrsta šumskog drveća te njihova uporaba u revitalizaciji do sada je kod nas nedovoljno istraženo. U tu je svrhu, u jesen 2007. godine, osnovano pokusno polje za potrebe istraživanja biološke sanacije kamenoloma Očura II autohtonim vrstama drveća i grmlja. Izabrane vrste su crni jasen (Fraxinus ornus), gorski javor (Acer pseudoplata nus), crna topola (Populus nigra), vrbe (Salix sp.), te kalina (Ligustrum vul gare) i bodljikava veprina (Ruscus aculeatus). Podaci o preživljenju nakon dvije sezone evidentiranja ukazuju na bolju otpornost na presadnju i na prilagodbu novim uvjetima školovanih sadnica javora, jasena te vrba i topola od biljaka presađenih iz šume. Sadnice kaline iz rasadnika nisu pokazale sličnu karakteristiku ranije navedenih vrsta, kao ni sklonost određenom tipu tla. Najmanje je preživljenje sadnica iz šume prenešenih na šumsko tlo (68, 8 %), a najveće, također šum skih sadnica, ali na poljoprivrednom tlu (87, 5 %). Ukupno gledajući, može se uočiti kako sadnice iz rasadnika imaju visoko i približno isto preživljenje i na poljoprivrednom i na šumskom tlu (89, 2 – 89, 7 %), a veće je od preživljenja biljaka presađenih iz šume. Ono se kreće od 73, 8 % na šumskom, do 86, 3 % na poljoprivrednom tlu. Sveukupno preživljenje biljaka (izuzevši veprinu) od 85, 0 % vrlo je visoko i zadovoljavajuće te pokazuje šire mogućnosti odabira vrsta prilikom radova na biološkoj sanaciji pojedinih kamenoloma od do sada uvriježenih u praksi. Analizom visinskih klasa, za sve promatrane vrste utvrđen je pomak za 1 – 4 klase. Najveći visinski prirast (do 120 cm) imale su sadnice vrba i topola. Biological {{revitalisation}} {{of highly}} devastated {{areas such as}} querries, depots and landfills is in Croatia, in terms of permanent green coverage, usually conducted with Austrian black pine (Pinus nigra Mill.). Until now research of other forest tree species utilization and their usage within sanation process haven’t been conducted. With this objective, {{in the fall of}} 2007, test field for scientific needs was established for research of biological sanation of querry Očura II with autochtonous tree and schrub species. Basic aim of this trial was to determine the possibility of application of autochtonous tree and shrub species in querry revitalisation. Trial was established in the border part of Očura II querry on already technically improved terracce. On this terracce layer of wasterock from querry was deposed which acts as foundation. Trial was established in two repetitions which depend on the soil type (deposed agricultural or forest humus substrate (soil)). In every repetition seedlings from nursery and from surrounding forest stands were planted. Seven pedological profiles have been dug up and additional observations have been conducted with pedological sonde. For indentification of pioneer forest species which come by nature on Očura querry locality, it was necessary to study and to determine vegetation, floristic composition of forest edges, as well as areas inside of querry on which natural vegetation begun to appear. Selection of plants for extraction was conducted in forest stands, on the top border area of querry, which was planned for clearcut in the near future with the aim of sequent exploitation of querry. Selected species were Flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus L.), Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), Black poplar (Populus nigra L.), willows (Salix sp.), and <b>European</b> <b>privet</b> (Ligustrum vulgare L.). 546 plants od forest tree species was planted in total, which include 110 willows and poplar plants, 110 sycamore maple and 110 flowering ash plants and 216 bush species plants, which include 144 <b>European</b> <b>privet</b> and 72 Ruscus aculeatus plants. Selection of Ruscus aculeatus for this trial was based on preservation of individuall speciments of this endangered specie in the vicinity of it’s habitant which will be devastated by exploitation. The results of test field monitoring indicate very good survival success of young plants. Outplanted plants on the test field were in very good health condition, except Ruscus aculeatus, which was planted with the aim of protection. For now conclusions about success of plants regarding the soil type could not be made, but there is a correlation between survival of plants and their breeding. At the time of survival observation nursery seedlings had higher average survival rate then plants extracted from surrounding stands. There is no difference in survival rate between plants planted on agricultural and forest soil in first year (91, 2 – 91, 1 %) but after secund year there are differences (81, 8 % on forest soil, 87, 7 % on agricultural soil). Survival of Sycamore maple is in range from 72, 0 % to 93, 3 %. Sycamore plants which have been extracted from forest stands have the lowest survival rate while plants planted on forest soil have lower survival (72 %) then plants planted on agricultural soil (73, 7 %). Survival of sycamore nursery seedlings is satisfatory on both soil types and it ranges from 88, 0 to 93, 3 %. Flowering ash nursery seedlings have 100 % survival rate regardless of soil type, but survival of Flowering ash extracted from forest stands is different in relation to soil type. On agricultural soil this survival rate is satisfatory and amounts 93, 3 %, while plants on forest soil have 56 % survival rate. Survival rate of willows and poplars ranges from 90, 0 to 100 %. The best survival have plants which have been extracted from forest stands and been planted on forest soil, and plants from stands planted on agricultural soil have the lowest survival. Survival of nursery seedlings ranges from 92, 0 to 90, 0 %. Survival of Euro pean privet is in the range of 68, 8 to 87, 5 %. More successful are <b>European</b> <b>privet</b> plants planted on agricultural soil. The results of this research indicate that adequate species of autochtonous and pioneer forest trees and species have been selected for revitalisation of this querry, taking into account their ecological requirements and biological features...|$|E
