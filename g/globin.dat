30|$|Typical annelid {{extracellular}} <b>globins</b> are renowned {{and widely}} studied {{because of their}} amazing quaternary structure, which is comprised of a 3.6  MDa hexagonal bilayer (HBL) complex of <b>globins</b> and linker chains (see Weber and Vinogradov 2001 for a review). Annelid extracellular multi-domain <b>globins</b> have so far only been found in Branchipolynoe, a hydrothermal-vent endemic genus in the family Polynoidae (Hourdez et al. 1999 a). In this genus, the Hb is extracellular, and corresponds to dimers and trimers of tetra-domain <b>globins</b> (Hourdez et al. 1999 a). Based on sequence data, Projecto-Garcia et al. (2010) showed that these <b>globins</b> were closely related to single-domain intracellular <b>globins,</b> and {{were the result of}} successive tandem gene duplications.|$|R
25|$|Recently, {{there had}} been {{discussion}} connecting copy number variations to gene families. Gene families are defined {{as a set of}} related genes that serve similar functions but have minor temporal or spatial differences and these genes likely derived from one ancestral gene. The main reason copy number variations are connected to gene families {{is that there is a}} possibility that genes in a family may have derived from one ancestral gene which got duplicated into different copies. Mutations accumulate through time in the genes and with natural selection acting on the genes, some mutations lead to environmental advantages allowing those genes to be inherited and eventually clear gene families are separated out. An example of a gene family that may have been created due to copy number variations is the <b>globin</b> gene family. The <b>globin</b> gene family is an elaborate network of genes consisting of alpha and beta <b>globin</b> genes including genes that are expressed in both embryos and adults as well as pseudogenes. These <b>globin</b> genes in the <b>globin</b> family are all well conserved and only differ by a small portion of the gene, indicating that they were derived from a common ancestral gene, perhaps due to duplication of the initial <b>globin</b> gene.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin is {{involved}} in the transport of other gases: It carries some of the body's respiratory carbon dioxide (about 20–25% of the total) as carbaminohemoglobin, in which CO2 is bound to the <b>globin</b> protein. The molecule also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric oxide bound to a <b>globin</b> protein thiol group, releasing {{it at the same time}} as oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Thalassemias are genetic {{disorders}} {{inherited from}} a person's parents. There {{are two main}} types, alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. The severity of alpha and beta thalassemia depends on {{how many of the}} four genes for alpha <b>globin</b> or two genes for beta <b>globin</b> are missing. Diagnosis is typically by blood tests including a complete blood count, special hemoglobin tests, and genetic tests. Diagnosis may occur before birth through prenatal testing.|$|E

All eukaryote 3 / 3 hemoglobins are related to the bacterial single domain F <b>globins.</b> It is known that Fungi contain flavohemoglobins and single domain S <b>globins.</b> Our aims are to provide a census of fungal <b>globins</b> and to examine their relationships to bacterial <b>globins.</b> Results: Examination of 165 genomes revealed that <b>globins</b> are present in. 90 % of Ascomycota and, 60 % of Basidiomycota genomes. The S <b>globins</b> occur in Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota in addition to the phyla that have FHbs. Unexpectedly, group 1 T <b>globins</b> were found in one Blastocladiomycota and one Chytridiomycota genome. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on the fungal <b>globins,</b> alone and aligned with representative bacterial <b>globins.</b> The Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes with two FHbs form two widely divergent clusters separated by the remaining fungal sequences. One of the Saccharomycete groups represents a new subfamily of FHbs, comprising a previously unknown N-terminal and a FHb missing the C-terminal moiety of its reductase domain. The two Saccharomycete groups also form two clusters in the presence of bacterial FHbs; the surrounding bacterial sequences are dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacilli (Firmicutes).

40|$|In {{common with}} many other groups, {{nematodes}} express <b>globins</b> with unknown functions. Nematode globin-like genes {{can be divided into}} class 1 <b>globins,</b> similar to vertebrate myoglobins, and a wide range of additional classes. Here we show that class 1 nematode <b>globins</b> possess a huge amount of diversity in gene sequence and structure. There is evidence for multiple events of gene duplication, intron insertion and loss between species, and for allelic variation effecting both synonymous and non-synonymous sites within species. We have also examined gene expression patterns in class I <b>globins</b> from a variety of species. The results show variation in the degree of gene expression, but the tissue specificity and temporal specificity of expression may be more conserved in the phylum. Because the structure-function relationships for the binding and transport of oxygen by <b>globins</b> are well understood, the consequences of genetic variation causing amino acid changes are explored. The gene family shows great promise for discovering unique insights into both structure-function relationships of <b>globins</b> and their physiologial roles...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in computational biology {{have made it}} possible to map the complete network and energy profile of gas migration pathways inside proteins. Although networks of O 2 pathways have already been characterized for a small number of proteins, the general properties and locations of these pathways have not been previously compared between proteins. In this study, maps of the O 2 pathways inside 12 monomeric <b>globins</b> were computed. It is found that, despite the conserved tertiary structure fold of the studied <b>globins,</b> the shape and topology of O 2 pathway networks exhibit a large variability between different <b>globins,</b> except when two <b>globins</b> are nearly identical. The locations of the O 2 pathways are, however, found to be correlated with the location of large hydrophobic residues, and a similar correlation is observed in two unrelated protein families: monomeric <b>globins</b> and copper-containing amine oxidases. The results have implications for the evolution of gas pathways in proteins and for protein engineering applications involving modifications of these pathways...|$|R

25|$|The β <b>globin</b> {{chains are}} encoded {{by a single}} gene on {{chromosome}} 11; α <b>globin</b> chains are encoded by two closely linked genes on chromosome 16. Thus, in a normal person with two copies of each chromosome, two loci encode the β chain, and four loci encode the α chain. Deletion {{of one of the}} α loci has a high prevalence in people of African or Asian descent, making them more likely to develop α-thalassemia. β-Thalassemias are not only common in Africans, but also in Greeks and Italians.|$|E
25|$|There is {{more than}} one {{hemoglobin}} gene: in humans, hemoglobin A (the main form of hemoglobin present) is coded for by the genes, HBA1, HBA2, and HBB. The amino acid sequences of the <b>globin</b> proteins in hemoglobins usually differ between species. These differences grow with evolutionary distance between species. For example, the most common hemoglobin sequences in humans and chimpanzees are nearly identical, differing by only one amino acid in both the alpha and the beta <b>globin</b> protein chains. These differences grow larger between less closely related species.|$|E

The structural similarity between colicin A and <b>globins</b> is comparable to that between <b>globins</b> and phycocyanins.

50|$|Hemoglobin Barts, {{abbreviated}} Hb Barts, is {{an abnormal}} type of hemoglobin {{that consists of}} four gamma <b>globins.</b> It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells. It has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, resulting in almost no oxygen delivery to the tissues. As an embryo develops, it begins to produce alpha-globins at weeks 5-6 of development. When both HBA1 and HBA2, the two genes that code for alpha <b>globins,</b> are non-functional, only gamma <b>globins</b> are produced. These gamma <b>globins</b> bind to form hemoglobin Barts. It is produced in the disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, {{it is the only}} form of haemoglobin in circulation. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed.|$|R

25|$|Some {{mutations}} in the <b>globin</b> chain {{are associated with}} the hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. Other mutations, as discussed {{at the beginning of the}} article, are benign and are referred to merely as hemoglobin variants.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the oxygen}} ligand, which binds to {{hemoglobin}} in a cooperative manner, hemoglobin ligands also include competitive inhibitors such as carbon monoxide (CO) and allosteric ligands such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO). The {{carbon dioxide is}} bound to amino groups of the <b>globin</b> proteins to form carbaminohemoglobin; this mechanism is thought to account for about 10% of carbon dioxide transport in mammals. Nitric oxide can also be transported by hemoglobin; it is bound to specific thiol groups in the <b>globin</b> protein to form an S-nitrosothiol, which dissociates into free nitric oxide and thiol again, as the hemoglobin releases oxygen from its heme site. This nitric oxide transport to peripheral tissues is hypothesized to assist oxygen transport in tissues, by releasing vasodilatory nitric oxide to tissues in which oxygen levels are low.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the large}} number of <b>globins</b> {{recently}} discovered in bacteria, our knowledge of their physiological functions is restricted to only a few examples. In the microbial world, <b>globins</b> appear to perform multiple roles in addition to the reversible binding of oxygen; all these functions are attributable to the heme pocket that dominates functional properties. Resistance to nitrosative stress and involvement in oxygen chemistry seem to be the most prevalent functions for bacterial <b>globins,</b> although the number of <b>globins</b> for which functional roles have been studied via mutation and genetic complementation is very limited. The acquisition of structural information has considerably outpaced the physiological and molecular characterisation of these proteins. The genome of the Antarctic cold-adapted bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 (PhTAC 125) contains genes encoding three distinct single-chain 2 / 2 <b>globins,</b> supporting the hypothesis of their crucial involvement in a number of functions, including protection against oxidative and nitrosative stress in the cold and O 2 -rich environment. In the genome of PhTAC 125, the genes encoding 2 / 2 <b>globins</b> are constitutively transcribed, thus suggesting that these <b>globins</b> are not functionally redundant in their physiological function in PhTAC 125. In the present study, the physiological role of one of the 2 / 2 <b>globins,</b> Ph- 2 / 2 HbO- 2217, was investigated by integrating in vivo and in vitro results. This role includes the involvement in the detoxification of reactive nitrogen and O 2 species including NO by developing two in vivo and in vitro models to highlight the protective role of Ph- 2 / 2 HbO- 2217 against reactive nitrogen species. The PSHAa 2217 gene was cloned and over-expressed in the flavohemoglobin-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli and the growth properties and O 2 uptake in the presence of NO of the mutant carrying the PSHAa 2217 gene were analysed. The ferric form of Ph- 2 / 2 HbO- 2217 is able to catalyse peroxynitrite isomerisation in vitro, indicating its potential role in the scavenging of reactive nitrogen species. Here we present in vitro evidence for the detoxification of NO by Ph- 2 / 2 HbO- 2217...|$|R

25|$|The name {{hemoglobin}} {{is derived}} from the words heme and <b>globin,</b> reflecting the fact that each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embedded heme group.

25|$|Many {{proteins}} have a quaternary structure, {{which consists}} of several polypeptide chains that associate into an oligomeric molecule.

40|$|Multimeric <b>globins</b> (e. g., hemoglobin) are {{considered}} to be the prototypes of allosteric enzymes, whereas monomeric <b>globins</b> (e. g., myoglobin; Mb) usually are assumed to be non-allosteric. However, the modulation of the functional properties of monomeric <b>globins</b> by non-covalent (or allosteric) and covalent modifications casts doubts on this general assumption. Here, we report examples referable to these two extreme mechanisms modulating the reactivity of three mammalian monomeric <b>globins.</b> Sperm whale Mb, which acts as a reserve supply of O- 2 and facilitates the O- 2 flux within a myocyte, displays the allosteric modulation of the O- 2 affinity on lactate, an obligatory product of glycolysis under anaerobic conditions, thus facilitating O- 2 diffusion to the mitochondria in supporting oxidative phosphorylation. Human neuroglobin (NGB), which appears to protect neurons from hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, undergoes hypoxia-dependent phosphorylation (i. e., covalent modulation) affecting the coordination equilibrium of the heme-Fe atom and, in turn, the heme-protein reactivity. This facilitates heme-Fe-ligand binding and enhances the rate of anaerobic nitrite reduction to form NO, thus contributing to cellular adaptation to hypoxia. The reactivity of human cytoglobin (CYGB), which has been postulated to protect cells against oxidative stress, depends on both non-covalent and covalent mechanisms. In fact, the heme reactivity of CYGB depends on the lipid, such as oleate, binding which stabilizes the penta-coordination geometry of the heme-Fe atom. Lastly, the reactivity of NGB and CYGB is modulated by the redox state of the intramolecular CysCD 7 /CysD 5 and CysB 2 /CysE 9 residue pairs, respectively, affecting the heme-Fe atom coordination state. In conclusion, the modulation of monomeric <b>globins</b> reactivity by non-covalent and covalent modifications appears a very widespread phenomenon, opening new perspectives in cell survival and protection.

25|$|The {{structure}} of hemoglobins varies across species. Hemoglobin occurs in all kingdoms of organisms, {{but not in}} all organisms. Primitive species such as bacteria, protozoa, algae, and plants often have single-globin hemoglobins. Many nematode worms, molluscs, and crustaceans contain very large multisubunit molecules, much larger than those in vertebrates. In particular, chimeric hemoglobins found in fungi and giant annelids may contain both <b>globin</b> {{and other types of}} proteins.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{agree that}} the event that {{separated}} myoglobin from hemoglobin occurred after lampreys diverged from jawed vertebrates. This separation of myoglobin and hemoglobin allowed for the different functions of the two molecules to arise and develop: myoglobin {{has more to do}} with oxygen storage while hemoglobin is tasked with oxygen transport. The α- and β-like <b>globin</b> genes encode the individual subunits of the protein. The predecessors of these genes arose through another duplication event also after the gnathosome common ancestor derived from jawless fish, approximately 450–500 million years ago. The development of α and β genes created the potential for hemoglobin to be composed of multiple subunits, a physical composition central to hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen. Having multiple subunits contributes to hemoglobin's ability to bind oxygen cooperatively as well as be regulated allosterically. Subsequently, the α gene also underwent a duplication event to form the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. These further duplications and divergences have created a diverse range of α- and β-like <b>globin</b> genes that are regulated so that certain forms occur at different stages of development.|$|E

AItman 1 - 2 As the database of three-dimensional protein structures expands, it becomes possible to classify related structures into families. Some of these families, such as the <b>globins,</b> have enough members to allow statistical analysis of conserved features. Previously, we have shown that a probabilistic representation based on means and variances can be useful for defining structural cores for large families. These cores contain the subset of atoms that are in essentially the same relative positions in {{all members of the}} family. In addition to defining a core, our method creates an ordered list of atoms, ranked by their structural variation. In applying our core-finding procedure to the <b>globins,</b> we find that helices A, B,G and Hform a structural core with low variance. These helices fold early in the folding pathway, and superimpose well with helices in the helixlurn-helix repressor protein family. The non-core helices (F and the parts of other helices that interact with it) are associated with the functional differences among the <b>globins,</b> and are encoded within a separate exon. We have also compared the variablity measure implicit in our core structures with measures of sequence variability, using a procedure for measuring sequence variability that helps correct for the biased sampling in the databanks.
