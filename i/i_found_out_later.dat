60|$|The German of Heine, when {{once you}} are in the joke of his capricious genius, is very simple, and in his poetry it is simple from the first, so that he was, perhaps, the best author I could have fallen in with if I wanted to go fast rather than far. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> this <b>out</b> <b>later,</b> when <b>I</b> {{attempted}} other German authors without the glitter of his wit or the lambent glow of his fancy to light me on my hard way. I should find it hard to say just why his peculiar genius had such an absolute fascination for me from the very first, and perhaps I had better content myself with saying simply that my literary liberation began with almost the earliest word from him; for if he chained me to himself he freed me from all other bondage. I had been at infinite pains from time to time, now upon one model and now upon another, to literarify myself, if I may make a word which does not quite say the thing for me. What I mean is that I had supposed, with the sense at times that I was all wrong, that the expression of literature must be different from the expression of life; that it must be an attitude, a pose, with something of state or at least of formality in it; that it must be this style, and not that; that it must be like that sort of acting which you know is acting when you see it and never mistake for reality. There are a great many children, apparently grown-up, and largely accepted as critical authorities, who are still of this youthful opinion of mine. But Heine at once showed me that this ideal of literature was false; that the life of literature was from the springs of the best common speech and that the nearer it could be made to conform, in voice, look and gait, to graceful, easy, picturesque and humorous or impassioned talk, the better it was.|$|R
40|$|On {{the road}} {{in and out of}} the local town it’s hard for me to pass up hitchhikers. One night, leaving town toward my cabin, I’m about four miles out the dirt road in a winter rain storm and my {{headlights}} shine on a guy walking the road with no bundle and barely a jacket and he turns around and sticks out his thumb, which got me nervous but what could I do. Another car might not be on this road all night. I pick him up. He says he’s heading to Oregon. It would take me six hours to drive to Oregon. I keep conversation calm as can be. An hour later I drop him off near an empty barn, and tell him he can find shelter from the rain there. I give him some food. I live a mile away but I don’t tell him that. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> a week <b>later</b> that a murder had been committed in town that evening and that they hadn’t found the murderer. Perhaps I had. I picked up two people last week. One person was Thomas. He hopped in right outside his trailer three miles from town, heading into the gas station to get a new battery for his Volkswagen Bug. Lived in the valley all his life. Indian.

40|$|I {{first saw}} Richard Shutler Jr. {{in the summer}} of 1973 from the bottom of a ravine in the Loess Hills of {{southwest}} Iowa. Dick was about 200 or 300 feet overhead in a huge transport helicopter. He and other newer and older friends were waving vigorously. I waved back. They continued waving. I continued waving. This went on for some time until the helicopter manoeuvred a few hundred feet beyond the crest of the ravine and landed. I thought it was a bit thrilling … the thunder of the big bird’s engines … the roar of the wind down upon me. But I stayed meekly out of the way for the rest of Dick’s visit when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> minutes <b>later</b> that they were not waving in greeting. They had been trying to wave me away so they could throw down gigantic nets they had carried from 250 miles away. Nets with which they would haul out the samples the geologist had been accumulating over the summer in 50 or 100 pound burlap bags down {{at the bottom of the}} ravine. The State Archaeologist had persuaded the National Guard to help out our project as a training exercise and Dick had been invited along for the show. Actually I didn’t have to stay out of his way at all. The other students and myself were immediately his comrades-in-arms, Dick kind of trooping around the place, asking us constant questions, engaging us, finding out about our backgrounds, our interests and the progress of the immediate project. When the call came a few weeks later to help with an emergency PaleoIndian dig led by Dick, we all volunteered without a second thought. The Iowans weren’t necessarily much aware of or interested in Dick’s Pacific Island or Early Man in East Asia work. He was mainly known to the other archaeologists and students as the person who conducted a trenchant interdisciplinary investigation of Tule Springs, a site which had been claimed, by people Dick referred to as “the Southern California lunatic fringe”, to have extremely ancient remains of human activity. Dick’s group, which included geologists, subsequently found no evidence of human activity in the horizons concerned. I was finishing up a bachelors degree in anthropolog...|$|R

60|$|My way {{lay over}} Mouter's Hill, and through {{an end of}} a clachan on the braeside among fields. There was a whir of looms in it went from house to house; bees bummed in the gardens; the {{neighbours}} that I saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> that this was Picardy, a village where the French weavers wrought for the Linen Company. Here I got a fresh direction for Pilrig, my destination; and a little beyond, on the wayside, came by a gibbet and two men hanged in chains. They were dipped in tar, as the manner is; the wind span them, the chains clattered, and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks and cried. The sight coming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my fears, I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort. And as I thus turned and turned about the gibbet, what should I strike on, but a weird old wife, that sat behind a leg of it, and nodded, and talked aloud to herself, with becks and courtesies.|$|E

I wrote to Prince Frederick and begged him to release me from our uncompleted engagement. His answer was to appear in person. He made a scene. My {{mother and father were}} now wholly on his side.
