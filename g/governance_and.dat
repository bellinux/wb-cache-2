5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or <b>governance)</b> <b>and</b> {{the idea that a}} pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} a {{governance}} perspective on corporate social responsibility (CSR) {{makes it possible to}} explain why the concept will always be under-defined, is normative and thus political by nature, and is and should be difficult to measure. The perspective also makes it possible to understand the interaction between corporate values and stakeholders values. In processes of dialogue within <b>governance</b> systems <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> structures, changing insights into the principles of CSR can lead to regulation or its adjustment. Power is important in these dialogues. Principles are at least partly shaped within <b>governance</b> systems <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> structures, <b>and</b> they influence the outcomes of corporate policies. Changes within the regulatory framework could also lead to changes in the principles of CSR. Value attunement processes could lead to regulation, which again influences the <b>governance</b> structures <b>and</b> thus the power of stakeholders within the dialogue. The theoretical model provided helps to analyze why CSR is different in companies, cultures and academic traditions...|$|R

5|$|By 2012 {{the scandal}} had {{developed}} {{into one of}} the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan; it had wiped 75–80% off the company's stock market valuation, led to the resignation of much of the board, investigations across Japan, the UK and US, the arrest of 11 past or present Japanese directors, senior managers, auditors and bankers of Olympus for alleged criminal activities or cover-up, and raised considerable turmoil and concern over Japan's prevailing corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> transparency and the Japanese financial markets. Woodford received a reported £10 million ($16 m) in damages from Olympus for defamation and wrongful dismissal in 2012; around the same time, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 percent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015 to reduce its cost base.|$|E
5|$|Even {{cities and}} states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their {{merchant}} Republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how operational <b>governance</b> formalization <b>and</b> flexibility affect organizational performance, both directly and jointly. We build our arguments using learning mechanisms. Based on 434 observations from project managers {{in a large}} multi-department government organization, we hypothesize a positive-increasing U-shaped learning curve effect regarding <b>governance</b> formalization <b>and</b> a positive effect regarding governance flexibility. Most importantly, we hypothesize that <b>governance</b> formalization <b>and</b> flexibility exhibit joint effects. We find that governance flexibility increases performance when formalization is low and decreases performance when formalization is high. Our finding that flexibility can be counter-productive to performance is novel. Overall, this paper contributes to the operational governance literature by clarifying how learning mechanisms explain the joint effects of <b>governance</b> formalization <b>and</b> flexibility...|$|R
