5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her <b>head</b> <b>again.</b> Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began {{updating}} {{the house before}} 1850 (and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square <b>head</b> <b>again,</b> in Elizabethan style.|$|E
25|$|Ali and Mason then chipped {{away at the}} Northamptonshire batsmen, {{and would}} have fancied their chances when the {{visitors}} were 64 for 5. However, a quickfire partnership between Sales and Wright turned the match on its <b>head</b> <b>again,</b> as the pair added 188 runs in 112 minutes - one run less than Northamptonshire had managed in the entire first innings - to send Northamptonshire into a relatively big lead on this pitch. Sales was 152 not out overnight, and powered on to 190 before Malik had him caught. However, the damage was done, and Worcestershire faced a steep target of 360 to win - or five sessions for a draw. Losing Moore and Graeme Hick early on, Ben Smith attacked for a fine 92, and a 45-minute flurry of runs from Zander de Bruyn gave Worcestershire some hope at 154 for 3. However, Monty Panesar got four for 40, Phillips dug out three for 56, Worcestershire lost the last seven wickets for 68 runs, and whimpered into a heap. Worcestershire were later docked one point due to a slow over rate.|$|E

25|$|Going into 2007, Michigan {{had high}} expectations. Standout players Chad Henne, Mike Hart, and Jake Long all opted {{to return for}} their senior seasons for one last crack at Ohio State and {{a chance at a}} {{national}} championship, causing Michigan to be ranked fifth in the preseason polls. However, Michigan's struggles against the spread offense reared its ugly <b>head</b> <b>again</b> as the Wolverines shockingly lose the opener to the Appalachian State Mountaineers. The game marked the first win by a Division I-AA team over a team ranked in the Associated Press Poll. The next week, Michigan was blown out by Oregon, another spread team. Despite the early rough start, Michigan won their next eight games and went into the Ohio State game with a chance to win the Big Ten championship. However, Michigan once again fell to the Buckeyes, this time 14–3. After the game, Lloyd Carr announced that he would retire from Michigan after the bowl game. In the 2008 Capital One Bowl, Carr's final game, Michigan defeated the defending national champion Florida Gators, led by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow, 41–35. Carr's accomplishments at Michigan included a 122–40 record, five Big Ten championships, and one national championship.|$|E

2500|$|Makhaya Ntini and Curtly Ambrose {{are among}} the very few bowlers who {{have been able to}} use their pace and {{accuracy}} to pressure Langer. In his 100th test, Langer was hit by a devastating bouncer from Ntini (South Africa v Australia, 3rd Test, Johannesburg, 2nd day). [...] He underwent scans in hospital and suffered concussion. Despite the risk of being killed if hit on the <b>head</b> <b>again,</b> Langer padded up to bat in the second innings if it was required of him. Captain Ricky Ponting wrote in his diary, that because of Langer's intention of defying medical advice, {{he would have had to}} declare the run chase and forfeit the match to prevent Langer from facing the bowling. Brett Lee scored the winning runs before he was needed, however.|$|E

2500|$|The reunion {{actually}} {{took place in}} early October 1972, beginning with a rehearsal at McGuinn's house, where the band initially worked {{on one of the}} guitarist's new songs. [...] Significantly, the group played none of their old material during this first rehearsal but instead concentrated on selecting suitable songs for a new project. [...] All five musicians were encouraged by the rehearsal and felt sure that they could recreate the magic of The Byrds' golden era. [...] Consequently, they agreed to commence the recording of their first album together in seven years, with the last time that all five had worked together as The Byrds being early 1966, prior to Gene Clark's departure from the band. [...] However, the reunited group were determined that the internal conflict that tore them apart during the 1960s {{would not be allowed to}} rear its <b>head</b> <b>again</b> and so, it was agreed that they would not be a band in the traditional sense, but rather a loose arrangement of solo artists, akin to the modus operandi of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [...] With considerable leverage from David Geffen, McGuinn managed to secure permission from Columbia Records—to which he was still contracted—to record a one-off album for Asylum. [...] As part of the deal, Clive Davis, the president of Columbia Records, specified that McGuinn and Crosby would be required to record a joint album together for Columbia, to be released in 1973. [...] However, this planned Crosby/McGuinn album failed to materialize, due to Davis being fired from Columbia shortly after the exchange deal was struck. [...] While the original quintet prepared to record the reunion album, the existing Columbia line-up of The Byrds, featuring McGuinn, Clarence White, Skip Battin, and John Guerin, continued to make concert appearances in the United States.|$|E
