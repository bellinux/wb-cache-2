40|$|Future {{directions}} of NASA's space program plans include a significant effort at studying the Earth {{as a system}} of interrelated ecosystems. As part of NASA's Earth Observing System (Eos) Program a series of space platforms will be launched and operated to study the Earth {{with a variety of}} active and passive instruments. Several of the Eos instruments will be capable of imaging the planet's surface reflectance on a large number of very narrow portions of the solar spectrum. After the development of appropriate algorithms, this reflectance information will be used to determine key parameters about the structure and function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the pattern and processes of those systems across large areas of the globe. Algorithm development applicable to terrestrial systems will permit the inference of ecological processes from <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>spectrometry</b> data, similar to that to be forthcoming from the Eos mission. The first summer was spent working with tropical soils and relating their reflectance characteristics to particle size, iron content, and color. This summer the emphasis is on vegetation and work was begun with the Forest Ecosystems Dynamics Project in the Earth Resources Branch where both optical and radar characteristics of a mixed conifer/hardwood forest in Maine are being studied for use in a ecological modeling effort. A major series of aircraft overflights will take place throughout the summer. Laboratory and field spectrometers are used to measure the spectral reflectance of a hierarchy of vegetation from individual leaves to whole canopies for eventual modeling of their nutrient content using reflectance data. Key leaf/canopy parameters are being approximated including chlorophyll, nitrogen, phosphorus, water content, and leaf specific weight using <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>spectrometry</b> alone. Measurements are made of carbon exchange across the landscape for input to a spatial modeling effort to gauge production within the forest.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{synthesis}} of bicyclic systems containing a heteroatom (either Ge or P). Part one contains the synthesis, characterization, and equilibration studies of 3 -germabicyclo (3. 2. 1) octane (3 GBO) and 2 -germabicyclo (2. 2. 1) heptane (2 GBH) derivatives. The former was synthesized in a seven-step sequence culminating in the reaction of a bis-Grignard reagent derived from cis- 1, 3 -bis-(bromomethyl) cyclopentane and R 2 GeCl 2 (R = Ph or Me). The latter synthesis required a five-step sequence culminating with a platinum catalyzed intramolecular hydrogermylation reaction of di-n butyl(3 -cyclopentenylmethyl) germane. Derivatives of 3 GBO were initially formed by a cleavage reaction of one/both phenyl group(s) in 3, 3 -diphenyl- 3 GBO, by molecular bromine. Additional derivatives were formed by nucleophilic attack on the bromo derivatives. Fluoride ion catalyzed isomerization reactions of exo- 3 methyl- 3 -phenyl- 3 GBO were unsuccessful; either a hypervalent fluoro substituted germane was not formed under the reaction conditions, or if formed did not undergo intramolecular ligand rearrangement at an observable rate. New compounds were characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR, IR and mass (70 ev and <b>high</b> <b>resolution)</b> <b>spectrometry.</b> Combustion analysis was also employed.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) has {{expressed}} {{a need for}} an on-line, real-time instrument for assaying alpha-emitting radionuclides (uranium and the transuranics) in effluent waters leaving DOE sites to ensure compliance with regulatory limits. Due to the short range of alpha particles in water ({approximately} 40 Tm), it is necessary now to intermittently collect samples of water {{and send them to}} a central laboratory for analysis. A lengthy and costly procedure is used to separate and measure the radionuclides from each sample. Large variations in radionuclide concentrations in the water may go undetected due to the sporadic sampling. Even when detected, the reading may not be representative of the actual stream concentration. To address these issues, Tecogen, a division of Thermo Power Corporation, a Thermo Electron company, is developing a real-time, field-deployable, alpha monitor based on a solid-state silicon wafer semiconductor (patent pending, to be assigned to the Department of Energy). The Thermo Alpha Monitor (TAM) will serve to monitor effluent water streams (Subsurface Contaminants Focus Area) and will be suitable for process control of remediation as well as decontamination and decommissioning operations, such as monitoring scrubber or rinse water radioactivity levels (Mixed Waste Focus Area and D&D Focus Area). It would be applicable for assaying other liquids, such as oil, or solids after proper preconditioning. Rapid isotopic alpha air monitoring is also possible using this technology. This instrument for direct counting of alpha-emitters in aqueous streams is presently being developed by Thermo Power under a development program funded by the DOE Environmental Management program (DOE-EM), administered by the Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC). Under this contract, Thermo Power has demonstrated a solid-state, silicon-based semiconductor instrument, which uses a proprietary film-based collection system to quantitatively extract the radionuclides of interest from the water sample. The new instrument permits extremely sensitive counting of alpha-emitters in water, and it also provides high-resolution alpha spectrometry so that individual radionuclides can be identified and assayed simultaneously, based on their different alpha energies. The specialized film captures a broad (or narrow by choice of film) range of alpha-emitting radionuclide ions dissolved in the liquid. The radionuclides are captured on or near the film's surface, forming a very thin source for <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>spectrometry...</b>|$|E

40|$|A salient goal of {{spectral}} imaging is {{to record}} a so-called hyperspectral data-cube, consisting of two spatial and one spectral dimension. Traditional approaches are based on either time-sequential scanning in either the spatial or spectral dimension: spatial scanning involves passing a fixed aperture over a scene {{in the manner of}} a raster scan and spectral scanning is generally based on the use of a tuneable filter, where typically a series of narrow-band images of a fixed field of view are recorded and assembled into the data-cube. Such techniques are suitable only when the scene in question is static or changes slower than the scan rate. When considering dynamic scenes a time-resolved (snapshot) spectral imaging technique is required. Such techniques acquire the whole data-cube in a single measurement, but require a trade-off in spatial and spectral resolution. These trade-offs prevent current snapshot spectral imaging techniques from achieving resolutions on par with time-sequential techniques. Any snapshot device needs to have an optical architecture that allows it to gather light from the scene and map it to the detector in a way that allows the spatial and spectral components can be de-multiplexed to reconstruct the data-cube. This process results in the decreased resolution of snapshot devices as it becomes a problem of mapping a 3 D data-cube onto a 2 D detector. The sheer volume of data present in the data-cube also presents a processing challenge, particularly in the case of real-time processing. This thesis describes a prototype snapshot spectral imaging device that employs a random-spatial-access technique to record spectra only from the regions of interest in the scene, thus enabling maximisation of integration time and minimisation of data volume and recording rate. The aim of this prototype is to demonstrate how a particular optical architecture will allow for the effect of some of the above mentioned bottlenecks to be removed. Underpinning the basic concept is the fact that in all practical scenes most of the spectrally interesting information is contained in relatively few pixels. The prototype system uses random-spatial-access to multiple points in the scene considered to be of greatest interest. This enables time-resolved <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>spectrometry</b> to be made simultaneously at points across the full field of view. The enabling technology for the prototype was a digital micromirror device (DMD), which is an array of switchable mirrors that was used to create a two channel system. One channel was to a conventional imaging camera, while the other was to a spectrometer. The DMD acted as a dynamic aperture to the spectrometer and could be used to open and close slits in any part of the spectrometer aperture. The imaging channel was used to guide the selection of points of interest from the scene. An extensive geometric calibration was performed to determine the relationships between the DMD and two channels of the system. Two demonstrations of the prototype are given in this thesis: a dynamic biological scene and a static scene sampled using statistical sampling methods enabled by the dynamic aperture of the system. The dynamic scene consisted of red blood cells in motion and also undergoing a process of de-oxygenation which resulted in a change in the spectrum. Ten red blood cells were tracked across the scene and the expected change in spectrum was observed. For the second example the prototype was modified for Raman spectroscopy by adding laser illumination, a mineral sample was scanned and used to test statistical sampling methods. These methods exploited the re-configurable aperture of the system to sample the scene using blind random sampling and a grid based sampling approach. Other spectral imaging systems have a fixed aperture and cannot operate such sampling schemes...|$|E
