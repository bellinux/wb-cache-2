5|$|If {{the office}} of <b>governor</b> becomes vacant through death, resignation, or {{conviction}} on impeachment, the lieutenant <b>governor</b> becomes <b>governor</b> {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the <b>governor,</b> the lieutenant <b>governor</b> only acts out the duties of <b>governor.</b> Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes <b>governor.</b> The position of lieutenant <b>governor</b> was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as <b>governor</b> in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant <b>governor</b> could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant <b>governor</b> could actually become <b>governor</b> in that fashion. The office of <b>governor</b> has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous <b>governor</b> and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{president}} of the state senate acted as <b>governor</b> should that office be vacant. The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of lieutenant <b>governor,</b> who would similarly act as <b>governor.</b> This office was abolished in 1885, with {{the president}} of the senate again taking on that duty. The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant <b>governor,</b> who now becomes <b>governor</b> in the absence of the <b>governor.</b> The <b>governor</b> and lieutenant <b>governor</b> are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of <b>governor</b> become vacant, the {{lieutenant}} <b>governor</b> becomes <b>governor.</b> If both the offices <b>governor</b> and lieutenant <b>governor</b> are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the {{senior members of the}} state senate and state house of representatives of the same party as the <b>governor.</b> The lieutenant <b>governor</b> was elected separately from the <b>governor</b> until a 1968 amendment to the constitution made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

Earlier constitutions said the powers of the <b>governor</b> devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming <b>governor,</b> but the official listing includes these as full governors. The <b>governor</b> and lieutenant <b>governor</b> are not elected on the same ticket.|$|E
