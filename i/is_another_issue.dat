5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses targeting women. Funding <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> impacting the game in Africa, where most financial assistance comes from FIFA and not national football associations. Another challenge is the retention of football players. Many women footballers leave the continent to seek greater opportunity in Europe or the United States.|$|E
5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father {{to pay for an}} illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue.</b> Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
25|$|Viewership on the CBC's French {{television}} network has also declined, {{mostly because of}} stiff competition from private French-language networks. Audience fragmentation <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue.</b> However, {{in contrast to the}} anglophone audience, French Canadians prefer home-grown television programming, a vibrant Quebec star system is in place, and little American or foreign content airs on French-language networks, public or private. And the CBC's French-language radio channel is sometimes the top-rated network.|$|E
50|$|Perfectionism, while {{considered}} to have many positive aspects, can <b>be</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> for gifted individuals. It is encouraged {{by the fact that}} gifted individuals tend to be easily successful in much of what they do.|$|R
50|$|Monitoring the system’s health <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue.</b> There <b>was</b> no {{entity that}} {{monitored}} and controlled the {{processes in the}} system.

25|$|Habitat {{loss and}} degradation, {{especially}} of wetlands, through coastal reclamation (e.g. Saemangeum, Shiwa, Song Do, Namyang Bay, Asan Bay, in the south-west, Gwangyang Bay and the Nakdong Estuary) have caused huge declines in fisheries and of biodiversity. Most riverine wetland in Korea is now {{threatened by the}} proposed Grand Korean Waterway project. There are also some problems air pollution in large cities; as well as water pollution from the discharge of sewage and industrial effluents. Drift netting <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other issues {{involving}} photojournalism include {{the right to}} privacy and the compensation of the news subject. Especially regarding pictures of violence, photojournalists face the ethical dilemma of whether or not to publish images of the victims. The victim's right to privacy is sometimes not addressed or the picture is printed without their knowledge or consent. The compensation of the subject <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue.</b> Subjects often want to be paid in order for the picture to be published, especially if the picture is of a controversial subject.|$|E
25|$|Reintroduction of extirpated native species, such as {{the swift}} fox, <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> that must be {{balanced}} with the needs and tolerances of existing species. Other extirpated species that formerly occupied the grasslands were the bison (Bison bison), wolf (Canis lupus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), {{which may not be}} feasible to reintroduce due to cost and potential conflict with humans. Educational and scientific pursuits require guidelines and permits to protect the landscape from inadvertent damage such as collection of rare species or archaeological samples. Extraction of natural resources such as minerals, gas, oil, and coal are incompatible with the management intent of the protected area, as are linear developments such as roads, pipelines and power lines. As such, only freehold areas may be explored for resource extraction, and no new linear developments are planned; however, construction of a viewing area is being considered to limit and concentrate public access to an approved and controlled area. Fencing and signage, used for public safety and resource protection, are also kept to a minimum.|$|E
50|$|Immigration into Tunisia {{began to}} surge, leading to {{difficulties}} with traditional documentation. Hayreddin proposed {{the issuance of}} passports. Here also the Ottoman capitulatory agreements, which gave extraterritorial legal rights to Europeans resident or transient in Tunis, complicated the situation. Contraband <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|R
50|$|Significant {{drops in}} cell {{capacity}} with increasing discharge rates <b>are</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue.</b> The decrease in cell capacity {{is attributed to}} kinetic charge transfer limits.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{critical}} issue with the commercialization of personalised medicine is the protection of patients. One of the largest issues is the fear and potential consequences for patients who are predisposed after genetic testing or found to be non-responsive towards certain treatments. This includes the psychological effects on patients due to genetic testing results. The right of family members who do not directly consent <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue,</b> considering that genetic predispositions and risks are inheritable. The implications for certain ethnic groups and presence of a common allele {{would also have to}} be considered. [...] In 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers.

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of four bronze statues at {{a construction site}} near the Tinaneios Gardens in Piraeus, Greece on July 18, 1959 is still remembered by an entire generation as a momentous discovery in Modern Greek archaeology. The statues are now featured in the Piraeus Museum, and are {{largely responsible for the}} creation of the modern Archaeological Museum of Piraeus. While drilling in order to lay pipes, the Hydrex Company came across the hand of a bronze kouros (youth) at a depth of approximately 1.50 meters. Excavations began after the custodian of the local museum, Dimitrios Kalantonis, and the Director of the Archaeological Service, Yiannis Papdimitriou, were informed. Four noteworthy bronze statues were uncovered in the continuing excavations – the Archaic Apollo (the kouros whose hand had originally been seen), the large Artemis, a smaller Artemis, and a larger-than-life Athena. However, the enthusiasm for the dig led to poor documentation of the details and context of the finds, leaving rare photos taken by the media or public as the only record. There are multiple theories as to how the statues came to be carefully arranged within what is thought to have been a small square room. When and why the statues were apparently hidden is open to debate, along with their origins, date, and style. One early theory suggests that the statues had been stored near the harbour with the intention of being shipped to Italy [...] however, the presence of coins near the statues dating from a period of war opens up another possibility – that the statues were hidden for safe keeping, and then lost when the building was destroyed. Dating the concealment of the statues <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue,</b> as they may have been buried anytime between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD. The statue of the kouros was recognized to be of Apollo, and dated to the 5th century BC. The other three female statues, from the 4th century BC, show a different, more human, form of sculpture that sets them apart from their older companion.|$|E
60|$|But there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> {{which must}} not be overlooked. I mean the social issue. We have taken a great step already. I must {{say that he is}} rather a sour kind of man who can find nothing to notice in the Old-Age Pensions Act except its little flaws and petty defects. I think you will feel, on the contrary, that the {{establishment}} of the pensions system is a marvellous and impressive example of the power which British Governments possess. Without a hitch, perfectly smoothly, punctual to the minute, regular as clockwork, nearly 600,000 aged persons are being paid their pensions every week. That is a wonderful and beneficent achievement, a good job well worth some risk and sweat to finish. Nearly eight millions of money are being sent circulating through unusual channels, long frozen by poverty, circulating in the homes of the poor, flowing through the little shops which cater to their needs, cementing again family unions which harsh fate was tearing asunder, uniting the wife to the husband, and the parent to the children. No; in spite of Socialistic sneer and Tory jeer and glorious beer, {{and all the rest of}} it, I say it is a noble and inspiring event, for which this Parliament will be justly honoured by generations unborn. I said just now that a Tory tariff victory meant marching backwards, but there are some things they cannot undo. We may be driven from power. We may desire to be released from responsibility. Much of our work may be cut short, much may be overturned. But there are some things which Tory reaction will not dare to touch, and, like the settlement and reconciliation of South Africa, so the Old-Age Pensions Act will live and grow and ripen as the years roll by, far beyond the reach of Party warfare and far above the changing moods of faction.|$|E

50|$|The de Valliere guns proved rather good in siege warfare, {{but were}} less {{satisfactory}} {{in a war}} of movement.
