50|$|Dammar gum, or <b>damar</b> <b>gum,</b> is {{obtained}} from the Dipterocarpaceae family of trees in India and East Asia, principally those of the genera Shorea, Balanocarpus or Hopea. Most is produced by tapping trees; however, some is collected in fossilised form from the ground. The gum varies in colour from clear to pale yellow, while the fossilised form is grey-brown. Dammar gum is a triterpenoid resin, containing {{a large number of}} triterpenes and their oxidation products. Many of them are low molecular weight compounds (dammarane, dammarenolic acid, oleanane, oleanonic acid, etc.), but dammar also contains a polymeric fraction, composed of polycadinene.|$|E
40|$|A natural <b>gum,</b> <b>damar</b> was {{investigated}} as a novel microencapsulating material for sustained drug delivery. Microparticles were prepared by oil-in-oil emulsion solvent evaporation method. Ibuprofen and diltiazem hydrochloride {{were used as}} model drugs. Microparticles were evaluated for particle size, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release kinetics. Images of the microparticles were obtained by bright field microscopy. The effect of different gum:drug ratios and solubility of drug on microparticle properties was principally investigated. <b>Gum</b> <b>damar</b> could produce discrete and spherical microparticles with both drugs. With a freely water soluble drug (diltiazem hydrochloride), <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> produced bigger (45 - 50 &#x 00 B 5;m) and fast drug releasing microparticles with low encapsulation efficiencies (44 - 57 &#x 0025;). Contrary, with a slightly water soluble drug (ibuprofen), <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> produced small (24 - 33 &#x 00 B 5;m) microparticles with better drug encapsulation (85 - 91 &#x 0025;) and sustained drug delivery. The increase in gum:drug ratio showed an increase in particle size, encapsulation efficiency and decrease in drug release rate in all cases. Drug release profiles of all microparticles followed zero order kinetics. In conclusion, <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> can be used successfully to produce discrete and spherical microparticles of ibuprofen and diltiazem hydrochloride...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the evaluation of}} natural gum copal and <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> as novel sustained release matrix forming materials in tablet formulation. Along with the physicochemical properties, gum copal and <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> were characterized for molecular weight, polydispersity index and glass transition temperature. Matrix tablets were prepared by wet granulation technique using isopropyl alcohol as a granulating agent. Diclofenac sodium {{was used as a}} model drug. Tablet weight (250 mg) and diameter (9 mm) was kept constant. Tablets were evaluated for pharmacotechnical properties, drug content uniformity and in vitro drug release kinetics. Effect of gum concentration (10, 20 and 30 &#x 0025; w/w with respect to total tablet weight) on in vitro drug release profile was examined. Both the gums produced matrix tablets with good strength and acceptable pharmacotechnical properties. Matrix tablets with 30 &#x 0025; w/w gum copal and <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> showed sustained drug delivery beyond 10 h. Drug release from gum copal matrix tablets followed zero order kinetics while <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> (10 and 20 &#x 0025; w/w) was found suitable to formulate the insoluble plastic matrix that releases the drug by diffusion. It is concluded that both gums possess substantial matrix forming property {{that could be used for}} sustained drug delivery...|$|R
40|$|The {{formulations}} {{consisting of}} a hydrophilic and hydrophobic material were investigated for effect on drug-release pattern from the matrices. <b>Gum</b> <b>damar</b> and <b>gum</b> copal being water-insoluble were used to study the efficiency of combined matrices to sustain the release of drug. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K 100 M and diclofenac sodium were used as the hydrophilic material and model drug, respectively. The influence of concentration of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose on drug release pattern of hydrophobic material was determined. The optimum ratio of drug: polymer {{was found to be}} 1 : 1. The hydrophobic:hydrophilic polymer ratio of 75 : 25 was found to have a similar release pattern as that of marketed formulation. At this ratio, the initial burst-release that occurred in individual hydrophobic matrices was lowered to a great extent. The release of drug was found to follow Higuchiâ€²s equation as the concentration of hydrophobic material was increased. The formulations were compared with marketed formulation Voveran SR, and a correlation was drawn accordingly...|$|R
50|$|The {{sailing ship}} was bound from Batavia to Amsterdam with a cargo of tobacco, sugar, coffee, India rubber, gall-nuts, <b>gum</b> <b>damar,</b> and tin {{when she was}} wrecked at Strandfontein near Muizenberg, South Africa, on 15 July 1862. No lives were lost. Blame for the wreck {{was placed on the}} pilot refusing to use the {{services}} of a harbor pilot.|$|R
40|$|Metformin {{hydrochloride}} has {{relatively short}} plasma half-life, low absolute bioavailability. The {{need for the}} administration {{two to three times}} a day when larger doses are required can decrease patient compliance. Sustained release formulation that would maintain plasma level for 8 - 12 h might be sufficient for daily dosing of metformin. Sustained release products are needed for metformin to prolong its duration of action and to improve patient compliances. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} develop an oral sustained release metformin hydrochloride tablet by using hydrophilic Eudragit RSPO alone or its combination with hydrophobic natural polymers Gum copal and <b>gum</b> <b>damar</b> as rate controlling factor. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method. The in vitro dissolution study was carried out using USP 22 apparatus I, paddle method and the data was analysed using zero order, first order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer and Hixson-Crowell equations. The drug release study revealed that Eudragit RSPO alone was unable to sustain the drug release. Combining Eudragit with gum Copal and <b>gum</b> <b>Damar</b> sustained the drug release for more than 12 h. Kinetic modeling of in vitro dissolution profiles revealed the drug release mechanism ranges from diffusion controlled or Fickian transport to anomalous type or non-Fickian transport. Fitting the in vitro drug release data to Korsmeyer equation indicated that diffusion along with erosion could be the mechanism of drug release...|$|R
