40|$|Several {{conceptual}} hypersonic research airplanes, designed {{within the}} constraints of a B- 52 launch aircraft, have been studied experimentally and analytically at Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 6. 0. Vehicles built to these criteria for Mach 6 cruise were shown to be feasible, if careful {{attention was paid to}} the low speed lift, drag, and high angle of attack stability to assure successful landings and transonic pitch angle maneuvers. The integrated scramjet engine drag was high at subsonic speeds and appears to be constant with Reynolds number. The variable geometry airfoil used previously to improve directional stability was shown to be equally adaptable to the improvement of longitudinal stability. The vortex lattice theory gave good subsonic predictions of lift, drag due to lift, and pitching moments. Wind tunnel tests must be relied on for the drag at zero lift, trim, static margins and lateral-directional stability. The Gentry Hypersonic Arbitrary Body Program gave good predictions of the trends of lift, drag, and pitching moments with angle of attack at Mach numbers above 3, but the level of the values were not consistently predicted. No currently available theory or program gave accurate predictions of directional stability or <b>dihedral</b> <b>effects</b> at hypersonic speeds...|$|R

In {{the last}} decade folding tube launch UAV became common, for which {{aerodynamic}} scheme "tandem" is reasonable. By the time tandem-wing aerodynamic characteristics are researched much less than ones of traditional scheme. Particularly it concerns wing <b>dihedral</b> angle <b>effect</b> on lift-to-drag ratio about which no quantitative data were found. Forward or rear wing dihedral angle appearance result in circulation redistribution and changing of rear wing induced drag. Rear wing <b>dihedral</b> angle <b>effect</b> on longitudinal aerodynamic performance of tandem-wing UAV model was researched through wind tunnel experiment. Geometry variables were forward and rear wing spans, rear wing dihedral angle and longitudinal stagger. Lift, drag and longitudinal moment coefficients were defined. The possibility of lift-to-drag ratio increasing at cruise regime was proofed. Rear wing negative dihedral angle application is able to increase maximal lift-to-drag ratio by more than 1. 0 or about 10 %. It was found that wing dihedral angle effectiveness depends from relation of forward and rear wing spans and from longitudinal stagger. Longitudinal stagger increasing results in dihedral angle effectiveness falling if forward wing span is higher than rear wing. For bigger rear wing span increasing of longitudinal stagger results in dihedral angle effectiveness gaining. The hypothesis was declared that proposes theoretical explanation of experimentally founded dependencies. Also dihedral angle appearance increases lift slope because of rear wing carrying capacity gain and has almost no influence on maximal lift coefficient. All dependencies founded for rear wing negative dihedral angle are correct for forward wing positive dihedral angle except the last one is increasing longitudinal and lateral stability. ??? ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ???????? ??? ?????? ???????????? ? ???????????????? ????? ???? ??????????? ??????? ???? ???????????

40|$|The FAST/ADAMS/AeroDyn {{system of}} codes {{has been widely}} used to perform the aero-structural {{analysis}} of conventional wind turbine blades. Recent advances in blade design involve the development of aeroelastic tailored blades with large amounts of sweep, and blades with winglets. However, the existing Blade Element Momentum (BEM) approach in AeroDyn is limited to straight blades and {{does not account for}} sweep or <b>dihedral</b> <b>effects.</b> The goal of this work is to obtain higher fidelity aerodynamic loads predictions for such advanced blade designs. A Vortex Line Method (VLM) for computing aerodynamic loads has been coupled to ADAMS through modification of the existing AeroDyn interface. The VLM approach adopted here adds fidelity by modeling the <b>effects</b> of sweep, <b>dihedral,</b> 3 D wakes, and wake dynamics. An existing steady/unsteady VLM code with these capabilities was restructured to allow its integration with AeroDyn. The FAST routines from NREL, which are used as a preprocessor to ADAMS, and the ADAMS/AeroDyn interface itself, were also modified to create an ADAMS model that properly accounts for the curvature of the blade that occurs when large amounts of sweep or winglets are present. The resulting ADAMS/VLM model was compared to the original ADAMS/BEM model for a straight blade and for a highly swept blade. The model was also applied to blades with pressure-side and suction-side winglet configurations. The BEM and VLM models give similar aero predictions for the straight blade, as expected. The induced twist and blade deformations are found to be more similar for the two methods than the aerodynamic loads. Computations were made for the blades with the winglets at different wind speeds and different pitch settings, and results were obtained for blade deflection, induced twist, and thrust and torque force distributions...|$|R

A rocketed winged-body is the current focus. The configuration (WB 001) is a vertically-launched, horizontally-landing system with circular cross-section. Preliminary aerodynamic data was generated by LaRC and is a combination of wind-tunnel data, empirical methods, and Aerodynamic Preliminary Analysis System-(APAS) generated values. JSC's efforts involve descent trajectory design, stability analysis, and flight control system synthesis. Analysis of WB 001 's static stability indicates instability in 'tuck' (C(sub mu) less than 0 : Mach = 0. 30, alpha greater than 3. 25 deg; Mach = 0. 60, alpha greater than 8. 04), an unstable <b>dihedral</b> <b>effects</b> (C(sub l(beta)) greater than 0 : Mach = 30,alpha less than 12 deg.; Mach = 0. 60, alpha less than 10. 00 deg.), and, most significantly, an unstable weathercock stability derivative, C(sub n(beta)), at all angles of attack and subsonic Mach numbers. Longitudinal trim solutions for Mach = 0. 30 and 0. 60 indicate flight path angle possibilities ranging from around 12 (M = 0. 30) to slightly over 20 degrees at Mach = 0. 60. Trim angles of attack increase from 6. 24 at Mach 0. 60 and 10, 000 feet to 17. 7 deg. at Mach 0. 30, sea-level. Lateral trim was attempted for a design cross-wind of 25. 0 knots. The current vehicle aerodynamic and geometric characteristics will only yield a lateral trim solution at impractical tip-fin deflections (approximately equal to 43 deg.) and bank angles (21 deg.). A study of the lateral control surfaces, tip-fin controllers for WB 001, indicate increased surface area would help address these instabilities, particularly the deficiency in C(sub n(beta)), but obviously at the expense of increased vehicle weight.

40|$|Abstract Protein methyl {{groups have}} {{recently}} {{been the subject of}} much attention in NMR spectroscopy because of the opportunities that they provide to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins and protein complexes. With the advent of selective labeling schemes, methyl groups are particularly interesting in the context of chemical shift based protein structure determination, an approach that to date has exploited primarily the mapping between protein structures and backbone chemical shifts. In order to extend the scope of chemical shifts for structure determination, we present here the CH 3 Shift method of performing structure-based predictions of methyl chemical shifts. The terms considered in the predictions take account of ring current, magnetic anisotropy, electric field, rota-meric type, and <b>dihedral</b> angle <b>effects,</b> which are consid-ered in conjunction with polynomial functions of interatomic distances. We show that the CH 3 Shift method achieves an accuracy in the predictions that ranges from 0. 133 to 0. 198 ppm for 1 H chemical shifts for Ala, Thr, Val, Leu and Ile methyl groups. We illustrate the use of the method by assessing the accuracy of side-chain structures in structural ensembles representing the dynamics of proteins...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} chiral {{diphosphine}} ligands denoted as PQ-Phos was prepared by atropdiastereoselective Ullmann coupling and ring-closure reactions. The Ullmann coupling {{reaction of the}} biaryl diphosphine dioxides is featured by highly efficient central-to-axial chirality transfer with diastereomeric excess > 99 %. This substrate-directed diastereomeric biaryl coupling reaction is unprecedented for the preparation of chiral diphosphine dioxides, and our method precludes the tedious resolution procedures usually required for preparing enantiomerically pure diphosphine ligands. The effect of chiral recognition was also revealed in a relevant asymmetric ring-closure reaction. The chiral tether bridging the two aryl units creates a conformationally rigid scaffold essential for enantiofacial differentiation; fine-tuning of the ligand scaffold (e. g., dihedral angles) {{can be achieved by}} varying the chain length of the chiral tether. The enantiomerically pure Ru- and Ir-PQ-Phos complexes have been prepared and applied to the catalytic enantioselective hydrogenations of α- and β-ketoesters (CO bond reduction), 2 -(6 ‘-methoxy- 2 ‘-naphthyl) propenoic acid, alkyl-substituted β-dehydroamino acids (CC bond reduction), and N-heteroaromatic compounds (CN bond reduction). An excellent level of enantioselection (up to 99. 9 % ee) has been attained for the catalytic reactions.

5000|$|During {{design of}} a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft (or any aircraft with horizontal surfaces), changing dihedral angle is usually a relatively simple way to adjust the overall <b>dihedral</b> <b>effect.</b> This is to compensate for other design elements' influence on the <b>dihedral</b> <b>effect.</b> These other elements (such as wing sweep, vertical mount point of the wing, etc.) may {{be more difficult to}} change than the dihedral angle. As a result, differing amounts of dihedral angle can be found on different types of fixed-wing aircraft. For example, the dihedral angle is usually greater on low-wing aircraft than on otherwise-similar high-wing aircraft. This is because [...] "highness" [...] of a wing (or [...] "lowness" [...] of vertical center of gravity compared to the wing) naturally creates more <b>dihedral</b> <b>effect</b> itself.

40|$|Using a semiempirical quantum {{mechanical}} procedure (FCPAC) we have {{calculated the}} partial atomic charges of amino acids from 494 high-resolution protein structures. To analyze {{the influence of}} the protein's environment, we considered each residue under two conditions: either as the center of a tripeptide with PDB structure geometry (free) or as the center of 13 - 16 amino acid clusters extracted from the PDB structure (buried). The partial atomic charges from residues in helices and in sheets were separated. The FCPAC partial atomic charges of the Cbeta and Calpha of most residues correlate with their helix propensity, positively for Cbeta and negatively for Calpha (r 2 = 0. 76 and 0. 6, respectively). The main consequence of burying residues in proteins is the polarization of the backbone C=O bond, which is more pronounced in helices than in sheets. The average shift of the oxygen partial charges that results from burying is - 0. 120 in helix and - 0. 084 in sheet with the charge of the proton as unit. Linear correlations are found between the average NMR chemical shifts and the average FCPAC partial charges of Calpha (r 2 = 0. 8 - 0. 85), N (r 3 = 0. 67 - 0. 72), and Cbeta (r 2 = 0. 62) atoms. Correlations for helix and beta-sheet FCPAC partial charges show parallel regressions, suggesting that the charge variations due to burying in proteins differentiate between the <b>dihedral</b> angle <b>effects</b> and the polarization of backbone atoms.

This aircraft configuration is defined, {{for the purpose of}} this discussion, as one having multiple sweep and <b>dihedral</b> angles. The <b>effects</b> of changes in the static margin and of gusts on handling qualities were investigated for this new configuration. The Exulans, an aircraft currently under development, was used as a representative example of a tailless swept gullwing configuration. The Exulans uses variable outboard wing sweep as a means of static margin control. This is achieved by a sweep hinge located at semispan. The pilot can change the outboard wing sweep angle for purposes of pitch trim. The Exulans is a research test bed that is being used to investigate the possibility of designing a tailless aircraft with both good handling qualities and a high Oswald efficiency. The handling qualities investigation was limited to the longitudinal plane. A Neal–Smith handling quality analysis was used to investigate handling qualities at different static margins, and a Mönnich–Dalldorff analysis was used to investigate gust handling qualities. Time domain simulations were also used to investigate the aircraft gust response. It is shown that the gull-wing configuration promises to have satisfactory handling qualities for a region of center of gravity locations, for which good Oswald efficiency can also be achieved.
