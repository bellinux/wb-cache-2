2500|$|According to {{hydrodynamic}} theory, fluids within <b>dentinal</b> <b>tubules</b> {{are believed}} to be the mechanism by which pain receptors are triggered within the pulp of the tooth. [...] Since sclerotic dentin prevents the passage of such fluids, pain that would otherwise serve as a warning of the invading bacteria may not develop at first. [...] Consequently, dental caries may progress {{for a long period of}} time without any sensitivity of the tooth, allowing for greater loss of tooth structure.|$|E
2500|$|As the enamel and dentin are destroyed, {{the cavity}} becomes more noticeable. [...] The {{affected}} {{areas of the}} tooth change color and become soft to the touch. [...] Once the decay passes through enamel, the <b>dentinal</b> <b>tubules,</b> which have passages to the nerve of the tooth, become exposed, resulting in pain that can be transient, temporarily worsening with exposure to heat, cold, or sweet foods and drinks. [...] A tooth weakened by extensive internal decay can sometimes suddenly fracture under normal chewing forces. When the decay has progressed enough to allow the bacteria to overwhelm the pulp tissue {{in the center of}} the tooth, a toothache can result and the pain will become more constant. Death of the pulp tissue and infection are common consequences. The tooth will no longer be sensitive to hot or cold, but can be very tender to pressure.|$|E

The smear layer remained intact in all the roots of group A. Complete removal of the smear layer in group B was achieved after irrigation with 3 ml of 17% EDTA for 3 min, followed by 3 ml of 1% NaOCl solution. Ten roots from each group were obturated with AH Plus and laterally condensed gutta-percha points.

After complete setting, the maximum penetration depth of the sealers into the <b>dentinal</b> <b>tubules</b> was examined in upper, middle, and lower levels. The smear layer prevented all the sealers from penetrating <b>dentinal</b> <b>tubules.</b> In contrast, in smear layer-free root canals, all the sealers penetrated <b>dentinal</b> <b>tubules,</b> although the depth of penetration varied between the sealers.

5000|$|In response, {{the fluid}} inside the tubules brings {{immunoglobulins}} from {{the immune system}} to fight the bacterial infection. At the same time, there is an increase of mineralization of the surrounding tubules. [...] This results in a constriction of the tubules, which {{is an attempt to}} slow the bacterial progression.

40|$|Background: Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} {{results when}} patent tubules {{are exposed to}} pain-inducing external stimuli. Aim: This study aims to compare the effects of two desensitizing dentifrices containing NovaMin and arginine on <b>dentinal</b> <b>tubule</b> occlusion with and without citric acid challenge in vitro using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Materials and Methods: Forty dentin discs were randomly divided into Groups I and II containing twenty specimens each, treated with NovaMin and arginine-containing dentifrices, respectively. Groups I and II were divided into subgroups A and B where IA and IIA underwent CLSM analysis to determine the percentage of tubule occlusion while IB and IIB underwent 0. 3 % citric acid challenge and CLSM analysis. A novel grading system was devised to categorize tubule occlusion. Results: In Group II, the percentage of occluded tubules was highest for IIA (72. 25 % ± 10. 57 %) and least for IIB (42. 55 % ± 8. 65 %) having statistical significance (P < 0. 0005). In Group I, the difference between IA (49. 9 % ± 12. 96 %) and IB (43. 15 % ± 12. 43 %) was statistically insignificant (P = 0. 249). On the comparison between IB and IIB statistically indifferent result was obtained (P = 0. 901), whereas the difference between IA and IIA was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). The results of grading system were for IA 50 % of samples belonged to Grade 2, for IIA 60 % - Grade 3, and for IB 70 % and for IIB 90 % - Grade 2.

AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} fluoride iontophoresis on the microtensile bond strength (MTBS) between coronal dentin and two resin-based adhesive systems, and to measure quantitatively <b>dentinal</b> <b>tubule</b> occlusion. METHODS: Twelve freshly extracted intact human mandibular third molars were divided randomly into four groups. The superficial occlusal dentin of each tooth was exposed and treated. Group A 1 : One-Step Plus total-etch adhesive system; group A 2 : One-Step Plus total-etch adhesive system after fluoride iontophoresis; group B 1 : ACE BOND SE self-etching adhesive system; group B 2 : ACE BOND SE self-etching adhesive system after fluoride iontophoresis. A resin composite buildup was made for each tooth, which was then sectioned along its long axis to produce 10 beams (1. 0 mm x 1. 0 mm) for the microtensile bond strength (MTBS) test. Five dentin disks were cut in half and their occlusal surfaces etched with 6 % citric acid. The test halves were treated with fluoride iontophoresis. Four SEM photomicrographs were taken from corresponding sites on each test and each non-treated control half-disk. Image-Pro Plus 4 software quantified the percentage of tubule occlusion. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, chi(2) - and t-tests, with the probability level set at alpha= 0. 05. RESULTS: The mean MTBS (MPa) for each group was, A 1 : 30. 86 (S. D. 6. 84); A 2 : 25. 04 (8. 49); B 1 : 19. 22 (6. 88); B 2 : 19. 40 (6. 92). There were significant differences among all groups (P < or = 0. 02), except between groups B 1 and B 2 (P= 0. 92).
