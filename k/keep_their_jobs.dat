500|$|After {{completing}} his doctorate, Sledd obtained an appointment {{as a professor}} of Greek at Methodist-affiliated Southern University (now known as Birmingham–Southern College) in Greensboro, Alabama. Several months later, on July 6, 1904, he was unanimously selected to be the president of the University of Florida at Lake City by its board of trustees. At the time of his appointment, the University of Florida at Lake City was experiencing a controversy of its own: its administration and faculty were hopelessly fractured by personality conflicts and its unpopular president's failed attempts at improving the small school's instruction and academic standing. The university's board of trustees had removed the ineffectual president, and dismissed seven members of its small faculty. The university, such as it was, had been known as [...] "Florida Agricultural College" [...] until 1903. When Sledd arrived in Lake City, it was a school with a new name, a faculty fractured by contentious personalities, an unknown number of returning students and an uncertain future. Sledd required all previous faculty members to re-apply if they desired to <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> hired replacement instructors, most of whom had earned doctoral degrees in their respective fields (in contrast to the previous faculty), and set about devising rigorous academic standards for the school's new students. Although the university was a designated land-grant college under the federal government's Morrill Act, it received insufficient annual financial assistance from the state government, and its finances remained tenuous.|$|E

Supported employment is for those individuals who need help finding a job, intensive support to learn the job, and on-going follow-along support in order to <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> <b>job.</b> It is based on the premise that individuals do no have to “get ready ” for work but rather receive the necessary supports that bridge the gap between their skills and the job requirements once they are employed. Job coach assistance is provided more intensely at first followed by intermittent on-going support once that individual is able to complete the job. Examples of some of the supports that may help someone perform <b>their</b> <b>job</b> are: advocacy, natural supports, assistive technology, job modifications, job carving, rehabilitation engineering, compensatory strategies, and behavioral training techniques...|$|R

It investigates potential dynamic links between statistical discrimination, mobility, tenure and wage profiles. The model assumes {{that it is more}} costly for an employer to assess female workers' productivity and that the noise/signal ratio tapers off more rapidly for male workers. These two assumptions yield numerous theoretical predictions pertaining to gender wage gaps. These predictions are tested using data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. As predicted by our statistical discrimination model, we find that men and women have the same wage at the start of their career, but that female wages grow at a slower rate, creating a gender wage gap. Also consistent with our model, we find that mean wages are higher for workers who <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> while wage growth is stronger for workers who change job...|$|R
