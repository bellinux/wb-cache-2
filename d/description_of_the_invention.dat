2500|$|On January 7, 1791, France {{passed a}} patent law that stated that [...] "Any new {{discovery}} or invention, in {{all types of}} industry, is owned by its author...". [...] Inventors paid a fee depending upon the desired term of the patent (5, 10, 15 years), filed a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> and were granted a patent. [...] There was no preexamination. [...] Validity was determined in courts. [...] 14 out of 48 of the initial patents were for financial inventions. In June 1792, for example, a patent was issued to inventor F. P. Dousset for a type of tontine in combination with a lottery. [...] These patents raised concerns and were banned and declared invalid in {{an amendment to the}} law passed in 1792.|$|E

Patents are accompanied by detailed textual <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inventions,</b> and often, by drawings of electrical, mechanical, or chemical (Markush) structures. The seminar series—Developing Patent Research Expertise—focuses on online retrieval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patent literature worldwide. It is divided into the following parts...|$|R
5000|$|... a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> in spoken words uttered in public; oral disclosure, {{which may}} not be {{recorded}} ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{content of}} the {{document}} or documents which that person filed {{with a view to}} initiating the above; most pertinently, a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> together with at least one claim purporting to define it.|$|E
5000|$|A patent {{specification}} is {{a document describing}} the invention for which a patent is sought and setting out {{the scope of the}} protection of the patent. As such, a specification generally contains a section detailing the background and overview of the invention, a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> and embodiments of the invention and claims, which set out the scope of the protection. A specification may include figures to aid the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention,</b> gene sequences and references to biological deposits, or computer code, depending upon {{the subject matter of the}} application. Most patent offices also require that the application includes an abstract which provides a summary of the invention to aid searching. A title must also generally be provided for the application.|$|E
5000|$|The Disclosure Document Program (DDP) was a USPTO {{program that}} allowed an {{inventor}} {{to file a}} preliminary <b>description</b> <b>of</b> his/her <b>invention.</b> <b>The</b> program was discontinued by <b>the</b> USPTO as <b>of</b> February 1, 2007, in favor of filing a provisional application. The USPTO says: ...|$|R
25|$|Stranger in a Strange Land {{contains}} an early <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waterbed, an <b>invention</b> that made its real-world debut in 1968. Charles Hall, who brought a waterbed design to the United States Patent Office, was refused {{a patent on}} the grounds that Heinlein's descriptions in Stranger in a Strange Land and another novel, Double Star (1956), constituted prior art.|$|R
25|$|Meucci and his {{business}} partners hired an attorney (J.D. Stetson), who filed a caveat on behalf <b>of</b> Meucci with <b>the</b> patent office. They had wanted to prepare a patent application, but the partners did not provide the $250 fee, so all that was prepared was a caveat, since the fee for that was only $20. However, the caveat did not contain a clear <b>description</b> <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> asserted <b>invention</b> would actually function. Meucci advocates claim the attorney erased margin notes Meucci had added to the document.|$|R
50|$|The date of {{receipt of}} the {{application}} shall be recognised as the filing date if as {{at the time of}} receipt, the application contained indications as to the request for a patent grant, indications as to the identity of the applicant and a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A patent {{application}} (i.e., the document which an applicant files {{with a view}} to initiating the {{patent application}} process) generally contains a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> together with at least one claim purporting to define it. A patent application may also include drawings to illustrate the invention. Furthermore, an abstract is generally required.|$|E
5000|$|As another example, a European patent {{application}} consists of [...] "a {{request for the}} grant of a European patent, a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention,</b> one or more claims, any drawings {{referred to in the}} description or claims, and an abstract." [...] specifies what the description of a European {{patent application}} should contain in more details.|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} is provided for describing multimedia content {{and a system}} in which a plurality of multimedia storage devices employing <b>the</b> content <b>description</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present <b>invention</b> can interoperate.

5000|$|German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher's 1645 book Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae {{included}} a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> his <b>invention,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Steganographic Mirror": a primitive projection {{system with a}} focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication. In 1654 Belgian Jesuit mathematician André Tacquet used Kircher's technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary Martino Martini. It is unknown how exactly Tacquet used Kircher's system, but it is imaginable that he drew pictures on the projecting mirror while details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey were explained.|$|R
5000|$|The Edisonian {{approach}} to innovation {{is characterized by}} trial and error discovery rather than a systematic theoretical approach. This may be a convenient term, but it is an inaccurate and misleading <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> actually used by Thomas Edison. An often quoted example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Edisonian approach is the successful but protracted process he is said to have used to invent a practical incandescent light bulb. Trial and error alone cannot account for Edison's success with electric lighting when so many others failed (Friedel and Israel (1987) list 23 others) or his remarkable record of almost 1100 patents (see <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> Edison patents).|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{specification}} shall {{contain a}} written <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention,</b> {{and of the}} manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person {{skilled in the art}} to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor or joint inventor of carrying out the invention." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{standard}} {{patent application}} is a patent application containing {{all of the}} necessary parts (e.g. a written <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> and claims) that are required for the grant of a patent. A standard patent {{may or may not}} result in the grant of a patent depending upon the outcome of an examination by the patent office it is filed in. In the U.S., a standard patent application is referred to as a [...] "non-provisional" [...] application.|$|E
5000|$|The written <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> in Katz's patents usually runs 20 to 40 pages, but {{the claims}} run into {{hundreds}} of pages. [...] "He has {{literally thousands of}} claims, and they differ only in trivial respects. Many are broad and vague, and sorting them out {{takes a lot of}} time, causing unncessary frustration. Raus." [...] says an attorney {{who asked not to be}} named. Katz denies that his strategy is to overly amend and complicate his patents.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Statistical machine {{translation}} of patents requires large a-mounts of sentence-parallel data. Translations of patent text often exist for parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patent document, namely title, abstract and claims. However, {{there are no}} direct translations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document, <b>the</b> <b>description</b> or background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention.</b> We document a twofold approach for extracting parallel data from all patent document sections from a large multilingual patent corpus. Since language and style differ depending on document section (title, abstract, description, claims) and patent topic (according to the International Patent Classification), we sort the processed data into subdomains in order to enable its use in domain-oriented translation, e. g. when applying multi-task learning. We investigate several similarity metrics and apply them to <b>the</b> domains <b>of</b> patent topic and patent document sections. Product of our research is a corpus of 23 million parallel German-English sentences extracted from the MAREC patent corpus and a descriptive analysis of its subdomains. ...|$|R
5000|$|The first United States Patent titled [...] "Clothes Washing" [...] {{was granted}} to Nathaniel Briggs of New Hampshire in 1797. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Patent Office fire in 1836, no <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device survives. <b>Invention</b> <b>of</b> {{a washing machine}} is also {{attributed}} to Watervliet Shaker Village, as a patent was issued to an Amos Larcom of Watervliet, New York, in 1829, {{but it is not}} certain that Larcom was a Shaker. A device that combined a washing machine with a wringer mechanism did not appear until 1843, when Canadian John E. Turnbull of Saint John, New Brunswick patented a [...] "Clothes Washer With Wringer Rolls." [...] During the 1850s, Nicholas Bennett from the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society at New Lebanon, New York, invented a [...] "wash mill", but in 1858 he assigned the patent to David Parker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canterbury Shaker Village, where it was registered as the [...] "Improved Washing Machine".|$|R
5000|$|The treaty allows [...] "deposits of {{microorganisms}} {{at an international}} depositary authority to be recognized for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> patent procedure". Usually, {{in order to meet}} <b>the</b> legal requirement <b>of</b> sufficiency of disclosure, patent applications and patents must disclose in their <b>description</b> <b>the</b> subject-matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> in a manner sufficiently clear and complete to be carried out by the person skilled in the art (see also: reduction to practice). When an invention involves a microorganism, completely describing said <b>invention</b> in <b>the</b> description to enable third parties to carry it out is usually impossible. This is why, in <b>the</b> particular case <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> involving microorganisms, a deposit of biological material must be made in a recognised institution. The Budapest Treaty ensures that an applicant, i.e. a person who applies for a patent, needs not to deposit the biological material in all countries where he/she wants to obtain a patent. The applicant needs only to deposit the biological material at one recognised institution, and this deposit will be recognised in all countries party to the Budapest Treaty.|$|R
5000|$|Most patent {{applications}} have {{at least}} two components, including a general, written <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> and at least one [...] "embodiment" [...] thereof, and a set of [...] "claims," [...] written in a special style that defines exactly what the applicant regards as the particular features of his or her invention. These claims are used to distinguish the invention from the existing prior art, and are compared by the patent office to the prior art before issuing a patent.|$|E
5000|$|... 35 U.S.C. 112 Specification.:(a) IN GENERAL.—The {{specification}} shall {{contain a}} written <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention,</b> {{and of the}} manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person {{skilled in the art}} to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor or joint inventor of carrying out the invention.|$|E
50|$|Swan {{was educated}} at Castleknock College {{and worked as}} a {{cardiologist}} in the Mayo Clinic (in Rochester, Minnesota), and later moved to Cedars Sinai Hospital (Los Angeles). His <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> of the catheter is said to have derived from watching the wind playing with sails in Santa Monica. He was present at the Mayo around the time they were performing early open heart surgeries in the mid-1950s. He died from complications following a heart attack following a long period of debilitation from a stroke.|$|E
5000|$|The 1645 {{first edition}} of German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher's book Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae {{included}} a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> his <b>invention,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Steganographic Mirror": a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication. He saw limitations in <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> size and diminished clarity over a long distance and expressed his hope that someone would find a method to improve on this. Kircher also suggested projecting live flies and shadow puppets from <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mirror. The book was quite influential and inspired many scholars, probably including Christiaan Huygens who would invent the magic lantern. Kircher was often credited as <b>the</b> inventor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magic lantern, although in his 1671 edition of Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae Kircher himself credited Danish mathematician Thomas Rasmussen Walgensten for the magic lantern, which Kircher saw as a further development of his own projection system.|$|R
40|$|A brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nanotechnological <b>inventions</b> is given. <b>The</b> <b>inventions</b> in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> {{nanotechnologies}} and nanomaterials {{produce a}} profound effect in construction, housing and communal services and adjacent economic fields as they allow us: to obtain high strength and durability <b>of</b> surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> details, to provide different materials with hydrophil properties, to increase efficiency of transformation of light energy into electrical one etc., and in general – to raise competitive ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products. For example, <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> production of solar element and a unit of solar elements (RU 2532137) comprises following stages: formation of pn-transfer in semiconductor base plate, formation of passivating layer on the light-receptive surface and/or non light-receptive surface of semiconductor base plate and formation of power robbing electrodes on the light-receptive surface and non light-receptive. A film of aluminium oxide is formed as passivating layer, its thickness is up to 40 nm, and lectrode is formed by baking conductive paste under the temperature 500 – 900 ͦͦ°C for 1 second – 30 inutes with formation <b>of</b> sintered product. <b>The</b> sintered product penetrates through passivating layer setting electric contact between electrode and base plate. <b>The</b> formation <b>of</b> aluminium ide with specified thickness on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> base plate {{makes it possible to}} achieve good passivating characteristics and good electric contact between silica and electrode only by eans of baking conductive paste, that is standard technology. Moreover the baking stage which was necessary to get <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> film passivation for aluminium oxide in the past now can be cancelled to decrease costs. The specialists may be also interested in the following nanotechnological inventions: reinforced flaked element made of natural or conglomerate stone and its multilayer protective coating (RU 2520193); fine organic suspension of carbon metal-containing nanostructures and the method to produce it (RU 2515858); <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> production of carbon nanomaterial (RU 2509053); the method to produce nanopowder of zinc oxide with the surface modification for the use in construction sealing materials (RU 2505379); building structures reinforcement composition (RU 2493337); nanostructured thermoelectric material (RU 2528338); conglutination composition for metal articles (RU 2526991); <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> nanosize structures formation структур (RU 2529458) etc. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} {{documents the}} life and various interests of Leon Szalet. A significant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collection is related to his memoirs entitled Experiment 'E', which were published by Didier Publishers in 1945. In his memoirs, Leon Szalet describes his imprisonment in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, which lasted almost 8 months. Included in the collection is the original manuscript (Series I) as well as legal documents (Series IV) and correspondence with his publishers and other persons involved in <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> his book (Series V, Subseries 1). Newspaper and journal reviews of his book as well as clippings and radio interviews {{can also be found}} in the collection (Series III). In addition, there are letters Leon Szalet sent to and received from his daughter in Sachsenhausen (Series V, Subseries 3) and a manuscript written by his daughter Gitla-Matla Szalet, which describes his imprisonment, his liberation and their subsequent emigration in detail (Series I). In the 1920 s Szalet was very much engaged in developing a patent with George Breslauer for prefabricated steel-houses. Series IV holds <b>the</b> copies <b>of</b> these patents in addition to legal and business correspondence concerning the steel-houses. There are also architectural measurements/calculations, architectural plans, concrete <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention,</b> writings on <b>the</b> exploitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel houses, blue print copies and a manuscript on steel-house building. Articles and brochures concerning houses in general and steel-houses in particular can be found as well. Series VII deals with the real estate properties of Marie Faszyniak (later Fried) in Berlin, which Leon Szalet represented. It contains legal and business correspondence as well as rent calculations, architectural plans of some properties and legal documents. The collection also contains a few personal documents and autobiographical notes by Leon Szalet (Series 1) and newspaper clippings he collected on various topics (Series VIII). There are also a few photographs depicting Leon Szalet, models of his steel-houses, and inmates of concentration camps (Series IX). Leon Szalet was born on April 9 th 1892 in Zelechow (Poland). As a boy he moved with his parents to Warsaw where he attended and finished school and later set himself up in business. In 1921 he moved to Berlin and became active in the real estate business. With his friend Georg Breslauer, an architect, he developed a design for prefabricated houses made of steel in 1926. They applied for patents, which were granted in several important industrial countries. Model houses based on this design were shown at the Olympia building exhibition (with <b>the</b> cooperation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Steelwork Association) in London in 1936. <b>The</b> outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war interrupted the work. On September 13, 1939 Leon Szalet was taken prisoner by the Gestapo and sent to the concentration camp Sachsenhausen. On May 7 th 1940 he was released and escaped to the Far East via Italy on the SS Conte Verde (the last ship to leave for Asia before <b>the</b> outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war). He came to Shanghai and remained there until October 1941 when he was granted an immigration visa to the United States. He entered the US on October 23, 1941 in San Francisco. In the US, Leon Szalet tried to renew his contacts in order to reestablish his business. He demanded reparations for <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> properties in Berlin and was able to reclaim a building. In 1957 he travelled through Europe (Austria, France, Britain, Germany). Health problems forced him to stay in sanatoriums in Austria and England. Leon Szalet died in Berlin on March 2, 1958. Leon Szalet had a daugther, Gitla-Matla Szalet (Madeleine Lejwa-Chalette), who was born in Paris in 1914, while here parents were visiting there. In 1947, she married Arthur Lejwa, a Polish biochemist. The couple opened a galery in Manhattan and became successful art dealers in the 1950 s. Following her husband's death in 1972, Gitla-Matla Szalet closed the Galerie Chalette, but contined working as an art consultant to collectors and museums. She died in 1996.

50|$|In {{terms of}} the South African Patent Act 57 of 1978, the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) is the {{custodian}} of all new patent applications that are filed within the Republic of South Africa. An individual can privately file a provisional patent application. However, only a patent attorney can file a non-provisional patent application and assist in drafting the patent specification; see Patent attorney: South Africa. It is essential that {{the content of the}} patent specification - referring to the definition and <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> - is clear, coherent and concise so that the patent is assured the maximum protection.

5000|$|In his patent, Durand clearly {{mentions}} that <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> was communicated to {{him more than}} a year ago by a friend abroad. The patent itself consists of two distinct parts: first, <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original idea, and second, observations by Durand himself. Durand was clearly suspicious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention.</b> However, having a curious mind, he performed a thorough test of it by himself, sealing meat, soups and milk, and boiling them as described. The original inventor had only experimented with small food volumes, whereas Durand envisioned future large scale production and therefore preserved up to 30 pounds (13.6 kg) of meat in one can. For unknown reasons, Durand used only tin cans rather than glass vessels. He arranged for the cans to sail with the Royal Navy for a period of four to six months. Several members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Society and the Royal Institution examined the food upon its arrival, and found that it was perfectly preserved.|$|R
