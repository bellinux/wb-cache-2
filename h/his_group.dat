5|$|Marcinkus and {{the three}} prisoners in <b>his</b> <b>group</b> posing as Lithuanians– Tim Walenn, Henri Picard and Gordon Brettell– managed to reach a train heading towards Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). Most likely, they {{intended}} to travel to East Prussia, cross the Lithuanian border, and somehow cross the Baltic Sea to neutral Sweden. However, officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts. Marcinkus and <b>his</b> <b>group</b> travelled further {{than most of the}} escapees, but were captured by the Gestapo near Schneidemühl on 26 March. Marcinkus and his associates were brought to Stalag XXB and spent the night there. On the following day they were handed over to the Danzig Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|McCartney biographer Ray Coleman {{asserted}} {{that the majority of}} the song's lyrics were written by Jackson, and given to McCartney the next day.

5|$|Riker {{gets up to}} {{date with}} the situation, and decides that while Ramsey and <b>his</b> <b>group</b> are at large and refusing to leave the planet, there is little they can do. Before leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where they arrested the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey and <b>his</b> <b>group</b> to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey and <b>his</b> <b>group</b> without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard for fear of being infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return. Riker orders Data to take command and get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.|$|E

5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, {{the attack on the}} Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading <b>his</b> <b>group,</b> he found that the 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although he would have been justified in turning back, Johnson led <b>his</b> <b>group</b> in through thick smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way home, they had to fight off Me109 fighters.|$|E

5|$|As {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Oppenheimer was no longer answerable to Compton, but reported directly to Groves. He {{was responsible for the}} technical and scientific aspects of Project Y. He assembled the nucleus of his staff from the groups that had been working for him on neutron calculations. These included his secretary, Priscilla Greene, Serber and McMillan from his own group, and Emilio Segrè and Joseph W. Kennedy's groups from the University of California, J. H.

5|$|Corea was {{influenced}} in particular by {{a scene from}} Hubbard's work {{where one of the}} main characters plays the piano, and he created the album as a tone poem piece.

5|$|Despite {{the many}} western {{travelers}} coming into China {{to live and}} trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that <b>his</b> <b>group</b> of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.|$|E
