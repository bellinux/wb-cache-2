By 1943 he {{concluded}} that Germany was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> war and that Finland was in great danger as well. However, his initial opposition to the pro-German politics of 1940–1941 was too well known, and his first initiatives for peace negotiations were met with little support from either Field Marshal Mannerheim or Risto Ryti, who now had become President.|$|E
25|$|According to Mangala Samaraweera and Rajitha Senaratne, senior {{figures in}} the Sirisena campaign, Rajapaksa {{attempted}} to stage a coup {{in order to stay}} in power when it became clear he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> election. They allege that Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Defence Secretary, summoned Commander of the Army Daya Ratnayake, Inspector General of Police N. K. Illangakoon and Attorney General Yuwanjana Wanasundera to Temple Trees at around 1am on 9 January 2015. Rajapaksa allegedly pressured the three officials to deploy troops, annul the election results and declare a state of emergency but they refused. According to the Colombo Telegraph Rajapaksa also wanted to dissolve parliament. It was only then Rajapaksa decided to concede defeat and summoned Wickremesinghe to assure him of a smooth transition of power.|$|E
25|$|On 8 December 1941, {{in concert}} with the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces invaded and {{occupied}} Thailand. Ananda Mahidol was away from the country, as he had returned to Switzerland to complete his studies, and Pridi Phanomyong served as regent in his absence. From 24 January 1942, occupied Thailand became a formal ally of the Empire of Japan {{and a member of the}} Axis. Under Plaek Pibulsonggram, Thailand declared war on the Allied powers. The regent refused to sign the declaration and it was thus legally invalid. Many members of the Thai government, including the Siamese embassy in Japan, acted as de facto spies in the Seri Thai underground on the side of the Allies, funnelling secret information to British intelligence and the US Office of Strategic Services. By 1944, it was apparent that Japan was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> war. Bangkok suffered heavily from the Allied bombing raids. These, plus economic hardships, made the war and the government of Plaek Pibulsonggram very unpopular. In July, Plaek Pibulsonggram was ousted by the Seri Thai-infiltrated government. The National Assembly reconvened and appointed the liberal lawyer Khuang Aphaiwong prime minister. Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945, and Allied military responsibility for Thailand fell to Britain.|$|E

25|$|While {{the town}} {{lost much of}} its populace and leading citizenry during the American Civil War for several reasons (ranging from {{military}} to economic), Golden City became capital of the federally recognized Colorado Territory on 2 August 1862, continuing as such until 1867. It was the time period between 1862 and the early 1870s that a fierce railroad competition developed between Denver, ten miles to the east, and Golden. By the mid-1860s, Golden held only an honorific status as territorial capital rather than serve as the legitimate source of territorial power. Denver, the increasingly larger and more developed city, was the focused core of important territorial occasions, with the Governor residing in Denver, and territorial government meetings occurring there as well. The citizens and supporters of Golden realized that a spur from Golden to the new transcontinental railroad, running through Cheyenne, Wyoming, 100 miles to the north, was the only possibility for Golden to reemerge as the dominant heart of commerce in the territory. W.A.H. Loveland founded the Colorado Central Railroad on 9 February 1865 to do just this. With Golden beginning talk of creating a railroad, prominent Denver residents raced to do the same. In an appeal to the residents of Denver, The Rocky Mountain News, which was based in Denver itself, wrote an article imploring the citizens of Denver to vote to fund a railroad; “If we vote $500,000 in bonds to the Denver Pacific railway all is well. If we defeat those bonds, all hope of a railroad {{for the next two years}} is gone… Gentlemen of Denver, what will you do? The fate of your city is in your own hands.” The residents of Denver voted for the bonds, spurring construction of the Denver Pacific Railway. By 1869, the railroad race to Cheyenne was becoming less and less of a race, as the Denver Pacific Railway pulled ahead of the struggling Colorado Central Railroad. Realizing they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> race to Cheyenne, the Colorado Central began expanding west into mountain communities such as Georgetown, Black Hawk, and Central City, all areas founded on and focused in silver mining. Golden, having then sidetracked into servicing various close-by mountain communities, continued to fall behind the pace set by the Denver railroad, and by 1870, officially lost the race to Cheyenne. However, The Colorado Central Railroad connected directly with Cheyenne seven years later, in 1877, but by that point, the race with Denver had been lost. Although Golden’s Colorado Central Railroad offered a challenge to Denver’s railroad, the better funded Denver Pacific Railway was able to connect to Cheyenne far more quickly than Golden, securing for Denver its long term status as both capital and prominent city.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} more positive and uplifting lyrics {{in comparison with}} Green Day's earlier work. Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got a little {{light at the end}} of the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one reason why I was really taking my time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Impossible {{is used as}} an {{archetype}} or stock character supervillain. He {{is characterized}} as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts {{to take control of}} the world's population. This is seen as a sub-type of the hero's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile, repetitive and self-destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature. The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with [...] "Malign Hypercognition Disorder", a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions. Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible's point of view, he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms: [...] "it's a matter of integrity — he's sticking to his principles, doing science his own way, pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him, even if he looks ridiculous in his costume, even if he knows he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> <b>The</b> superheroes are taking the conformist path, and getting all the applause." [...] From the literary point of view, Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters, [...] "they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative. ... Their plans usually start with a great invention, which gives the story all its color and energy. The hero just has to come in and smash it up." [...] Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student, [...] "On the one hand, you're supposed to be really smart, and on the other hand, it's a humiliating experience. You're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant, but at the same time, you're [...] in the eyes of the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Chrétien's main focuses {{in office}} was {{preventing}} {{the separation of}} the province of Quebec, which was ruled by the sovereigntist Parti Québécois for nearly the Prime Minister's entire term. In September 1995, when the 1995 referendum began, Chrétien was relaxed and assured about victory as the polls showed that the federalist forces were leading by a wide margin. Relations between the federal government and chairman of the no committee, the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Quebec Liberal Daniel Johnson were not very good with non committee co-chairwoman Liza Frulla openly saying that Chrétien was not wanted at non campaign events, but Chrétien argued with Parizeau leading the yes committee that this did not matter. On October 8, 1995, the charismatic Lucien Bouchard replaced Parizeau as the de facto chairman of the oui committee, and at that point, the support for the yes side started to dramatically increase, aided by the complacency of the no committee who had taken victory for granted. Unlike the [...] "hard separatist" [...] Parizeau for whom nothing less than a totally independent Quebec republic would have sufficed, the [...] "soft separatist" [...] Bouchard argued for sovereignty association, {{which turned out to be}} more appealing vision of the future to many Québécois than Parizeau's vision. For Chrétien, the replacement of Parizeau with Bouchard was a sign of weakness, and it was only as October went on did he realized that Bouchard was a much more formidable opponent than was Parizeau. Several of Chrétien's ministers such as David Collenette, Sheila Copps and Brian Tobin accused Chrétien of complacency, telling the Prime Minister at a Cabinet meeting that he [...] "needed to get off his ass or we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> country".|$|E
