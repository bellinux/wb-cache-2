40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{researchers}} {{within the field of}} security studies address the blurring line between <b>internal</b> and external <b>security.</b> Some focus on the national level while others focus on the international level and the European Union (EU). Due to the changing nature of threat perceptions since the Cold War, many scholars hold that the distinction between <b>internal</b> and external <b>security</b> is dissolving. The aim {{of this study is to}} empirically examine how <b>internal</b> and external <b>security</b> discourses are merging within the EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and how this merge is connected to the EU identity construction. This study uses a poststructuralist approach on discourse analysis of EU policies, EU council documents and speeches of the high representatives. Furthermore, an analytical framework for analyzing the merging of <b>internal</b> and external <b>security</b> discourses from an identity perspective is constructed. This study concludes that discursively constructed ”links” between <b>internal</b> and external <b>security</b> is merging the two discourses. Finally, in a co-constitutive relationship, the internal-external security nexus and the EU security identity are (re) constructing each other. ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Internal</b> <b>Security</b> Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties.
