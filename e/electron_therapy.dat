40|$|<b>Electron</b> arc <b>therapy</b> is the {{treatment}} of choice for tumours involving large curved surfaces. At the Montreal General Hospital a unique approach to the <b>electron</b> arc <b>therapy</b> was developed in 1986 and has been used clinically ever since. The approach {{is based on the}} concept of the characteristic angle beta. We measured radial percentage depth doses in a polystyrene cylindrical phantom irradiated with electron arc beams having angles beta in the range from 5 $ sp circ$ to 100 $ sp circ,$ for 9 MeV, 12 MeV, 15 MeV, and 18 MeV electron beam energies. We showed that the characteristic angle-$ beta$ concept can be extended to the beams with nominal energy of 18 MeV. The validity of the empirical relationship, relating the doses in two beams with different energies, was confirmed. A linear relationship between the angle $ beta$ and the depth of dose maximum, the depth of the 85 % depth dose, and the depth of the 50 % depth dose, was established. The surface dose dependence on the angle $ beta$ was also determined and the bremsstrahlung contamination in the <b>electron</b> arc <b>therapy</b> studied...|$|R

50|$|Particle {{therapy is}} a form of {{external}} beam radiotherapy using beams of energetic protons, neutrons, or positive ions for cancer treatment. The most common type of particle therapy as of 2012 is proton therapy. Although a photon, used in x-ray or gamma ray therapy, can also be considered a particle, photon therapy is not considered here. Additionally, <b>electron</b> <b>therapy</b> is generally put into its own category. Because of this, particle therapy is sometimes referred to, more correctly, as hadron therapy (that is, therapy with particles that are made of quarks).|$|E
50|$|Total skin <b>electron</b> <b>therapy</b> (TSET) is {{a common}} {{treatment}} for mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome, the two most common forms of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The treatment involves using very large electron beams to deliver radiation to the entire skin surface. Typically this is done using six dual-beams: First, the upper portion of the patient is irradiated with one beam and then the lower portion is irradiated. Then the patient rotates one-sixth of a turn and is treated with the second dual-beam. This process is repeated until the patient has been irradiated from six directions each with an upper and lower electron beam.|$|E
50|$|The figure {{shows how}} beams of electrons, X-rays or protons of {{different}} energies (expressed in MeV) penetrate human tissue. Electrons {{have a short}} range and are therefore only of interest close to the skin (see <b>electron</b> <b>therapy).</b> Bremsstrahlung X-rays penetrate more deeply, but the dose absorbed by the tissue then shows the typical exponential decay with increasing thickness. For protons and heavier ions, on the other hand, the dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue and loses energy continuously. Hence the dose increases with increasing thickness up to the Bragg peak that occurs {{near the end of}} the particle's range. Beyond the Bragg peak, the dose drops to zero (for protons) or almost zero (for heavier ions).|$|E
40|$|Radiation therapy {{plays an}} {{important}} role in cancer management. Today 45 % of all cancer patients can be cured. About one half of them are cured by radiation therapy applied alone or in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. The clinical experience accumulated in decades shows that, to be efficient, the radiation treatment must be delivered with a high physical selectivity. At present, electron linear accelerators are the primary equipment of a modern radiotherapy department, and are used to irradiate a large proportion of the patients for at least part of the treatment. Photon beams of about 6 - 20 MV have, in general, a sufficient penetration in the tissues to treat most of the tumors with an adequate physical selectivity. A combination of several beams adequately oriented allows the radiation-oncologist to deliver the prescribed dose to the “target volume ” (tumor) without exceeding the tolerance of the surrounding normal tissues. Conformation therapy, which needs well-equipped and well-staffed centers, further improves the physical selectivity of the treatment, and offers definitive advantages at least for some tumor types and/or locations. Finally, modern linear accelerators also allow to apply <b>electron</b> beam <b>therapy.</b> <b>Electron</b> beam <b>therapy</b> is suitable for the treatment of superficial lesions and is also the best available irradiation technique for Intra-Operative-Radiation-Therapy (IORT) ...|$|R

Only the lymphomata which remain confined to the skin throughout the major part of their development are considered. It is emphasized that these are extremely radiosensitive and that there must be some factors as yet unknown which play a part in their unique natural history and response to treatment. The cutaneous lymphomata are considered under three headings: (1) lymphocytoma, (2) lymphosarcoma and reticulum cell sarcoma, (3) mycosis fungoides. The characteristics of the first two are discussed briefly and illustrative examples are given. The relatively benign nature of the lymphocytoma is stressed.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{computer technology}} in radiation oncology and the intimate role {{that it must}} now play in the dosimetry practices of this discipline. Aspects of the dosimetry and implementation of five radiation therapies are examined, namely total-body irradiation (TBI), total-skin <b>electron</b> <b>therapy</b> (TSET), <b>electron</b> <b>therapy,</b> superficial therapy and ophthalmic brachytherapy. Computational techniques, in particular, Monte Carlo and several other numerical methods are used. The Monte Carlo platform, EGS 4, and the treatment planning system, GRATIS, have been implemented on SUN and Silicon Graphics workstations. Monte Carlo methods {{are used in the}} investigation of <b>electron</b> <b>therapy</b> planning and superficial and brachytherapy dosimetry practices. Monte Carlo techniques are used for radiation protection calculations of linear accelerator bunker design and for the optimisation of an in vivoX-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique used to measure platinum uptake associated with cisplatin chemotherapy. Inverse Monte Carlo methods have been examined and implemented. Inverse methods, applied to in-phantom dose measurements, are used to determine phase-space information. such as spectra, for an incident electron beam. Analogous methods are examined for megavoltage and superficial X-rays in particular, source parameterisation with attenuation and photoactivation techniques. Two linear accelerators, a Varian 2100 C and a Varian 600 C, provide Megavoltage X-rays or electrons. The TBI therapy uses a 6 MV X-ray beam. The TSET technique uses 6 MeV electrons which degraded to a lower energy by a screen placed in front of the patient at an extended source distance. The 9 Me V and the 20 Me V electron modalities are also closely examined. Two Philips superficial therapy units, RT 100 and RT 50 provide 10 through 100 kVp X-rays. 1251 seeds are used for the investigation of ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry. Methods of dosimetry incorporated in this work include in-phantom, ionisation chamber and diode measurements. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), Silverhalide and radio chromic films are used. Measurements have been performed in water, solid water. polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA), and polystyrene phantoms. Fricke, ferrous based gels are investigated as a method of dosimetry in a uniform medium. Three-dimensional dose distributions are examined for several radiation modalities.

40|$|Abstract Background Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) {{is one of}} the methods used to deliver a large single dose to the tumor tissue while reducing the exposure of normal surrounding tissue. However, the usefulness of intraoperative <b>electron</b> <b>therapy</b> for malignant gliomas has not been established. Methods During the period from 1987 to 1997, 32 patients with malignant gliomas were treated with IORT. The histological diagnoses were anaplastic astrocytoma in 11 patients and glioblastoma in 21 patients. Therapy consisted of surgical resection and intraoperative <b>electron</b> <b>therapy</b> using a dose of 12 – 15 Gy (median, 15 Gy). The patients later underwent postoperative external {{radiation therapy}} (EXRT) with a median total dose of 60 Gy. Each of the 32 patients treated with IORT was randomly matched with patients who had been treated with postoperative EXRT alone (control). Patients were matched according to histological grade, age, extent of tumor removal, and tumor location. Results In the anaplastic astrocytoma group, the one-, two- and five-year survival rates were 81 %, 51 % and 15 %, respectively in the IORT patients and 54 %, 43 % and 21 %, respectively in the control patients. In the glioblastoma group, one-, two- and five-year survival rates were 63 %, 26 % and 0 %, respectively in the IORT patients and 70 %, 18 % and 6 %, respectively in the control patients. There {{was no significant difference between}} survival rates in the IORT patients and control patients in either the anaplastic astrocytoma group or glioblastoma group.

40|$|Iodinated {{contrast}} agents, {{which are}} routinely {{used to improve}} contrast in x-ray diagnostic radiography, have been successfully proven to enhance radiation effects in kilovoltage x-ray radiation therapy beams. The studies determined the influence of iodine {{on the level of}} radiation biotoxicity to cells as an indicator of the radiation dose enhancement. The use of other high-atomic-number materials such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) may also provide advantages in terms of radiation dose enhancement. In this work AuNPs have been used for the enhancement of radiation effects on bovine aortic endothelial cells of superficial x-ray radiation <b>therapy</b> and megavoltage <b>electron</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> beams. Results reveal an increase of cell damage with increasing concentration of AuNPs. At 1 mM concentration of AuNPs, enhancement of radiation peaked at 25 times for a kilovoltage x-ray beam. AuNPs showed similar effects on electron beams but to a lesser extent. This study showed that AuNPs can be used to enhance the effect of radiation doses from kilovoltage x-ray radiation <b>therapy</b> and megavoltage <b>electron</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> beams. In the prevailing clinical circumstances, wherein radiation therapy dose is constrained by normal tissue tolerance, this enhancement could in the future be used to improve local control in superficial x-ray treatments, megavoltage <b>electron</b> beam radiation <b>therapy,</b> microbeam radiation therapy, and intraoperative irradiation using kilovoltage x-rays or megavoltage electron beams. Moreover, the value of this work also {{stems from the fact that}} the damage to the endothelial cells lining the highly vasculature structure of tumors deprives tumors of their oxygen and nutrients supply and enhances the efficiency of radiation therapy treatment, where it has been proven that more of the AuNPs injected into animals ends up into the blood than in the tumor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Electron</b> arc <b>therapy</b> is {{a special}} {{radiotherapeutic}} technique using a rotational electron beam {{in the treatment of}} large superficial tumours following curved surfaces. In those cases, arc therapy offers the best way to optimize dose uniformity while sparing healthy tissues and critical organs. The use of this technique overcomes under or over dosage problems caused by field junctions. However, <b>electron</b> arc <b>therapy</b> presents important challenges in terms of dosimetry and treatment planning. Clinical implementation of <b>electron</b> arc <b>therapy</b> requires the study of many parameters of influence such as the radius of curvature of the treated surface, the width of the treatment field, the total angle of irradiation and the beam energy. Monitor unit calculation to deliver prescribed dose is a very critical topic and, in general, requires acquisition of a large amount of measured dosimetric data. This project concerns the clinical implementation of <b>electron</b> arc <b>therapy</b> using an Elekta SL- 25 linear accelerator in the radiation oncology department of the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital (Montreal, Canada). Firstly, the objective of the study is to observe the influence of the radius of curvature, the total arc angle and the field width on the following dosimetric parameters: depth of maximum dose, isodose distributions and electron arc beam output at the depth of maximum dose. Secondly, for our particular setup, the goal is to develop a simple monitor unit calculation method, based on an analytical model fitted through measured dosimetric data covering a large range of possible clinical situations. In order to achieve these goals, electron arc irradiations were performed on cylindrical acrylic phantoms of different radii, successively varying the total arc angle and the field width at isocentre. Results obtained with thermoluminescent dosimeters show a minor impact of the radius of curvature variation on the percent depth dose curves. However, they show {{a significant impact on the}} beam output. It was also observed that the total arc angle influences the dose at the depth of maximum dose only up to a limit angle value, different for each radius of curvature. Finally, the field width at isocentre has an impact on the beam output as well as on the bremsstrahlung contribution at the isocentre. Concerning the monitor unit calculation, a seven parameter analytical model fitted through measured data was obtained using Origin 7 software. A relationship giving the beam output as a function of the radius of curvature and the total arc angle was found. The field width was not included in the model, but will be part of further investigation before clinical implementation. As future work, dosimetric measurements with other energies should be carried on, mainly to be able to cover a wider range of clinical cases...|$|R
