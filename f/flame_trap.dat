50|$|In July 1940 {{the village}} {{was turned into a}} model strong point by the 1st Canadian Pioneer Battalion. Within three weeks the village {{bristled}} with defences including fifteen casemates and a variety of <b>flame</b> <b>traps,</b> <b>flame</b> fougasses and other anti-tank devices.|$|R
50|$|Magical lamps {{that gave}} blue {{radiance}} from a <b>flame</b> <b>trapped</b> within a white crystal. Their light {{could not be}} quenched by wind or water.|$|R
50|$|Some 200 static <b>flame</b> <b>traps</b> were installed, {{mainly by}} the {{employees}} of oil companies whose services were placed {{at the disposal of}} the government.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} Home Guard Flamethrower {{was not a}} flamethrower in {{the conventional}} sense, but a small, semi-mobile <b>flame</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
50|$|Incomplete {{combustion}} {{will occur}} {{when there is}} not enough oxygen to allow the fuel to react completely to produce carbon dioxide and water. It also happens when the combustion is quenched by a heat sink, such as a solid surface or <b>flame</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{newly formed}} {{department}} quickly made arrangements for some practical experiments at Dumpton Gap in Kent. These were {{the source of}} some excitement for witnesses, who included the pilots of enemy planes. Many of the first ideas to be tried proved fruitless, but experience quickly {{led to the development}} of the first practical weapon: the static <b>flame</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
50|$|In high-powered {{supercharged}} aircraft {{piston engines}} {{such as the}} Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon, backfiring into the inlet manifold is prevented with <b>flame</b> <b>traps</b> inside the manifold, the <b>traps</b> preventing the <b>flame</b> propagating into the compressed air/fuel mixture within the manifold.|$|R
50|$|Episode 2: Enemies in {{this episode}} cannot be killed {{and must be}} avoided at all costs. Levers {{in many of the}} levels can be pulled to switch <b>flame</b> <b>traps</b> on and off. One unique puzzle {{requires}} Alabama to pull a set of levers in the correct sequence.|$|R
50|$|Buildings {{have many}} uses such as storing a player's gold and grog. Buildings can be defensive, {{which can be}} cannons, mystic mortars, ground pounders, gun towers, mines, mystic mines, legendary mines, <b>flame</b> <b>traps,</b> shark traps, bunkers, pirate ship, and the pirate hall at upgrade level 9 or higher. Players {{automatically}} collect resources with gold mines and grog collectors. All buildings get stronger when upgraded with resources.|$|R
50|$|Because {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of pumps - they were badly needed for fighting fires started by bombing - a simpler type of mobile <b>flame</b> <b>trap</b> was also designed. This consisted {{of a number of}} 12 in diameter pipes welded shut to make a 12 ft long cylindrical drum which was filled with 43 imp gal of gasoline-oil mixture and pressurised with an inert gas. A number of these cylinders could be transported {{on the back of a}} vehicle and, at a weight of just under 1000 lb, could be deployed reasonably quickly wherever an ambush was required. The cylinders would be placed at intervals along a road each with a short length of hose leading to a nozzle secured by ground spikes. Flow was initiated by a pull-string that opened a valve and ignition was provided by Molotov cocktails.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of a two-stage supercharger eventually became so clear that Allison did make some efforts in this direction. Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger in various configurations to the existing engine-mounted supercharger and carburetor. Early versions of these two-stage supercharger engines were used on the P-63. No intercooler, aftercooler, or backfire screen (<b>flame</b> <b>trap)</b> were incorporated into these two-stage V-1710 engines (except for the V-1710-119 used on the experimental P-51J, which had an aftercooler). The two-stage Merlin engines had all of these features, which were designed to prevent detonation from charge heating and backfire into the supercharger. The G-series V-1710s installed on the F-82 E/F/G models had only anti-detonation injection (ADI) {{to deal with these}} problems, and not surprisingly had severe reliability and maintenance problems. In one record, it was stated that the F-82 required 33 hours of maintenance for each hour of flight.|$|E
50|$|A static <b>flame</b> <b>trap</b> {{allowed a}} length of road, {{typically}} 60 to 150 ft, to be covered in flame and smoke at a moment's notice. The weapon was a simple arrangement of perforated pipes placed alongside a road. The pipes were steel, one to two inches in diameter and drilled with 1/8th inch holes at angles carefully calculated to cover the road evenly. The perforated pipes were connected to larger pipes {{that led to a}} tank of fuel in a raised position. The fuel mixture was 25% petrol and 75% gas-oil that was contrived to be of no use as motor vehicle fuel should it be captured. All that was required to trigger the weapon was to open a valve and for a Home Guardsman to throw in a Molotov cocktail creating an inferno. The ideal location for the trap was a place where vehicles could not easily escape, such as a steep-sided sunken road. Some trouble was taken with camouflage: pipes could be hidden in gutters or disguised as handrails; others were simply left as innocent looking plumbing.|$|E
40|$|Experiments of vented gas explosions {{involving}} {{two different}} cylinder vessel volumes (0. 2 and 0. 0065 m 3) were reported. It {{was found that}} self-acceleration and larger bulk <b>flame</b> <b>trapped</b> inside the vessel are the main factor enhancing the overpressure attained in 0. 2 m 3 vessel. There was about 2 to 7 times increase in ratio of pressure and flame speeds on both vessels at the same equivalence ratio and K which {{can be considered as}} turbulent enhancement factor, ß. Hot spot or auto ignition is responsible to the deflagration to detonation...|$|R
50|$|Then on August 15, 2009 a fire {{broke out}} at a wedding in Al Jahra. At least 49 {{people were killed and}} about 80 others wounded when the grooms' 23-year-old first wife, sought revenge for her husband's second marriage, poured petrol on a tent where women and {{children}} were celebrating and set it on fire. Within three minutes the whole tent, which had only one exit and did not meet fire safety regulations, was engulfed in <b>flames,</b> <b>trapping</b> many inside. It was the deadliest civilian disaster in Kuwait in the last 40 years.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the static <b>flame</b> <b>traps,</b> mobile units were created. The main design used an otherwise redundant 200 - 300 imp gal tank mounted {{on the back of}} a 30 cwt lorry, just behind the cabin. In the middle of the remaining space was a petrol-driven pump and either side of this was stored 75 ft of armoured rubber hose. Two nozzles were provided with a primitive sight and with spikes for pushing into the ground. Gas tubes for chlorine and acetylene gas were provided for ignition. The resulting jets of flame had a range of 60 - 70 ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} by a team consisting of Peter Berthon, Harry Mundy (who had designed engines for Jaguar), Eric Richter, and Frank May. It was conceived as basically two 750cc V8 engines back-to-back with cam drives and gears in {{the centre of the}} engine. Components were manufactured by various British companies, including English Steel - the crankshaft, Standard Motors - machining of the main engine components, sump, etc., and David Brown - the gears. Eventually there were around 350 companies that provided support to the project, including Rolls-Royce (RR) who designed and manufactured the two-stage centrifugal supercharger. Testing of the supercharger by Rolls-Royce involved the test specimen being mounted on the front of a Merlin supercharger. (RR personnel stated that that was just the kind of after-hours activity they enjoyed). Rolls-Royce also developed the flame traps for the inlet manifold, used to prevent a backfire causing an explosion in the highly compressed fuel/air mixture in the manifold. The <b>flame</b> <b>trap</b> was a feature not previously used on car engines, due to the relatively low amounts of supercharging then in use, but it was by then a necessity on high-powered piston aero engines such as the Merlin and Griffon. Twin-pot carburettors were designed for the engine by SU.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Kuwait wedding {{fire was}} an arson attack that {{occurred}} during a wedding ceremony in Jahra, Kuwait on August 15, 2009. At least 57 {{people were killed and}} about 90 others wounded when the groom's 23-year-old ex-wife, Nasra Yussef Mohammad al-Enezi, to take revenge for her husband's second marriage, poured petrol on a tent where women and children were celebrating and set it on fire. Within three minutes the whole tent, which had only one exit and did not meet fire safety regulations, was engulfed in <b>flames,</b> <b>trapping</b> many inside. It was the deadliest civilian disaster in Kuwait in the last 40 years.|$|R
5000|$|Hankey and Lloyd {{were not}} alone in their {{interest}} {{in the development of}} petroleum warfare weapons; encouragement came from the highest quarters. In August a note from the Chief Engineer's office at GHQ Home Forces read: [...] "The PM is personally interested in it. It is something which can be provided without any adverse effect on the production of other equipment or on our War effort generally. It is unlikely that we shall have enough A/T weapons to cover all our road blocks for many months, if ever. These <b>flame</b> <b>traps</b> do at least give the Home Guard a sporting chance of frying a few Germans." ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 24, 1937, 21 {{members of}} a touring group of Roller Derby skaters and support {{personnel}} were killed when their chartered bus blew a tire while going 40 mph down a hill on U.S. Route 50, collided with a bridge abutment, rolled onto its side and burst into <b>flames,</b> <b>trapping</b> passengers inside. The accident occurred near Salem, Illinois, as the bus was en route from St. Louis to Cincinnati for another performance. Only {{a few of the}} 23 passengers escaped the burning wreckage, and two of them died later from their injuries, bringing the total fatalities to 19 or 20 (sources vary). The ghastly tragedy nearly put Seltzer out of business, but replacement skaters were signed and Roller Derby survived. As a tribute to those killed in the tragedy, the number [...] "1" [...] was permanently retired for all Roller Derby teams.|$|R
50|$|Still {{attempting}} to understand Gabriel's plans, Harry determines {{that in order}} for Gabriel to truly hurt him he will attempt to abduct an innocent person and lay a trap. Harry then rushes to find Norah. Meanwhile, the police arrive at Gabriel's hideout but are unable to rescue Norah because of the American Son's interference. Harry manages to sneak in through one of his father's secret tunnels and confronts his half-brother. As the police prepare to make another attempt to save Norah, Harry frees her and gets the young reporter to safety. With Norah out of harms way Gabriel and Harry engage in an epic battle. During the fight, Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is evil and that {{attempting to}} follow in his footsteps is madness. Gabriel refuses to listen and continues his attempts to kill Harry. Saddened by his brother's choice, Harry hacks the American Son armor and knocks Gabriel unconscious. The battle causes the warehouse to go up in <b>flames,</b> <b>trapping</b> Gabriel and Harry inside, but Spider-Man arrives and saves them. Afterward, Norah visits Harry in his coffee shop, and notices a bottle of oxycodone in Harry's things. Troubled by what she finds, Norah concludes that Harry has a drug problem and resolves to help him through it.|$|R
50|$|Georgia Fair is an Australian music duo {{comprising}} Jordan Wilson and Benjamin Riley. Their debut album, All Through Winter, {{was released}} in October 2011, which peaked in the top 100 of the ARIA Albums Chart and reached No. 1 on the related ARIA Hitseekers Albums Chart.

50|$|The Grover Shoe Factory {{disaster}} was {{an industrial}} explosion, building collapse and fire that killed 58 people and injured 150 when it leveled the R. B. Grover shoe factory in Brockton, Massachusetts on March 20, 1905. Following a boiler explosion, the four-story wooden building collapsed and the ruins burst into <b>flames,</b> incinerating workers <b>trapped</b> in the wreckage.|$|R
50|$|He {{died during}} the Macau Grand Prix on November 19, 1967, {{at the age of}} 35. Eyewitness {{accounts}} revealed that Laurel, after his Lotus 41 skidded out of control, tried to avoid hitting some spectators by driving the car into the sea wall. The crash caused his car to burst into <b>flames,</b> leaving him <b>trapped</b> inside. He was the first fatality of the Macau Grand Prix.|$|R
50|$|The Able Seaman Oscar Chappell Award {{is awarded}} to a Military Sealift Command civil service unlicensedcrew member who {{displays}} selfless dedication to shipmates. Presented since 2000, this award {{is named after}} Oscar Chappell, who in 1942 saved seven of his shipmates from burning to death after a torpedo attack, by turning the ship into the windand redirecting the <b>flames</b> from his <b>trapped</b> shipmates onto himself and the wheelhouse.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{experimental}} realization of continuous carbon aerogel production using a flame aerosol reactor by operating it in negative gravity (−g; up-side-down configuration). Buoyancy opposes the fuel and air flow forces in −g, which eliminates convectional outflow of nanoparticles from the <b>flame</b> and <b>traps</b> {{them in a}} distinctive non-tipping, flicker-free, cylindrical flame body, where they grow to millimeter-size aerogel particles and gravitationally fall out. Computational fluid dynamics simulations show that a closed-loop recirculation zone is set up in −g flames, which reduces the time to gel for nanoparticles by ≈ 10 [superscript 6][*]s, compared to positive gravity (upward rising) flames. Our results open up new possibilities of one-step gas-phase synthesis {{of a wide variety}} of aerogels on an industrial scale...|$|R
50|$|In 1922 Helmore {{was granted}} a {{permanent}} commission in the RAF and developed his interest in scientific research in aviation. He was also involved {{in the development of}} aerial refuelling, serving as copilot and hose handler on Sir Alan Cobham's pioneering flight from Portsmouth, England to India on 22 September 1934, also inventing the electrolytic process of forming <b>flame</b> or explosion <b>traps.</b> In 1931 Helmore was awarded the Groves Prize for Aeronautical Research.|$|R
40|$|The {{aims of the}} {{research}} for this thesis were fourfold, all of which focused at reducing employee exposure to diesel particulate in underground coal mines. The four aims were to: a) Develop a method to test disposable diesel exhaust filters and if possible improve their performance b) Investigate the relationship between maintenance and diesel particulate generation c) Highlight the benefits of newer design engines in emission reduction d) Review {{the research}} of the Tower Colliery Research group as their findings have been {{the basis for the}} development of control technologies for diesel particulate in NSW underground coal mines. Methods used to achieve these aims involved: a) The construction of a test rig to measure the efficiency and backpressure of new and used disposable filters b) The testing of the in service fleet at four of BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal mines using an R&P Series 5100 diesel analysis system mounted in a trailer c) Comparison of a newer design engine with three current vehicles under mining conditions d) A detailed statistical review of all available data from the Tower Colliery Research group. Key outcomes from research conducted for this thesis are: a) The filtration efficiency and backpressure of disposable diesel exhaust filters used by BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal have been improved. These improvements, together with changes to work practices, generate potential cost savings of $ 395, 000 per annum while affording increased protection to equipment operators. b) Seven engines with unacceptable raw exhaust elemental carbon emissions were identified in a fleet of 66 tested. Some faults identified as causing these elevated emission levels were- blocked exhaust <b>flame</b> <b>traps</b> (scrubber tanks), incorrectly set tappets and worn injectors. c) Testing of a prototype 4 WD fire protected vehicle powered by an "over the road" engine as against three current vehicles, highlighted reductions in atmospheric elemental carbon concentrations of 67 90 %. Significant reductions in raw exhaust elemental carbon levels were also observed. d) A statistical review of data produced by the Tower Colliery Diesel Research group identified elevated exposures within mine transportation roadways. This outcome is significant as much research within the mining industry has focused on other areas in the belief that high air quantities in transportation roadways would limit exposures. This {{does not appear to be}} the case. The project has had a number of positive outcomes, all of which have assisted in the reduction of equipment operators to excessive levels of diesel particulate...|$|R
50|$|But at 2:40 p.m., tragedy struck. A Comstock Racing entered GT40 Mk.I {{driven by}} Canadian Bob McLean {{was coming out}} of Big Bend, and while {{approaching}} the famous hairpin, the car's gearbox seized, the rear brakes locked up, and the car slid off the narrow service road used for the race. It then crashed into a ditch and started to barrel roll, and it then made very hard contact with a telephone pole. The point of contact was where one of the fuel tanks were, and the car burst into <b>flames.</b> McLean was <b>trapped</b> inside, and the few marshals at Sebring were inadequately equipped to put out the inferno, and McLean perished in the fire. He was 32 years old. When word of McLean's death reached the Comstock Racing camp, they withdrew their other GT40 Mk.I from the race.|$|R
50|$|Two drivers died in Formula One related {{events in}} 1967. Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini {{died in a}} fiery {{accident}} during the Monaco Grand Prix on 10 May. While running second behind Hulme's Brabham BT20 on lap 82 (of 100), Bandini lost control of his Ferrari 312 when he clipped a guardrail going into the Harbor Chicane. He went into an erratic skid before hitting a light pole and overturning. When the Ferrari then hit the trackside straw bales its fuel tank exploded into <b>flames</b> with Bandini <b>trapped</b> underneath. Suffering burns to more than 70% of his body, Bandini died in hospital three days later. British driver Bob Anderson died on 27 August during a test at Silverstone driving a Brabham. Anderson slid off the track in wet conditions and hit a marshals post, suffering serious chest and neck injuries. He later died in the nearby Northampton General Hospital.|$|R
50|$|After a brief hiatus in 2007, when he {{returned}} to Oval racing, he once again joined the British GT grid, beginning a long racing partnership with Rob Austin Racing. Partnering Rob Austin in the teams Ginetta G50, the pair managed to finish second in the GT4 class of the 2008 season, taking three class wins. At the Oulton Park round of the championship, Abbott had a spectacular 100mph crash in his Ginetta, flipping several time before coming to rest on its roof where it burst into <b>flames.</b> Abbott was <b>trapped</b> in the car for 18 seconds while on fire. The driver's door was jammed shut and he escaped from the car by crawling through the roll cage and out of the passenger side of the car. Quick thinking by Abbott and efficient work by the race marshals meant that he escaped with only minor burns and injuries. After 2 weeks Abbott returned to the series and took a double victory at Knockhill.|$|R
50|$|Some {{believe the}} {{building}} is haunted, and ghost hunters visited the building in 2006.According to legend, Nurse Betsy cared for the patients in the psychiatric ward of the old Troy Hospital. She was musically talented and often played the piano to calm the screams and whining of her patients. She was {{well known in the}} hospital, serving as a nurse until her tragic and unfortunate death. As legend goes, there was a fire in the psychiatric ward when Betsy was working. Heroically, she attempted to save the lives of her patients. Unfortunately, she and many of her patients were not able to escape the <b>flames</b> and died <b>trapped</b> in the psychiatric ward where legend has it they remain to this day. Many times late at night you can hear the sounds of Nurse Betsy's footsteps as she walks from room to room checking in on her patients. Some have even heard her patients screaming or whining, doors flying shut, loud thumping noises and if you listen closely... the faint sound of piano coming from the psychiatric ward {{in the basement of the}} old Troy Hospital.|$|R
40|$|The {{trapped vortex}} {{combustor}} concept provides a simple design for <b>flame</b> stabilization by <b>trapping</b> a pilot <b>flame</b> inside a cavity instead of exposing {{it to the}} mainstream. Under some circumstances, the combustor may operate in a high-spinning motion (for example, when it is installed in a spin-stabilized ramjet projectile), in which the spinning rate can {{be as high as}} 30, 000 rpm. The objective {{of this study is to}} numerically investigate the effects of high-spinning motion on the trapped vortex combustor, including the cavity vortex dynamics, fuel-air mixing, and combustion performance. Numerical computations have been performed with the Reynolds stress model for turbulence and the eddy dissipation model for combustion in a rotating reference frame. The results of the spinning trapped vortex combustor show that the Coriolis effects dominate the flow in the cavity whenit is subjectedto ahigh-spinning motion (30, 000 rpm). The vortex breakdowninthe cavity brings strong three-dimensional flow and promotes fuel-air mixing so that a stronger cavity pilot flame is generated. But, the effect of the centrifugal force also generates a short recirculation zone in the main combustor and concentrates the fuel stream on the combustor axis, which in turn impairs fuel-air mixing and leads to a longer main combustor flame...|$|R
2500|$|Although Abi {{discovers the}} truth, she {{decides not to}} tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is {{planning}} to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to {{set fire to the}} flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is {{trying to get rid of}} him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after taunting her about Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the <b>flames.</b> Believing Lauren <b>trapped</b> inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently pushes him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [...] cardiac arrest and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him.|$|R
