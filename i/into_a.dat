5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on June 6 and developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> depression the next day as it drifted to the north, moving over south of the Ganges Delta. The depression reversed its course overland, reemerging into the Bay of Bengal on June 8. Once over water, the depression intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cyclonic storm {{on the morning of}} June 9. The cyclone's motion shifted to the northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened to a deep depression overland and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> broad area of {{low pressure}} on June 11.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia on April3 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying <b>into</b> <b>a</b> moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by April9. Kamisy reached winds of 170km/h (105mph) before making landfall in extreme northern Madagascar near Diego Suarez. It weakened {{upon entering the}} Mozambique channel, but briefly re-intensified on April10. That day while passing near Mayotte, the cyclone turned to the southeast, striking Madagascar again near Majunga. Kamisy quickly crossed the country and quickly weakened <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical disturbance}}. After emerging into the Indian Ocean off {{the east coast of}} Madagascar, the system re-intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> moderate tropical storm before dissipating on April16.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3, 115mi (185km/h) east of Dominica. The depression rapidly intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm, and {{was classified as}} Tropical Storm Klaus only six hours later. Because Klaus was {{in an area of}} weak steering current, it was drifting west-northwestward. On October 5, Klaus briefly intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hurricane, and passed only 12mi (19km) east of Barbuda later that day. By the following day, Klaus had weakened back <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. After weakening to a tropical storm, Klaus began to accelerate, while turning westward. Klaus became significantly affected by wind shear, as it weakened to a tropical depression to the north of Puerto Rico on October 8. Later that day, deep convection began to re-developed near the low-level circulation of Klaus, and it had re-intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. As Klaus tracked northwestward near the Bahamas on October 9, it was absorbed by an area of low pressure, which would eventually develop into Tropical Storm Marco.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical depression}} over the central Caribbean Sea around 12:00 UTC on August 23.

The hurricane then curved northwest and intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Category 2 hurricane on August 27. Early the following day, the cyclone made landfall near Cancún, Quintana Roo, with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The storm weakened to a Category 1 during its brief transit across the Yucatán Peninsula, before re-intensifying <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Category 2 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico late on August 28. The hurricane quickly strengthened, and attained its peak intensity on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, nearing the Texas Gulf Coast, the storm waned in intensity, {{and was only}} a Category 1 hurricane {{by the time it}} made a final landfall near Matagorda, Texas, on August 30. Continuing inland, the hurricane weakened, and degenerated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> remnant low over New Mexico on August 31.|$|E

After Batista retained his World Heavyweight Championship, Edge was scripted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rivalry with him over his title. Eventually, The Undertaker was also placed in feud, {{which led to the}} advertising of a Triple Threat match at Armageddon for the title. At Armageddon, Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship. Due to the events that occurred at Survivor Series, a match was announced between Finlay and The Great Khali for Armageddon. Finlay prevailed at Armageddon via pinning The Great Khali. After surviving their Elimination tag team match, Triple H and Jeff Hardy were promoted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> match for Armageddon, in which the winner would win the opportunity to challenge for the WWE Championship. At Armageddon, Hardy defeated Triple H.

Phoenix retained her title at Armageddon.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened rapidly {{as it began}} to move west-northwest.
