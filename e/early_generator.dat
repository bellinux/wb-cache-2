5000|$|The mine {{power station}} {{is located at}} the eastern base of the Urquhart Shaft hill (...) [...] The power station forms a {{two-level}} complex comprising two sections, a boiler and furnace house on the eastern side and a turbine-generator powerhouse on the western side. The external appearance of both sections has remained comparatively unchanged since construction although substantial extension and adaptation of internal structure and plant have taken place with the development of the mine. The power station was initially coal-fired. The boiler house now contains oil-fired furnaces and waste-heat boilers which powered compressors to produce compressed air for the entire mine operation The power house which is a long steel framed corrugated iron clad building aligned north south has been substantially renewed and re- equipped since the 1950s. The original central third of the powerhouse remains structurally intact. This section originally housed Nos.1 and 2 turbo-generators. No.3 turbo generator (made in England by The General Electric Co Ltd., Witton, Birmingham) was installed in line north of No.2 in 1936 to replace No.1 generator after it blew up. No.2 generator has since been removed leaving No.3 as the only surviving <b>early</b> <b>generator</b> plant. No.3 plant comprising a General Electric alternator and turbine generator is coupled to a water-tube condenser unit (manufactured by Hick Hargreaves & Co Ltd., Bolton, England) situated beneath. The northern and southern sections of the powerhouse contain compressors installed in the 1950s. Mine power is now drawn from Mica Creek power station.|$|E

40|$|Ultra-short-lived radionuclidesâ€”those having phys ical half-lives {{ranging from}} seconds to several mm utesâ€”can be {{injected}} intravenously either {{by a small}} rapid injection or by continuous infusion. They have advantages in that dynamic studies can be performed repeatedly in patients within a very short time. They provide high photon flux for imaging while delivering low radiation dose to the patient. Various workers (1 â€” 5) have demonstrated the feasi bility of generator systems designed to produce ultra short-lived radionuclides for angiography. The cad mium- 109 (T 112 = 1. 26 yr) â€”ksilver- 109 m (11 / 2 = 39. 6 sec) generator has two disadvantages: the long half-life of Cd- 109 in case of breakthrough, and the low abun dance of detectable 88 -keV photons (5 %) from Ag lO 9 m.

40|$|The {{results of}} 64 {{patients}} pacemade by the Birmingham (Lucas) inductive system are described. As in other series, thoracotomy and epicardial wires carried a higher postoperative mortality but a lower incidence of reoperation {{than did the}} lesser operation of catheter-coil insertion. Muscle twitch was a minor but annoying complication of the latter operation. The advantages and dis-advantages of this system as compared with totally implanted units are discussed. It is considered b to be more reliable (fewer reoperations) and to have other advantages including the facility to use high voltage stimulation in emergency. An elaborate follow-up system to detect <b>early</b> <b>generator</b> failure is unnecessary.

40|$|The <b>early</b> <b>generator</b> tool {{designs of}} architects {{in the design}} process are {{architectural}} context and design data, and they define the main approach of the design; this approach has led to extensive expressions of design options and ultimately they are followed by more successful assessment of solutions and more complete design. The study implements descriptive and historical analysis (using the data of ancient city and define a new set for reviving the identity and analyzing the new process). There {{is no doubt that}} the museum as a cultural institution in community is vital because the culture of a society is a general concept and it includes all the spiritual values of that community. Thus, culture is the heritage of every people, which is taken from his or her predecessors, and it has been changed and shifted to the next generation. Whenever a decision is taken to build a museum the preliminary basic problem that must be dealt with is choosing the location, a place with various facilities and each one of them need to be examined carefully. Now we should decide whether it should be in the downtown or in the suburb. But with the gradual speed increase and ease of use of public and private vehicles to get from one place to another, it was realized that a location of a museum in a downtown is not a priority anymore. A museum should be accessible from all parts of the city by public transport, and possibly by walking, and as much as possible they should be in the vicinity of schools, colleges, universities and libraries. Today, museums are seen as cultural centers more than past. But it should be noted that not only students visit them, but people who have different socio-economic background visit them. Visiting of museums are more likely if the museum is close and accessible, and coming these kinds of people even for spending their free time is an education hobby...|$|E

50|$|Hausen also {{researched}} electrical phenomena, using a triboelectric generator.

Hausen's generator was similar to <b>earlier</b> <b>generators,</b> {{such as that of}} Francis Hauksbee. It consisted of a glass globe rotated by a cord and a large wheel. An assistant rubbed the globe with his hand to produce static electricity. Hausen's book describes his generator and sets forth a theory of electricity in which electrification is a consequence of the production of vortices in a universal electrical fluid.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of SECV, electricity was generated and distributed by a number of private and municipal generator and distribution companies. The main municipal-owned power station in Victoria was operated by the Melbourne City Council, which generated electricity from its Spencer Street Power Station for the city’s residents, as well as being a wholesale supplier to other municipal distributors. The main privately owned company was the Melbourne Electric Supply Company which was established in the 1880s and operated under franchise arrangements with a number of other municipal distributors.

5000|$|Salter's duck, {{also known}} as the nodding duck or by its {{official}} name the Edinburgh duck, is a device that converts wave power into electricity. The wave impact induces rotation of gyroscopes located inside a pear-shaped [...] "duck", and an electrical generator converts this rotation into electricity with an overall efficiency of up to 90%. The Salter's duck was invented by Stephen Salter in response to the oil shortage in the 1970s {{and was one of the}} <b>earliest</b> <b>generator</b> designs proposed to the Wave Energy program in the United Kingdom. The funding for the project was cut off in the early 1980s after oil prices rebounded and the UK government moved away from alternative energy sources.

50|$|In {{the very}} early days of {{electricity}} generation, the generators at power stations had been single-phase AC or direct current. The direction of the power industry were changing in 1895 when more efficient polyphase generators were successfully implemented at Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant {{which was the first}} large-scale polyphase power station. Newer power stations started to adopt the polyphase system. In the 1900s, many railways started the electrification of their lines. During that time, the single-phase AC system had been widely used for their traction power networks beside the direct current system. The <b>early</b> <b>generators</b> for those single-phase traction networks are single-phase generators. Even with newer three-phase motors which were introduced to some modern trains, the single-phases transmission for traction networks survive their time and are still in use in many railways today. However, many traction power stations have replaced their generators over time to use three-phase generators and convert into single-phase for transmission.|$|R

50|$|The first {{electricity}} supplies to Melbourne were generated and distributed {{by a number}} of private companies and municipal generator and distribution companies.

The main privately owned company was the Melbourne Electric Supply Company which was established in 1899. The company operated the Richmond power station, which had been opened in 1891, and the Geelong power station. It operated under franchise arrangements with a number of municipal distributors. The final major generator of electricity was the Victorian Railways which operated the Newport power station, for the supply of electricity to Melbourne's suburban trains. Newport power station was the largest power station in the urban area which opened in 1919 close to the mouth of the Yarra River in the inner western suburbs.
