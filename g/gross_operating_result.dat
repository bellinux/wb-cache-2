40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we chose to}} present two {{components}} of the financial statements: the {{profit and loss account}} and the cash flow statement. These summary documents and different indicators calculated based on them allow us to formulate assessments on the performance and profitability on various functions and levels of the companyâ€™s activity. This paper aims to support the hypothesis that the accounting information presented in the profit and loss account and in the cash flow statement is an appropriate source for assessing company performance. The purpose of this research is to answer the question linked to the main hypothesis: Is it the profit and loss statement or the cash flow account that reflects better the performance of a business? Based on the literature of specialty studied we tried a conceptual, analytical and practical approach of the term performance, overviewing some terminological acceptations of the term performance as well as the main indicators of performance analysis {{on the basis of the}} profit and loss account and of the cash flow statement: aggregated indicators, also known as intermediary balances of administration, economic rate of return, rate of financial profitability, rate of return through cash flows, operating cash flow rate, rate of generating operating cash out of <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>result.</b> At the same time we had a comparative approach of the profit and loss account and cash flow statement, outlining the main advantages and disadvantages of these documents. In order to demonstrate the above theoretical assessments, we chose to analyze these indicators based on information from the financial statements of SC Sinteza SA, a company in Bihor county, listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{findings}} of prior empirical research concerning hotel management contracts between owners and operators is undertaken. It is noted that management contracts have become increasingly commonplace in the international hotel sector and that gross revenue and <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> profit are the most extensively used determinants of operator incentive fee remuneration. These findings present a platform for examining how revenue and <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> profit are deficient in promoting owner-operator goal congruency. In light of this, return on investment (ROI) and residual income (RI) are examined as potential alternative determinants of operator reimbursement. Although it is appears that both ROI and RI as determinants of hotel operator fees would represent an advance in promoting owner-operator goal congruency, a rationale outlining how RI is preferable to ROI is outlined. © 2010 International Council on Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education...|$|R

50|$|Corporate taxThe {{corporate}} tax, in French impot sur les societes (IS), is {{an annual}} tax in principle that affects all profits made in France by corporations and other entities. It concerns {{about one-third of}} French companies. The standard rate is 33.3% for all of their activities. In 2016, the net proceeds from corporation tax amounted to €29.9 bn. The taxable income {{is equal to the}} difference between gross profit and costs and deductible expenses. The <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> profit is made by the difference between sales and costs. In addition to the <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> profit, all income or profits made apart are normally taxable: income from the rental of property, interests, deposits and bonds. A reduced rate applies to a limited number of Long Term Capital Gains. Since 2012 a tax credit equal to 7% of total salary costs can be deducted from the gross tax due.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the changes in the availability of oil and gas resources in Malaysia. The physical and monetary balance sheets for crude oil and natural gas for the period 2000 - 2007 was constructed. The net present value of expected future incomes to reflect the value of resource change was calculated based on a physical extraction and a resource rent scenario. Resource rent is <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> surplus less the estimated user cost of produced capital in the crude oil and natural gas extraction industry. We obtained the <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> surplus by subtracting the value of consumption of employees and net taxes on production cost from the value added of petroleum domestic products. Our findings noted serious reduction of oil reserves from 2001 – 2005, due to changes in crude oil prices, and thereafter the depletion rate decreased. Malaysia has depleted her natural gas reserves mainly in 2004 and 2005. Changes in reserves values were attributable more to price changes and new discoveries. Further, our study shows that the royalty rate paid by the state oil company, Petronas was far less than the estimated resource rent.
