40|$|Title: Food {{waste from}} <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> in Umeå- the {{potential}} {{for taking care of}} and reducing the amount of food waste. Author: Helene Myhrberg Abstract Food waste from <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> is an increasing problem in Sweden, and amounts to roughly 67 000 ton per year. This has consequences both for sustainability in general, but also for achieving the targets stipulated by the EU. Given this, it should be relevant for the society that <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> both decrease the amount of food waste but also develop better ways of dealing with food waste. Although there exist methods for this, the practicability of such measures are unknown. In this thesis I assess these issues by conducting interviews with owners and employees at five <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> in Umeå, asking them how they think about these questions. In particular, I focus on {{how to take care of}} and prepare food waste for anaerobic digestion and how to decrease volumes of food waste. In essence, I find that both the knowledge of, and interest in, these issues vary substantially between <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> Further, for these measures to be feasible, it requires the process to be both economically efficient while not requiring too much time of work. With this in mind, it seems necessary to have a facility that can take care of both packed and unpackaged food waste, making it as cheap and simple as possible for the <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> For reducing volumes of waste, most <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> agrees on better planning as the way to go. Key words: food waste, <b>grocery</b> <b>stores,</b> anaerobic digestion, decreasing of food waste...|$|R

5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small <b>grocery</b> <b>store.</b> After his father was shot and killed outside the <b>grocery</b> <b>store,</b> Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E

40|$|Load {{shapes and}} {{electricity}} consumption indicators are developed for <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> using a multiple regression approach with parameters accounting for {{factors that affect}} the electricity consumption. This paper deals with electricity consumption and electrical load demand in Swedish <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> Several interesting results were observed, such as: non-linear correlation between floor area and electricity consumption, and non-linear correlation between outdoor temperature and electricity consumption. Electricity Consumption Indicators (ECIs) were developed based on 11 months of load research data from 21 <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> Load shapes, and daily, monthly and annual consumption indicators were developed. The usage of two different area figures was studied: the gross floor area and the sales floor area. The analysis showed that the sales area provides the most information about the actual store conditions and is of greater importance when analysing the electricity consumption in <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> There was {{a high level of}} agreement in comparisons to measured data. <b>Grocery</b> <b>stores</b> are among the highest electricity consumers if the specific electricity consumption (kWh/m·yr) is compared.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Little {{is known}} about the {{relation}} between the neighbourhood food environment and home cooking. We explored the independent and combined associations between residential neighbourhood spatial access to restaurants and <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> with home cooking in European adults. Methods: Data of 5076 participants of the SPOTLIGHT study were collected across five European countries in 2014. Food retailers were classified into <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> (supermarkets and local food shops) and restaurants (full-service restaurants, fast food and take-away restaurants, café/bars). We used multinomial logistic regression models to test the associations between tertiles of spatial access to restaurants and spatial to access <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> and the outcome ‘frequency of home cooking’ categorized into 0 - 3; 4 - 5; and 6 - 7 days/week. Additive interaction analysis was used to test the combined association between access to <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> and to restaurants with home cooking. Results: Mean age was 52. 3 years; most participants were women (55. 5 %) and completed higher education (53. 8 %). Residents with highest access to restaurants had a reduced likelihood of home cooking 6 - 7 days/week (vs. 0 - 3 days/week) (relative risk ratio (RRR) 0. 42; 95 %CI[*]=[*] 0. 23 - 0. 76) when compared with lowest access to restaurants. No association was found for spatial access to <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> Additive interaction analysis showed that individuals with medium access to <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> and highest access to restaurants had the lowest likelihood (RRR[*]=[*] 0. 29, 95 %CI[*]=[*] 0. 10 - 0. 84) of cooking 6 - 7 days/week when compared to individuals with lowest access to restaurants and highest access to <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> Conclusion: Greater neighbourhood spatial access to restaurants was associated with lower frequency of home cooking, largely independent of access to <b>grocery</b> <b>stores...</b>|$|R
