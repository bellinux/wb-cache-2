As part of his union busting strategies, all of these activities were performed with the goal of maintaining complete control of the work force by top management. Shefferman's book not only provided the concepts that animated all future union busting techniques, he also provided language that pro-labor supporters believe mask the intent of the policies.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> to drive performance, few studies empirically demonstrate their long-term benefits within work-team settings in field studies; even fewer studies incorporate hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> in their design.

It was conducted on bulk-cash tellers working in 19 centres, using a time-series design. The results, derived from quantitative data collected from 82 individual tellers over 24 months, showed that hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> for supervisors of teams of tellers, some of whom were individually incentivised, were associated with significant increases in the volume, speed and accuracy of deposit processing by all the tellers.

40|$|This {{research}} focussed on {{the performance}} of individuals in work teams. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the nature of the team processes which could explain time-associated differences, in the performance outcomes of individuals within work teams, in teams whose members had moderately interdependent tasks and received hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives.</b> The extant literature has a large body of work on teams in general; there also exists a large amount of work on currently understood relationships between task-interdependence, <b>pay</b> <b>incentives,</b> team processes, and performance. However, although task-interdependent work teams with hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> are common in many labour-intensive business environments, the current literature is thin on the identification of specific team processes which link long-term performance differences in comparable teams. Secondly, few studies on work-team performance, in the current literature, incorporate time as a predictor variable. This research investigated the effects of the introduction of performance-based hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> to members of work teams; the research also investigated the nature of explanatory, time-linked team processes which could be associated with performance variances between these work teams. A review of the literature on work team effectiveness, <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> and performance in work teams, resulted in hypothesised relationships between the interdependent tasks of work team members, hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> for supervisors, and overall team performance over time. The research focussed on variances between the team processes for good and poor teams to design a work team process and performance model, which could be used to predict performance variance between teams over time in the field. The study was conducted on bulk-cash deposit processing teller work teams. These work teams were located at geographically dispersed processing centres (18 cash centres), where each work team was composed of an average of 6 members, comprising a team supervisor, and a combination of permanently employed tellers (regular tellers) and tellers on renewable fixed term contracts (contract tellers), in a financial services firm. Using a longitudinal research design, the study used mixed methods, incorporating a control group time-series design. Quantitative performance data included the number and accuracy of deposits processed and attendance records; the data also included ratings on behavioural measures for professionalism. Individual and team-level performance related data was collected from over 480 individuals, in monthly buckets over a period of thirty four months (N= 16, 358 teller data months), during which a <b>pay</b> <b>incentive</b> for performance was introduced as the first intervention (IV 1), followed - after eight months - by a second intervention (IV 2), which was the allocation of tellers into teams, whose supervisors received hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives.</b> Using a multiple case study approach, qualitative data was collected using semi-structured individual and group interviews incorporating rating scales, for individuals and focus groups, in two phases of data collection periods. The interviews were lagged to findings from analyses performed on the quantitative data collected. Using a combination of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the quantitative component of the study, emerging-themes analysis for the qualitative component, and structural modelling techniques, 1) as expected, the introduction of <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> for regular tellers was associated with statistically significant increases in the volumes of deposits processed per unit time, with a large effect size; 2) the introduction of individual <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> for regular tellers was associated with statistically significant increases in overall individual performance, with a medium effect size; 3) the combination of the introduction of individual and hybrid incentives, and the allocation of supervisors to teams, was associated with statistically significant additional increases in the volumes of deposits processed per unit time and accuracy of deposit processing for both regular and contract tellers, within high performing teams; 4) internal team processes (intra-team communication, target-setting and coaching, progress monitoring and feedback) explained the variance in inter-team performance over time; 5) team coordination and target-setting were the intervening variables in the relationship between <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> and team performance. A predictive performance model for performance in interdependent work teams with a combination of individual and hybrid <b>pay</b> <b>incentives</b> was developed, based on the quantitative and qualitative findings from this study.
