5|$|This munia eats mainly <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> {{apart from}} berries and small insects. They forage in flocks and {{communicate}} with soft calls and whistles. The species is highly social and may sometimes roost with other species of munias. This species is found in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using grass or bamboo leaves.|$|E

30|$|Pastoral {{households}} are increasingly practising fodder production {{in response to}} forage scarcity associated with land degradation, climate variability and change. Understanding the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain {{is a prerequisite for}} developing sustainable fodder production and guiding appropriate out-scaling in the drylands. This study investigated the producers’ perspectives on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production, marketing and challenges faced along the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain in Marigat Sub-County of Baringo County, Kenya. The results show that the dominant actors were the bulking and processing agents who provided inputs and were a source of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> market to the producers. The producers preferred contractual agreements that allowed them to sell their <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to markets of their choice. As independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders allowed for seed price negotiation, they were popular amongst the producers and thus handled the most volume of seeds marketed. Drought occurrence, inability of existing outlets to purchase <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> at times, together with low prices offered for producers’ <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> were found to be among the challenges facing the producers. There is need to strengthen the fodder groups with a possibility of registering them as cooperatives for the purpose of collective bargaining for better <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> prices.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how two <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> industries respond {{to changes in}} the production environment. Two sets of factors are necessary to understand what adjustments would be made. First, it is necessary to know the nature of the markets and whether market power is being exerted. Second we need to know the relative demand and supply elasticities for the products. The Oregon cool season <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> industry is selected for a number of reasons. First, the banning or restriction of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> burning is a legislative change that would increase production costs. Second, U.

30|$|The {{independent}} <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> {{traders in}} the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain in Marigat Sub-County utilize {{their knowledge of}} the region to locate <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> supplies, negotiate seed prices with the farmers and bulk sufficient quantities of the seeds. Since these traders do not act as brokers, they incur costs in seed purchases, transportation and storage. They have connections, within and outside the Sub-County, which serve as their seed markets. Rarely do these agents sell their bulked seeds to the bulking and processing agents within the Sub-County; rather, they view them as competitors. To the producers, the independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders are seasonal market actors.|$|R
5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters {{will take the}} occasional vertebrate such as a small frog, rodent or fish. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Plant material is eaten, especially <b>grass</b> <b>seeds,</b> but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and common quails.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on <b>grass</b> <b>seeds.</b> They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits mangroves and its absence from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|E
5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs or fish {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially <b>grass</b> <b>seeds,</b> but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade to pluck food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to map the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain in Baringo County, Kenya, {{document}} producers’ perspectives on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production and marketing, and the challenges encountered along the chain. The information generated will be important in identifying key areas where interventions can help improve the functioning of the value chain to the benefit of the chain actors. Moreover, Baringo County is known to be one of the leading <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> producers whose output is supplied across the country, and its efforts need documentation. This will enable formulation of effective and efficient intervention strategies that can facilitate the growth and competitiveness of the Baringo County <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> market in Kenya.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 This {{research}} {{analyzed the}} relationships of agricultural field burning policies, and other economic factors, with the quantity of land devoted to <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production in counties of the Willamette Valley, Oregon.

5|$|A smallish crake, the African crake has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and {{black-and-white}} barring on {{the flanks}} and belly. It has a stubby red bill, red eyes, {{and a white}} line from the bill to above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the corn crake; that species is also lighter-plumaged, and has an eye stripe. The African crake has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating krrr notes. It is active during the day, and is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a threat display, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3–11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy precocial chicks fledge after four to five weeks. The African crake feeds {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially <b>grass</b> <b>seeds.</b> It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E

25|$|Like other finches, the Gouldian finch is a seed eater. During the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian finches feed mostly on ripe or half-ripe <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> of sorghum. During the dry season, they forage {{on the ground}} for fallen seed. During the wet season, spinifex grass seed (Triodia sp.) is an important component of their diet. So far Gouldians have been recorded as consuming six different species of grass seed, but during crop analysis, researchers have yet to find evidence of insect consumption.|$|E

25|$|The grey-capped social weaver or grey-headed social weaver (Pseudonigrita arnaudi) is a sparrow-like liver-colored bird, with a pale grey crown, a dark grey bill, a whitish eye-ring, horn-colored legs, {{with some}} {{black in the}} wing and a light {{terminal}} band in the tail, that builds roofed nests made of straws, breeds in colonies in thorny Acacia trees, and feeds in groups gathering <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> and insects. Male and female have near identical plumage. Recent DNA-analysis confirms {{it is part of}} the weaver family. It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.|$|E
25|$|In P. arnaudi, nests are {{not only}} used for {{breeding}} {{and to protect the}} chicks, but also for fully grown birds to sleep at night. The species builds roofed nest in thorny Acacia trees and forms colonies. One of the two entrances is closed however just before eggs are laid and opened again around the moment of fledging. Male and female share incubation duties. Adult and adolescent birds from previous broods often help in nest building and feeding the chicks. The nestlings are initially fed on a diet consisting exclusively of insects, and <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> are only given during the last days. Fledging occurs after about twenty days.|$|E

25|$|The {{scarlet-chested parrot}} (Neophema splendida), known {{alternately}} as scarlet-breasted parrot, orange-throated parrot or splendid parrot, is a parrot endemic to central South Australia and inland southern Western Australia. The species is sexually dimorphic; the male has a bright blue face and scarlet chest and yellow underparts, amid overall green plumage, while the female is similar but lacks the red chest. These nomadic parakeets move readily from the Great Victoria Desert region into neighbouring areas. These interruptions are {{triggered by a}} search for more favourable conditions. They can survive quite well without access to drinking water, however, as succulent plants help meet much of their fluid requirement.
