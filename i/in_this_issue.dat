Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine. Each story featured an illustration of the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.|$|E

25|$|Astonishing Tales #12 (June 1972) {{is a key}} early {{appearance}} for the character, {{due in part to}} Marvel’s {{decision to}} feature Man-Thing <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> At this point Man-Thing had made only one previous appearance, in the 1971 black-and-white magazine Savage Tales #1. A follow-up seven–page Man-Thing story by writer Len Wein and artist Neal Adams was commissioned for a version of Savage Tales #2 that was ultimately never published. Finally seeing print in Astonishing Tales #12 the sequence is presented as a flashback and an interlude between the main action of the book.|$|E
25|$|This however didn’t {{prompt a}} break from his record company, as they offered a few stipends, leading him and his fans to believe they’d still {{eventually}} put the record out. Saigon later suspected that Atlantic {{wanted to make sure}} he didn’t take the material elsewhere and benefit from the buzz he’d created. While caught <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> with Atlantic, Saigon continued to perform freestyles on hip hop radio shows, release mixtapes, and also continued to write and record The Greatest Story Never Told. Despite not having an official album out, Saigon gradually became somewhat of a high-profile hip hop artist, as he appeared on the covers of several magazines and had a recurring role playing himself on the hit HBO show Entourage.|$|E

25|$|In 1923 the Post Office {{released}} the last Washington-Franklin stamp {{that would also}} become the rarest non-error stamp (Scott 544) <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> Printed on unwatermarked paper with gauge 11 perforations, this issue can only be distinguished from the 1-cent 1918 issue (which is also printed on unwatermarked paper with gauge 11 perforations) by measuring {{the parameters of the}} design: 19mm wide by 23½. In 1922 a small quantity of 1c Rotary Press stamps was perforated 11, using remainder sheets from the earlier printings that were normally perforated in 10 gauge or 10 x 11 dual (or compound) gauge. Its existence as a Perf. 11 variety was discovered in 1936, and the stamp finally received a Scott Catalogue listing in 1938.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, the {{government}} decided to introduce decimal currency into the country. This necessitated the surcharging of stamps to reflect this change. Six stamps were chosen from various issues and overprinted {{with the following}} denominations: 1 paisa, 2 paisas, 3 paisas, 7 paisas, 13 paisas (2 designs). Their printing was divided between two local printers, both based in Karachi: Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Time Press, Karachi. Times Press used many plates for printing which resulted in varieties and shifts. Service stamps with decimal surcharges were also printed by the same printers. Forgeries <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> exist in such numbers that they make the average person {{think that there are}} more errors and varieties than in fact. In the 2 paisas Service stamps, errors including service on front and surcharge on gum side are forgeries.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the vast}} number of Washington-Franklin stamps released—as said, more than 250 in seven {{different}} series—only five basic designs were employed during their printing and production. Two separate engravings—one of Washington, the other of Franklin—are used in the five basic design types. The engraving of George Washington was modeled after a bust (sculpture) by the celebrated sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon. The image of Franklin <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> was engraved by Marcus Baldwin who modeled his engraving after {{a photograph of a}} plaster bust of Franklin created by Jean Jacques Caffieri in 1777. As the issue evolved through its seven series, Washington and Franklin replaced each other on some values—marking the first time in United States postal history that two men had appeared on the same denomination in one issue. Indeed, both Washington and Franklin ultimately appeared on the 1-cent, 8-cent, 10-cent, 13-cent, 15-cent, 50-cent and 1-dollar values.|$|E

500|$|When {{the results}} of the polls were printed in the March 2004 issue, {{the rules of the game}} had been changed from the {{original}} concept, showing that readers wanted to focus on the relationships between the girls, and in this respect, the readers could vote on who they wanted to be coupled together. The number of votes for this first round were less than 2000. Noting this, the editorial staff lifted the restriction on only coupling within the same school, along with the restriction of only allowing the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna to couple. This resulted in a total of 66 different possibilities between the twelve characters in the series. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> it was explained that four events were planned for the stories that followed: Easter, Athletic Carnival, Cultural Festival, and Christmas Bazaar. The [...] "Etoile" [...] title was born <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> which was initially used to crown the best couple voted first by the readers in each of the four events to follow. These events were going to be carried out by the three schools in cooperation. It became such that the planning of the schools resulted in them in a triangle position, having the dormitories at the center. The reader's position as the elder brother was canceled <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> and the game became a simple popularity vote for coupling. Due to this new system, Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna ceased to be sisters; surnames were later added to clarify this. After the first story arc of the short stories concluded, it was shown that the number of votes had increased sharply due to the new voting mechanisms. The Etoile voting was announced in the July 2004 issue to take place every month as opposed to every two months which had been the case beforehand. The deadline for voting was shifted to the middle of every month, and online voting was introduced. In September 2004, the voting for the next Etoile was shifted to be online-only; the voting for the Dormitory Panic arc became mail voting only.|$|E
