40|$|Twenty {{indigenous}} (Apis mellifera yemenitica) honeybee colonies {{were transferred}} from the traditional log hives into modern movable frame (Langstroth) hives and divided into 4 Groups. Each group was provided with a modified frame to assess the effect of frame-type on colony settlement, wax secretion, sugar syrup and pollen consumption, sealed brood area, honey and pollen storage. Role of sugar syrup and pollen patty feeding was also evaluated for easy Apis mellifera yemenitica establishment in modern hives under Riyadh conditions. In treatment A and B where the frames were provided with complete wax foundation sheets and one inch wide wax foundation stripe, respectively showed complete colony`s settlement. In treatments C the wired frame without wax foundation sheet and in treatment D where the frames were without <b>wire</b> and wax <b>foundation</b> sheets out of 5 could settle only 3 and 2 - Apis mellifera yemenitica colonies respectively. The food consumption rate remained high in treatment B followed by A, C and D, respectively whereas the sealed brood area, honey and pollen storage were found maximum in treatment A followed by B, C and D, respectively. The dimensions of the hive cells were found different in frames with the wax foundation sheet and without wax foundation sheet. The bees constructed larger cells 27 /sq. inch in frames with wax foundation sheets and smaller cells 34 /sq. inch in frames without wax foundation sheets...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{systems have been}} a part of everyday life for many decades but implemented in an industrial control system they are yet to make their big breakthrough. This is despite of the fact that wireless control systems show great promise in reducing installation costs and down time. The biggest reason why they have not already revolutionised the industry is reliability, as they are much more susceptible to delays and communication breakdowns compared to their <b>wired</b> counterpart. The <b>foundation</b> for this thesis is the following scenario. In an industry a control loop uses a wireless link between the control computer and the actuator. A forklift moving heavy equipment happens to park in a position where it is blocking the communications. This thesis suggests a solution to this problem through the implementation of two separate measures. First a Collection Tree routing Protocol (CTP) is responsible for detecting broken links and nding a disturbance free path for the packet through the network. Secondly a Kalman lter based Predictive Outage Compensator (POC) estimates the missing data when the real control signal is delayed or missing. In the implementation the Moteiv Tmote Sky was used for the network nodes and the double tank process as test bed for the POC. The results show that the CTP network is capable of routing the data through multiple hops without too much delay and that between 1 and 8 packets are lost during route changes. The POC performs on average 8 % better than the more common and naive solution to simply hold the most recently received value in case of outage...|$|R
40|$|A {{wave energy}} park has been {{established}} on the Swedish west coast outside Lysekil and pioneer work about its interactions with the marine environment has been conducted. So far, {{little is known about}} the effects of offshore energy installations on the marine environment, and this thesis assists in minimizing environmental risks as well as in enhancing potential positive effects on the marine environment. The Lysekil research site is situated about two kilometres offshore and has been under development since 2005. During this time 26 “environmental devices”, without generators, consisting of a steel buoy attached via a <b>wire</b> to a <b>foundation</b> on 25 m depth have been placed out for ecological studies on macrofauna in surrounding sediments and on colonization of the foundations and the buoys. Sediment samples to examine macrofauna in the seabed have been taken during five seasons. Biomass, abundance and diversity of infauna in the test site were generally low, but higher than in a nearby control site. The species composition was typical for the area and depth. In addition to sediment analysis, the effect of wave power concrete foundations on the marine environment has been investigated by scuba diving. The surface orientation and its effect on colonization by sessile organisms was examined on the first five foundations, placed out in 2005, and observations of habitat use by fish and crustaceans were made. The results show a succession of colonization over time (three years of investigation) with a higher cover by sessile organisms on vertical surfaces. Mobile fauna abundance on and around the foundations was generally low. Three months after the deployment of the 21 new foundations in 2007, assemblages of mobile organisms were examined visually. Also here, mobile species exhibit a low density, but still higher than on surrounding soft bottoms. The edible crab used artificial holes in the foundations frequently. The foundations were placed in two different clusters, north and south, and the degree to which early recruits covered the foundations and the succession of epibenthic communities were documented during two years. Sessile organisms colonized the northern foundations more rapidly, producing a higher diversity which suggests that the placement of wave energy devices affects colonization patterns. Biofouling on buoys was examined and blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, dominated with a cover about 90 %. Wave exposed buoys were particularly favoured by M. edulis which there had a higher biomass and larger shells compared to those on sheltered buoys. Biofouling on wave power buoys, independent whether these had a cylindrical or toroidal shape, was insufficient to markedly affect their energy production. Finally, the thesis incorporates a review describing wave power projects in general pointing out the need of future research on for instance no-take zones, marine bioacoustics and electromagnetic fields. The main conclusions are that large-scale renewable wave energy conversion will cause ecological impact primarily by adding new hard substrate to an area but not by harming organisms or decreasing biodiversity within wave power parks...|$|R
