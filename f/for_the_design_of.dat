5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the Festspielhaus, Wagner {{appropriated}} some of {{the ideas}} of his former colleague, Gottfried Semper, which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at Munich. Wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at Bayreuth; these include darkening the auditorium during performances, and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, a {{competition}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> Canberra was launched, and Scrivener's detailed {{survey of the}} area was supplied to the competing architects. The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a flood plain and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam to create it. Most of the proposals took the hint and included artificial bodies of water.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the council}} held a {{competition}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the York Park sports ground, the winner to receive £20. The final design had to include two full sized tennis courts, a bowling green, a cycling track, cricket and football grounds with dressing rooms and facilities for spectators. Although not fully complete, York Park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society on 1 January 1921. A cycling track surrounding the perimeter fence was in use by September {{of the same}} year.|$|E
5|$|Influenced from {{an early}} age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained {{international}} recognition in 1949 when he won the competition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.

5|$|Lewis Pilcher of the {{architectural}} firm Pilcher and Tachau {{served as an}} art professor at Vassar between 1900 and 1911; his firm was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the house.

It is the only building on the quad, including Rockefeller Hall, with its main facade facing inward.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroshima {{authorities}} took {{advice about}} the city's reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, suggested they build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near ground zero, that point directly below {{the explosion of}} the atomic bomb.

5|$|The {{design of}} the bridge was {{selected}} via a two-staged, closed design competition, commissioned by Hulme Regeneration Ltd and Manchester City Council.

5|$|Tony Smith {{worked on}} some of the game's {{backgrounds}} and graphics, while Jones designed the levels. Jones decided for Menace to be a side-scrolling game after playing arcade games such as Nemesis (1985) and R-Type (1987). Psygnosis could not decide a preference <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the player ship; as a result, Smith often re-designed the ship with many variations.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which formed the basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the}} first characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

5|$|The {{first phase}} of this work took place from 1539 until autumn 1540. The Moravian {{engineer}} Stefan von Haschenperg was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the fort, being paid the substantial salary of £75 a year {{for his work on}} this and other similar projects, including Calshot, Hurst, Sandgate and Sandown. Philip Chute, John Fletcher and William Oxenbridge, all prominent local men, served as the commissioners for the project, Oxenbridge becoming the pay master. Finding sufficient numbers of workmen was difficult and some had to be pressed into service unwillingly. More artillery pieces were sent to the castle ahead of the work being completed, and were probably installed in temporary battery positions around the castle site.|$|E
