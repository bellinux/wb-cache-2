50|$|In 1992, Sea Shepherd {{launched}} another {{campaign to}} stop <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> from killing dolphins. They stopped in Mexico to repair their ship, Sea Shepherd II. Despite warnings from the Mexican navy {{that they would}} be arrested due to the incident the previous year, they entered the country and covertly did repairs with no incident. They later stopped a <b>tuna</b> <b>seiner</b> from killing a pod of dolphins off of Mexico.|$|R
40|$|From its {{inception}} in 1972, {{one of the goals}} of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was to reduce the incidental mortality of dolphins in the ETP tuna fishery. Regulations promulgated under MMPA authority set standards <b>for</b> <b>tuna</b> seining and motivated technological improvements that reduced dolphin mortalities in this fishery [...] by 1977, annual dolphin mortality by U. S. <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> had declined to about 25, 450 animals. Despite the extensive mortalities, no ETP dolphin population has been listed as endangered or threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. However, two ETP dolphin stocks were listed as depleted under the MMPA...|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Sea Shepherd {{travelled}} to Costa Rica to ram a <b>tuna</b> <b>seiner</b> {{and bring}} the issue to public attention. They found a <b>tuna</b> <b>seiner</b> called the Pan Pacific, which they confirmed had been illegally killing dolphins. The ramming was eventually called off due to a dispute between Paul Watson and Scott Trimmingham. Scott said that ramming would upset his negotiations to have tuna fishing banned in Costa Rica, to which Watson replied that they created international incidentsâ€”they didn't negotiate. In the end, they boarded the Pan Pacific and inspected the logbook, which revealed locations where dolphins were being killed. Using the information, they travelled along the Mexican coast and stopped several <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> from various Latin American countries from killing dolphins.|$|R

25|$|<b>Tuna</b> purse <b>seiners</b> {{are large}} purse seiners, {{normally}} over 45 metres, {{equipped to handle}} large and heavy purse seines <b>for</b> <b>tuna.</b> They have the same general arrangement as the American seiner, with the bridge and accommodation placed forward. A crows nest or tuna tower is positioned {{at the top of}} the mast, outfitted with the control and manoeuvre devices. A very heavy boom which carries the power block is fitted at the mast. They often carry a helicopter to search <b>for</b> <b>tuna</b> schools. On the deck are three drum purse seine winches and a power block, with other specific winches to handle the heavy boom and net. They are usually equipped with a skiff.|$|R

50|$|Purse-seine vessels locate tuna using onboard lookouts, as {{was done}} in the pole-and-line fishery, but they also employ {{sophisticated}} onboard electronics, sea-surface temperature and other satellite data, and helicopters overhead. Once a school is located, the net is set around it. A single set may yield 100 t. Modern <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> have a capacity up to 2000 MT, reach speeds of over , and carry multiple spotting helicopters.|$|R
40|$|Estimates of dolphin school sizes made by {{observers}} and crew members aboard <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> or by observers on ship or aerial surveys are important components of population estimates of dolphins which {{are involved in}} the yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific. Differences in past estimates made from <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> and research ships and aircraft have been noted by Brazier (1978). To compare various methods of estimating dolphin school sizes a research cruise was undertaken with the following major objectives: 1) compare estimates made by observers aboard a <b>tuna</b> <b>seiner</b> and in the ship's helicopter, from aerial photographs, and from counts made at the backdown channel, 2) compare estimates of observers who are told the count of the school size after making their estimate to the observer who is not aware of the count to determine if observers can learn to estimate more accurately, and 3) obtain movie and still photographs of dolphin schools of known size at various stages of chase, capture and release to be used for observer training. The secondary objectives of the cruise were to: 1) obtain life history specimens and data from any dolphins that were killed incidental to purse seining. These specimens and data were to be analyzed by the U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), 2) record evasion tactics of dolphin schools by observing them from the helicopter while the seiner approached the school, 3) examine alternative methods for estimating the distance and bearing of schools where they were first sighted, 4) collect the Commission's standard cetacean sighting, set log and daily activity data and expendable bathythermograph data.

50|$|Insitu {{was founded}} in the early 1990s to develop the Aerosonde concept for {{long-range}} weather reconnaissance. The company derives it name from the process of measuring the atmosphere in situ (in place), as opposed to remotely, by satellite. At {{the end of the}} 1990s the company transitioned to the SeaScan concept for imaging reconnaissance from <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners.</b> With the onset of the Iraq war in 2003, SeaScan turned into ScanEagle, and Insitu focused their efforts on military applications. Insitu was acquired by long-time partner Boeing in 2008. In addition to its Defense business, the company announced the establishment of its commercial business unit, Insitu Commercial, in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m <b>for</b> a large <b>tuna</b> or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|R
5000|$|Rocket Chemical Company {{was founded}} in 1953 by Cyril E. Irving, Norman Roulette and his Robert Roulette, and Iver Norman Lawson. [...] The company had offices in Chula Vista and National City before moving to Kearny Villa Road in Kearny Mesa in 1955. [...] Sam Crivello, who owned a <b>tuna</b> <b>seiner,</b> a major {{industry}} in San Diego at that time, was an early investor and became a director in 1958. [...] Norman B. Larsen was president of Rocket in 1957 and 1958, {{and he had the}} idea of packaging WD-40 in aerosol cans and selling it into the consumer market. [...] Larsen left the company in 1958 after a verbal agreement between Rocket and a distributor fell apart; the distributor set up CRC Industries to directly compete with Rocket and Larsen left to lead it. Cy Irving took over as president in 1958 and retired in 1969.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent trends}} in the Japanese fishing activities by longline, pole-and-line, purse seine and other fisheries mostly taking tuna and billfish fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area (WCP-CA), including fleet size, catch and fishing effort statistics. Total number of commercial longline vessels (larger than 10 GRT) was 533 in 2007 which is 47 vessels (8 %) less than that in 2006. Total number of pole-and-line vessels (larger than 20 GRT) was 116 in 2007 which is 7 vessels (6 %) less than that in 2006. The total WCP-CA catch of tunas (Pacific bluefin, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack) by the Japanese fishery in 2007 was 482, 840 mt that corresponds to 105 % of 459, 679 mt in 2006. In 2007, the catch of tunas by the purse seine fishery was 270, 997 mt (56 % of the total catch of tunas), with 128, 632 mt (27 %) by the pole-and-line, 69, 943 mt (15 %) by the longline, and the remaining 3 %was made by the other gears. With respect to the research activities <b>for</b> <b>tunas</b> and billfishes, tagging studies <b>for</b> tropical <b>tunas</b> and sharks, bluefin tuna larval sampling, longline fishing and collection of gonad samples for albacore were conducted. Currently, a research cruise to investigate behavioral characteristics of juvenile bigeye is being conducted in the western Pacific with the participation of a research boat of Fisheries Agency, FRA <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiner</b> and commercial purse seiner.
