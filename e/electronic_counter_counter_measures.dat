The YB-2B-II had another radar search system, entering service in 1989. These two missiles were capable of flying {{at an altitude of}} 20-50m, so the overall capabilities (altitude, range, reliability, <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Measures</b> (ECCM) were greatly superior.|$|E
40|$|Spread -spectrum {{modulation}} techniques, {{which are}} traditionally applied to military systems {{to enhance their}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Measures</b> (ECCM) capabilities, are beginning {{to appear in the}} commercial secular. Specifically, spread-spectrum technology is being employed in digital cellular radio systems. These systems are identical to the military systems except that they employ much simpler spreading code design and have less security incorporated. However, due to the economies of scale, they can be produced at a much lower cost than their military counterparts. The jamming vulnerability of such commercial products in tactical situations is analyzed in this thesis. The mobile cellular network developed by Qualcomm Inc. is used to illustrate the methodology in analyzing the effects of jamming on the mobile cellular network. With a single mobile station and jammer, the probability of jamming and the optimal jammer trajectory are derived. Next, the effective probabilities of detection and false alarm under the jamming conditions are derived and the mean acquisition times are compared to that without jamming. Our results show that intelligence jamming can cause devastating effects even with very small power. Commercial products are therefore much more vulnerable due to the simplicity in design.

50|$|In late 1990, the US {{partnership}} expressed {{similar concerns}} and {{embarked on an}} upgrade to the existing Sidewinder design to provide increased maneuverability and IRCCM (infrared <b>counter</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measures)</b> performance, i.e. <b>measures</b> to <b>counter</b> infrared countermeasures (IRCM). This program was designated AIM-9X.|$|R
50|$|The AIM-9M-8/9 {{incorporated}} {{replacement of}} five circuit cards {{and the related}} parentboard to update infrared <b>counter</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> (IRCCM) capability to improve 9M capability against the latest threat IRCM. The first AIM-9M-8/9 modifications, fielded in 1995, involved deskinning the guidance section and substitution of circuit cards at the depot level, which is labor-intensive and expensive—as well as removing missiles from inventory during the upgrade period. The AIM-9X concept is to use reprogrammable software to permit upgrades without disassembly.|$|R
5000|$|In combat {{uses of the}} AIM-9L, opponents had not {{developed}} tactics for the evasion of head-on missile shots with it, making them more vulnerable. The AIM-9L {{was also the first}} Sidewinder that was a joint variant used by both the US Navy and Air Force since the AIM-9B. The [...] "Lima" [...] was distinguished from earlier Sidewinder variants by its double delta forward canard configuration and natural metal finish of the guidance and control section. The Lima was also built under license in Europe by a team headed by Diehl BGT Defence. There are a number of [...] "Lima" [...] variants in operational service at present. First developed was the 9L Tactical, which is an upgraded version of the basic 9L missile. Next was the 9L Genetic, which has increased infra-red <b>counter</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> (IRCCM); this upgrade consisted of a removable module in the Guidance Control Section (GCS) which provided flare-rejection capability. Next came the 9L(I), which had its IRCCM module hardwired into the GCS, providing improved countermeasures as well as an upgraded seeker system. Diehl BGT also markets the AIM-9L(I)-1 which again upgrades the 9L(I)GCS and is considered an operational equivalent to the initially [...] "US only" [...] AIM-9M.|$|R
5000|$|The AIM-9X Sidewinder, {{developed}} by Raytheon engineers, entered service in November 2003 with the USAF (lead platform is the F-15C; the USN lead platform is the F/A-18C) {{and is a}} substantial upgrade to the Sidewinder family featuring an imaging infrared focal-plane array (FPA) seeker with claimed 90° off-boresight capability, compatibility with helmet-mounted displays {{such as the new}} U.S. Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, and a totally new three-dimensional thrust-vectoring control (TVC) system providing increased turn capability over traditional control surfaces. Utilizing the JHMCS, a pilot can point the AIM-9X missile's seeker and [...] "lock on" [...] by simply looking at a target, thereby increasing air combat effectiveness. It retains the same rocket motor, fuze and warhead of the 9-"Mike", but its lower drag gives it improved range and speed. AIM-9X also includes an internal cooling system, eliminating the need for use of launch-rail nitrogen bottles (U.S. Navy and Marines) or internal argon bottle (USAF). It also features an electronic safe and arm device similar to the AMRAAM, allowing reduction in minimum range and reprogrammable InfraRed <b>Counter</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Measures</b> (IRCCM) capability that coupled with the FPA provide improved look down into clutter and performance against the latest IRCM. Though not part of the original requirement, AIM-9X demonstrated potential for a Lock-on After Launch capability, allowing for possible internal use for the F-35, F-22 Raptor and even in a submarine-launched configuration for use against ASW platforms. The AIM-9X has been tested for a surface attack capability, with mixed results.|$|R

50|$|Electronic attack (EA) (previously {{known as}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Measures</b> (ECM)) {{involves}} the use of EM energy, directed energy, or anti-radiation weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying enemy combat capability including human life. In the case of EM energy, this action is referred to as jamming and can be performed on communications systems (see Radio jamming) or radar systems (see Radar jamming and deception).|$|R
50|$|Being {{one of two}} {{reconnaissance}} wings supporting SEA {{there were}} few military operations that did not involve the 460th TRW. Not only did the 460th TRW provide electronic and photo reconnaissance, the Wing's electronic capabilities allowed it to provide <b>electronic</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> support to B-52s returning from striking targets in North Vietnam. The Wing even gave support to the Cambodian military against the North Vietnam and Viet Cong forces, as well as support to US units operating inside Cambodia.|$|R
50|$|Melpar {{continued}} its work on military and space {{applications such as}} radar, communications, and <b>electronic</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> systems as well as airborne and ground intelligence systems. Devices to detect lethal chemical and biological agents were developed.

50|$|The Argus {{replaced}} the RCAF Lancaster and Lockheed P-2 Neptune aircraft types previously flown in the maritime roles. One {{of the most}} effective anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft of its day, the Argus was a mainstay for the RCAF. A large amount of equipment was carried, including: search radar, sonobuoys, <b>electronic</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> (ECM), explosive echo ranging (EER) and magnetic anomaly detector (MAD). Up to 8,000 lb (3,632 kg) of weapons could be carried in the bomb bays, including torpedoes, bombs, mines and depth charges.|$|R
5000|$|Fully stealth {{aircraft}} carry all fuel and armament internally, which limits the payload. By way of comparison, the F-117 carries only two laser- or GPS-guided bombs, while a non-stealth attack aircraft can carry several times more. This requires {{the deployment of}} additional aircraft to engage targets that would normally require a single non-stealth attack aircraft. This apparent disadvantage however is offset by the reduction in fewer supporting aircraft that are required to provide air cover, air-defense suppression and <b>electronic</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measures,</b> making {{stealth aircraft}} [...] "force multipliers".|$|R
50|$|Externally, the {{aircraft}} has a modified centerline pylon to enable carriage of {{many types of}} test and operational stores such as the ALQ-167 <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Measures</b> (ECM) pod, which is programmable {{with a wide variety}} of electronic jamming techniques as well as an ALE-40 chaff and flare pod. External stores can be provided with AC and DC power. Another test capability under development is a Low Observable Instrumented Tow Target system that will support many different types of tests. Flight cleared pods are available for carriage of additional customer defined stores.|$|R
50|$|In British service it {{was mostly}} {{organised}} as a radar section of two radars in the locating (G) troop of field regiments. In addition to the radars the section also had a command post and deployed two Listening Posts (LPs). The task of the LPs was to report mortars firing and the area they were in. This told the radar to switch-on, and so avoided continuous transmission as an <b>electronic</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measure.</b> The other section of the troop provided an artillery intelligence section at brigade headquarters responsible for fighting the brigade’s counter-mortar battle.|$|R
