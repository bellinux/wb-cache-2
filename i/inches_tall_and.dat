25|$|Before the 1958 season, Cleveland {{was again}} {{in search of}} a quarterback. O'Connell had played well in the {{previous}} two seasons – he led the league in passing in 1957 – but lacked the stature and durability Paul Brown wanted in a starter. He stood at just 5 feet, 10 <b>inches</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> was hurt numerous times, including a sprained ankle and a broken bone in his leg that kept him out of the last two games of the 1957 regular season. Due in part to these injuries, O'Connell retired early in 1958 to take a coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named the starter. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527 yards – almost twice as much as any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E
25|$|Gorgal was {{selected}} by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in the sixth round of the 1950 draft.

Gorgal was given a $5,900-a-year contract with a $200 bonus and made Cleveland's roster as a starter in his rookie year, supplanting long-time safety Cliff Lewis. While Gorgal was large in stature for a safety of the era – he was six feet, two <b>inches</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> weighed about 200 pounds – he had six interceptions in 1950, second on the team to Tommy James's nine. Led by an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, the Browns finished with a 10–2 record and won the NFL championship by beating the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E

500|$|Animation {{took place}} at 3 Mills Studios in East London. A dozen animators/puppeteers were put to work when {{production}} began, but that number had tripled {{by the end of}} production. The initial group spent time developing each puppet's unique characteristics. The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 <b>inches</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets. The three primary characters—Victor, Victoria and Corpse Bride—were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces. The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera. A total of 32 cameras were used on the film. Each camera was outfitted with a [...] "grabber" [...] system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short [...] "reel" [...] of the shot being produced to check their work.|$|E
