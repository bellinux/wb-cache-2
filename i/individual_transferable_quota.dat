40|$|Fisheries {{worldwide}} {{continue to}} suffer from {{the negative consequences of}} open access. In 1986, New Zealand responded by establishing an <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota</b> (ITQ) system that by 1998 included 33 species and more than 150 markets for fishing quotas. We assess these markets in terms of trends in market activity, price dispersion, and the fundamentals determining quota prices. We find that market activity is sufficiently high to support a competitive market and that price dispersion has decreased over time. Using a 15 -year panel dataset, we also find evidence of economically rational behavior through the relationship between quota lease and sale prices and fishing output and input prices, ecological variability, and market interest rates. Controlling for these factors, our results show an increase in quota prices, consistent with increased profitability. Overall, the results suggest these markets are operating reasonably well, implying that ITQs can be effective instruments for efficient fisheries management. tradable permits, <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota,</b> fisheries, policy. ...|$|E

Assuming the existence of two types of vessels {{in terms of their}} scales, we consider not only quota transactions but also the exit of fishers. Changes in vessel sizes of incumbent fishers are also taken into consideration. We find that when large-scale vessels are more efficient than small-scale vessels, the long-run efficiency is achieved only with an ITQ regime. However, when small-scale vessels are more efficient than large-scale vessels, the long-run efficiency is not achieved; the number of vessels becomes too few compared to when the total harvesting cost is minimized.

40|$|New Zealand's {{fisheries}} {{are perhaps}} best known for the <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota</b> (ITQ) system brought about by the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986. The 1986 Act allocated quota to fishing firms and individuals that met the allocation criteria. Part-time fishers, many of whom were Maori, New Zealand's indigenous people, were excluded from the initial allocation. The 1986 Act did not address claims by Maori of having indigenous rights guaranteed by the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. Since the Treaty, Maori have protested against government actions and legislation that have eroded their rights guaranteed by the Treaty. The implementation of the 1986 Act prompted further Treaty-based claims to large areas of fisheries, and the ITQ system was used to settle several claims. This paper explores Maori views on resource use and claims to fisheries resources, legislative changes enacted to settle Maori fisheries claims, and claims that remain outstanding. The insights of this paper have relevance to the broader discussion on the position of indigenous peoples throughout the world.

40|$|The use of {{individual}} transferable quotas in fisheries {{has been considered}} an opportunity to achieve a given total allowable catch with a maximum social benefit. One of the assumptions used in obtaining that {{result is that the}} system is in perfect compliance. The presence of violations and the need for enforcement of tradable property rights systems in fisheries has not received much attention in the literature. The incidents of non-compliance, however, may affect the performance of transferable property rights-based fisheries in unexplored ways. In this paper, we adapt previous literature on enforcing emissions trading programs to analyze a positive model of fisherman behavior that operates under a perfectly competitive <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota</b> system, while recognizing the opportunities for violations of quota holdings, given incomplete enforcement. Considering a poorly enforced, <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota</b> system we are able to obtain a number of implications for the current and future equilibrium of the quota market, the time paths of the fishery, and the proper design of a policy rule on total allowable catch (TAC).

40|$|This article explores New Zealand's {{experience}} with introducing species into the quota management system (QMS). The Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 {{brought about the}} QMS based on the allocation of <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota</b> (ITQ) to those who met the eligibility criteria. At that time, 27 commercially valued species were introduced into the QMS. While the intent was to manage more species within the QMS, introduction occurred slower than initially anticipated, with only another 15 species introduced into the QMS by 2000. The last major impediments to the QMS introduction process were removed in 2001 with the full implementation of the Fisheries Act 1996 {{and the development of}} a new registry computer system. The Ministry of Fisheries then embarked on a project to introduce a further 50 species into the QMS by 2004. This article outlines the challenges encountered and legislative and procedural changes made for introducing species into the QMS. This article contributes to the broader discussion on the application of ITQ to the management of fisheries resources and does not necessarily express the views of the Ministry of Fisheries. <b>Individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota</b> Quota allocations Tendering Costs and benefits New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of New Zealand's quota management system in 1986 both property rights and institutional arrangements for managing wild fisheries and marine farming have continued to mature. Changes strengthening the commercial fisheries rights have encouraged <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quota</b> owners and marine farmers to voluntarily organise into associations to better manage fisheries resources. These associations are placing increasing emphasis on the co-management of the productive capacity of the marine ecosystems. However, barriers remain to the widespread uptake of co-management arrangements, such as poorly defined rights for non-commercial fishers and marine farmers and/or poor integration of these rights with the management of wild fisheries, and legislative inflexibility and inappropriate political and bureaucratic intervention. Recognising these problems, the New Zealand Government recently released "Fishing for the Future", an independent review of fisheries legislation and its administration. The review recommended a fundamental change from centrally managed fisheries to co-managed fisheries.

40|$|Abstract In this article, we analyse to {{what extent}} the change in the Danish fishery policy from an effort {{restriction}} based management system (ERIQ) to a system based on <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quotas</b> (ITQ) has improved the creation of resource rent. Fisheries economic theory shows that ITQ-based fisheries in a perfect world will be efficient and resource rents will be larger than in fisheries regulated by various forms of entry restrictions and effort regulations. The results presented in this article and evidence from the entire Danish fishery support this conclusion. However, the analy-ses also show that the resource rent in an ITQ-based fishery might not differ very much from the resource rent in a well-managed fishery based on effort restrictions.

40|$|Two {{important}} new directions in resource and environmental management are increased reliance on market mechanisms {{on the one}} hand, and on greater participation by local communities on the other. In fisheries, market-based management is found mainly in the “cap-and-trade ” systems known as <b>individual</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>quotas</b> (ITQs). ITQs are effective in achieving certain economic goals but often with undesirable social costs, leading {{to the view that}} they are antithetical to community-based management. However, ITQ systems have been adapted to mitigate community losses. In addition, social resistance to ITQs has encouraged the development of innovative programs in community-based fisheries management.

40|$|A {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a {{critical}} review of the total allowable catch (TAC) policy within the European Union (the EU) for cod in the North Sea. The actual TACs are compared with the biological recommendations about the TAC and the bio-economic optimal TAC. It is shown that the actual TAC follows biological recommendations but that bio-economic principles are poorly reflected in the TAC. The Danish regulatory policy for cod in the North Sea (rations) is analysed by means of a bio-economic model. It is shown that the information requirements needed for conducting a bio-economic optimal allocation of rations are considerable. Furthermore, the actual allocation scheme for rations distribute too high a share of the EU determined Danish quota to small vessels.

40|$|Rights-based {{management}} {{regimes are}} considered by economists {{as an important}} solution {{to the problems of}} excess capacity and biological over-harvesting of fisheries. In practice, adoption of such regimes, and particularly of those relying on individual quota allocations, has often met with resistance from within the fisheries concerned. A key reason for this resistance appears to be the distributional conflicts which arise in the process of implementing the regimes. An economic analysis of the nature of these conflicts in the different contexts in which they have been observed is proposed. The approach centres on the way in which distributional conflicts can influence the operation of management systems and their impacts on fisheries, from the country to the individual firm level.
