I hope to {{meet you}} again, and I raise my pipe above my head and say, Great Spirit, I pray be good to my friend, the Son of the Shadow-Maker.

Lowering my pipe of peace, I say, Kind Mother Earth, when you receive my friend into thy {{maternal}} bosom, hold him kindly let the howl of the coyote, the roaring of the bears and mountain lions, the cold blasts of winds swaying the tops of the pine trees be a sweet lullaby to him, that shaketh the hand of your friend.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Still,” said Tony doggedly, “I’m not <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> {{in peril}} here. I couldn’t face Violet, {{and tell her}} that tale. Nor am I as sure as {{you seem to be}} that the thing is so absurd. It’s only the moral courage that has been left out of me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Their guest laughed bitterly. [...] "Well, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I reckon to cut {{the whole}} concern to-morrow, and 'lite' out for {{something}} new. It can't be worse than this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> {{here for}} a little while," [...] she said cheerfully, but with a pale face and nervous hands. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> while I seek Low." ...|$|E
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. Hold your noise, I tell you. Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you?</b> I'm {{going to}} take you with me. There now: does that satisfy you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Miss Kilburn," [...] he said, after {{scanning}} {{her face}} sharply, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> a little tonic. I think you're rather run down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Jinny with <b>you,</b> Lige," [...] said Mr. Carvel, presently. [...] "Worington {{has some}} {{notion that the}} Marshal may go to the Arsenal to-night with the writ. I mustn't neglect the boy." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Guess you've got to learn," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "You don't fancy I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> skip and <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> rotting on the beach, perhaps? I'm not that sort, old man. And you're handy, anyway; I've been shipmates with worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come round to-morrow?" [...] {{repeated}} Miss Tipping, in surprise; [...] "why, you don’t think I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> here {{surrounded by}} dangers? You’re coming home with us now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> to {{get over}} it," [...] he declared. [...] "I'm off now to fetch the luggage. You won't be afraid to be left here?" ...|$|E

60|$|As for the hazel staff, {{he was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> that behind, <b>you</b> may be sure.

5000|$|Later, Hitler is {{informed}} by Krebs and Alfred Jodl that Steiner could not mount the attack, allowing the Red Army to further advance closer to Berlin. Dismissing everyone from the room except for Keitel, Jodl, Krebs, Burgdorf and Goebbels, Hitler flies into a furious rage against what he perceives are traitorous actions against him and finally acknowledges {{that the war is}} lost. However, he is determined to stay in Berlin to the end, even if it means killing himself, saying [...] "But, gentlemen, if <b>you</b> believe I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Berlin, <b>you</b> are seriously mistaken.

6000|$|Saunders grinned. [...] "I wouldn't {{worry about}} the thing. If there isn't a club handy {{the next time you}} feel like doing {{anything}} of that kind I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> severely alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Brooke, drily. [...] "It's more restful than shovelling. Still, that's my affair, and you'll have to rustle {{more and}} wonder less. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> in charge here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] said Jack, {{when our}} repast was about concluded, [...] "as <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> us soon, <b>you</b> had better arrange {{with the king}} about getting us an {{interpreter}} and supplying us with a few men to carry our goods.

6000|$|... "'Gone! gone where?' said she.

I shall {{have so much}} time to think, and I shall have no papers--no news. I mustn't talk to you of that. Don't {{let me talk to}} you of that. I want to hear about this world, this world I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and how <b>you</b> think you are going on {{fighting}} in the hot and dusty struggle--to make the world cool and kind and reasonable, to train minds better, to broaden ideas ... all those things you believe in. All those things you believe in and stick to--even when they are dull. Now I am leaving it, I begin to see how fine it is--to fight as you want to fight. A tiresome inglorious lifelong fight.... You really believe, Stephen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> {{to select}} your own studies {{outside of the}} regular course, Richard. What would be the use of taking up music, for instance, if you were not musically inclined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all no use, papa, {{to keep it}} {{to myself}} any longer. The time is coming that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you.</b> I am going, and never to come back!" [...] and Eva sobbed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you,</b> master. No {{doubt the}} Dervishes will shoot me, but {{my life is}} of no consequence, and I shall be glad to die {{by the side of}} so good a master." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} story you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hear, Mabel. You heard of course, that it was Mr. Penfold's {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> half his estates?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> {{alone for}} a quarter of an hour," [...] he said. [...] "I do not think that it will make any difference, but I should like you to have that time for {{unbiased}} reflection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do so," [...] said Kilcullen, [...] "and {{they also}} shall hear what I have to say. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow, perhaps for ever; {{and you will}} not listen to the last word I wish to speak to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, monsieur. We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> {{till the}} work is done. We have settled that four sets of hands can work better than one, and besides, we may hit on some idea. No one can say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} best to let you see it if you pleased," [...] said John Eames.

[...] "I don't like <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you,</b> Sir Raffle, without saying good-by. I do not suppose we shall meet again. Of course you must do your duty, and I do not wish you to think that I have any personal ill-will against you." [...] So saying, he put out his hand to Sir Raffle as though to take a final farewell. Sir Raffle looked at him in amazement. He was dressed, as has been said, in black, and did not look like the John Eames of every day to whom Sir Raffle was accustomed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Greta with a sigh, {{touching}} the buttons of her cape, [...] "because I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Vienna; but I am sorry <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you,</b> Uncle Nic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we are not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop you," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "All we {{came after}} was our brother. But it's a pity <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> here all alone." ...|$|R
