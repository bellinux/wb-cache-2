A strong difference between a single spin and a spin ensemble also exists for the Rabi oscillation decay: for a repeated Rabi oscillation experiment, suppression of decoherence happens for a single spin while acceleration takes place for a spin ensemble.

40|$|We study quantum {{teleportation}} via Bell-diagonal mixed {{states of}} two qubits {{in the context}} of the intrinsic properties of the quantum discord. We show that when the quantum-correlated state of the two qubits is used for quantum teleportation the character of the teleportation efficiency changes substantially depending on the Bell-diagonal-state parameters, which can be seen when the worst-case-scenario or best-case-scenario fidelity is studied. Depending on the parameter range, one of two types of single qubit states is hardest/easiest to teleport. The transition between these two parameter ranges coincides exactly with the transition between the range of classical correlation decay and quantum correlation <b>decay</b> <b>characteristic</b> for the evolution of the quantum discord.

We show that two qubit entanglement of a single entangled initial state may exhibit <b>decay</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the two disentanglement regimes in a single sample, when the external magnetic field is changed.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{measurements}} of the scintillation characteristics of materials has been developed.

The distribution of the arrival times of these individual photon pulses provides information about the <b>decay</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the scintillation process and the number of photons recorded per scintillation event is proportional to the scintillation light yield. The ability to reject spurious events through off-line analysis is an important advantage of the MPCC method since it allows cleaning of the data set from pile-up events.
