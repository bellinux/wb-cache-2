25|$|If {{the black}} liquor <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> is below 20% or water content in black liquor is above 80% the net heating value of black liquor is negative.

The higher the <b>dry</b> <b>solids,</b> the less water the black liquor contains and the hotter the adiabatic combustion temperature.|$|E
25|$|The feed to a {{belt press}} filter {{depends on the}} type of solids, desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> {{concentration}} is typically in the range of 1-10%. The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%. Dilute feed solids concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher feed solids concentration yields an improved solids filtration rate and drier end product.|$|E
25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> loading (mass of <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{are done}} on lab scale with sludge from Garmerwolde and Heerenveen. The {{goal was to}} {{determine}} important differences between the sludges and coagulants. Garmerwolde sludge had a darker colour than Heerenveen sludge. It was also seen that Heerenveen sludge contained much more pollutions such as twigs and hairs. The odour of Heerenveen sludge was also much stronger. These differences {{can be explained by}} the fact that Garmerwolde sludge is digested and the organic material is therefore lower. An optimum <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content for Garmerwolde was not reached yet but with a dosage of 167. 5 g/kg sludge DSC, a <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content of 30 % could be reached. However this dosage is too high to use it in practice. In the case of Heerenveen there was an optimum <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content with a dosage of 88. 5 g/kg sludge DSC. With this dosage a <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content of 27 % is obtained. An improvement of the <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content is not acquired with the use of magnesium salts as coagulant. With both sludges it was seen that manually dewatering using a filter, was difficult. There were more flocs formed with MgCl 2 but still the water was more unclear than using FeCl 3. Probably the settle time needs to be increased if higher <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> contents should be reached. Both sludges require a suitable dosage of coagulant and flocculant. Wrong amounts of coagulant and flocculant cause too large flocs. When the flocs are too thick, the sludge cake will be thicker as well because dewatering is difficult and the filtration resistance will increase. When the dosage of coagulant and flocculant is too low, it is not possible to obtain a sludge cake at all because of the absence of flocs. ...|$|R

25|$|As fired {{black liquor}} {{is a mixture}} of organics, inorganics and water. Typically the amount of water is {{expressed}} as mass ratio of dried black liquor to unit of black liquor before drying. This ratio is called the black liquor <b>dry</b> <b>solids.</b>|$|E
25|$|Where Q0 = {{mass flow}} rate (kg/s), m0 = mass loading (kg/m2), sb = belt speed (m/s) and Lsludge0 = initial width of sludge across the belt (m). Thus to {{maintain}} industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of sludge across the belt must be increased. It {{has been found that}} increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> concentration of the cake while significantly increasing the potential for sludge to overflow the belt. Lateral migration of sludge on the belt is a measure of how the sludge spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral sludge migration means that sludge is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the filtrate. Therefore, increased lateral sludge migration negatively impacts filtrate quality and <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> recovery.|$|E

The total amount of solid waste generated in Mashhad in 2008 was 594 800 tons with per capita solid waste generation rate of 0. 609 kg person 1 day 1.

40|$|Several {{studies has}} been {{conducted}} to economically cultivate the Monascus sp. However, the potential of using stirred drum bioreactor in solid state fermentation (SSF) for Monascus sp. cultivation has been relatively understudied. Oil palm frond (OPF) petiole {{has been used as}} a potential substrate due to its nutritional contents and to add more value to local agricultural waste. This study reports the production of red pigment by Monascus purpureus FTC 5357 in a 2. 3 L bench top - stirred-drum bioreactor. The fungus was grown on moistened OPF substrate (60 % (w/w)) supplemented with 2 % (w/w) of soy meal peptone. The effects of different aeration rates (0. 3 - 1. 0 vvm of humidified air), agitation programme (4 - 8 cycles per day), and substrate load capacity (25 - 40 % (v/v) of total drum capacity) on red pigment production are reported. Aeration rate showed a positively correlated interaction to red pigment production in which the highest red pigment were produced using 1. 0 vvm (6. 09 AU/g <b>dry</b> <b>solid),</b> and non-aerated culture showed the lowest red pigment production (0. 81 AU/g <b>dry</b> <b>solid).</b> The agitation programme was also showing the positive trend of interaction, in which 8 cycles per day showed the highest red pigment production (4. 34 AU/g <b>dry</b> <b>solid)</b> and 4 cycles per day agitation showed the lowest red pigment production.

25|$|The first {{generation}} air {{system in the}} 1940s and 1950s consisted of a two level arrangement; primary air for maintaining the reduction zone and secondary air below the liquor guns for final oxidation. The recovery boiler size was 100 – 300 TDS (tons of <b>dry</b> <b>solids)</b> per day. and black liquor concentration 45 – 55%. Frequently to sustain combustion auxiliary fuel needed to be fired. Primary air was 60 – 70% of total air with secondary the rest. In all levels openings were small and design velocities were 40 – 45m/s. Both air levels were operated at 150oC. Liquor gun or guns were oscillating. Main problems were high carryover, plugging and low reduction. But the function, combustion of black liquor, could be filled.|$|E

The air ratios and temperatures remained the same, but to increase mixing 50m/s secondary air velocities were used. CE changed their frontwall/backwall secondary to tangential firing at that time. In tangential air system the air nozzles {{are in the}} furnace corners. The preferred method {{is to create a}} swirl of almost the total furnace width.
