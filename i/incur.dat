For example, between 15 March and 15 August 1944, the SDS lost 157 men killed, 107 wounded and 26 missing. By August 1944, SDS units were responding to Mihailović's call for a general mobilisation by defecting openly to his Chetniks.|$|E

5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would <b>incur</b> unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E

These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|Final {{assembly}} for the A321 would be, as a {{first for}} any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would <b>incur</b> $150million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing {{it would be more}} productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.|$|E
5|$|Geldray {{took part}} in the Normandy {{landings}} with the Prinses Irene Brigade, but was injured by a bomb blast and spent time in a military hospital. Although he did not <b>incur</b> long-term injuries, he suffered from recurring nightmares in the following years. After the liberation of Amsterdam, Geldray travelled to the city to find his parents who had been resident when the Germans invaded. He found that both parents and his sister Xaviere had been killed in a concentration camp by the Nazis. At the end of the war, Geldray returned to Paris and once again found work with Ray Ventura's orchestra for two years, before returning to London in 1947.|$|E

A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also <b>incur</b> minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Penn National Gaming bought Rosecroft for $10.25 million. Penn National said it {{planned to}} return live racing and {{simulcast}} wagering {{to the track}} as well as pushing for changes in Maryland gaming laws allowing slots and table games. Penn National said it was hoping to convince the state to allow slot machines at the track, even though voters did not approve Prince George's County as a gambling location. On July 28, 2011, the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to allow Penn National Gaming to secure a $1.4 million line of credit to cover operating losses at Rosecroft for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Penn National said it was likely to <b>incur</b> $2.3 million in losses through 2013.|$|E

During the crisis, the wing controlled the 102d Tactical Fighter Group, the 104th Tactical Fighter Group, and the 174th Tactical Fighter Group from New York. The 102d's primary {{mission was to}} provide close air support to NATO ground forces, including the Seventh Army, and air interdiction. During the blockade, the 102d did not <b>incur</b> any losses.

5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must <b>incur</b> different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E
5|$|Operation Biting, {{also known}} as the Bruneval Raid, was the codename for a raid by Combined Operations in 1942. Their {{objective}} was a German Würzburg radar installation at Bruneval in France. Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the array, it was thought a commando raid from the sea would <b>incur</b> heavy losses, and give the garrison sufficient time for the radar equipment to be destroyed. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by sea-borne evacuation would be the ideal way to surprise the garrison and seize the technology intact.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} holding and {{overflow}} packets <b>incurred</b> by policy AT is always zero. However, it results in {{the highest number of}} transmissions and transmission error rate. The average immediate cost <b>incurred</b> by AT is at least 0.09 higher than DP-MDP-QC, which justifies our expectation; AT minimizes the packet delay and queue overflow costs but <b>incurs</b> higher transmission power consumption and downlink transmission error rate. Therefore, the long-term cost <b>incurred</b> by AT is not as low as that <b>incurred</b> by DP-MDP-QC. For policy DP-MDP-Q, the number of transmissions is almost the same as DP-MDP-QC, and the {{number of holding}} and overflow packets is even lower than DP-MDP-QC. However, since this policy assumes that the wireless channels are ideal (but they are in fact not), the transmission error rate is about 1.3 times higher than DP-MDP-QC (almost as high as AT). Therefore, the average immediate cost is still higher than DP-MDP-QC. In summary, in a stochastic environment where the long-term loss can be <b>incurred</b> by multiple causes, the policy that considers all such causes simultaneously outperforms those that only consider some and neglects others.|$|R
