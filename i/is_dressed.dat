5|$|The two copper statues, each {{standing}} 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the obelisk which {{rises to}} a masonry soldier statue, {{instead of the}} typical apex of an obelisk.

In the figure's right hand he holds the handle of his sword and the sword's tip rests {{in front of his}} right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier.

5|$|Before Peter is {{preparing}} to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible.

5|$|Béart {{is given}} an {{ethereal}} quality by Lubtchansky's cinematography and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. In {{the latter part}} of the film Béart <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> in grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and angst. Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace.|$|E

The man in the film that confronts Clint Eastwood is modelled after Lee Van Cleef.|$|E
5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> in sombre colours and rendered {{in a more}} compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into the pictorial space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although {{he appears to be}} resting or asleep.|$|E
5|$|Jenna {{mentions}} that she met Jayden 20 years ago. The scene then flashes back to Jenna getting dissed {{by a young}} Jayden. The costume she is wearing {{is essentially the same}} costume that Jane Krakowski wore 20 years previously in the Broadway musical Starlight Express. In addition, Jayden <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> similar to the street urchin Gavroche in Les Misérables because the young boy playing that role on Broadway was also providing the voice of Control in Starlight.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|Structure 61, Mound61A and Mound61B {{are all on}} {{the east}} side of Terrace5, on the San Isidro plantation.

Early Classic finds from Mound61A include four ceramic vessels and four obsidian prismatic blades.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon {{catching}} sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty standing behind him.

The video ends with each making a pose as the cinematic black bars close.|$|E
5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> in traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
