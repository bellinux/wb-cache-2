The main {{idea is to}} exchange potential <b>error</b> <b>character</b> with its confusable ones and rescore the modified sentence using a conditional random field (CRF) -based word segmentation/part of speech (POS) tagger and a tri-gram language model (LM) to detect and correct possible spelling errors. Experimental results on the Bakeoff 2013 tasks showed the proposed method achieved 0. 50 location detection and 0. 24 error location F-scores in subtask 1 and 0. 49 location and 0. 40 correction accuracies and 0. 40 correction precision in subtask 2. ...|$|E
40|$|Chinese {{character}} correction involves {{two major}} steps: 1) Providing candidate corrections for all or partially identified {{characters in a}} sentence, and 2) Scoring all altered sentences and identifying {{which is the best}} corrected sentence. In this paper a web-based measure is used to score candidate sentences, in which there exists one continuous <b>error</b> <b>character</b> in a sentence in almost all sentences in the Bakeoff corpora. The approach of using a web-based measure can be applied directly to sentences with multiple error characters, either consecutive or not, and is not optimized for one-character error correction of Chinese sentences. The results show that the approach achieved a fair precision score whereas the recall is low compared to results reported in this Bakeoff. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} {{of one of}} the parts in a particle detector, called the RF Foil, has been a very intensive process in the past. The design and production process, which had a trial and <b>error</b> <b>character,</b> led eventually to an RF Foil that met the most important requirement: a sufficient leak tightness value. Since these kinds of foils have to be produced in the future, it is desirable to shorten the development stage with a view to cost reduction. This research project investigates how this part can be optimized with respect to the radiation length. An important limiting factor within this optimization process is the leak tightness of the foil. The intended production method this research will investigate is superplastic forming (SPF). On the one hand, the goal is to use finite element calculations to predict the forming behavior. The leak tightness of the formed foil must also be predicted within these calculations. On the other hand, an optimization strategy is necessary to reduce the radiation length of the RF Foil while maintaining the leak tightness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel {{mathematical}} {{framework is}} developed for investigating steady, incompressible, laminar, radially accelerating or decelerating flows confined between two parallel flat disks. The mathematical description for this flow involves a nonlinear, second-order, boundary-value problem containing an unknown parameter. This equation is derivable from the cylindrical-polar coordinates {{form of the}} Navier–Stokes equations. In order to uniquely determine this parameter, the system is adjoined to an integral constraint. This paper presents a two-level resolution process involving the numerical solution of an equivalent nonlinear integral equation and a detailed error analysis based on an inverse method for developing error estimates for both the function and the unknown system parameter. First, the differential equation is converted into an equivalent Hammerstein–Fredholm equation that automatically incorporates the integral constraint and removes the explicit unknown parameter. This equation is accurately solved {{with the aid of}} the method of Kumar and Sloan using a Chebyshev basis. Second, an unusual nonlinear differential equation is constructed for the local error and resolved by an inverse method involving parameter estimation. The resulting nonlinear differential equation in the local error contains the second derivative of the error at an endpoint. Interrogation of the local error distribution overcomes the limitations associated with a posteriori error estimates based on classical functional analysis. Often the need rises for recognizing the local <b>error</b> <b>character</b> resulting from a numerical simulation. Numerical results indicate the merit of the approaches and re-iterate the need for error estimation in numerical studies...|$|E

40|$|The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS) {{campaign}} {{was conducted in}} central and northeastern Iowa during the months of April-June, 2013. Specific science objectives for IFloodS included quantification of uncertainties in satellite and ground-based estimates of precipitation, 4 -D characterization of precipitation physical processes and associated parameters (e. g., size distributions, water contents, types, structure etc.), assessment {{of the impact of}} precipitation estimation uncertainty and physical processes on hydrologic predictive skill, and refinement of field observations and data analysis approaches as they pertain to future GPM integrated hydrologic validation and related field studies. In addition to field campaign archival of raw and processed satellite data (including precipitation products), key ground-based platforms such as the NASA NPOL S-band and D 3 R Ka/Ku-band dual-polarimetric radars, University of Iowa X-band dual-polarimetric radars, a large network of paired rain gauge platforms, and a large network of 2 D Video and Parsivel disdrometers were deployed. In something of a canonical approach, the radar (NPOL in particular), gauge and disdrometer observational assets were deployed to create a consistent high-quality distributed (time and space sampling) radar-based ground "reference" rainfall dataset, with known uncertainties, {{that could be used for}} assessing the satellite-based precipitation products at a range of space/time scales. Subsequently, the impact of uncertainties in the satellite products could be evaluated relative to the ground-benchmark in coupled weather, land-surface and distributed hydrologic modeling frameworks as related to flood prediction. Relative to establishing the ground-based "benchmark", numerous avenues were pursued in the making and verification of IFloodS "reference" dual-polarimetric radar-based rain maps, and this study documents the process and results as they pertain specifically to efforts using the NPOL radar dataset. The initial portions of the "process" involved dual-polarimetric quality control procedures which employed standard phase and correlation-based approaches to removal of clutter and non-meteorological echo. Calculation of a scale-adaptive KDP was accomplished using the method of Wang and Chandrasekar (2009; J. Atmos. Oceanic Tech.). A dual-polarimetric blockage algorithm based on Lang et al. (2009; J. Atmos. Oceanic Tech.) was then implemented to correct radar reflectivity and differential reflectivity at low elevation angles. Next, hydrometeor identification algorithms were run to identify liquid and ice hydrometeors. After the quality control and data preparation steps were completed several different dual-polarimetric rain estimation algorithms were employed to estimate rainfall rates using rainfall scans collected approximately every two to three minutes throughout the campaign. These algorithms included a polarimetrically-tuned Z-R algorithm that adjusts for drop oscillations (via Bringi et al., 2004, J. Atmos. Oceanic Tech.), and several different hybrid polarimetric variable approaches, including one that made use of parameters tuned to IFloodS 2 D Video Disdrometer measurements. Finally, a hybrid scan algorithm was designed to merge the rain rate estimates from multiple low level elevation angle scans (where blockages could not be appropriately corrected) in order to create individual low-level rain maps. Individual rain maps at each time step were subsequently accumulated over multiple time scales for comparison to gauge network data. The comparison results and overall <b>error</b> <b>character</b> depended strongly on rain event type, polarimetric estimator applied, and range from the radar. We will present the outcome of these comparisons and their impact on constructing composited "reference" rainfall maps at select time and space scales...|$|E

40|$|Document images undergo various {{degradation}} processes. Numerous {{models of}} these degradation processes {{have been proposed}} in the literature. In this {{paper we propose a}} modelbased restoration algorithm. The restoration algorithm first estimates the parameters of a degradation model and then uses the estimated parameters to construct a lookup table for restoring the degraded image. The estimated degradation model is used to estimate the probability of an ideal binary pattern, given the noisy observed pattern. This probability is estimated by degrading noise-free document images and then computing the frequency of corresponding noise-free and noisy pattern pairs. This conditional probability is then used to construct a lookup table to restore noisy images. The impact of the restoration process is then quantified by computing the decrease in OCR word and <b>character</b> <b>error</b> rate. We find that given the estimated degradation model parameter values, the restoration algorithm decreases the <b>character</b> <b>error</b> rate by 16. 1 % and the word error rate by 7. 35 %.
