5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Lactation {{proceeds}} for 19 to 42 months, but calves, rarely, may suckle up to 13 years. Like other whales, {{the sperm}} whale's milk {{has a higher}} fat content than that of terrestrial mammals: about 36%, compared to 4% in cow milk. This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese, which prevents it from dissolving in the water before the calf can eat it. It has an <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> of roughly 3,840 kcal/kg, compared to just 640 kcal/kg in cow milk. Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers.|$|E

5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable inner product. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> of space-time.

5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain a clearer {{understanding}} of the mistletoe fruit/avian disperser interacting system the biochemical composition of the fruit of Tapinanthus leendertziae (Sprague) Wiens was studied. The information reported is the first of this type for any African mistletoe, and the first ever on the disperser-attracting component (the fleshy layer). The water, lipid, protein, fibre, ash. nitrogen-free extract and <b>energy</b> <b>contents,</b> as well as the fresh weight of the fleshy layer and the seed, including the viscin layer, were recorded. The protein and lipid (and thus the <b>energy)</b> <b>contents</b> are relatively high. Comparison with reports in the literature Indicates a possible tendency to higher protein, lipid and <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> in loranthoid species than In viscoid species. The exocarp accounts for 29 % of the dry weight of T. leendertziae fruit, the fleshy layer for 13 % and the seed, including the viscin layer, for 58 %. Analysis of the fleshy layer showed that aspartic acid was the most abundant amino acid present (20 %). The most Important mistletoe disperser in the study area, the yellowfronted tinkerbird, Pogoniutus chrysoconus (Temminck). needs some 172 fruits of T. leendertziae per day to satisfy its energy requirements.

40|$|From the {{contents}} of the soluble sugars, starch, and total lipide measured at monthly intervals {{during the course of a}} year in leaves and barks of Taxus baccata, Juniperus communis, Thuja occidentaliis, Picea excelsa and Sequoiadendron giganteum the <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> of storage substances were calculated and their seasonal trends established. From Taxus and Juniperus the wood was investigated in the same manner. Furtheron, the seasonal trends in total N-contents of leaves and barks of Taxus, Juniperus and Thuja were measured. As energy storing substances the N-compounds are not important. From the seasonal trends of the N-contents a function of the old leaves as an important N-storage pool for the budding may by concluded. In the one year old needles of Picea and Taxus the carbonic acid contents were measured, from an energetic point of view the acids are not important as reserve-substances. From the seasonal trends of the <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> in the different species a general pattern of storage in gymnosperms growing under mild climatic conditions in Central Europe was deduced. Remarkably, according to this pattern the highest amounts of starch are found in the spring or early summer, the maximum contents of total lipide are reached during autumn or early winter and the highest contents of soluble sugars are found in the winter. This pattern confirms earlier assumptions regarding the functions of different storage substances. The total <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> decline during the growth period and reach their lowest values in the late spring and early summer. In the winter none of the species showed an extensive diminution of storage energy, but rather sometimes a rise was seen which points to a net production during the winter months. Thus, the highest <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> in the leaves are often found in the winter. The old needles have an important function as storage sites in the evergreen gymnosperms...|$|R

5|$|The {{published}} work was criticised {{on the grounds}} that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and <b>energy</b> <b>content,</b> and that the food intake of all rats was the same. In an interview, Pickett later said that Lancet editor Richard Horton must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.|$|E
5|$|Wind is {{the flow}} of gases on a large scale. On {{the surface of the}} Earth, wind {{consists}} of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its velocity (wind speed); another the density of the gas involved; another its <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> or wind energy.|$|E
5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E

40|$|Nymphal instars {{and adults}} of the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris, preferably feed on {{lepidopteran}} and colopteran larvae. Different prey diets can change fitness including energy reservoirs of the predator. In the present study, effects of different artificial and natural diets {{as well as}} starvation was studied on <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> of {{the third and fourth}} nymphal instars of P. maculiventris. Total available energy calculated as the sum of the <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> of lipids, carbohydrates, glycogen, and proteins did not significantly differ in the third and fourth nymphal instars fed on natural and artificial diets. Among the energy reservoirs, only total lipid storage of the starved nymphal instars was significantly different from that in the bugs fed on the natural diet. In conclusion, total energy reserves cannot be changed in response to artificial diet. A better understanding of the impact of artificial diets on the energy reserves of natural enemies can be considered as a biomarker for more appropriate mass rearing approaches of natural enemies. ...|$|R

The main results can be posed as follows. First, if the phases of North Atlantic and Southern Oscillations vary synchronously with the 4 - 8 -year period then the relationship between the variations of the NAO indices and the K E contents is the most appreciable.
