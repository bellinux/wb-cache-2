50|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for SUSY comes from the quadratically {{divergent}} contributions to the Higgs mass squared. The quantum mechanical interactions of the Higgs boson causes a large renormalization of the Higgs mass and unless there is an accidental cancellation, the natural size of the Higgs mass is the greatest scale possible. This problem {{is known as the}} hierarchy problem. Supersymmetry reduces the size of the quantum corrections by having automatic cancellations between fermionic and bosonic Higgs interactions. If supersymmetry is restored at the weak scale, then the Higgs mass is related to supersymmetry breaking which can be <b>induced</b> <b>from</b> <b>small</b> non-perturbative effects explaining the vastly different scales in the weak interactions and gravitational interactions.|$|R

Thus, we investigate photoluminescence of nanotube bundles. We show that their complex spectra are simply explained by exciton energy transfer between adjacent tubes, whereby excitation of large gap tubes <b>induces</b> emission <b>from</b> <b>smaller</b> gap ones via Forster interaction between excitons. The consequent relaxation rate is faster than non-radiative recombination, leading to enhanced photoluminescence of acceptor tubes. This fingerprints bundles with different compositions and opens opportunities to optimize them for opto-electronics. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

The Hardy space is a reproducing Hilbert space of holomorphic functions living on a tube type bounded symmetric domain, containing G/H as a boundary component. A boundary value map is constructed and we show that it induces an G-isomorphism onto a multiplicity free subspace of full spectrum in the most continuous part L_ mc^ 2 (G/H) of L^ 2 (G/H).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the likely impact of <b>induced</b> migration <b>from</b> <b>smaller</b> communities to larger centres {{in the event}} of further cuts in federal expenditures in the NWT. With {{the exception of a few}} communities located near mineral resource industries, government employment and transfer payments provide the major source of cash income for most aboriginal communities. This income is critical as a source of money to invest in machinery and equipment to enhance the cash and in-kind income from traditional activities. However, promoting migration to larger centres would increase dependence by reducing access to these traditional sources of income, and by increasing the need for government subsidies to provide housing in the larger centres at a time when adequate housing already exists in smaller communities. Policy alternatives to migration are discussed. ...|$|R

This paper proposes a novel, unsupervised algorithm for auto-matically learning an IS-A taxonomy from scratch by analyzing a given text corpus. Our approach {{is designed to}} deal with infrequently occurring con-cepts, so it can effectively <b>induce</b> taxonomies even <b>from</b> <b>small</b> corpora. Algorithmically, the approach makes two important contributions. First, it per-forms inference based on clustering and the distri-butional semantics, which can capture links among concepts never mentioned together. Second, it uses a novel graph-based algorithm to detect and remove incorrect is-a relations from a taxonomy. An em-pirical evaluation on five corpora demonstrates the utility of our proposed approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Data miners {{have often}} {{to deal with}} data sets of limited size due to economic, timing and other constraints. Usually their task is two-fold: to induce the most {{accurate}} model from a given dataset and to estimate the model's accuracy on future (unseen) examples. Crossvalidation {{is the most common}} approach to estimating the true accuracy of a given model and it is based on splitting the available sample between a training set and a validation set. The practical experience shows that any cross-validation method suffers from either an optimistic or a pessimistic bias in some domains. In this paper, we present a series of large-scale experiments on artificial and real-world datasets, where we study the relationship between the model's true accuracy and its cross-validation estimator. Two stable classification algorithms (ID 3 and info-fuzzy network) are used for inducing each model. The results of our experiments have a striking resemblance to the well-known Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: the more accurate is a model <b>induced</b> <b>from</b> a <b>small</b> amount of real-world data, the less reliable are the values of simultaneously measured cross-validation estimates. We suggest calling this phenomenon "the uncertainty principle of cross-validation"...|$|R
40|$|Abstract —Co-training {{is one of}} {{the major}} semi-supervised {{learning}} methods which can <b>induce</b> classifiers <b>from</b> only <b>small</b> number of labeled data and sufficient number of unlabeled data. To perform successfully, co-training requires splitting the features in original data and constructing views. However, it is not so easy to construct good views which satisfy the following conditions for successful performance of co-training: (1) each of views includes good attributes for classification, and (2) the views are sufficiently independent each other. Additionally, some of the recent researches pointed out that co-training can not perform successfully even if the views satisfy the requirements for good performance. We investigate the relationship among the some evaluation criterion for feature splits and the performance of co-training through the well-designed experiments. In this paper, the experimental results and future works for designing ideal artificial feature splits are reported. Index Terms—co-training, feature splits, dependency, semi-supervised learning.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{deriving}} a dynamical lower bound on Ω from diverging flows in low-density regions, {{based on the fact}} that large outflows are not expected in a low-Ω universe. The velocities are assumed to be <b>induced</b> by gravity <b>from</b> <b>small</b> initial fluctuations, but no assumptions are made regarding their exact Gaussian nature, galaxy biasing, or Λ. The derivatives of a diverging velocity field infer a nonlinear approximation to the mass density, which is an overestimate when the true value of Ω is assumed. This inferred density can become ridiculously negative when the assumed Ω is too low, thus bounding Ω. Observed radial peculiar velocities of galaxies allow the procedure to recover the required velocity field, Gaussian smoothed at 1200. The density and the associated errors are then inferred for different values of Ω, searching for a void which shows negative inferred density with high confidence. A preliminary application to data in a southern void indicates that Ω≤ 0. 3 can be ruled out at the 2. 4 -sigma level. A detailed study of possible systematic errors is under way.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to 1) determine the effects of livestock grazing and periods of rest from grazing on infiltration and erosion rates of unchained woodland; chained, debris-in-place; and chained, debris-windrowed pinyon-juniper sites; and 2) utilize these measurements in developing guidelines for grazing management of pinyonjuniper rangelands that protect or improve the hydrologic condition of the watershed. The study was conducted on sandy loam soils in southeastern Utah during the summers of 1971 and 1972. Runoff and erosion were artificially <b>induced</b> <b>from</b> <b>small</b> plots by simulating rainfall with the Rocky Mountain infiltrometer. Infiltration rates, erosion rates, and selected vegetative and edaphic parameters were measured on each plot. Forage removal by clipping and soil compaction subtreatments were applied to randomly selected plots in an effort to simulate the forage removal and trampling activities of livestock. Analysis of variance techniques were used to determine the effect on infiltration and erosion rates of forage removal and soil compaction subtreatment, grazing and varying periods of rest from grazing, and chaining treatments with similar grazing histories. Multiple regression techniques were used to evaluate the influence of vegetative and edaphic factors on infiltration and erosion. Forage removal and soil compaction subtreatments had no consistent effect on infiltration rates. However, the clipping and compaction subtreatments were an instantaneous application of forage removal and soil pressure and thus may not adequately represent long term, accumulative conditions imposed by actual grazing. Areas rested from livestock grazing since 1967 had significantly higher infiltration rates than grazed areas on unchained woodland and chained, debris-in-place sites. Grazed plots consistently had the lowest infiltration rates although this lower rate was not significantly different from infiltration rates measured on areas protected from grazing since 1969 or 1971. Grazing did not consistently affect infiltration measured on chained, debris-windrowed sites. Infiltration rates increased on all three vegetative conditions as the period of rest from grazing increased. None of the 21 soil and vegetative variables included in this study were identified by multiple regression models as consistently explaining significant amounts of variation in infiltration rates. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the primary value of multiple regression models is not to predict changes that will occur in infiltration because one management alternative is selected over another, but to help explain significant differences measured between treatments. Erosion rates were not significantly affected by forage removal subtreatments, but a trend indicates that erosion increases on plots when above ground vegetation is removed by clipping. No consistent relationship between -erosion rates and soil compaction subtreatments was found. A trend toward increased erosion rates on grazed areas was found. No consistent relationship between erosion rates and the various periods of rest from grazing was recorded. Thus, any rest from grazing appears to reduce the erosion potential from pinyonjuniper sites. In summary, pinyon-juniper rangelands can be improved for livestock by chaining and seeding without causing a deterioration in watershed condition. However, to achieve these objectives, the sites to be treated must be carefully evaluated and the appropriate chaining, plant debris disposal, and seeding techniques identified. And following vegetative conversion, the areas must be properly grazed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—When {{stimulated by}} a {{periodic}} stimulus, every com-ponent of a possibly nonlinear periodicity preservation system os-cillates periodically {{with the same}} period as the stimulus. Changes in the harmonic structure of the the stimulus couples each input harmonic to, in general, every response harmonic. Knowledge of harmonic coupling weights (HCWs) allows model free character-ization of effects of all small stimulus perturbation. This paper develops foundational methodology for experimentally measuring the HCWs. The on-frequency method uses <b>small</b> <b>tickle</b> tones at harmonic frequencies to do this. The off-frequency method places tickle tones adjacent to harmonic frequencies and is applicable to PP systems that are locally frequency invariant. Memoryless non-linear PP systems are an example where the approach works ex-actly. The off-frequency method also requires fewer experiments. In some cases, the off-frequency method can be extended to mea-sure numerous HCWs in a single experiment. Some system types such as the memoryless nonlinearity, require fewer experiments than general PP systems. Methods to experimentally measure the Hessian are also presented.

It {{represents}} {{the velocity of}} large datasets, {{which is one of}} the four aspects of Big Data, the other three being volume, variety and veracity. As data streams in, models are constructed using data mining techniques tailored towards continuous and fast model update. The Hoeffding Inequality has been among the most successful approaches in learning theory for data streams. In this context, it is typically used to provide a statistical bound for the number of examples needed in each step of an incremental learning process. It has been applied to both classification and clustering problems. Despite the success of the Hoeffding Tree classifier and other data stream mining methods, such models fall short of explaining how their results (i. e. classifications) are reached (black boxing). The expressiveness of decision models in data streams is an area of research that has attracted less attention, despite its paramount of practical importance. In this paper, we address this issue, adopting Hoeffding Inequality as an upper bound to build decision rules which can help decision makers with informed predictions (white boxing). We termed our novel method Hoeffding Rules with respect to the use of the Hoeffding Inequality in the method, for estimating whether an <b>induced</b> rule <b>from</b> a <b>smaller</b> sample would be of the same quality as a rule <b>induced</b> <b>from</b> a larger sample.

40|$|A {{rainwater}} {{harvesting system}} on slopes using contour furrows with plastic-covered transverse ridges designed {{to be used in}} small rainfall dominated areas of the semiarid loess region of China has been tested from 2001 to 2004. The system consisted of constructing contour furrows on the loess slope at a distance of 5 m with plastic-covered transverse ridges built in the furrows between shrubs of Caragana korshinskii. There were three treatments in the study: (1) plastic-covered ridge with gravel-mulched furrows (T 1), (2) plastic-covered ridge with bare furrows (T 2), and (3) control (no ridge and no contour furrow) (T 3). The experimental results indicated that runoff from the natural loess slope was small and variable, and only produced from a few rainfall events with high intensity. Runoff efficiency averaged 13. 8, 4. 5, 1. 4, and 0. 4 % in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. However, the plastic-covered ridges accumulated runoff from most rainfall events, particularly from the light rains less than 5 mm. So the natural loess slope between the furrows and the plastic-covered ridges in the furrows can complement each other, i. e., the plastic-covered ridges <b>induce</b> runoff <b>from</b> <b>small</b> rainfall to the planted area, and the natural loess slope between the furrows concentrate runoff from heavy rainfall, thus improving rain use efficiency. The total runoff collected from both the natural loess slope and the plastic-covered ridges to the planted area in the furrows was 231, 143, 88, and 59 mm in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. Soil moisture storage in the 200 -cm deep soil layer was obviously higher for T 1 and T 2 than for T 3, and C. korshinskii showed a significant improvement in growth for the T 1 and T 2 treatments. Therefore the combination of contour furrows and plastic-covered ridges as {{rainwater harvesting system}} may have a great potential development in the small rainfall dominated arid regions of China. ...|$|R

Membrane {{capacitance}} measurements in combination with Ca 2 + uncaging offers a temporal resolution in the millisecond range and reveals that catecholamine release occurs in three distinct phases. Release of a readily releasable (RRP) and a slowly releasable (SRP) pool are followed by sustained release, due to maturation and release of vesicles which were not release-ready {{at the start of}} the stimulus. Trains of depolarizations, a more physiological stimulus, <b>induce</b> release <b>from</b> a <b>small</b> immediately releasable pool of vesicles residing adjacent to calcium channels, as well as from the RRP. The SRP is poorly activated by depolarization. A sequential model, in which non-releasable docked vesicles are primed to a slowly releasable state, and then further mature to the readily releasable state, has been proposed. The docked state, dependent on membrane proximity, requires SNAP- 25, synaptotagmin and syntaxin. The ablation or modification of SNAP- 25 and syntaxin, components of the SNARE complex, as well as of synaptotagmin, the calcium sensor, and modulators such complexins and Snapin alter the properties and/or magnitudes of different phases of release, and in particular can ablate the RRP.
