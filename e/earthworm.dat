5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It {{is much more}} common during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown intermediate host is an <b>earthworm</b> that only emerges when it rains. The worm was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and spicule (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and the texture of the eggs.|$|E

5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of <b>earthworm</b> (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves.

5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} invertebrates described from Puerto Rico include earthworms and {{cave dwelling}} animals. Eighteen native species of <b>earthworm</b> have been described, with 11 species {{belonging to the}} family Glossoscolecidae, 3 to the family Megascolecidae, and 4 to the family Exxidae. Seventy-eight invertebrate species are known to inhabit Puerto Rico's caves. Six of these species are restricted to the Antilles, 23 come from North America and 23 are endemic to Puerto Rico. Only two of the species are confirmed as troglobites, or restricted to caves. Forty-five percent of the species are predators while the remaining 55% are guano scavengers, detritivores and herbivores. It is believed that most of this fauna arrived at Puerto Rico in the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The M32 was {{considered}} inadequate for {{its role as}} an armored recovery vehicle, especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle insufficient flotation to wade through water and the horsepower of the engine was insufficient to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing.

5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an <b>earthworm</b> or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the leaf litter in a region. The leaf litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where <b>earthworm</b> populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial decomposition of the leaf litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices.|$|E

40|$|<b>Earthworms</b> {{native to}} the former mine site of Devon Great Consols (DGC), UK reside in soils highly {{contaminated}} with arsenic (As). These <b>earthworms</b> are considered to have developed a resistance to As toxicity. The mechanisms underlying this resistance however, remain unclear. In the present study, non-resistant, commercially sourced Lumbricus terrestris were exposed to a typical DGC soil in laboratory mesocosms. The <b>earthworms</b> bio-accumulated As from the soil and incurred DNA-damage levels significantly above those observed in the control mesocosm (assessed using the Comet assay). A dose response was observed between DNA damage (% tail DNA) and As concentration in soil (control, 98, 183, 236, 324 and 436 mgkg(- 1)). As-resistant <b>earthworms</b> (Lumbricus rubellus, Dendrodrilus rubidus and L. terrestris) collected from contaminated soils at DGC (203 to 9025 mgkg(- 1) As) had also bio-accumulated high levels of As from their host soils, yet demonstrated low levels of DNA damage compared with <b>earthworms</b> from uncontaminated sites. The results demonstrate that the As-contaminated soils at DGC are genotoxic to non-native <b>earthworms</b> and much less so to <b>earthworms</b> native to DGC, thus providing further evidence of an acquired resistance to As toxicity in the native <b>earthworms.</b> 973...|$|R

40|$|Effects of <b>earthworms</b> in {{combination}} with soil heterogeneity and other soil organisms (mycorrhiza, plant feeding nematodes) on plant and herbivore performance were investigated in greenhouse experiments. The aim of the studies {{was to understand the}} role of <b>earthworms</b> in terrestrial ecosystems concerning their effects on growth, competition and defensive chemistry of plants, and above-ground herbivore performance. The plant species investigated were a grass (Lolium perenne), a forb (Plantago lanceolata) and a legume (Trifolium repens) that differ among other things in root morphology and N acquisition. I hypothesized that effects of <b>earthworms</b> and litter distribution affect plant species differently and change plant competition. The grass litter was labelled with the stable isotope 15 N to follow the N flow from the litter to the plants. To understand why <b>earthworms</b> reduced the reproduction of aphids (Myzus persicae) on P. lanceolata, I analysed defensive compounds in P. lanceolata. Since other soil organisms also affect growth and competition of plants, interactions between <b>earthworms</b> and mycorrhiza or plant-feeding nematodes were investigated. As predicted, soil heterogeneity (i. e. litter distribution) and <b>earthworms</b> affected plant species differently. Because of its symbiosis with N fixing bacteria, T. repens was generally more independent of soil conditions than L. perenne and P. lanceolata. Shoot and root biomass of L. perenne and P. lanceolata were increased by <b>earthworms,</b> while growth of T. repens was not affected. <b>Earthworms</b> enhanced N uptake in all plant species. Litter concentrated in a patch enhanced mainly growth of L. perenne. When the plants were growing in interspecific competition, <b>earthworms</b> increased the competitive ability of L. perenne against T. repens, while the spatial distribution of litter had no effect on plant growth and competition. <b>Earthworms</b> reduced aphid reproduction on P. lanceolata, and affected the defensive chemistry of P. lanceolata. <b>Earthworms</b> increased the concentrations of N and phytosterols in the leaves, but the effect depended on the litter distribution. The concentration of phytosterols increased with increasing N concentration in the leaves. Litter concentrated in a patch led to an increase in the concentration of aucubin in the leaves. In another experiment, <b>earthworms</b> reduced the concentration of catalpol in P. lanceolata shoots. The effects of <b>earthworms</b> on plant defensive chemistry and herbivores depended on soil conditions. It has been assumed that <b>earthworms</b> affect the symbiosis between mycorrhiza and plants. However, no significant effects of <b>earthworms</b> on the symbiosis between mycorrhiza (Glomus intraradices) and P. lanceolata were found. <b>Earthworms</b> enhanced shoot biomass, while G. intraradices reduced root biomass of P. lanceolata. The mycorrhizal plants took up more P, but the N content in the leaves of mycorrhizal plants was lower compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. <b>Earthworms</b> and mycorrhiza combined accelerated the development of aphids (M. persicae), probably by increasing plant host quality for herbivores. Plant-feeding nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita) increased plant uptake of litter N. The low root infestation by M. incognita has probably enhanced root exudation that stimulated the microbial decomposition of the litter. The {{results of the present study}} document that <b>earthworms</b> affect growth, competition, defensive chemistry of plants, and above-ground herbivores. However, the effects depend on abiotic soil conditions such as soil heterogeneity and nutrient availability...|$|R
