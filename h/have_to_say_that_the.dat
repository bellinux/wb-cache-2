500|$|Preparation for All Hope Is Gone {{began in}} 2007. Drummer Joey Jordison explained, [...] "I've {{told them to}} demo {{whatever}} they can so we've got as much material to choose from as possible." [...] In February 2008, Slipknot entered the Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa with producer Dave Fortman. All Hope Is Gone is the band's first album written and recorded in their home state of Iowa. Bassist Paul Gray explained that the band decided to record in Iowa because {{there were too many}} distractions in Los Angeles, where production of their previous albums had taken place. The band also stated that being close to home was good for their mindset; vocalist Corey Taylor drove home every night to see his son. Unlike Slipknot's previous releases, the album's writing process involved all nine band members, who wrote over 30songs. Jordison commented, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band is at its peak; everyone—I mean everyone—is now completely involved in the writing process, and it's a beautiful thing." [...] Taylor felt the writing process had some problems, but also noted that the creation of every Slipknot album has had conflict and that the band has come to embrace it after realizing that the conflict helps to bring out their creativity. Taylor and guitarist Jim Root paired up with Sid Wilson, performing on keyboards, and percussionist Shawn Crahan to work on [...] "oblique, arty pieces". Taylor also experimented with tracking in an old well, stating, [...] "There was this natural reverb to it that was just intense." [...] According to Crahan none of the experimental tracks made it onto the album. However, one of them, [...] "Til We Die", appears as a bonus track on the album's special edition along with [...] "Child Of Burning Time" [...] and the similarly experimental Bloodstone Mix of [...] "Vermillion Pt. 2". The track [...] "Sulfur" [...] was the first combined effort of Jordison and Root, who wrote the song in one evening.|$|E
2500|$|Jazani {{would explain}} that a revolutionary status {{does not exist}} in the country and in {{addition}} to that a revolution does not result from armed struggle rather it comes about as a development of a political, social, economical, and ideological process. A military uprising should be staged at the time of- and not before the revolution, as it does not cause a revolution by itself. In his opinion, those who are for a military uprising are similar to the Shah who is blocking a peaceful means of struggle. Because of this without talking about Ahmadzadeh, Jazani writes [...] "When we hear that revolution begins with a military uprising, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> believers of this train of thought do not know two things: one the current situation of military uprising and second revolution in general and the revolution we want is a specific one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zakaria {{initially}} {{supported the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. He {{said at the}} time, [...] "The place is so dysfunctional ... any stirring of the pot is good. America's involvement {{in the region is}} for the good." [...] He argued for a United Nations–sanctioned operation with a much larger force—approximately 400,000 troops—than was actually employed by the administration of President George W. Bush. However, he soon became a critic. In addition to objecting to the war plan, he frequently criticized the way the Bush administration was running the occupation of Iraq. He argued against the disbanding of the army and bureaucracy yet supported the de-Baathification programs. He continued to argue that a functioning democracy in Iraq would be a powerful new model for Arab politics but suggested that an honest accounting would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> costs of the invasion had been much higher than the benefits. He opposed the Iraq surge in March 2007, writing that it would work militarily but not politically, still leaving Iraq divided among its three communities. Instead he advocated that Washington push hard for a political settlement between the Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, and begin a reduction in forces to only 60,000 troops. He later wrote that the surge [...] "succeeded" [...] militarily but that it did not produce a political compact and that Iraq remains divided along sectarian lines, undermining its unity, democracy, and legacy.|$|E

60|$|So {{far as to}} {{the stock}} of the common people, as it {{consists}} in their persons. As to the other part, which consists in their earnings, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rates of wages are very greatly augmented almost through the kingdom. In the parish where I live it has been raised from seven to nine shillings in the week, for the same laborer, performing the same task, and no greater. Except something in the malt taxes and the duties upon sugars, I do not know any one tax imposed for very many years past which affects the laborer in any degree whatsoever; while, on the other hand, the tax upon houses not having more than seven windows (that is, upon cottages) was repealed the very year before the commencement of the present war. On the whole, I am satisfied that the humblest class, and that class which touches the most nearly on the lowest, out {{of which it is}} continually emerging, and to which it is continually falling, receives far more from public impositions than it pays. That class receives two million sterling annually from the classes above it. It pays to no such amount towards any public contribution.|$|E
6000|$|De Amicis, {{who visited}} Cordova nearly forty-five years later, {{and in the}} heart of spring, brought letters which opened {{something}} of the intimate life of that apparently blanched and calcined skeleton. He meets young men and matches Italian verses with their Spanish; spends whole nights sitting in their cafes or walking their plazas, and comes away with his mouth full of the rapturous verses of an Arab poet: [...] "Adieu, Cordova! Would that my life were as long as Noah's, that I might live forever within thy walls! Would that I had the treasures of Pharaoh, to spend them upon wine and the beautiful women of Cordova, with tho gentle eyes that invite kisses!" [...] He allows that the lines may be [...] "a little too tropical for the taste of a European," [...] {{and it seems to me}} that there may be a golden mean between scolding and flattering which would give the truth about Cordova. I do not promise to strike it; our hotel still rankles in my heart; but I promise to try for it, though I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very moment we started for the famous mosque it began to rain, and rained throughout the forenoon, while we weltered from wonder to wonder through the town. We were indeed weltering in a closed carriage, which found its way not so badly through the alleys where two mules could not pass abreast. The lime-wash of the walls did not emit the white heat in which the other tourists have basked or baked; the houses looked wet and chill, and if they had those flowered and fountained patios which people talk of they had taken them in out of the rain.|$|E
