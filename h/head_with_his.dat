5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in a bout {{that lasted}} 15 minutes and 28 seconds between then-champion Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper. During the encounter, Daniels {{performed}} his signature backflip, the Best Moonsault Ever, on Skipper, which {{earned him a}} near-fall. Skipper later jumped {{off the top of}} the cage and bashed Daniels in the back of the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> forearm. This also gained Skipper a near-fall. Daniels went on to perform his signature maneuver, the Angel Wings, on Skipper, which forced him face-first into the mat and allowed him to gain the pinfall and to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|At {{the midway}} point the {{following}} season, Daniel {{was named to}} his second consecutive NHL All-Star Game in January 2012. He {{was one of four}} players representing the Canucks, including Henrik, Alexander Edler and Cody Hodgson. Chosen to Team Alfredsson in the All-Star Fantasy Draft, he recorded a goal and an assist in a 12–9 loss to Team Chara. Later in the season, Daniel sustained a concussion after receiving a hit from Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith during a game on 21 March 2012. With Daniel in the neutral zone and without possession of the puck, Keith hit him in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> elbow. After being helped off the ice by a trainer, Daniel remained in the game for a shift before leaving the contest entirely. Two days later, Keith was suspended five games for his hit by the League. Sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} regular season, Daniel finished 2011–12 with 30 goals and 67 points over 72 games, a drop off from his League-leading total from the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> teeth.|$|E

5|$|Milt Joyce, {{a county}} {{supervisor}} {{and owner of}} the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from the Oriental Saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.|$|E
5|$|Pugh {{started his}} career with First Division club Burnley where, at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and {{gradually}} {{worked his way up}} through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003. As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record, which led to him being named on the bench for two first-team matches in the League Cup, they decided to keep him on for a third year. As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club's reserve and youth team. This led to him to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football. He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th-minute substitute in a 3–1 defeat to Stevenage Borough. He converted a Simon Heslop cross during a match against Dagenham & Redbridge to score his first career goal, which helped Kidderminster to a 3–1 victory. Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on Soccer AMs showboating section.|$|E
5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Kurt Angle, who was {{accompanied}} by Karen Angle, fought Christian Cage. The duration of the match was eighteen minutes and forty-five seconds. Near the end, Angle performed his signature Angle Slam maneuver, resulting in a near-fall. Cage then performed his signature Unprettier maneuver, also resulting in a near-fall. Angle attempted his ankle lock submission maneuver which was countered by Cage {{into one of his}} own. Angle soon submitted to the hold, however the referee was distracted by the Karen. A.J. Styles ran down to the ring and pulled Karen away from the ring. Styles then hugged Cage, before springboarding off the top rope and bashing Cage {{in the back of the}} <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> forearm, effectively siding with The Angle Alliance. Angle then performed the Angle Slam to gain the victory and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the 2009–10 season, Booth {{sustained}} a concussion after being hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Mike Richards during a game on October 24, 2009. Skating up to the Flyers' blueline, Booth had shot the puck into the offensive zone when Richards hit him in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. Rendered unconscious, Booth was taken off the ice on a stretcher and brought to a Philadelphia hospital. In addition to his concussion, he sustained a cut above one eye that required stitches; he was released from hospital the next day. While Richards received a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for intent to injure, he was not suspended for the play. The decision not to further penalize Richards proved to be a highly contentious issue. Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton and defenceman Keith Ballard voiced their opinion that Richards' hit was directed at the head while knowing Booth was in a vulnerable position, warranting a suspension. The Flyers captain expressed concern for Booth's health both in the media and to Panthers Head Coach Peter DeBoer personally, but asserted that he was not intending to hurt him. Another concern was the timing of Richards' hit, as Booth had already released the puck. In response, NHL Vice President Bill Daly explained that the hit was not late enough to justify a suspension.|$|E

5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E
5|$|Having {{retired from}} top-tier football, Loxton soon broke into {{first-class}} cricket. He {{was selected for}} Victoria to make his debut in the match against Queensland in December 1946 because five players, including Miller, were playing in a Test match for Australia against England during their Test tour. The debutant scored 232 not out, sharing a Victorian record sixth-wicket partnership of 289 with Doug Ring, who made 145. When he had scored 183, Loxton hit himself on the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> bat in attempting a hook shot, but continued batting {{until the end of}} Victoria’s innings and then opened the bowling in Queensland’s innings. He took the first wicket before going off to hospital with concussion. Recovering in time to bowl in the second innings, he took 2 wickets for 40 runs (2/40) in an innings win. Loxton's 232 not out remains a record debut score in Australian first-class cricket. His debut performance was enough for him to keep his place when the Test players returned, and he scored 73 and took a total of 3/17 in the next match against arch-rivals New South Wales, which Victoria won by an innings. He compiled 87 in the next match against Queensland, and Victoria won {{all but one of the}} five Sheffield Shield matches in which he played—the only draw was washed out—to claim the title. The all-rounder finished the season atop Victoria's batting averages, with 429 runs at a batting average of 143.00. He also headed the bowling averages with 8 wickets at 14.00 runs apiece.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ensuing}} 1996–97 season began, Kariya {{was out of}} the lineup with a pulled {{abdominal}} muscle. After missing the first 11 games of the season, he returned to the lineup at the end of October 1996. Two weeks after his return, however, he was injured again after suffering a concussion during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 13, 1996, after opposing defenceman Mathieu Schneider hit Kariya in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> elbow. While the play was not penalized during the game, Schneider was suspended by the League following the contest. Kariya missed two games {{as a result of the}} hit. In the 13 games that he {{was out of the}} Ducks' lineup, the team won one game, lost ten and tied two. Later in the season, Kariya was voted in by fans to the West's starting lineup in the 1997 All-Star Game. Receiving 210,015 votes, he was second among Western Conference wingers to Brett Hull's 254,414. Joining him on the Western squad were Ducks teammates Selänne and Guy Hebert. During the Game, he scored one goal in an 11–7 loss to the East. Returning to club play with the Ducks, he scored the fastest goal to start a game in team history, eight seconds into a match against Colorado on March 9, 1997. The contest ended in a 2–2 tie. Kariya finished the season with 44 goals and 55 assists, one point short of reaching the 100-point mark for the second consecutive year. Limited to 69 games due to his injuries, he still ranked third in League point-scoring, behind Selänne and Pittsburgh Penguins captain Mario Lemieux. His +36 plus-minus rating and ten game-winning goals set Ducks records (the latter mark was tied by Selänne twice in 1997–98 and 2006–07, then broken by Corey Perry's 11 game-winning goals in 2010–11). Nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League's MVP, alongside Lemieux and Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hašek, Kariya finished as a runner-up to Hašek. Kariya did, however, win the Lady Byng Award after recording six penalty minutes during the season. In doing so, he became the third player in NHL history to win the award in consecutive years after Mike Bossy (1983 and 1984) and Wayne Gretzky (1991 and 1992). He was also named to the NHL First All-Star Team once more, an honour he shared with Selänne. His efforts helped the Ducks achieve a winning record (36 wins, 33 losses and 13 ties) and reach the playoffs for the first time in team history. Trailing three-games-to-two against the Phoenix Coyotes in the opening round of the 1997 playoffs, the Ducks faced elimination in Game 6 of the series. Kariya scored two goals in the contest, including the overtime-winner, leading the Ducks to a 3–2 win. In the ensuing Game 7, Anaheim won 3–0 to eliminate Phoenix. Facing the (eventual Stanley Cup champions) Detroit Red Wings in the second round, they were swept in four games. Of the four-game series, one went to overtime, one went to double overtime and one went to triple overtime. Playing 11 games in his first NHL playoff season, Kariya had seven goals and 13 points, which ranked first in team scoring.|$|E
