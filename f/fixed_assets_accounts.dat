The {{results show that}} the single-question proxies are too difficult for proprietors to answer, whereas the most complex profit measures generate many negative estimates. The best measure of profits, based on three questions, could be answered by all proprietors and it avoids recall problems associated with sales and expenses. Among the net worth proxies, all of the measures are positively correlated. Nonetheless, the proxy based on <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable, debt, and inventory, showed the highest correlation with the full measure of net worth.

The article offers a systematic analysis of factors determining the choice of tangible <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods that is based on research by Lithuanian and foreign scientists and hypotheses of the positive accounting theory. The research produced a theoretical result: it identified groups of factors that determine the choice of tangible <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods including a flow chart of the factor and accounting method interaction, which can be used to develop a profit increasing or profit decreasing accounting policy. The factors are broken down into factors of the internal and external environment. Financial and human factors are attributable to the internal environment factors, while economic and technological factors are regarded as factors of the external environment. It was found that the financial leverage and the firm value maximization are the key factors in the financial factor group as they affect the management determination to opt for profit increasing tangible <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> methods, while technological factors have an effect on profit decreasing tangible <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> <b>accounting</b> policy choice.
