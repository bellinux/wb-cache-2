Experiments are conducted {{at a variety of}} freestream and slot <b>jet</b> <b>velocities</b> for three different slot heights h. The airfoil’s lift characteristics compare favorably with data from a previous research study in a conventional closed-wall wind tunnel. A large aperture microphone array reveals low noise contamination in the UFAFF test section. Data from farfield microphones indicate both tonal and broadband noise sources. Vortex shedding from the rounded trailing edge occurs when jet momentum levels are insufficient to prevent flow separation. High frequency tonal noise is also identified due to vortex shedding, where fD/Ujet = 0. 21, from the D = 0. 28 mm thick slot lip. For large <b>jet</b> <b>velocities,</b> high frequency broadband slot jet noise is identified as the dominant noise source for fh/Ujet> 0. 1. <b>Jet</b> <b>velocity</b> amplitude and frequency non-dimensionalization collapse the high-frequency portion of the spectra reasonably well when freestream velocity is low or zero.

The model places particular emphasis on the contrarotating vortex pair associated with the jet, and predicts the flame length and shape based on entrainment of the oxidizer by the fuel jet.

An experimental system with hot-wire anemometer was setup to test the <b>jet</b> <b>velocity.</b> The frequency responses of time-averaged <b>jet</b> <b>velocity</b> were measured for both HCPCS diaphragms and plane membranes. The time-averaged velocity distributions were collected along the exit centerline. Experiments indicate that the HCPCS structure brings a promotion of vibration displacement distortion of diaphragm and stronger driving capability, and that the mean <b>jet</b> <b>velocities</b> synthesized from the optimal HCPCS PSJAs are higher than the optimal plane membrane one. Hilbert-Huang Transform was employed to analyze the instantaneous energy distribution characteristics of the jet. The analysis was done for signals along the centerline. The results show that HHT is an effective method for fluid field analysis...|$|R
40|$|Laser-jet-etching is a {{technique}} to cut and microstructure stainless steel in sulphuric and phosphoric acid where a laser induces a thermochemical wet etching reaction. Several dynamical regimes and bifurcations are observed by measurement of the electrochemical potential and the reflected laser light during the process. In dependency on the control parameters feed <b>velocity,</b> laser power, <b>jet</b> <b>velocity</b> and applied potential the reaction exhibits either a fix point or an oscillating behaviour. In the oscillating regime the kerfs show a periodic ripple structure. The electrochemical potential (active, passive) and the topology of the interface in the micrometer and nanometer scale are important order parameters. The formation of the ripples is caused by an interface instability and changes of the roughness in the nanometer range. Both {{give rise to a}} feedback of the reaction on the absorption of the laser and results in synchronous oscillations of the potential and the reflected laser...|$|R
