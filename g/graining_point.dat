40|$|Published in Proteomics 2007 7 : 3800 - 3808 at www. interscience. wiley. comBlack <b>point</b> {{of barley}} <b>grain</b> is a {{disorder}} characterised by a brown-black discolouration at the embryo {{end of the}} <b>grain.</b> Black <b>point</b> is undesirable to the malting industry and results in significant economic loss annually. To identify proteins associated with barley black point we utilised a proteomic approach with 2 -DE to compare proteins from whole grain samples of black <b>pointed</b> and healthy <b>grain.</b> From this comparison two condition-specific proteins were identified: a novel 75 kDa late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein and a barley grain peroxidase 1 (BP 1) that were specifically more abundant in healthy <b>grain</b> and black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain,</b> respectively. Although LEA protein was less abundant in black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain,</b> LEA gene expression was greater suggesting protein degradation had possibly occurred in black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain.</b> Similarly, the increase in BP 1 in black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain</b> could not be explained by gene expression. Western blot analysis also revealed that the identified LEA protein is biotinylated in vivo. The role {{that each of these}} proteins might have in black point development is discussed. Timothy J.

40|$|There are two {{components}} of quality in malting barley: {{the first is}} grain quality {{and the second is}} malt quality. To ensure that malt of the highest quality is produced during the time-limited malting process, the barley must be able to germinate vigorously and uniformly. It has been proposed that black point can affect the germination of barley grains. As a consequence, black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain</b> is routinely downgraded from malt quality to feed quality resulting in substantial losses to the grower. However limited research has been carried out to determine whether black <b>pointed</b> <b>grains</b> behave differently to clean grains during the malting process. Our research found that black point did not reduce germination energy of the <b>grain,</b> with black <b>pointed</b> <b>grains</b> able to germinate as readily as clean grains. This paper discusses germination energy, alphaamylase activity and microscopic investigation of the grain in relation to grain viability and black point, to determine the suitability of black <b>point</b> discoloured <b>grain</b> for use in malting.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{demonstrated that}} topologically stable magnetic skyrmions {{have the potential}} to provide new solutions for efficient low power, high density data processing and retrieval. Skyrmion diameters can be as small as a few atom spacings, suggesting applications for ultra-high density data encoding and it has also been observed that skyrmions can be easily manipulated using spin-polarised currents five orders of magnitude smaller than those required in conventional magneto-electronics. In this work, we show that nanoscale patterned thin film samples support a new class of stable incomplete and complete skyrmions without need of external fields or anisotropy. We demonstrate hysteretic behaviour of a single skyrmion in disk and square shaped nanostructures, and show that the skyrmion core reverses via Bloch point occurrence and propagation. The ever increasing need for data storage creates great challenges for the development of high-capacity storage devices that are cheap, fast, reliable, and robust.

5000|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{constituent}} grains of the formation were deposited in a near-shore environment, mainly in shallow water, and to a much lesser extent on the beach {{as determined by the}} nature of bedding from place to place. The surfaces of the quartz grains are almost universally “frosted” or abraded, indicating that they, at one time or another, occupied a subaerial environment. [...] Almost all of {{the constituent}} grains were determined to have originated in Canada, and were carried southward by currents along the eastern shore of the Paleozoic sea. This concept is supported by several lines of evidence: (1) the only plausible source of such a large volume of sand is in Canada at about 56° north latitude where Cambrian sandstone was exposed extensively in Ordovician time; (2) the base of the formation decreases in age from north to south as determined by marine fossils in subjacent beds; (3) the formation becomes finer grained from north to south apparently due to progressive abrasion of the grains along the way; and (4) the radiometric age of constituent zircon <b>grains</b> <b>points</b> to a northern source.|$|R
