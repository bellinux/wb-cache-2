5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

Schiff similarly had indicated that he would run regardless of the convention's results.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} she was retried in 1977, Acoli had already been convicted of {{shooting}} and murdering Foerster. The prosecution argued that Assata had fired the bullets that had wounded Harper, while the defense argued that the now deceased Zayd had fired them.

The bodies were taken to the morgue at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau, where they were kept for relatives to help identify them. Some of the bodies were badly burned in the crash.|$|E

She {{fought the}} disease, {{but it was}} found that she was also {{suffering}} from Bright's disease, which had weakened her, making it impossible to survive the attack. She was buried in accordance with the rites of the Jewish faith. Rosebery found this particularly hard to bear, and wrote to Queen Victoria of the pain he experienced when [...] "another creed steps in to claim the corpse."

Ms. Spears, in all prior circumstances, had indicated she had, but at the time she was going through this application she did answer 'no.' It had not been a full five years, but four years and eleven months since the surgery [...] and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> answered in the affirmative, our contention is that it makes no difference".|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Alexey Eremenko from AllMusic {{awarded the}} album three stars out of five. Eremenko was {{positive}} towards the album's [...] "meticulously arranged music, and multiple stylistic layers {{ensure that the}} record does not wear thin {{after the first few}} listens". However, he furthered stated, [...] "but although Rock'n'Roll Circus is a testament to veritable professional skills of Hamasaki and her producers and songwriters, its emotional power is questionable, to put it mildly." [...] Although criticizing the album's addition of J-pop music, its additional [...] "clichés", and labelling the ballads as the [...] "worst offenders on the album", he concluded, [...] "This is Hamasaki's eleventh album, and so song writing routine is to be expected, to a degree, but she {{would have been better off}} going all the way with the alt-rock gimmick instead of meekly complying with the already trite conventions of J-pop, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> created those herself." [...] Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express was mixed in his review. Although he commended Hamasaki's transition to rock music and her song writing, he said he became [...] "worried" [...] about the production and found it regressive in comparison to Next Level.|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2016, an {{anonymous}} woman sued Michael Jackson's Estate, MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, alleging {{she had been}} sexually-abused by Jackson when she was 12-15, from 1986-1989 in Jackson's Encino home, hotels, the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] set, the [...] "Moonwalker" [...] movie set, {{in the back of}} his limousine, his Neverland Ranch, and an apartment/condo he nicknamed [...] "The Hideout". She provided letters, love notes allegedly written by Jackson, multiple gifts apparently given by Jackson, a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an Album photo-shoot, checks given to her from 1990-1993 totaling $920,000 sent from Michael Jackson, MJJ Ventures, and MJJ Productions—coming directly from Jackson's back-accounts, and a 1993 Santa Barbara PD letter alleging that the Police Department concluded she [...] "knew all about Child Abuse" [...] to come in and speak to them, regarding their investigation. Her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotional/psychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with Jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in September 2016, and that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wanted to she could not possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone, told that she would get in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did, and that Jackson made her promise not to tell anyone. A lawyer for the Businesses dismissed the allegations saying, [...] "This is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of Michael Jackson more than seven years after Michael's death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred. We believe this claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit. It's also no coincidence that this woman is represented by the same attorneys involved in two other frivolous claims against the estate." ...|$|E

She was also quoted as saying, [...] "I wouldn't guess what's next on his agenda, but it's probably not peace and love." [...] When Conservative Party members called on her to apologize for these remarks she said that such comments [...] "are in the best traditions of free speech and independence of thought." [...] These comments came just hours after Paul Martin warned his MPs in a private caucus meeting not to make incendiary comments in the wake of the U.S. election.
