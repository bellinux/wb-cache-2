40|$|My {{research}} {{question in my}} dissertation was: "What is the relationship of civil association New Acropolis to the Czech civil society?" New Acropolis is the international organization which presents itself as a "philosophical school in the classic way" {{but it is not}} only about the Philosophy but also about the Religion and the "Higher cognition"(whatever it is). New Acropolis has been in the Czech republic registrated in 1990 as a civil association. Since then, New Acropolis constantly grows and expands its activities. Also in the Czech republic is presented as a "philosophical school in the classic way". Its main agency is organizing philosophical lectures and lot of courses. Members also hold some exhibitons, music concerts and others cultural actions. The czech branch profess the same doctrine like the foreign branches - with secred elements. So there is a question - <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> that an organization with religious items is registrated as a civil association? Also this problem I am thinking out. Dissertation is bringing a summary view of one of the many civil associations operating in the Czech Republic - called New Acropolis.

40|$|You {{are about}} to enter a new genre, that of {{scientific}} fables, by which I don’t mean science fiction, or false stories about science, but, on the contrary, true ways of understanding {{how difficult it is to}} figure out what animals are up to. ” -Bruno Latour, form the Foreword <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to urinate in front of animals? What does it mean when a monkey throws its feces at you? Do apes really know how to ape? Do animals form same-sex relations? Are they the new celebrities of the twenty-first century? This book poses twenty-six such questions that stretch our preconceived ideas about what animals do, what they think about, and what they want. In a delightful abecedarium of twenty-six chapters, Vinciane Despret argues that behaviors we identify as separating humans from animals do not actually properly belong to humans. She does so by exploring incredible and often funny adventures about animals and their involvements with researchers, farmers, zookeepers, handlers, and other human beings. Do animals have a sense of humor? In reading these stories it is evident that they do seem to take perverse pleasure in creating scenarios that unsettle even the greatest of experts, who in turn devise newer and riskier hypotheses that invariably lead them to conclude that animals are not nearly as dumb as previously thought. These deftly translated accounts oblige us, along the way, to engage in both ethology and philosophy. Combining serious scholarship with humor that will resonate with anyone, this book-with a foreword by noted French philosopher, anthropologist, and sociologist of science Bruno Latour-is a must not only for specialists but also for general readers, including dog owners, who will never look at their canine companions the same way again. © 2016 by the Regents of the University of Minnesota.

40|$|Transcription begins]:Sunday Dearest Judson, Right now you’re {{probably}} {{out with}} that WAC. Hope that you’re having a horrible time, honey. Isn’t that nice of me? Honey, I’m so happy and so in a daze. Golly, (that word again) but golly anyway! That seems to express so much. Anyone who tries to utter anything intelligent to me will be wasting their time. Honestly, I’m just walking around in a complete fog. After I left you today there wasn’t a train until five twenty five and I just sat in Grand Central looking at a wall 2 ̆ 6 not even knowing what I was doing. Can you imagine what we’ll be like after we’re married. We’ll probably drive people nuts. I’ll just sit and stare at you. Everyone will have to just ignore us because I probably won’t even realize they’re around. Oh, Steve must think I’m crazy. I was telling him how everything was all wrong between us (this was after that little talk we [or you] had {{in the place where}} we stopped to eat). Now when he hears about what happened after we left him, and he doesn’t know what you had told me before, he’s going to wonder. Have you told anyone yet? What happened to Tom this weekend? Was his willpower strong? Honey, you didn’t have a chance to say much. About getting married, I mean. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> with you if we have a double ring ceremony? I would like that, but would you? It doesn’t seem real to me. Is it really happening? Are you sure you mean it? There are so many things to get settled but I never can think of them when I’m with you. Mother is going to write you a letter sometime. She’s really crazy about you but so am I. Don’t know where this paper ever came from but there’s a whole box of it. Please write soon, darling. I miss you already. As soon as you got on that train I got so lonesome. What {{are we going to do}} next weekend? Anything special? We have to have a real long talk, o. k. ? We really should start out earlier and then maybe the time wouldn’t go so fast. I love you, honey—Lots of love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
