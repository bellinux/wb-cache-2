5|$|The locals saw Meiklejohn as an outsider. He was {{foreign to}} Madison in his politics, social life, and personality. Dean Sellery and President Frank's {{professional}} relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn {{due to his}} close association with Frank. Sellery {{had the support of}} the faculty, who were envious of the Experimental College advisers' arrangements for higher salaries. In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding. Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college. Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College {{in the first quarter of}} 1929, and Frank attempted to <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> in response. In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, a philosophy doctoral student at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy. Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment. A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college.|$|E
5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and <b>fire</b> <b>him,</b> as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract.

5|$|Months before Entre a Mi Mundo was {{scheduled}} to be released, Pérez was booked on charges for driving under the influence, assaulting police officers, resisting arrest, and initiating a high-speed chase with police.

After the band completed the recording sessions for Entre a Mi Mundo, several members of the band and their friends went to a hotel in San Antonio, Texas to celebrate. According to Pérez, he, along with several of his friends, trashed the hotel.

5|$|As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts {{predicted}} that the Philadelphia Eagles were a favorite to win the NFC East title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Washington Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in FedEx Field 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to Philadelphia. By Week 9, New York was 6–2 after beating the Patriots in Foxboro for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating Dallas to the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara {{that there were no}} plans to <b>fire</b> <b>him.</b> However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29-14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Dallas Cowboys in which the winner would win the NFC East. The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win the NFC East with a record of 9-7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak QB compared to his brother) put up some of the best stats of his career.|$|E
5|$|With The Legacy finally formed, Manu and Snuka {{still wanted}} revenge on Orton. Fearing {{they would try}} to {{convince}} Raw general manager Stephanie McMahon to <b>fire</b> <b>him,</b> Orton went to speak to her himself but their conversation ended in an argument. When Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father, made his return that night Orton maintained he was owed an apology. His brashness angered McMahon who responded by trying to fire Orton, but before he could finish his sentence Orton slapped McMahon and gave him a running punt which left him hospitalized in the storyline. During the 30-man Royal Rumble match that Sunday the group worked as a team, making them three of the last four contestants in the ring with Triple H as the other. Ultimately, in throwing out Rhodes and DiBiase, Triple H was distracted enough to allow Orton to throw him over the top rope and win the match. The next evening on Raw, The Legacy came to the ring accompanied by lawyers and doctors, with Orton explaining his outburst against McMahon was a result of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and threatened to sue the company and cancel WrestleMania XXV if he was fired, as winning the Rumble guaranteed him a championship match at WrestleMania. Instead he was booked for a no holds barred match with Vince's son, Shane, at No Way Out in February, which Orton won. The night after the event, they fought again until Orton punted Shane unconscious. Stephanie McMahon came to the ring to oversee her brother being carried away by the paramedics and shouted at Orton until he performed an RKO, his finishing move, to her.Triple H ran to the ring and chased away the group, standing over the body of Stephanie McMahon.The next week,Orton and The Legacy attacked Triple H.When Stephanie came out to stop The Legacy,Orton attacked and made out with her before hitting Triple H with a sledgehammer.|$|E
