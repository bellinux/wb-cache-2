(2006) A $9.5 million {{lawsuit was}} filed {{by a police}} officer, Constable Duane Simon, an 18-year veteran of the Toronto Police Service, alleging false imprisonment, abuse of public office, <b>injurious</b> <b>falsehoods,</b> negligent {{investigation}} and breach of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{after he had been}} arrested and charged with assault of a female Peel Regional Police Officer.|$|R

6000|$|I am {{not sure}} that I had the {{controversy}} with this correspondent that he seemed to suppose; but novels are now so fully accepted by every one pretending to cultivated taste and they really form the whole intellectual life of such immense numbers of people, without question of their influence, good or bad, upon the mind that it is refreshing to have them frankly denounced, and to be invited to revise one's ideas and feelings in regard to them. A little honesty, or a great deal of honesty, in this quest will do the novel, as we hope yet to have it, and as we have already begun to have it, no harm; and for my own part I will confess that I believe fiction in the past to have been largely injurious, as I believe the stage-play to be still almost wholly <b>injurious,</b> through its <b>falsehood,</b> its folly, its wantonness, and its aimlessness. It may be safely assumed that most of the novel-reading which people fancy an intellectual pastime is the emptiest dissipation, hardly more related to thought or the wholesome exercise of the mental faculties than opium-eating; in either case the brain is drugged, and left weaker and crazier for the debauch. If this may be called the negative result of the fiction habit, the positive injury that most novels work is by no means so easily to be measured in the case of young men whose character they help so much to form or deform, and the women of all ages whom they keep so much in ignorance of the world they misrepresent. Grown men have little harm from them, but in the other cases, which are the vast majority, they hurt because they are not true --not because they are malevolent, but because they are idle lies about human nature and the social fabric, which it behooves us to know and to understand, that we may deal justly with ourselves and with one another. One need not go so far as our correspondent, and trace to the fiction habit [...] "whatever is wild and visionary, whatever is untrue, whatever is injurious," [...] in one's life; bad as the fiction habit is it is probably not responsible for the whole sum of evil in its victims, and I believe that if the reader will use care in choosing from this fungus-growth with which the fields of literature teem every day, he may nourish himself as with the true mushroom, at no risk from the poisonous species.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} torts can {{be listed}} as passing off, <b>injurious</b> <b>falsehood</b> and trade libel (see also Food libel laws), conspiracy, inducement of breach of contract, tortious interference (such as interference with economic relations or unlawful interference with trade), and watching and besetting. These torts represent the common law's historical attempt {{to balance the}} need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers).|$|E

50|$|Uniform {{defamation}} {{law reform}} came {{into effect in}} Australia on 1 January 2006, severely restricting the right of corporations to sue for defamation (see eg Defamation Act 2005 (Vic), s 9). This makes defamation laws across states and territories similar. The only corporations excluded from the general ban are not-for-profit corporations or those with fewer than ten employees and not affiliated with another company. Corporations may, however, still sue for the tort of <b>injurious</b> <b>falsehood,</b> where {{the burden of proof}} is greater than for mere defamation, because the plaintiff must show that the defamation was made with malice and resulted in economic loss.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Clive Cussler filed {{a lawsuit}} against E. Lee Spence for unfair competition, <b>injurious</b> <b>falsehood,</b> civil conspiracy, and defamation. Spence filed a countersuit against Cussler in 2002 seeking damages, {{claiming}} that Cussler was engaging in unfair competition, tortious interference, and civil conspiracy by claiming Cussler had discovered the location of the wreck of the Hunley in 1995, when it had already been discovered by Spence in 1970 and that such claims by Cussler were damaging to Spences career, and had caused him damages in excess of $100,000. [...] Spences lawsuit was dismissed through summary judgment in 2007 on the legal theory that, under the Lanham Act, regardless of whether Cusslers claims were factual or not, Cussler had been making them for over three years before Spence brought his suit against Cussler and thus the suit was not filed within the statute of limitations. Cussler dropped his suit a year later, after the judge agreed that Spence could introduce evidence in support of his discovery claims as a truth defense against Cusslers claims against him.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a vast {{expansion}} of standardized testing and of related scoring errors. For example, in October 2005, the College Board mis-scored 5, 000 SAT exams. Most scores were too low by 50 to 100 points, but in some cases the deficiency was over 400 points. This is the first law review article to examine the issue of whether mis-scoring of standardized tests is actionable until traditional tort theories.

40|$|The {{defamation}} tort is {{the common}} law 2 ̆ 7 s established remedy for false speech that causes reputational and emotional injury. That tort is subject to intricate constitutional, legislative, and common law rules that have evolved over decades. The false light invasion of privacy tort also provides a potential cause of action in response to <b>injurious</b> <b>falsehood.</b> False light, however, has been subject to much less judicial and legislative scrutiny than defamation. As a result, courts often are uncertain about the proper limits on false light and, in some cases, have countenanced false light claims that would have failed if filed as defamation claims. Allowing such claims conflicts with two important legal principles: (1) the common law principle disfavoring novel causes of action that duplicate established torts, and (2) the constitutional rule of Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. These important legal principles require that courts reject false light claims that challenge defamatory speech but fail to meet defamation law 2 ̆ 7 s standards...|$|E
