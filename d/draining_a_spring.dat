40|$|Hydrogeomorphology of a zero-order subbasin in the Kamagatani Experimental basinwas examined. This subbasin is <b>drained</b> by <b>a</b> small <b>spring.</b> Topography and the topsoil ismuch {{different}} from those in other zero-order subbasins in this experimental basin. Trench cut and electrical prospecting revealed that the topsoil is essentially colluviumconsisting of angular boulder and clayey matrix. No stratification is recognized and nolateral flow of water exists in the topsoil. The topsoil is underlain by fractured bedrock andfurther by a zone of low electrical resistivity which suggests saturated zone. The spring isfed by the flow in a conduit which has been formed by the subsurface erosion at the bottomof the colluvial soil. Hydrological analysis of the discharge of the spring revealed that the spring is rechargedby the precipitation on one tenth of {{the area of the}} subbasin. It was suggested that thepercolation of rainwater through the colluvial soil recharges a Darcy flow on the surface ofthe bedrock or in the fissure within the bedrock, which is led to the spring. While other zero-order subbasins in the Kamagatani Experimental Basin are character-ized by surficial landslides and the throughflow along the interface between different soilhorizons, rarer occurrence of larger landslides is coupled with the lack of throughflow in thissubbasin. It can be said that two kinds of hydrogeomorphological systems are working inthis experimental basin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo better {{understand}} the role of groundwater-level changes on rock-slope deformation and damage, a carbonate rock slope (30 m x 30 m x 15 m) was extensively instrumented for mesoscale hydraulic and mechanical measurements during water-level changes. The slope is naturally <b>drained</b> by <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> that can be artificially closed or opened by a water gate. In this study, a 2 -h slope-dewatering experiment was analyzed. Changes in fluid pressure and deformation were simultaneously monitored, both at discontinuities and in the intact rock, using short-base extensometers and pressure gauges as well as tiltmeters fixed at the slope surface. Field data were analyzed with different coupled hydromechanical (HM) codes (ROCMAS, FLAC 3 D, and UDEC). Field data indicate that, in the faults, a 40 kPa pressure fall occurs in 2 min and induces a 0. 5 - 31 x 10 - 6 m normal closure. Pressure fall is slower in the bedding-planes, lasting 120 min, with no normal deformation. No pressure change or deformation is observed in the intact rock. The slope surface displays a complex tilt towards {{the interior of the}} slope, with magnitudes ranging from 0. 6 to 15 x 10 - 6 rad. Close agreement with model for both slope surface and internal measurements is obtained when a high variability in slope-element properties is introduced into the models, with normal stiffnesses of kn_faults = 10 - 3 x kn_bedding-planes and permeabilities of kh_faults = 103 x kh_bedding-planes. A nonlinear correlation between hydraulic and mechanical discontinuity properties is proposed and related to discontinuity damage. A parametric study shows that 90 % of slope deformation depends on HM effects in a few highly permeable and highly deformable discontinuities located in the basal, saturated part of the slope while the remaining 10 % is related to elasto-plastic deformations in the low-permeability discontinuities induced by complex stress/strain transfers from the high-permeability zones. The periodicity and magnitude of free water-surface movements cause 10 - 20 % variations in those local stress/strain accumulations related to the contrasting HM behavior for high- and low-permeability elements of the slope. Finally, surface-tilt monitoring coupled with internal localized pressure/deformation measurements appears to be a promising method for characterizing the HM properties and behavior of a slope, and for detecting its progressive destabilization...|$|R
