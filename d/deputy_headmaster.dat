25|$|The Headmaster of {{the college}} is Neville Beischer BEd (Hons), with Martin Haworth as the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Headmaster</b> and the Chair of Governors is Mr Colin Brierley MBE.

25|$|These masters {{are further}} {{recognised}} by {{the naming of}} the Buchanan Oval, Ben Jarvie Staff Common Room and Cortis Jones Lecture Theatre. Another long-serving master {{of the first half}} of the 20th Century was Colonel Albert Douglas Arthur (1889-1949). In 1951 the college library was housed in a new room and renamed the A.D. Arthur Memorial Library in his honour. The library moved into the Nesbitt Wing upon its completion and when it moved again into Prescott Hall an adjoining study room was named the A.D. Arthur Annex. Arthur's name has not been connected with the college library since the 1970s but his portrait in oils still hangs in the Ben Jarvie Common Room. In 2014, past masters Phil Davis OAM and Robert Buntine were honoured with rooms in the AJ Rae Resource and Library Centre being named after them. Davis is the college's third-longest serving master (1951–2000), after Cortis Jones and Jarvie, and Buntine was the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Headmaster</b> during the headship of Tony Rae.|$|E
25|$|Nkrumah's mother {{sent him}} to the {{elementary}} school run by a Catholic mission at Half Assini, where he proved an adept student. A German Roman Catholic priest by the name of George Fischer was said to have profoundly influenced his elementary school education. Although his mother, whose name was Elizabeth Nyanibah (1876/77–1979), later stated his year of birth was 1912, Nkrumah wrote that he was born on 18 September 1909, a Saturday. Nyanibah, who hailed from Nsuaem and belongs to the Agona family, was a fishmonger and petty trader when she married his father. After eight days of his birth, his father named him as Francis Nwia-Kofi after a relative but later his parents named him as Francis Kwame Ngolomah. He progressed through the ten-year elementary programme in eight years. By about 1925 he was a student-teacher in the school, and had been baptised into the Catholic faith. While at the school, he was noticed by the Reverend Alec Garden Fraser, principal of the Government Training College (soon to become Achimota School) in the Gold Coast's capital, Accra. Fraser arranged for Nkrumah to train as a teacher at his school. Here, Columbia-educated <b>deputy</b> <b>headmaster</b> Kwegyir Aggrey exposed him to the ideas of Marcus Garvey and W. E. B. Du Bois. Aggrey, Fraser, and others at Achimota taught that there should be close co-operation between the races in governing the Gold Coast, but Nkrumah, echoing Garvey, soon came to believe that only when the black race governed itself could there be harmony between the races.|$|E

The teachers reported that their stress levels had increased, a bad atmosphere in the classroom had been created, their expectations for students and teaching profession had decreased. Also, the teachers stated that they most frequently turned to guidance counselors, <b>deputy</b> <b>headmasters,</b> and headmasters for help.

The Independent commented: [...] "Chalk is in the idiom of sadistic farce: disaster begets catastrophe begets apocalypse, and they all engulf Slatt. There are inevitable echoes of other sitcom characters - a dash of Basil Fawlty's unquenchable apoplexy, a slice of Gordon Brittas's purblind monomania - but Slatt's entanglements are caused by his own cocktail of failings." [...] Nicola Walker commented that viewers sympathise with Slatt because he {{is in charge of}} a bunch of lunatics. Moffat told The Herald that Slatt was inspired by a real person: ...|$|E

To optimise professional training of school leaders the authors carried out a broad research which aim was to identify both significance of particular items of a school leader competence profile and school leaders’ needs and requirements derived from their current everyday practice.
