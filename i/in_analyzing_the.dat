5|$|Many music {{theorists have}} used Parsifal to explore {{difficulties}} <b>in</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> chromaticism of late 19th century music. Theorists such as David Lewin and Richard Cohn have explored {{the importance of}} certain pitches and harmonic progressions both in structuring and symbolizing the work. The unusual harmonic progressions in the leitmotifs which structure the piece, {{as well as the}} heavy chromaticism of act 2, make it a difficult work to parse musically.|$|E
5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved <b>in</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles {{as a source of}} recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-{{creation of}} the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. <b>In</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E

25|$|On the {{theoretical}} level, Bordiga developed {{an understanding of}} the Soviet Union as a capitalist society. Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy, in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, also focused on the agrarian sector. <b>In</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> agriculture of the Soviet Union, Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the kolkhoz and sovkhoz, one a cooperative farm and the other a wage-labor state farm. In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small, privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.|$|E

25|$|While {{the work}} was {{initially}} hailed as scientific work of distinction <b>in</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> Jewish population of the Soviet Union and distributed for educational purposes across the nation, it was met with hostility from the international community. The work was condemned across Europe and the United States, leading to protests in Scandinavia when General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev toured the region. Communists parties, within Europe and America, also attacked the work and called for the Soviet Government to withdraw its support for the work and it from circulation. Under intense international pressure, the Soviet Government withdrew its support, and destroyed all copies. As a result, Trofim Kichko fell out of favor with the Government. While the book was destroyed, similar works continued to be published and several years later Kichko - having returned to grace - published a second anti-Semitic work.|$|E
25|$|Knudtzon {{was shown}} {{definitively}} {{to have been}} correct when a large quantity of tablets written in the familiar Akkadian cuneiform script but in an unknown language was discovered by Hugo Winckler at the modern village of Boğazköy, the former site of Hattusa, {{the capital of the}} Hittite Empire. Based on a study of this extensive material, Bedřich Hrozný succeeded <b>in</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> language. He presented his argument that the language is Indo-European in a paper published in 1915 (Hrozný 1915), which was soon followed by a grammar of the language (Hrozný 1917). Hrozný's argument for the Indo-European affiliation of Hittite was thoroughly modern, though poorly substantiated. He focused on the striking similarities in idiosyncratic aspects of the morphology, unlikely to occur independently by chance and unlikely to be borrowed. These included the r/n alternation in some noun stems (the heteroclitics) and vocalic ablaut, both seen in the alternation in the word for water between nominative singular, wadar and genitive singular, wedenas. He also presented a set of regular sound correspondences. After a brief initial delay due to the disruption caused by the First World War, Hrozný's decipherment, tentative grammatical analysis, and demonstration of the Indo-European affiliation of Hittite were rapidly accepted and more broadly substantiated by contemporary scholars such as Edgar H. Sturtevant who authored the first scientifically acceptable Hittite grammar with a chrestomathy and a glossary. The most up-to-date grammar of the Hittite language is currently Hoffner and Melchert 2008.|$|E

500|$|The Wisconsin Supreme Court in State v. Sanapaw {{held that}} the treaty rights were {{terminated}} by Congress. <b>In</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>the</b> case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court first had {{to determine whether the}} tribe had hunting and fishing rights under treaties with the United States. It found that although the Wolf River Treaty did not specifically mention hunting and fishing rights, the term [...] "to be held as Indian lands are held" [...] was clear. Indians have always been able to hunt and fish on their own land, and if a term in a treaty with Indians is ambiguous, the Wisconsin Supreme Court found that it must be resolved in favor of the tribe. Since the tribe originally had hunting and fishing rights under the treaty, the Wisconsin Supreme Court then looked to determine whether Congress had removed those rights by enacting the Menominee Termination Act. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that Congress had used its plenary power to abrogate those rights.|$|E

The Court then found that the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] burden did not fairly allocate risk and that a higher burden would be practically and symbolically important. The Court found that while the State had an interest, a higher burden would have little impact on the ability for the State to achieve its goal. Following from this review, the Court held that [...] "the State [...] support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence." ...|$|E
