40|$|If we are {{to limit}} global warming to 2 °C, all sectors in all {{countries}} must reduce their emissions of GHGs to zero not later than 2060 – 2080. Zero-emission options have been less explored and are less developed in the <b>energy-intensive</b> basic materials <b>industries</b> than in other sectors. Current climate policies have not yet motivated major efforts to decarbonize this sector, {{and it has been}} largely protected from climate policy due to the perceived risks of carbon leakage and a focus on short-term reduction targets to 2020. We argue that the future global climate policy regime must develop along three interlinked and strategic lines to facilitate a deep decarbonization of <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> First, the principle of common but differentiated responsibility must be reinterpreted to allow for a dialogue on fairness and the right to development in relation to industry. Second, a greater focus on the development, deployment and transfer of technology in this sector is called for. Third, the potential conflicts between current free trade regimes and motivated industrial policies for deep decarbonization must be resolved. One way forward is to revisit the idea of sectoral approaches with a broader scope, including not only emission reductions, but recognizing the full complexity of low-carbon transitions in <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> A new approach could engage industrial stakeholders, support technology research, development and demonstration and facilitate deployment through reducing the risk for investors. The Paris Agreement allows the idea of sectoral approaches to be revisited in the interests of reaching our common climate goals.

40|$|Several propositions have {{recently}} been made to use border tax adjustments (BTAs) to address the loss of competitiveness induced by unilateral stringent domestic pollution control policies. This paper explores in a general equilibrium framework the sectoral and welfare implications of a unilateral domestic GHG control policy combined with a BTA scheme. Using the Canadian economy as an illustration, we assess {{the extent to which}} BTAs achieve their objectives and analyze the impacts of different methods of recycling the BTA proceeds to support domestic industries. Our simulation results suggest that imposing BTAs on the imports of non-fossil and energy-intensive products reduces or removes completely the negative competitiveness impacts that domestic industries suffer from. The use of the proceeds of the BTAs to support domestic <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> improves their competitiveness and, more importantly, in some cases, overprotects them, as it allows them to even increase their output in comparison to the benchmark without emissions control. Our results also shed light on the existence of heterogeneity in the composition of <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> as far as the recycling method of the BTA proceeds is concerned. <b>Energy-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> that are more oriented toward the domestic market are better off with the recycling of the BTA proceeds towards gross output than towards exports alone.

40|$|This paper explores in {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} framework the welfare and sectoral implications of an optimally designed system of border tax adjustments (BTA) on the imports of <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> Recently, several propositions {{have been made by}} policy makers and researchers to use BTA as a restrictive trade policy instrument to address the loss of competitiveness induced by unilateral stringent domestic pollution control policies. In this paper, we define the loss of competitiveness not as a loss of output by domestic energy-intensive producers, but instead as a loss of their market shares. We argue and we show using the Canadian economy as illustration that the most often proposed BTA, which is based on the carbon embodiment of the import good, may under- or over-achieve the objective of addressing the competitive disadvantage of domestic <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> In some cases, the proposed BTA may over protect the domestic <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> by providing implicit subsidies as they might even increase their production in the presence of carbon taxes. Similarly, the proposed BTA may fail to fully restore the competitiveness of domestic producers, vis-à-vis their foreign peers. We determine the optimal BTAs on imports that fully restore the competitiveness of domestic firms following unilateral stringent pollution control policies. The ‘optimal’ BTAs take into consideration the general equilibrium effects of the carbon tax and of the import charges on the prices of domestic goods. In most cases, the impact their impact on import prices is higher than in the previous case. As a consequence, they entail higher distortions on resource allocation in the economy and hence higher welfare cost to households.

40|$|The {{question}} of how different climate policies will influence carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions in the <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> is complex. It is not obvious that increased costs for emitting CO 2 will lead to investments in new, low-emission technologies, since the <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> is very capital intensive, and reduced CO 2 emissions beyond a certain point require large investments and possibly also radical process changes. Traditionally, either top-down or bottom-up models {{have been used to}} analyze the influence of specific policies on energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions in industry. Bottom-up models describe technologies in detail, but are not realistic in their characterization of corporate decision-making, e. g., how businesses select technologies and make investments, and fail to depict macro-economic equilibrium feedbacks. Top-down models, in contrast, address these deficiencies by representing macro-economic feedbacks and by estimating parameters of technological change from observations of aggregate market responsiveness to cost changes. However, since top-down models lack technological detail, they are weak in assessing the use of new, low-emission technology. Because of these methodological differences, top-down and bottom-up models often make divergent cost predictions, and consequently suggest different policies, for meeting climate targets. This methodological divide has stimulated exploration of hybrid approaches that integrate the technological explicitness of bottom-up models with the micro-economic realism and macro-economic feedbacks of top-down models. To better understand the dynamics and policy responses of industry, such methods and models need to be further developed and applied. In this paper we analyse and compare top-down, bottom-up, and integrated (hybrid) approaches that have been used for evaluating potentials for CO 2 emissions reductions and CO 2 policy analysis in <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>industry.</b> We also evaluate the usefulness of these approaches and models to policy and decision makers...|$|E
