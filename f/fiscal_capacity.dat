Five of the counties are boroughs {{of the city of}} New York and do not have functioning county governments. While originally created as subdivisions of the state meant to carry out state functions, counties are now considered municipal corporations with the power and <b>fiscal</b> <b>capacity</b> to provide an array of local government services.

25|$|The levying {{of taxes}} aims to raise revenue to fund {{governing}} and/or to alter prices in order to affect demand. States and their functional equivalents throughout history have used money provided by taxation to carry out many functions. Some of these include expenditures on economic infrastructure (roads, public transportation, sanitation, legal systems, public safety, education, health-care systems), military, scientific research, culture and the arts, public works, distribution, data collection and dissemination, public insurance, and the operation of government itself. A government's ability to raise taxes is called its <b>fiscal</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

According to Kodinos, his court dress consisted of a long silk kabbadion, and a domed skaranikon hat covered in red velvet and topped by a small red tassel.|$|E

50|$|A {{horizontal}} {{fiscal imbalance}} (HFI) emerges when sub-national governments have different abilities {{to raise funds}} from their tax bases and to provide services. This creates differences in ‘net fiscal benefits’, which are a combination of levels of taxation and public services. It is these NFBs which are {{the main cause of}} horizontal fiscal disparities that in turn generate the need for equalization grants. Prominent among the objectives commonly attributed to intergovernmental fiscal transfers is ‘equalization’ of <b>fiscal</b> <b>capacities</b> or resolution of Horizontal Fiscal Imbalances.|$|R
50|$|Low <b>fiscal</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{typically}} {{a consequence of}} underdeveloped political, social and economic conditions in a state. First, as countries differ in their investments on the military, public education, infrastructure (etc.), different tax structures can reflect varying preferences for private versus public goods, and redistribution. Secondly, inefficient tax structure and weak <b>fiscal</b> <b>capacity</b> indicate the presence of tax evasion, a relationship that is further examined in the section below on the informal economy. Overall, favorable tax types are correlated to greater <b>fiscal</b> <b>capacity</b> because they impose fewer economic efficiency costs, but also encourage more efficient tax collection by minimizing tax evasion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{model of}} {{yardstick}} competition is presented where relative performance evaluation {{on the part}} of voters reduces the incentives for incumbents to divert resources away from public good provision to personal gain. Into this model, a horizontal inter-governmental transfer scheme is introduced where equalization entitlements depend on a noisy assessment of <b>fiscal</b> <b>capacities.</b> By reducing the informational content of the com-parison across jurisdictions, this system tilts the incumbent politician’s trade-off between current rents and the probability of winning the elections towards more rent diversion. Based on this effect, it is shown that the amount of rents taken in a symmetric Nash equilibrium increases in the intensity of the equalization system...|$|R
