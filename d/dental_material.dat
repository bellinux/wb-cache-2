5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative <b>dental</b> <b>material</b> underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
25|$|Wear {{facets of}} 3mm or more also {{were found on}} seven horse premolars in two sites of the Botai, Botai and Kozhai 1, dated about 3500–3000 BCE. The Botai culture premolars are the {{earliest}} reported multiple examples of this dental pathology in any archaeological site, and preceded any skeletal change indicators by 1,000 years. While wear facets more than 3mm deep were discovered on the lower second premolars of a single stallion from Dereivka in Ukraine, an Eneolithic settlement dated about 4000 BCE, <b>dental</b> <b>material</b> {{from one of the}} worn teeth later produced a radiocarbon date of 700–200 BCE, indicating that this stallion was actually deposited in a pit dug into the older Eneolithic site during the Iron Age.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether different computed tomography (CT) energy levels could supply additional information for the differentiation of <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> for forensic investigations. METHODS Nine different commonly used restorative <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> were investigated in this study. A total of 75 human third molars were filled with the restorative <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> and then scanned using the forensic reference phantom in singlesource mode. The mean Hounsfield unit values and standard deviations (SDs) of each material were calculated at 120, 80 and 140 kVp. RESULTS Most of the <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> could be differentiated at 120 kVp. We found that greater X-ray density of a material resulted in higher SDs and that the material volume could influence the measurements. CONCLUSION Differentiation of <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> in CT was possible in many cases using single-energy CT scans at 120 kVp. Because of the number of <b>dental</b> restorative <b>materials</b> available and scanner and scan parameter dependence, as well as the CT imaging artifacts, the identification (in contrast to differentiation) was problematic...|$|R

Key words: <b>dental</b> <b>materials,</b> contact hypersensitivity, diagnostic The diagnostic of contact hypersensitivity to <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> in Bulgaria was carrying out for many decades with allergens made from commercial products (2, 3). A certain difficulty in the diagnostic process was the wide variety of commercial products and the impossibility to prepare the diagnostic allergens opportunely (4, 5). A serious problem was the low concentration of some substances in the material, which was the cause of missing of such substances in the diagnostic allergen made on the base of commercial product (1, 4). It is a real cause to read false negative results in cases of sensibilization to those substances. We made a large study on the composition of <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> using monographs on dental biomaterials, information of data safety material sheets and correspondence with manufactures.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective A {{systematic}} review {{was conducted to}} analyze Brazilian scientific and technological production related to the <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> field over the past 50 years. Material and Methods This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (Prisma) statement. Searches were performed until December 2014 in six databases: MedLine (PubMed), Scopus, LILACS, IBECS, BBO, and the Cochrane Library. Additionally, the Brazilian patent database (INPI - Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industrial) was screened {{in order to get}} an overview of Brazilian technological development in the <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> field. Two reviewers independently analyzed the documents. Only studies and patents related to <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> were included in this review. Data regarding the <b>material</b> category, <b>dental</b> specialty, number of documents and patents, filiation countries, and the number of citations were tabulated and analyzed in Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, United States). Results A total of 115, 806 studies and 53 patents were related to <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> and were included in this review. Brazil had 8 % affiliation in studies related to <b>dental</b> <b>materials,</b> and the majority of the papers published were related to dental implants (1, 137 papers), synthetic resins (681 papers), dental cements (440 papers), dental alloys (392 papers) and dental adhesives (361 papers). The Brazilian technological development with patented <b>dental</b> <b>materials</b> was smaller than the scientific production. The most patented type of <b>material</b> was <b>dental</b> alloys (11 patents), followed by dental implants (8 patents) and composite resins (7 patents). Conclusions <b>Dental</b> <b>materials</b> science has had a substantial number of records, demonstrating an important presence in scientific and technological development of dentistry. In addition, it is important to approximate the relationship between academia and industry to expand the technological development in countries such as Brazil...|$|R

50|$|Dental Amalgam {{is widely}} used because of the ease of {{fabricating}} the plastic material into rigid direct fillings, completed in single appointment, with acceptable strength, hardness, corrosion, and toxicity properties. It is more forgiving of preparation and technique than composite resins used for that purpose. High copper dental amalgam is preferred over conventional dental amalgam as it has better corrosion resistance and less susceptible to creep. Amalgam is now mainly used for posterior teeth. Although the mercury in cured amalgam is not available as free mercury, concern of its toxicity has existed since the invention of amalgam as a <b>dental</b> <b>material.</b> It is banned or restricted in Norway, Sweden and Finland.
