[...] According to Murray, [...] "The serial killer stuff in 'Inner Child was fairly pat—with elements swiped wholesale from Thomas Harris and Michael Connelly—and the 'keep Lil’ O away from Eliot' operation {{struck me as}} a little sloppy, if not actively implausible. But the episode was fast paced and creepy, with a few good Walter lines (my favorite being a tie between 'Agent Dunham knows what a penis looks like' and 'obviously <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> toilet') and the return of his wonderfully ridiculous mad scientist device, 'the neural stimulator.'" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top bar of {{the corral}} fence and before me stood three saddled horses that would have gladdened any eye. I was waiting to take the young ladies on their usual morning ride.|$|E
60|$|About dusk {{one evening}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little gallery {{in front of}} the Hinkle parlor, waiting for Ileen to come, when I heard voices inside. She had come into the room with her father, and Old Man Hinkle began to talk to her. I had {{observed}} before that he was a shrewd man, and not unphilosophic.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a man}} 'ere 'arf an {{hour ago}} that {{reminded}} me of both of these faults.

60|$|Here {{follows a}} {{dialogue}} (but it requires imitation), which I had yesterday {{morning with a}} little boy of the house--landlord's son, I suppose--about Plorn's age. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the sofa writing, and find him sitting beside me.|$|R
60|$|Well, well! Dora and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{the sofa}} by and by, quiet enough, and Jip {{was lying in}} her lap, winking peacefully at me. It was off my mind. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in a state of}} perfect rapture. Dora and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> engaged.|$|R

There were many things I wished to turn over in my mind just then, but I had not long been in a state of reverie when I became conscious that Miss Thorn was standing beside me. I got to my feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank, conjuring up {{this scene}} to myself, when George remarked that when I was quite rested, perhaps I would not mind helping to wash up; and, thus {{recalled}} {{from the days}} of the glorious past to the prosaic present, with all its misery and sin, I slid down into the boat and cleaned out the frying-pan with a stick of wood and a tuft of grass, polishing it up finally with George’s wet shirt.|$|E

I was waiting for young Rectus, and had already waited some time; which {{surprised}} me, because Rectus was, as a general thing, a very prompt fellow, who seldom kept people waiting. But it was probably {{impossible for him to}} regulate his own movements this time, for his father and mother were coming with him, to see him off.|$|E
6000|$|When, {{a little}} later, R.C. came panting down stream <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank, all wet, with one knee skinned and I {{was holding his}} broken leader in my hands.

After his paroxysm had spent itself and he had become somewhat near a rational being once more he asked me: ...|$|E
6000|$|A chest, also {{singularly}} grained and streaked, of {{two large}} {{and two small}} drawers, held Parload's reserve of garments, and pegs on the door carried his two hats and completed this inventory of a [...] "bed-sitting-room" [...] as I knew it before the Change. But I had forgotten--there was also a chair with a [...] "squab" [...] that apologized inadequately for the defects of its cane seat. I forgot that for the moment because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chair on the occasion that best begins this story.|$|E

60|$|The morning {{had worn}} away in these inquiries, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step {{of an empty}} shop at a street corner, near the market-place, deliberating upon {{wandering}} towards those other places which had been mentioned, when a fly-driver, coming by with his carriage, dropped a horsecloth.

60|$|It is {{interesting}} to observe these first movements. Quite recently I met with a child of {{about the same age}} as the one just described, who exhibited herself to me in the very act of trying to climb out of the nest--trying to grasp something with her claws, so to speak, and pull herself up. She was and is a very beautiful child, full of life and fun and laughter, and came out to me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lawn to ask me for a story.|$|E
60|$|I tell you, madam, that box-seat was a queer box for me. I felt {{as though}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eaves of a roof with a herd of horses cavoorting under my feet. I never had a bird's-eye view of horses before. Looking down on their squirming bodies, with the coachman almost {{standing}} on his tiptoes driving them, was so different from Jone's buggy and our tall gray horse, which in general we look up to, that for a good while I {{paid no attention to}} anything but the danger of falling out on top of them. But having made sure that Jone was holding on to my dress from behind, I began to take an interest in the things around me.|$|E

60|$|I {{thought that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{ground on the}} outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, {{impossible}} for words to describe; when he stepped upon the ground with his feet I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to my apprehension {{as if it had been}} filled with flashes of fire.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the days}} which Susy is talking about, a perplexity fell to my lot one day. F. G. Whitmore was my {{business}} agent, {{and he brought}} me out from town in his buggy. We drove by the porte-cochère and toward the stable. Now this was a single road, and was like a spoon whose handle stretched from the gate to a great round flower-bed {{in the neighborhood of}} the stable. At the approach to the flower-bed the road divided and circumnavigated it, making a loop, which I have likened to the bowl of the spoon. As we neared the loop, I saw that Whitmore was laying his course to port, (<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> starboard side--the side the house was on), and was going to start around that spoon-bowl on that left-hand side. I said, ...|$|E

Now, if there is a subject on earth which infinitely bores me, that subject is woman's rights; {{and if there is a}} person on earth who can make it absolutely unendurable, that person is Miss Amelia Hogg. So I let her speak on placidly in her own interminable manner about the fortunes of the Bill--she always talks as though her own pet Bill were the only Bill now existing on this sublunary planet--and while I interposed an occasional [...] "Indeed" [...] or [...] "Quite so" [...] for form's sake, I gave myself up in reality to digesting the conversation of two intelligent people who sat back to back with us on the other side of the round ottoman.|$|E
5000|$|At {{one point}} during the 1980s, Capo {{attended}} school to become a certified Asbestos abatement worker. However, Capo later testified that he slept during class and allowed the school's operator {{to take the test}} for him. When questioned by a federal prosecutor about his knowledge of asbestos removal, Capo replied, [...] "I wouldn't know asbestos if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] Sometime in the late 1980s, law enforcement listed Capo as a soldier in the DeCavalcante family.|$|R
