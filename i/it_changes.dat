5|$|Electrons are {{identical}} particles because they cannot {{be distinguished from}} each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons {{must be able to}} swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, , where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.|$|E

5|$|Prions are {{proteins}} {{of particular}} amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein {{with the same}} amino acid sequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the prion folding <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> function. In turn it can convey information into new cells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the alternate prion form. In some types of prion in fungi this change is continuous and direct; the information flow is Protein→Protein.|$|E
5|$|Snow science {{addresses}} how snow forms, its distribution, {{and processes}} affecting how snowpacks change over time.

The study includes physical properties of the material as <b>it</b> <b>changes,</b> bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> state very readily. For example, the α form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable β (beta) form at slightly higher temperatures. The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E
