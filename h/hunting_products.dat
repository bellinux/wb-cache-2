The Shaman would gulp great {{quantities}} of Tobacco thus producing a sort of trance state; he would then blow smoke on the sick person while performing a massage to make a bad spirit or an object leave the body. If several related people died from disease, a shaman would typically be accused of performing sorcery and was sometimes assassinated by the kin of the deceased relatives. Shamans were also called in to give the Spirit to a child about to be born; the shaman actually dreamed-in the spirit while in trance state.

50|$|Late in the war, the {{collapse}} of the Imperial Russian government had a severe impact on Remington finances. Russia had ordered enormous quantities of arms and ammunition, but ran short of money to pay for the orders. They delayed payment, pointing to alleged defects in Remington products. When the Bolsheviks took power in the Russian Revolution, they repudiated the contract entirely. Remington was left with huge stocks of guns and ammunition, and no prospects for payment. The U.S. government stepped up to purchase the firearms thereby preventing Remington from absolute loss. Noting the explosive growth of business {{at the beginning of the}} war, and the precipitous decline at the end of the war, Remington made the conscious decision to promote and emphasize their line of sporting products. They viewed <b>hunting</b> <b>products</b> as a more stable business which might help them to survive future ups and downs.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the opening}} {{up of the}} Kalahari by David Livingstone in 1849, a large hunting-trading boom arose that lasted into the late 1870s. This trade was {{controlled}} by the Bakwena, Bangwato, Bangwaketse, and Batawana, who were {{all part of a}} loose alliance. All four of these Tswana-speaking groups organized private and regimental hunting groups using horses and guns, in addition to using the unfree labor or desert-dwellers who they subjugated or otherwise forced to pay annual tribute in the form of <b>hunting</b> <b>products.</b> The young Khama was at the forefront of this transition to global commerce, and as a young man owned considerable numbers of horses, guns, and ox-wagons. He was well-travelled and spoke fluent Dutch, the lingua franca of the period. By all accounts he was popular with visiting hunters (who came from South Africa and across the globe), who needed permission to travel and hunt on Ngwato territory. Although he was often portrayed by his missionary patrons as being primarily motivated by religious concerns, Khama {{was at the center of}} not only reshaping the Ngwato economy, but also of extending its power over a host of subject peoples.|$|E

40|$|For a {{long time}} the {{subsistence}} of Canadian Inuits, or Eskimos, depended {{on the cost of}} <b>hunting</b> <b>products,</b> of fur, in particular. The migratory lifestyle kept their households free of any excess objects, which is why their original artistic self-expression was limited to decorating objects of utility, including the series of pictures used at storytelling. After WWII the Canadian government launched a pilot project to support the population of Hudson Bay, in the course of which James A. Houston (born in 1921) was commissioned to create models of miniature plastic art, which could be used by the local population to produce miniature steatite figures. This form of Inuit folk art, which emerged only sixty years ago, has by now produced a number of artists with an interesting signature, like minimalist Lucy Tasseor from Keewatin, Joanassie (Joanassie Manning) from Cape Dorset and Peter Sevogat from Baker Lake.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the issue of barter trade in the North Western Siberia by the local peoples who used {{different}} fishing and <b>hunting</b> <b>products</b> such as fish and animal fur by way of cash equivalent up to the end of 19 th century. Particularly, squirrel fur was a most popular hunting product used as money equivalent in trade in the 19 th century. The author notes that due to the spread of the Russian population and development of railways {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century the situation gradually changed. As a result, by the beginning of the 20 th century natural barter was completely replaced by monetized trade with the use of bills and coins. The article describes a system of notes used by the local indigenous population to record the sums of money in trade, such as solar signs (hundreds), squares (tens), x-shaped crosses (units), vertical lines (hundredth parts of the main value). The article also indicates that during the Civil War and the transition to the NEP (New Economic Policy) an abrupt rise in prices for fishing products occurred, with the following revival of barter, when squirrel fur and fish regained their roles as cost units and universal money equivalents. ...|$|E
40|$|The core of South Africa tourism {{industry}} {{is based on}} wildlife tourism.  Private game reserves and game farms which forms part of wildlife tourism constitute most of the wildlife products in South Africa.  On these private reserves and game farms, hunting {{is one of the}} major income generators for product owners.  The aim of this study is to analyse the economic impact of hunting on the regional economies of three of South Africa’s most important hunting provinces. The study used economic multipliers, input-output analysis, and related modelling processes through input-output (supply-use) tables and social accounting matrices (SAM). The results differed significantly for the three provinces, with Limpopo receiving the biggest impact (R 2. 6 billion) and the Free State having the highest multiplier (2. 08). The geographical location of the game farms, the number of farms per province and the species available all influenced the magnitude of the economic impact of hunters over and above the traditional determinants of economic impact analysis. The implication of the research is that it will help product owners in the development of game farms or <b>hunting</b> <b>products,</b> contribute to policy formulation, especially for government decisions on what products to offer where, and how to create more jobs...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the funerary bone assemblages of Cerny then Rubané led to perceive a votive valuation of hunting, presents only as sign {{at the end of}} Rubané and more explicit in Cerny. The objects related to hunting, weapons and artifacts made from the bones of wild animals, could form attributes which materialize the identity of a social group. So, a durable social institution appears to manifest itself in the background of the use of a funerary code composed by attributes related with hunting. In Cerny, some assemblages are elaborated according to a treelike contruction. The material is a succession of symbols which makes sense. It is distributed by differential portion according to every grave. So, the "hunter" appears as a votive status meant by specific functional attributes. Inside the hunter's votive status, and according to the number and {{to the quality of the}} attributes, individual statutes could be differentiated. At least, all the individuals are not “ hunters ”. Is there a correspondence between institution, votive statutes and a practical reality ? According to the data of the fauna of the RRBP, the existence of a social order which governs the place of the hunting in settlements seems credible. The votive institution has so an echo in the daily; the use of the attributes related to hunting in the funeral is in correspondence with a concrete social phenomenon, even if it emphasizes hunting. The ostentation is however given by transfer at a moment in the chronology where the practice of hunting loses of its material and social importance : from the extreme end of Rubané. The ostentatious recycling in the abstraction of a material and social practice finishes showing that, even practical or votive, hunting possesses a strong symbolic charge and a power of social differentiation. This continues within the Neolithic time. An essential point, concerning the ideology, was also clarified. If the hunting or its symbolism corresponds to the expression of a social institution, the symbols which represent this institution recovers from a variable charge and from an ideology. So, the stage setting of the attributes connected to hunting differs rather considerably according to periods and cultures. Whereas in Rubané, a demonstration of a specific social and cultural identity could be implemented through the use of <b>hunting</b> <b>products,</b> an apology of war would be expressed in Cerny. In Michelsberg and in Chasséen, the weakness of the documentation does not allow to pronounce, but while the institution seems to continue, the ideological charge of the symbols is probably still different. L'analyse du mobilier osseux funéraire du Cerny, puis du Rubané, a conduit à percevoir une valorisation votive de la chasse, présente seulement comme signe à la fin du Rubané et plus explicite dans le Cerny. Armes et objets funéraires fabriqués à partir des ossements d'animaux sauvages, pourraient tre des attributs chargés de matérialiser l'identité d'un groupe social et de différencier des personnnes selon différents statuts sociaux individuels. Aussi, pourrait-on voir, à l'arrire-plan de l'emploi d'un code composé d'attributs issus de produits de la chasse et d'armes, une institution sociale d'un type bien particulier se manifester. Cette institution qui pourrait traverser les étapes chronologiques, pourrait aussi tre investie d'une charge idéologique changeante en fonction des cultures qui l'emploient...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} on product {{development}} and positioning in the hunting {{industry in the}} Eastern Cape, two conceptual frameworks were developed, based on a literature study. These positioning and product development concepts were tested against primary and secondary information gathered about the hunting industry. The game and hunting industries were in a strong growth phase {{at the time of}} this study. These industries are playing an increasingly important role in the economy of the Eastern Cape, and more and more agricultural land is utilised for game ranching. From the perspective of obtaining a competitive advantage in an increasingly competitive environment, it is therefore important for hunting providers to develop suitable products, and to position these products correctly. It is also important to investigate the characteristics of the game and hunting industries in the Eastern Cape and to get information about the characteristics of the market in which product development and positioning take place. Hunting is the most important form of game utilisation in the Eastern Cape, followed by cropping of game and live game sales. At the time of this study, the total value of the game utilised annually in the Eastern Cape was in excess of R 168 million. Game utilisation seemed to be taking place on a sustainable basis, as the number of animals utilised annually was less than the annual production. Kudu and springbok provide the biggest total income, and, together with mountain reedbuck, are the most abundant species in the Eastern Cape. The main game-producing areas in the Eastern Cape coincide with the areas where extensive beef, sheep and goat farming are practised. The <b>hunting</b> <b>products</b> on offer from hunting providers, differ in certain ways. Aspects like price, type of hunting provided, game species available for hunting, terrain where hunting takes place, and various other aspects in connection with the hunt, differ from hunting provider to hunting provider. Characteristics of the hunting experience that hunters desire may be divided into core and variable elements. The core elements include: · the conditions pertaining to the hunt being spelt out clearly; · the maintenance of safety standards; · reasonable day fees; · the presence of game in sufficient numbers; and · other aspects generally desired by hunters. In the study it was found that the needs of hunters also differ regarding certain aspects of the hunting experience. These variable elements include price levels, type and availability of accommodation, and the role of the hunting provider. The core aspects that hunters desire are as a rule part of the product offering. From a product development perspective, the variable elements provide an opportunity to customise products to hunter needs. The inclusion or exclusion of variable elements from the product offering give rise to certain unique product features, and therefore provide the opportunity for product differentiation. After development, products are positioned firstly by selecting a market segment to focus on. Secondly, the needs of hunters in the target segment should be clearly identified, followed by the development of suitable products based on hunter needs, and taking into account the features of competitive offerings. Decisions should also be taken about the features to be included in the product offering to achieve product differentiation. After development of a suitable product, an image or brand should be chosen for the product, and this image should be effectively communicated to the market. A number of possible positioning options were identified for hunting providers. It was found that factors like the physical features of the ranch, available infrastructure, the market segment chosen, desires of the hunting providers, and the perception of the needs of hunters, eventually influence decisions about product development and positioning. The final decisions on positioning should take the core competencies of the hunting provider into account and should ensure that the hunting provider has the ability to fill the chosen position in the market...|$|E
