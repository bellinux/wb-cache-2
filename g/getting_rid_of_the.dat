5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hated Apokaukos,. She, however, was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He mitigates {{the effects of the}} explosion, <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage the Golden Gate Bridge and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse, endangering lives.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Charles de Gaulle {{government}} {{cleaned up}} the French Penal Code, principally <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-Semitic laws. The article against homosexual relations between adults and minors, however, remained in force until 1982. The homophobic atmosphere of the 1940s-1960s meant that for the returning victims, the possibility of telling their story was thwarted by the fear of further stigmatisation. In his book, Seel also notes an increase of homophobic attacks in Mulhouse, after the war. In his family itself, Seel found a negative reaction to his homosexuality. His closest relatives decided to avoid broaching the subject while other members of the extended family made humiliating jokes. His godfather disinherited him.|$|E
25|$|The {{second step}} was to {{separate}} the plutonium from the uranium and the fission products. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added, producing bismuth phosphate, which was precipitated carrying the plutonium with it. This was {{very similar to the}} lanthanum fluoride process, in which lanthanum fluoride was used as the carrier. The precipitate was removed from the solution with a centrifuge and the liquid discharged as waste. <b>Getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fission products reduced the gamma radiation by 90 percent. The precipitate was a plutonium-containing cake which was placed in another tank and dissolved in nitric acid. Sodium bismuthate or potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium. Plutonium would be carried by the bismuth phosphate in the tetravalent state but not in the hexavalent state. The bismuth phosphate would then be precipitated as a by product, leaving the plutonium behind in solution.|$|E

25|$|Humans have {{introduced}} the mangrove monitor {{to a number}} of Pacific Islands since the 1930s. They have been present on Ifaluk in the western Caroline Islands since the Second World War. The Japanese introduced the lizards to the Marshall Islands prior to World War II to eliminate rats; the lizards flourished and soon began to raid the local chicken houses. When American troops arrived, the locals asked them for help in <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mangrove monitors. The US response was to introduce the marine toad (Bufo marinus) which proved toxic to the lizards. As the monitor population dropped, however, the rat population began to rise. Marine toads were introduced to the Palau Islands for a similar reason, and the demise of the mangrove monitors led to an increase in numbers of beetles known to be harmful to coconuts.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Mamluk slave {{soldiers}} {{became a}} very powerful landed aristocracy, {{to the point of}} <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a Mamluk dynasty. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as amirs. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a Mongol invasion in 1260 at the Battle of Ain Jalut. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of Medina and Mecca. Eventually the iqta system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their iqta as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of handguns and cannons.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{starting}} {{the construction of}} the Danube–Black Sea Canal seems to have been suggested to Romanian leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin during a visit to the Moscow Kremlin in 1948. Gheorghiu-Dej's chief of staff stated that Stalin indicated the canal as a means of <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rich peasants and of the enemies of the people and promised support to the authorities in identifying the people hostile to the regime and by providing construction equipment for the canal. He also stated that Gheorghiu-Dej was not convinced by Stalin's recommendations, suspecting that the canal was actually part of the Soviet Union's expansion strategy. It has since been found out, that Stalin's initiative was based on a secret study, commissioned in 1947-1948, which recommended building a soviet submarine base at the Port of Midia, which was suitable because of its proximity to the Bosphorus and because of the rocky foundation.|$|E

McSwain is caught accepting payoffs in an Internal Affairs sting, and Osborne has the burden of prosecuting him. With the assistance of fellow officers within the police force, the evidence is destroyed and suppressed. McSwain is cleared of the charges, at which point Anne, now clued in, is faced with the conflict of her personal feelings for Remy and her duty to uphold the law. It is later revealed that Jack Kellom (Ned Beatty), Remy's boss and the two detectives De Soto (John Goodman) and Dodge (Ebbe Roe Smith) are behind the murder, and a stash of heroin is hidden at a boat yard. Kellom goes to the boat and is confronted by De Soto and Dodge. Kellom suggests <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drugs, but De Soto shoots Kellom.

500|$|Antoinist beliefs combine some {{elements}} of Catholicism, reincarnation, and healing. In the Antoinist views, the man must reach consciousness by <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illusion of matter produced by his intelligence—the source of evil and suffering. The purpose of the life is to release oneself from the cycle of reincarnation through a moral progression aided by [...] "fluids"—all human actions, acquired by silent prayer and the harm caused by diseases and enemies. As freedom of conscience and free will are considered very important in Antoinist creed, the religion does not practice proselytism and is not exclusive. It does not provide any prescription on social issues. Although focused on healing, Antoinism does {{not interfere with the}} medical field, and does not discourage the resort to traditional medicine.|$|E
