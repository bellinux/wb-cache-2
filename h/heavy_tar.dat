At the same time, a temperature gradient is established in the reaction zone which will allow some of the vapor component of the decomposition (i. e. <b>heavier</b> <b>tars)</b> to condense on the solid component at cooler regions for subsequent reintroduction into the high temperature regions so that the latent carbon content of these tars may also be recovered.

The cost of the scrubber liquid represents a considerable part of the operating cost, which could be decreased by regenerating the spent scrubber liquid by separating it from ash residues and <b>heavy</b> <b>tars.</b> In this study, different types of spent scrubber liquids were regenerated using a centrifuge. The effect of centrifugation time (1. 5 – 10 min) and sample temperature (50 – 90 °C) on the separation efficiency was studied. Based on the results, the separation of tars from the scrubber liquids can be ranked as follows: diesel > RME > linoleic acid > linseed oil > rapeseed oil > motor oil. This ranking correlates to the viscosity of the different scrubber liquids, with the separation efficiency increasing with decreasing scrubber liquid viscosity.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{and reaction}} chemistry for the pyrolysis of Maplewood lignin were investigated using both a pyroprobe reactor and a thermogravimetric analyser mass spectrometry (TGA-MS). Lignin residue after enzymatic hydrolysis and organosolv lignin derived from Maplewood {{were used to}} measure the kinetic behaviours of lignin pyrolysis and to analyse pyrolysis product distributions. The enzymatic lignin residue pyrolyzed at lower temperature than that of organosolv lignin. The differential thermogravimetric (DTG) peaks for pyrolysis of the enzymatic residue were more similar to the DTG peaks for pyrolysis of the original Maplewood than DTG of the organosolv lignin. The condensable liquid volatile products were collected from a Pyroprobe reactor with a liquid nitrogen trap. The primary monomeric phenolic compounds were guaiacol, syringol, and vanillic acid. However, only 14 – 36 carbon% of the sample could be detected by GC-MS. Over 60 carbon% of the condensable products were <b>heavy</b> <b>tar</b> molecules that are not detectable by GC-MS. These <b>heavy</b> <b>tar</b> molecules are the primary products from pyrolysis of lignin. Intermediate solid samples were also collected at various pyrolysis temperatures and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, DP-MAS 13 C NMR, and TOC. The methoxy groups and ether linkages decreased and the non-protonated aromatic carbon–carbon bonds increased in the solid residues as the pyrolysis temperature increased. The carbon content of the initial lignin feed (derived from enzymatic hydrolysis) and the solid polyaromatics residue (obtained at 773 K) was 58 wt% and 74 wt% respectively. This polyaromatic residue contained about 69 wt% of the original lignin feed. The solid polyaromatics undergo further slow decomposition accompanied by a constant release of carbon dioxide as the pyrolysis reaction continues. The pyrolysis of the enzymatic lignin residue was modelled by two reactions in series. In the first pyrolysis step the lignin was decomposed with an apparent activation energy of 74 kJ mol− 1 and a heat of reaction of − 8, 780 kJ kg− 1.

Here we present results of gasification, using an adiabatic bed gasifier with air, steam as gasification medium, of mesquite and juniper. From Thermo-gravimetric analyses the pre-exponential factor (B) and activation energy of fuels for pyrolysis were obtained using single reaction models (SRM) and parallel reaction model (PRM). The single reaction model including convention Arrhenius (SRM-CA) and maximum volatile release rate model (SRM-MVR). The parallel reaction model fits the experimental data very well, followed by MVR. The CA model the least accurate model. The activation energies obtained from PRM are around 161, 000 kJ/kmol and 158, 000 kJ/kmol for juniper and mesquite fuels, respectively. And, the activation energies obtained from MVR are around 100, 000 kJ/kmol and 85, 000 kJ/kmol for juniper and mesquite fuels, respectively. The effects of equivalence ratio (ER), particle size, and moisture content on the temperature profile, gas composition, tar yield, and higher heating value (HHV) were investigated. For air gasification, when moisture increased from 6 % to 12 % and ER decreased from 4. 2 to 2. 7, the mole composition of the dry product gas for mesquite varied as follow: 18 - 30 % CO, 2 - 5 % H 2, 1 - 1. 5 % CH 4, 0. 4 - 0. 6 % C 2 H 6, 52 - 64 % N 2, and 10 - 12 % CO 2. The tar yield shows peak value (150 g/Nm^ 3) with change in moisture content between 6 - 24 %. The tar collected from the gasification process included light tar and <b>heavy</b> <b>tar.</b> The main composition of the light tar was moisture.

Both toluene and naphthalene were chosen as model compounds and tested separately with a simulated bio-syngas. Notably, the effect of naphthalene is almost negligible with pure H 2 feed to the SOFC, whereas a severe degradation is observed when using a bio-syngas with an H 2 :CO = 1. The tar compound showed to have a remarkable effect on the inhibition of the WGS shift-reaction, possibly also on the CO direct electro-oxidation at the three-phase-boundary. An interaction through adsorption of naphthalene on nickel catalytic and electrocatalytic active sites is a plausible explanation for observed degradation and strong performance loss. Different sites seem to be involved for H 2 and CO electro-oxidation and also with regard to catalytic water gas shift reaction. Finally, heavy tars (C ≥ 10) must be regarded as a poison more than a fuel for SOFC applications, contrarily to lighter compounds such benzene or toluene that can directly reformed within the anode electrode. The presence of naphthalene strongly increases the risk of anode re-oxidation in a syngas stream as CO conversion to H 2 is inhibited and also CH 4 conversion is blocked...|$|E

Steam and syngas, in comparison with N- 2, as the reaction atmosphere little affected the tar yield below 600 degrees C but significantly decreased it for the former and increased it for the latter at rather higher temperatures. The presence of H- 2 in the syngas increased tar yield significantly because it could suppress polymerization and condensation reactions through providing H as radical stabilizer and hydrogenation agent. In the steam-containing syngas atmosphere, the tar yield obtained from transport bed rapid pyrolysis increased rapidly with raising temperature to a peak value of 10. 5 wt. % (daf) at 600 degrees C, about 1. 1 wt. % higher than the Gray-King assay yield, and then decreased due to the excessive secondary reactions.

40|$|In {{fluidized-bed}} gasification (FBG) {{of biomass}} and waste {{the temperature is}} maintained relatively low to prevent agglomeration. This slows down carbon conversion in conventional FBG, and a gas with relatively high concentration of tar is generated. Then the gasification efficiency is reduced and utilization of the gas is difficult in applications where the gas is cooled or compressed. In the present work the conversion of char and tar is studied to identify the main factors hindering complete conversion of the fuel into a product gas that is free from tar. It is concluded that char conversion can be increased by solids recirculation in directly heated FBG (stand-alone units) or by burning the char in a separate chamber in indirectly heated FBG. However, the tar content of the gas remains high, making gas cleaning necessary. Downstream cleaning of gas by catalytic cracking and/or scrubbing is complex and/or expensive for small to medium gasification plants, so conversion of tar within the gasifier is preferred. The optimization of conventional directly heated FBG by use of in-bed catalyst and distribution of the gasification agent to various zones of the gasifier, although improving the process, {{is not sufficient to}} attain the gas purity required for cold gas applications.

Experiments {{have been carried out}} in a fluidized bed gasifier using steam as the fluidizing medium to improve hydrogen production. Bed materials consisting of CaO-based oxide for CO 2 sorption (CaO-Ca 12 Al 14 O 33) deposited on olivine for tar reduction were synthesized, their structural and textural properties were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) methods, and the determination of their sorption capacity and stability analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It appears that this CaO-Ca 12 Al 14 O 33 /olivine sorbent/catalyst presents a good CO 2 sorption stability (for seven cycles of carbonation/decarbonation). Compared to olivine and Fe/olivine in a fixed bed reactor for steam reforming of toluene chosen as tar model compound, it shows a better hydrogen production rate and a lower CO 2 selectivity due to its sorption on the CaO phase. In the biomass steam gasification, the use of CaO-Ca 12 Al 14 O 33 /olivine as bed material at 700 A degrees C leads to a higher H- 2 production than olivine at 800 A degrees C thanks to CO 2 sorption.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of biomass to {{synthetic natural gas}} (SNG) draws great interest in the world {{because it is a}} sustainable energy resource, where it can replace the fossil natural gas and reduce environmental problems. Common technologies for CH 4 production are based on the gasification of biomass at high temperature followed by CO and CO 2 methanation, but it is energetically costly and complex, requiring separate reforming stages due to the <b>heavy</b> <b>tar</b> production from the gasification process, and multiple cooling stages of the methanation due to the large exothermicity of this equilibrium driven reaction. Therefore, the main focus of this research was to attempt to address these issues by introducing the low temperature steam reforming (LTSR) process of bio-oil for CH 4 production via fast pyrolysis of biomass using palm empty fruit bunch (PEFB) as the biomass feedstock, a significant renewable waste of the palm oil industry, currently underexploited. One advantage of proposing the pyrolysis route vs. gasification, was the {{conversion of}} PEFB into bio-oil without generation of heavy tars, and at lower temperature than gasification due to the lower endothermicity of the chemical process favouring oil product rather than gas. Another advantage was the lower exothermicity of the subsequent methanation step by using bio-oil as feed rather than CO and CO 2. It was intended that bringing closer the enthalpy changes of the gasification by pyrolysis and of the methanation by feedstock substitution, would improve the efficiencies of heat transfers between the two. Chemical Equilibrium and Applications (CEA) program was used to analyse thermodynamic equilibrium for conversion PEFB bio-oil to CH 4 using LTSR process. It was found that CH 4 production was favoured in the 130 – 330 ºC range and at around molar steam to carbon ratio of 3 at atmospheric pressure. Using the optimum conditions observed from the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, the experimental feasibility of CH 4 production from acetic acid as single compound bio-oil surrogate via LTSR was performed at bench scale by using nickel-calcium aluminate (Ni/Ca-Al 2 O 3) catalyst in a packed bed reactor.

At the <b>heavier</b> (<b>tar)</b> end, the produced species range from benzene to coronene: In this work, {{a method for}} elucidating the pathways of tar evolution is, applied to previously presented measurements that satisfy the carbon, balance of the Chalmers 2 - 4 -MW DFB gasifier. In addition to quantifying the cold gas and tar, the measurements yield information regarding the amount and C, O, H composition of unknown condensable species (UCS). The reaction pathways were identified by means of fitting a model to the performed measurements. The employed solver varies freely the reaction rate coefficients of three global reactions (mimicking dissociation and reactions with hydrogen and steam) per modeled group, {{as well as the}} carbon distribution coefficients within a predefined reaction scheme. The mature tar (excluding primary tar) spectrum is divided into phenols, furans, benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and one-, two-, and three-ring aromatic components. In addition, UCS that are considered to contain primary tar are divided into four subgroups, to encompass two levels of reactivity with varying composition. Ultimately, the solver converges, yielding a reaction scheme that is based on the findings of earlier works and that describes the creation of mature tar from UCS. Furthermore, the importance of individual reaction routes is discerned for the pertinent measurements. Thus, it is demonstrated that the maturation of secondary tar species (e. g., toluene and phenol) is not in itself sufficient to describe the formation of the tar spectrum...|$|R
50|$|He {{originally}} {{focused on}} using lignite (brown coal) as a feedstock, but switched to using <b>heavy</b> liquid <b>tars</b> {{after moving to}} the United States in 1930. Although others had experimented with catalysts for this purpose, they were stymied {{by the fact that}} the catalyst ceased to work after a time. Houdry diagnosed the nature of the problem and developed a method to regenerate the catalyst. The first Houdry unit was built at Sun Oil's Marcus Hook, PA oil refinery in 1937. Many more units were built by the 1940s and were instrumental for US wartime aviation gasoline production. Among others at the company who helped Houdry in the development of the catalytic cracking process was Alex Golden Oblad.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty there have been about two dozen {{estimates}} made for world oil resources. Few of them are really independent or new estimates. Moreover, most of them disclose neither the method of assessment which was used nor the data on which the estimates rely. The situation is worse still for unconventional world oil resources such as <b>heavy</b> oil, <b>tar</b> sands, and oil shales. This {{is the reason why}} IIASA has launched an up-dating survey of past (and sometimes very old) estimates. This paper summarizes the efforts of the Resources Group to better understand both world oil (conventional and unconventional) estimates and also some technological and/or economic factors affecting the future availability of liquid fuel...|$|R
40|$|Trinidad and Tobago is a {{small country}} and our {{remaining}} known reserves now stand at 570 {{million barrels of oil}} and about 27 trillion cubic feet of gas. These reserves are both on land and offshore. The challenge of ensuring long-term growth of the energy sector has been great. This country has been endowed with energy resources and as a result, oil and natural gas {{play a central role in}} the socio-economic development of the country. Simultaneously they provide the necessary infra-structural economic base for the country becoming an attractive host for foreign investments in the energy sector. In the face of declining crude oil production, relatively modest natural gas prices and no deepwater success to date, the development of our unconventional resources should now be placed into the forefront of our energy future. The large volume and long-term potential of our unconventional resources pose a big challenge today but increasing prices and improved technology is the key to their development in the future. The current worldwide trend is a move from conventional to unconventional resources due to technology advances. This paper will evaluate the potential of developing our unconventional resources which include <b>heavy</b> oil, <b>tar</b> sands, tight sands and gas hydrates. The demand for oil and natural gas will continue to increase for the foreseeable future and we must now rely on unconventional resources to fill the gap between demand and supply. This analysis looks at the implications for the future and the technologies required for developing our unconventional resources. The research required and the technology advancement would also be discussed.

40|$|A 1 wt%/ 0. 5 wt% nickel-calcium {{catalyst}} was co-precipitated inside porous filter discs {{using the}} urea method {{to develop a}} gas cleaning technique involving the combined removal of tars and particles from hot biomass gasification gas. Special {{attention was paid to}} the improvement of the resistance of the catalyst against sulphur poisoning by the H 2 S present in the gasification gas. Deactivation tests were performed on catalytic filter discs using either benzene, naphthalene or a mixture of benzene and naphthalene as tar model compounds in a simulated gasification gas containing up to 200 ppm H 2 S. At 900 degreesC and at a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s, the developed catalyst formulation shows a benzene conversion of 93 % (50 ppm H 2 S), 78 % (100 ppm H 2 S) and 57 % (200 ppm H 2 S). However, benzene is not a problematic compound concerning the utilization of biomass gasification. More important is the removal capacity of this catalytic filter disc for the problematic <b>heavy</b> <b>tars</b> like naphthalene. Subsequent deactivation tests with naphthalene and with a mixture of benzene and naphthalene as tar model compounds showed that for simulated gasification gas containing up to 100 ppm H 2 S and for a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s (typical value in real gas) the naphthalene conversion is 98 % in both cases. As a result, the target tar conversion (> 95 %) was achieved in typical hot gas filtration conditions. The significant improvement over a pure nickel based catalyst by adding the appropriate amount of CaO is encouraging towards the further improvement of the sulphur tolerance of this catalyst.

40|$|Low-temperature {{gasification}} {{of biomass}} is a primary process step for production of biofuels or electricity using gas-fired engines or turbines. In addition to the desired product gas, the raw gas produced through gasification inevitably contains condensable hydrocarbons, known collectively as tar. The amount and composition of the tar have relevance for the efficiencies of the downstream processes. Tar can be measured using both online and off-line methods. However, many of these methods currently lack information regarding their implementation and accuracy levels for large-scale systems. In this work, the Solid-Phase Adsorption (SPA) method for measuring tar in industrial applications is evaluated. The individual steps of the method were examined for their effects on the overall performance of the analysis. Sample collection {{was found to be}} the most prominent source of error, and this was mainly due to human factors. Omitting to determine the temperature and pressure of the sampled gas contributed to this error, as the sampled volume of gas under normal conditions could not be correctly calculated. Inconsistencies in the treatment and storage of the collected samples were shown to affect the more volatile species with boiling points similar to that of benzene. The gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed with satisfying accuracy. However, the reliability of the estimations of the average composition and dew-point of the tar mixture were dependent upon the amount of the identified species. The current implementation of the SPA method yields values with a relative standard deviation within 10 % {{for the majority of the}} compounds in a given sample. However, in line with the result of previous studies, the tar species with boiling points between those of benzene and xylene (i. e., the BTX compounds) were measured with a lower accuracy than those of <b>heavier</b> <b>tars...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ten-year {{mortality}} rates for lung cancer and {{coronary heart disease}} have been related to cigarette smoking habits in 17 475 male civil servants aged 40 - 64 and in sample of 8089 male British residents aged 35 - 69. Both diseases were more frequent in smokers. Lung cancer rates were higher overall for "non-inhalers", particularly in <b>heavy</b> smokers. <b>Tar</b> yield correlated with the risk of lung cancer in non-inhalers but less so in inhalers. Conversely, coronary deaths were more common among inhalers, {{and the effect of}} tar/nicotine yield (such as it was) was confined to inhalers. It appears that there are subtle interactions between the amount smoked, the tar/nicotine yield of the cigarette, and the style of smoking. Thus the effects of a change in cigarette characteristics are hard to predict, and they may be different for respiratory and cardiovascular disease...|$|R
