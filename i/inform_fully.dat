40|$|Robust {{scientific}} conciusions are too sparse to <b>inform</b> <b>fully</b> most of {{the choices}} that physicians must make about tests and treatments. Instead, ad hoc rules of thumb, or "heu-ristics, " must guide them, {{and many of these}} are problem-atic. Physicians extrapolate from the small samples studied by clinical trials to general populations, but they do so inconsistently. Many physicians live by rules that dictate "not treating the numbers, " correcting abnormalities slowly, achieving diagnostic certainty, and operating now to avoid "greater " risk in the future. Yet in each case, historical trends or statistical realities suggest either doing the opposite or investing in more discriminating heuristics. The heuristics of medicine should be discussed, criticized, refined, and then taught. More uniform use of explicit and better heuristics could lead to less practice variation and more efficient medical care...|$|E

I also find that a <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> and <b>fully</b> coordinated electorate can change a candidate's incentives by bundling the reform with high wages and by voting strategically.

30|$|Some authors {{argue that}} {{informed}} consent cannot account for stochastic risk uncertainties [29]. In this scenario, patients must be <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> {{of what is}} known and what is unknown, but it is not advisable to establish a contract between a patient and the physician that reflects uncertainty [29]. On the contrary, we claim that patients must be <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> about the potential risks in order to provide their consent, even if the potential risks are based on controversial scientific data.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of joint channel and carrier {{frequency}} offset (CFO) estimation is studied {{in the context of}} multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications based on orthogonal space-time-block codes (OSTBCs). A new blind approach is proposed to jointly estimate the channel matrix and the CFO parameters usinga relaxed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that, for the sake of simplicity, ignores the finite alphabet constraint. Although the proposed technique {{can be applied to the}} majority of OSTBCs, there are, however, a few codes that suffer from an intrinsic ambiguity in the joint channel, CFO, and symbol estimates. For such specific OSTBCs, a semiblind modification of the proposed approach is developed that resolves the aforementioned estimation ambiguity. Our simulation results demonstrate that although the finite alphabet constraint is relaxed, the performance of the proposed techniques approaches that of the <b>informed</b> (<b>fully</b> frequency-synchronized and coherent) receiver, provide...|$|R

When firms sell horizontally differentiated products, cartels become more stable as the search cost increases; with homogeneous products, by contrast, the opposite holds. A higher share of <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> consumers makes collusion less stable when the market is initially sufficiently transparent, whereas it happens otherwise if the market is originally little transparent.

30|$|It {{should be}} added that a post focus group of several {{principals}} discussed the perception of teachers of the six items and how they could be subjective and biased about replaying to them. The discussions focused {{on the assumption that}} teachers might not be <b>informed</b> <b>fully</b> about some of those items. However, and during the discussions, many teachers raised the points that KG teachers are encouraged by the school principals, vice principals and ADEC advisors to use different means in understanding better on the degree of occurrences of these items at home. Some teachers directly contact parents and discuss these matters. Many teachers talk to individual students on related matters to better understand the occurrences of these items. In addition, most professional developments provided to teachers focus on how to better seek understanding of these issues. In short, teachers know all six items related to parental involvement to a large degree. As a result, for parental involvement, the survey included only these six items.|$|R
40|$|Setting {{priorities}} {{in health care}} means allocating lim-ited resources so that some programs are supportedand others are not (Box 1). For more than a decade, patients, scholars and government reports have asserted that the public should have greater involvement in setting health care priorities, 1 but progress on this front in Canada has been slow. We believe the merits of public involvement are compelling and in keeping with a democratic society’s de-sire for an <b>informed,</b> <b>fully</b> engaged citizenry. In this com-mentary, we review the value of public engagement, address the perceived barriers and suggest ways forward.
