5|$|Several {{pieces of}} {{merchandise}} {{related to the}} Vidiians were also released following their debut. In 1996, an action <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Vidiian was released {{as part of a}} second wave of Playmates Toys' Star Trek merchandise. A <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Vidiian starship was also released by WizKids. The Vidiians have not been featured in Star Trek Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), but a writer from Cryptic Studios presented in a 2013 article that they may be one potential alien species to be included in future updates.|$|E
5|$|East Worldham {{contains}} 10 Grade II listed buildings. St Mary's Church is of Transitional Norman {{architecture and}} is a Grade II* listed building. Notable features include triple lancet windows, a small pointed tower, three bells, and stained glass by Hardman & Co.. The chancel was restored in 1864, and in 1865, the nave was rebuilt. During the late restoration, a stone monument, like a coffin, was found under {{the floor of the}} church, which contained the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 13th-century lady. Magdalen College, Oxford is patron of the vicarage. A church school was built in 1864 upon a site donated by James Dutton, 3rd Baron Sherborne.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{an action}} <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Kazon was {{released}} {{as part of}} a second wave of Playmates Toys' Star Trek merchandise. The same year, Applause produced a ceramic mug whose design was based on the face of a generic Kazon male. Several figures on Kazon spacecrafts were released by Revell, such as those for the raider ship and torpedo. Revell included the raider ship figurine {{as a part of a}} three-piece set, along with ones for a Maquis ship and USS Voyager.|$|E
50|$|The <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> the Buddha {{is shown}} on a cushion on a throne or platform. On {{the front of}} the throne there are much smaller <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bodhisattva with a turban and halo, flanked by {{kneeling}} <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male and female probably representing donor portraits <b>of</b> <b>a</b> couple who paid for the statue.|$|R

50|$|Parallelism {{is another}} way to disambiguate the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image. The {{orientation}} of the contours of different textures in an image can determine which objects are grouped together. Generally, parallel contours suggest membership to the same object or group of objects. Similarly, symmetry of the contours can also define the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to appearing as the small <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman in A Golden Hour, Deborah Vernon Hackett {{was also the}} subject of a portrait, painted around 1908, again during Fuller's time in Perth. Anne Gray, the head of Australian art at the National Gallery of Australia, observed of Fuller's approach to the newspaperman's wife, that:Fuller portrayed her sitter sympathetically, capturing the young woman's grace and charm. But she also conveyed the complexity of the young Mrs Hackett's character through her soft, feminine, pale-blue dress counterpoised by the dramatic black hat and direct gaze.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Low {{used the}} same flag as Edward Teach ("Blackbeard"). Later, he used his own flag, a red {{skeletal}} figure on a black background, which became notorious. He first flew his own flag in late July 1723. Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man blowing a trumpet; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the mizzen peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.|$|E
5|$|Ivan the Russian {{was held}} in high regard by John VI Kantakouzenos, writer and later Byzantine emperor who likely {{personally}} faced Ivan in battle. In his History, Kantakouzenos calls Ivan a man “skilled in strategy”. Kantakouzenos also referred to Ivan as “one of Bulgaria's illustrious people” in his writings. Czech historian Konstantin Josef Jireček, a prominent researcher of Bulgarian history, assesses Ivan as “the most clear-cut <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Bulgarian military leader” of that age. In the eyes of Pavlov, despite his foreign origin Ivan the Russian was not considered an emigrant or a mercenary by the Bulgarian nobility and the emperor, but rather a trusted commander and one of their own.|$|E

5|$|Stela 39 is {{a broken}} {{monument}} that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper {{portion of the}} stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ich'aak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is trampling the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD 376. The text {{on the back of}} the monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a Katun-ending. The stela also names Chak Tok Ich'aak I's father as K'inich Muwaan Jol.|$|E
5|$|The longest {{surviving}} {{member of}} the Scottish Colourists, Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, where he became a leading <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.|$|E
5|$|The main retablo {{is painted}} {{in white and}} has a pantheon of 14 saints housed in an elaborately carved niche with the Archangel Michael towering above. There are two smaller retablos on either side. Father Ronald Reagan {{constructed}} an altar marble consecrated by Archbishop Alejandro Olalia in 1959 where {{the image of the}} Nuestra Señora de los Dolores was enshrined. A pulpit and a large painting depicting the concept of Heaven, Earth, Hell, and Judicium Finale (Final Judgement), created by Jose Dans, a 19th-century artist from Paete, can also be found. A life-sized <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crucified Christ is found in a smaller retablo near the church entrance. The church's Stations of the Cross were made by local artists.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} badge is a gold Maltese Cross {{of eight}} points, enamelled in white. Each {{point of the}} cross is decorated by a small gold ball; each angle has a small <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lion. The centre of the cross bears three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a thistle and a shamrock, emanating from a sceptre on the reverse side. Both emblems are surrounded by a red circular ring bearing the motto of the Order, which are in turn flanked by two laurel branches, above a scroll bearing the words Ich dien in gold letters.|$|E
5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|The western face {{is divided}} into three sections. The {{uppermost}} section is almost completely weathered. The antiquarian Alexander Gordon, who described the stone in 1726 in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene, with the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man at the right hand side and the left side completely defaced. Below this is a depiction of a centaur holding a bow, with the lowest panel having a symmetrical floral scroll design.|$|E

5|$|This story {{occurs as}} the war reaches its height. The South American Unification Army {{receives}} reports of a rogue sniper operating deep in the jungles of Patagonia, and sends a platoon {{under the command of}} Master Sergeant Murdock to neutralize the threat. However, the entire platoon is killed off one by one by the sniper, until only Murdock is left. All alone, Murdock catches a glimpse of this mysterious sniper through his binoculars—and is shocked to find that he gazes upon the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beautiful nun.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} {{on the disabled list}} with a groin strain during the opening month of the 1998 season, Rivera continued to establish himself as one of the major leagues' best closers. Moreover, he became the central <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Yankees bullpen that, supported by middle relievers Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, contributed to the team's late-1990s dynasty. That year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters' bats with its sharp lateral movement. He saved 36games in 41opportunities and had a 1.91ERA in the regular season. In the 1998 postseason, he pitched scoreless innings and saved six games, three of which came in the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Rivera's save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees' championship, capping off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125games combined in the regular season and the postseason. By season's end, Rivera had allowed only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51ERA—and by passing 30innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record for lowest postseason career ERA; it is a record he still holds after 141innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E

5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1650s, Parchevich {{had entered}} major European {{politics}} {{and was the}} central <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> significant anti-Ottoman plot. In 1656, Parchevich arranged a meeting in Târgovişte between {{the members of the}} plot, which included the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia and high-ranking clerics, including the Serbian Patriarch. After the meeting, Parchevich sent revolutionary messages to Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania and Greece, hoping to incite a rebellion. His plans were backed by the rulers of the Romanian lands which border Bulgaria north of the Danube: Gheorghe Ştefan of Moldavia and Constantin Şerban of Wallachia. However, the lack of clear support by key accomplice Austria meant an eventual uprising had to be delayed. In 1657, Parchevich was received by Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, whom he visited on a special mission. In the same year, he was granted the noble title of baron by the Habsburgs owing to his merits in defending Christianity. As an Austrian noble, he was styled Peter Freiherr von Parchevich.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of}} the cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E
