40|$|Intensification of {{agricultural}} production remains the {{major threat to}} the ecology of agro-ecosystems impairing the state of soil, water and air and reducing biological diversity in agricultural landscapes. This production is a complex process where cultivation plays an important role. Land degradation induced by large-scale equipment is of growing concern causing damage to the subsoil structure and may lead to harmful soil compaction. It is necessary to apply measures which can preserve or improve physical-mechanical, technological and microbiological properties as well as nutritive potential of soil, being {{at the same time}} environmental friendly. The machinery and tools that are often used in plant production in Republic of Serbia are the following: vibrating subsoiler VR- 5 / 7, universal self-propelled machine for soil arrangement USM- 5, <b>draining</b> <b>plough</b> DP- 4 and universal scraper land leveller. Those machines are tested on Marsh soil type. A description of the machines, tools and technologies necessary for soil preparation, with special note on preservation of soil properties, together with techniques based on decrease of the power energy necessary for the process of soil preparation is presented. Key words: machinery and tools, marsh soil, power energy...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} is complex process and it depends of various factors {{which can be}} controlled. Many {{of them can be}} improved by using of various means which are not friendly for environment and health of people. It is necessary to apply only those measures which can maintain and improve physical - mechanical, technological and microbiological properties of soil and also the nutritive potential of soil but will not be harmful for environment. The other part of this story demands decrease of energy necessary in the process of soil preparation. The machinery and tools for new technologies in plant production in Serbia is consisted of: vibrating subsoiler VR- 5 (7), universal self propelled machine for soil arrangement USM- 5, <b>draining</b> <b>plough</b> DP- 4 and universal Scraper land leveler, and it is developed to apply changed new technologies of soil preparation. This study gives description of machines, tools and technologies necessary for soil preparation in Serbia; this means preparation of soil surface and depth, special note is given to preservation of environment and improvement of soil potential, but also and how to decrease the energy necessary for the process of soil preparation...|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{strongylosis}} are {{the dominant}} parasitic infections of sheep and goats. The successful control of these parasites cannot be done exclusively with anthelmintics, {{but the first}} step is an integrated program for environmental prophylaxis. The correct planning of the prophylaxis program has to be preceded by the analysis of the related problems: (1) the parasitological status of farm livestock; (2) knowledge of the farm management; (3) hydrogeological, pedological and climatic-environmental aspects. The environmental control strategies can be resumed as follows: avoiding animals from different farms to share the same pasture; avoiding animals of different age classes to graze together; parcel the pastures to permit a rational rotation; rotational grazing of pastures according to the seasonal development of parasites; stocking rate; young animals grazing ahead of the older animai ones; crop management practices (<b>draining,</b> <b>ploughing,</b> harrowing, scrub clearing, fertilizing, etc.). These measures make the habitat less suitable for the free-living stages of gastrointestinal strongyles, reducing the potential of infection of the same pastures...|$|R

40|$|The annual net CO 2 {{exchange}} over undisturbed deep peatland in Scotland {{was measured}} continuously for 22 months using eddy covariance. Annual CO 2 exchanges over peatlands {{that had been}} <b>drained,</b> <b>ploughed</b> and afforested with conifers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 26 years previously were estimated by extrapolating 2 - 4 weekly measurements, using relationships between daytime fluxes and solar radiation and night-time fluxes and air temperature. The contribution of the trees to the overall net CO 2 flux was estimated using a carbon accounting model, calibrated to fit conifer volume yield data. The carbon exchange of the peat and ground vegetation was then {{the difference between the}} overall carbon flux and the amount accumulated in trees and tree litter. The undisturbed peat accumulated about 0. 25 tC ha- 1 y- 1. Newly drained peatland (2 - 4 years after ploughing) emitted between 2 and 4 tC ha- 1 y- 1, but when ground vegetation recolonized, the peatland became a sink again, absorbing about 3 tC ha- 1 y- 1 4 - 8 years after tree planting. Thereafter, the trees dominated the budget and afforested peatlands absorbed up to 5 tC ha- 1 y- 1. Assuming that the trees accumulated carbon at rates commensurate with Yield Class 10 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1, the peat beneath the trees after canopy closure was estimated to be decomposing at only about 1 tC ha- 1 y- 1 or less. This is slower than previously thought and suggested that afforested peatlands in Scotland accumulate more carbon in trees, litter, forest soil and products than is lost from the peat for 90 - 190 years...|$|R
50|$|The meadow is {{situated}} between two rivers, the Thames and the Churn, and the unique habitat for the fritillary {{was created by}} regular winter flooding. Such meadows were once common in Britain, but {{with the advent of}} modern farming many were <b>drained</b> and <b>ploughed</b> for arable crops from the 1730s onwards. In the case of North Meadow, it escaped such a fate by virtue of the preservation of the Court Leet, the Saxon system of town governance which made sure the land was held in common. The land is managed by Natural England and is run {{with the support of the}} Court Leet. The ancient Hay Lot stones which once marked local farmers' plots can still be seen within the meadow.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLong term {{studies of}} fluvial {{sediment}} {{processes in the}} Plynlimon catchments {{have contributed to the}} assessment and quantification of plantation forestry impacts in British upland catchments, at all stages of the forest cycle. The results from the Plynlimon studies are placed {{in the context of the}} observed impacts of particular forest practices and studies of forestry effects on sediment transport elsewhere in the world. The effects associated with <b>drain</b> excavation, <b>ploughing,</b> track construction, ground and channel disruption are outlined for both bedload and, particularly, for suspended load. Finally, recent data on sediment yields from 1995 to 1997 at Plynlimon are reported and discussed in the light of longer-term sediment yield estimates. This paper also provides background information relevant to other sediment process studies which use data from the main Plynlimon sediment monitoring network...|$|R
50|$|Today, the town's {{main claim}} to fame is the large nature reserve, North Meadow, which {{preserves}} some 80 per cent of Britain's wild snake's head fritillaries in its 150 acres, which flower in late April to early May. The meadow is situated between two rivers, the Thames and the Churn, and the unique habitat for the fritillary was created by winter flooding. Such meadows were once common in Britain, but {{with the advent of}} modern farming many were <b>drained</b> and <b>ploughed</b> for arable crops from the 1730s onwards.

50|$|The {{agricultural}} {{suitability of}} Stagnosols is limited {{because of their}} oxygen deficiency resulting from stagnating water above a dense subsoil. Therefore, {{they have to be}} drained. However, in contrast to Gleysols, drainage with channels or pipes is in many cases insufficient. It is necessary to have a higher porosity in the subsoil in order to improve the hydraulic conductivity. This may be achieved by deep loosening or deep <b>ploughing.</b> <b>Drained</b> Stagnosols can be fertile soils owing to their moderate degree of leaching.|$|R
60|$|A {{piece of}} waste, swampy land was enclosed, <b>drained,</b> <b>ploughed,</b> harrowed and thickly {{covered in the}} year 1822 with burnt marl and cinders. It was sowed with grass seeds, and now {{supports}} a tolerably good but coarse pasture. Holes were dug in this field in 1837, or 15 years after its reclamation, and {{we see in the}} accompanying diagram (Fig. 5), reduced to half of the natural scale, that the turf was 1 inch thick, beneath which there was a layer of vegetable mould 2.5 inches thick. This layer did not contain fragments of any kind; but beneath it there was a layer of mould, 1.5 inch in thickness, full of fragments of burnt marl, conspicuous from their red colour, one of which near the bottom was an inch in length; and other fragments of coal-cinders together with a few white quartz pebbles. Beneath this layer and at a depth of 4.5 inches from the surface, the original black, peaty, sandy soil with a few quartz pebbles was encountered. Here therefore the fragments of burnt marl and cinders had been covered in the course of 15 years by a layer of fine vegetable mould, only 2.5 inches in thickness, excluding the turf. Six and a half years subsequently this field was re-examined, and the fragments were now found at from 4 to 5 inches beneath the surface. So that in this interval of 6.5 years, about 1.5 inch of mould had been added to the superficial layer. I am surprised that a greater quantity had not been brought up during the whole 21.5 years, for in the closely underlying black, peaty soil there were many worms. It is, however, probable that formerly, whilst the land remained poor, worms were scanty; and the mould would then have accumulated slowly. The average annual increase of thickness for the whole period is 0.19 of an inch.|$|R
50|$|By {{harvesting}} {{the layers}} of peat and draining the land the climatic conditions of the entire area were changed considerably. By {{the end of the}} 19th century the keeping of dairy cattle had spread to the area. In Bremen the use of peat for heating was banned because on many winters days the air pollution it caused had become unbearable. Coal, with its greater energy density, superseded peat. Right into the 1980s and 1990s, however, there was continued destruction of the moor. Major 'melioration' measures such as <b>draining,</b> deep <b>ploughing</b> (Tiefumbruch) and river regulation were supposed to increase the productivity of agriculture and even enabled arable farming. Intensive farming methods were used to grow maize as an animal feedstuff. These measures had been supported since the middle of the 20th century by various national and European subsidy programmes. This went so far that ditches dried out in summer, heath fires broke out and, during sustained periods of drought, the land was artificially watered.|$|R
25|$|The {{mole plough}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers that impede drainage. It is a very deep plough, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When dragged through the ground, it leaves a channel deep under the ground, and this acts as a <b>drain.</b> Modern mole <b>ploughs</b> may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. Similar machines, so called pipe-and-cable-laying ploughs, are even used under the sea, for the laying of cables, as well as preparing the earth for side-scan sonar in a process used in oil exploration.|$|R
40|$|The study {{comprised}} a {{field and}} laboratory investigation on {{the stability of}} Sitka spruce trees planted on a surface water gley. The field-testing was conducted at Ballyfarnon Forest in County Sligo in the north west of Ireland. Nine destructive monotonic pulling tests were conducted on trees selected from three different site preparations, namely, mole <b>drained,</b> double mouldboard <b>ploughed</b> and an uncultivated control. Dynamic testing, using a mechanical rocking device, was performed on a tree selected from the uncultivated control. A simple shear apparatus was used to conduct monotonic and cyclic tests on reconstituted samples of the Ballyfarnon soil. This allowed a comparison of soil behaviour under monotonic and cyclic loading. A computer software package was used to model the behaviour of groundwater for soil mole drained at two drain spacings. Results from this mathematical modeling were compared to experimental data gathered during a previous study. Results indicate {{that the use of}} mole drainage as a site preparation technique produces more stable trees than either double mouldboard ploughing or no cultivation.

40|$|Rainfed {{permanent}} {{crops such as}} almonds, olives and vines cover important areas in the drier parts of the Mediterranean. The acreage of almonds has expanded rapidly into marginal soils of the hillslopes of southeast Spain. This expansion staffing in the 1970 s was reinforced by the subsidies under the EU Common Agricultural Policy since the late 1980 s. Trees are widely spaced and the soil in between is kept bare to reduce competition with weeds for the scarce rainfall. Hence, the large areas of bare soil are vulnerable to water erosion. However, recently it has been demonstrated that soil redistribution by tillage can be an even more important cause of degradation. This paper investigates the systematic variation in soil properties {{as a result of}} soil redistribution by tillage of a small catchment (21 ha in Murcia Region, southeast Spain) converted to almond groves in the late 1970 s. Furthermore, the impacts of the spatial variation in soil properties on the water balance of the almond cropping system are evaluated. The results of a spatially distributed tillage erosion model, WATEM, are validated by a topographic survey of accumulation and removal of soil along field borders (root mean square difference (RMS) = 6. 7 ton ha(- 1) y(- 1)). On the hillslopes, soil loss by tillage erosion amounts to 26. 6 ton ha(- 1) y(- 1) while sedimentation occurs at a rate of 21. 1 ton ha(- 1) y(- 1). The difference between erosion and sedimentation on the hillslopes results in a net transport of sediment towards the valley bottom, where the sediment is retained behind 17 earthen dams. Overall, these currently store 156. 5 tons ha(- 1), which is about half their total capacity. The area suffering from erosion is larger (53 %) than the area undergoing sedimentation (34 %) or the area undergoing a change within the accuracy of the model prediction (13 %). Hence, soils in {{a large part of the}} catchinent become gradually thinner and stonier. The PATTERN model, developed to describe the hydrology of thin and stony soils, was validated on two columns of bare soil for which wetting and drying runs were monitored. Frequent tillage destroys the roots in the plough layer and forces the widely spaced trees to develop a lateral root system in the broken bedrock below. The model results indicate that evaporation losses (92. 8 - 94. 7 mm per year) are similar for all soil profiles regardless of landscape position. The water <b>draining</b> below the <b>plough</b> layer (i. e. 67 % of the rainfall) will be used by the tree crop to develop its canopy covering the fields only partially (i. e. the transpiring surface is a fraction of the total area). However, the frequent ploughing causes important soil redistribution, which reduces soil thickness on the one hand and fills up the storage behind dams in the valley bottom on the other hand.
