40|$|The Lisbon Treaty reform {{provided}} an important {{innovation in the}} EU regulatory activity by differentiating between the legislative delegation (art. 290 TFEU) and the <b>executive</b> <b>delegation</b> (art. 291 TFEU). In so doing, {{the central role of}} the European Commission in the Comitology procedures as well as the power of the European Parliament and the Council to control its executive powers have been modified. The new 2011 Comitology Regulation aimed at creating a more intelligible and transparent committees' system where the EC is expected to act in a stricter framework. The paper argues that the new Regulation preserves the efficiency of the Comitology system; at the same time, however, it does not really improve the level of transparency and clarity {{in the way in which}} the committees' procedures works. Moreover, as the practice clearly shows, the EC continues to enjoy a broad discretion in the adoption of implementing acts...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The European Ombudsman is a {{new kind}} of ‘agent’, whose status and role remain unclear. On the one hand, it is {{formally}} a parliamentary body, designed to strengthen the control of EU institutions and administrations by MEPs; on the other hand, the profile and role of this organ is close to that of a court. This article argues that the hybrid nature of this organ is the reason for its success. The powers of the Ombudsman, limited as they are, give him the opportunity to combine the instruments of parliamentary scrutiny and judicial control in an original way. As such it is well equipped to scrutinize those agents which cannot be submitted to classic parliamentary controls without losing their independence, and thereby helps to reconcile <b>executive</b> <b>delegation</b> with parliamentary democracy. KEY WORDS Accountability; European governance; Ombudsman; parliament-ary scrutiny; rule of law; transparency. It has become commonplace to say that parliaments alone can no longer hold the state apparatus accountable, in a context of increasingly complex and technical ‘governance’. The European Union (EU) is confronted with that problem, more than any other national political system (Joerges and Dehousse 2002; Harlow 2002). Its competence, which is often technical and based on expertise, implies that new forms of political control should be invented (Majone 2001). Its intricate institutional system, in which the European Parliament (EP) does not play the same central role as national parliaments, necessitates complementary modes of political accountability (Lord 1998). The nature of this problem explains the creation of the European Ombuds-man in the Treaty of Maastricht. This organ illustrates a new trend in the legitimization of the Union, which consists in subjecting ‘all of the Union’s institutions to standard sets of rules and procedures, or scrutiny by agents who are dedicated to a single task but responsible for applying it across the entir...|$|E
2500|$|Michael B. Rappaport {{argued that}} the {{original}} meaning of the Constitution {{does not apply to}} certain parts of the nondelegation doctrine, relying on his interpretation of the Executive Power Vesting Clause. Under this view, [...] "laws that authorize the withdrawal of money from the treasury and which have traditionally taken the form of authorizing a certain amount to be spent for particular programs ... are not subject to the nondelegation doctrine." [...] He further criticized the majority opinion for failing to satisfactorily justify its application of a stricter standard to the delegation of cancellation authority than it had used in the past for other <b>executive</b> <b>delegations.</b> In Rappaport’s opinion, [...] "the Court’s approach to cancellation authority has no basis in text, structure and purpose, or precedent." ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{an economic}} {{theory of the}} Chilean Constitution and the legislative process, and the role that play interest groups in the later. For the authors {{is not clear that}} the only approach when analyzing interest group politics consists, inevitably, in establishing statutory regulations, like campaign finance laws and lobbying regulation. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the Chilean Constitution and the design of the legislative process should be considered more seriously. Different constitutional principles, institutions and mechanisms are established in the Chilean constitutional design that raises the costs of capturing the State and Congress. Thus, the authors propose an economic theory of the Chilean constitution and analyze different topics such as the bicameral system, <b>executive</b> veto, <b>delegation</b> of legislative powers to the Executive and the legal reserve clause, the respect for the matrix ideas of a legislative proposal, quorums, judicial review of legislation by the Constitutional Court, among others...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{checks and}} {{balances}} aimed at protecting citizens from government abuse of power are key features of well performing democracies. Nevertheless, some presidents have enjoyed strong and often explicit popular support when they undermined these controls. We present a formal model of the trade-off between control on the <b>executive</b> and <b>delegation</b> to analyze voters' decision {{on the strength of}} {{checks and balances}}. We argue that voters may support their loosening, even when this allows rent extraction, if they are convinced that checks on the executive are blocking necessary reforms. We discuss several cases of strong presidents in Latin America who, alleging that radical reforms were necessary, obtained popular support that allowed them to loosen checks on the executive. Some of these presidents had a pro- and some an anti-market reform agenda so, as our model suggests, voters' willingness to remove checks and balances can emerge under both right- and left-wing executives. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{business}} in Russia, being {{a new phenomenon}} in cultural traditions, {{is characterized by a}} lot of special features due to the recency of its ascendance within the new economic, social and political conditions. Many of these features seriously prevent the further development of organizations and are anyhow realized by agents of business activity. In this context, Tepfer (2000) identifies characteristic features like placing collective values above personal values, concentration of authority onto the chief <b>executive,</b> insufficient <b>delegation</b> of authority, and an inefficiency of discussions between people at different hierarchical levels in the organization (See also Humphreys and Nappelbaum, 1997). Forms of inter-organizational communications, such as business clubs, are not developed in a proper way. Within Russian organizations, problem handling is more likely to search for "the guilty ones" rather than to conduct a scrupulous analysis of allowed mistakes: representations of problems and the phenomena involved have a primarily emotional character. Direct communication, both inside an organization and in relations between different organizations, is complicated by virtue of the dominance of competitive relations, the cultural norms prevalent in Russian business, and absence of a supportive environment in which such communications might be realized...|$|R
5000|$|The {{holding in}} Yakus  was a major {{development}} of American nondelegation law. Chief Justice Stone argued that an administrative agency could self-correct {{a problem of}} delegation if it limited its own power:The standards prescribed by the present Act, {{with the aid of}} the [...] "statement of the considerations" [...] required to be made by the Administrator, are sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts and the public to ascertain whether the administrator, in fixing the designated prices, has conformed to those standards [...] [...] [...] Hence we are unable to find in them an unauthorized delegation of legislative power. 321 U.S. at 426.Thus, Yakus held that an administrative agency could [...] "save" [...] an otherwise unconstitutional delegation of power through a narrowing construction constraining that agency's own discretion. This would become a key principle in American constitutional law and would be followed by lower courts in striking down challenges to laws based on the nondelegation doctrine for the next fifty years. The Yakus principle was logically flawed however: how could an administrative agency itself cure a problem of delegation? The problem of delegation is one of excessive legislative power transferred to the <b>executive</b> branch--the <b>delegation</b> problem happens {{at the time of the}} passage of the statute. The act of an executive agency limiting that power is too late and does not correct the problem (it really only limits the problem). Allowing the agency to correct a delegation problem is liking locking the barn doors after all the horses have already escaped.|$|R
500|$|The queen was deposed on January 17, and the {{provisional}} government established under pro-annexation leader Sanford B. Dole was officially recognized by Stevens as {{the de facto}} government. She temporarily relinquished her throne to the United States, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would restore Hawaii's sovereignty to the rightful holder. The government under Dole began using ʻIolani Palace as its <b>executive</b> building. A <b>delegation</b> departed for Washington D.C. on January 19, to ask for immediate annexation by the United States. At the request of {{the provisional}} government, Stevens proclaimed Hawaii a protectorate of the United States on February 1, to temporarily provide a buffer against domestic upheaval and interference by foreign governments. The US flag was raised over the palace, and martial law was enforced. The annexation treaty presented to the US Senate contained a provision to grant Liliʻuokalani a $20,000 per annum lifetime pension, and Kaʻiulani a lump-sum payment of $150,000. The queen protested the proposed annexation in a January 19 letter to President Benjamin Harrison. She sent Prince David Kawānanakoa and Paul Neumann to represent her.|$|R
2500|$|Burj Khalifa was {{designed}} to be the centrepiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development that would include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), [...] of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the Dubai Mall, and the [...] artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. [...] The decision to build Burj Khalifa is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it is necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in the city to garner more international recognition, and hence investment. [...] "He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational," [...] said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP <b>delegations</b> <b>executive</b> at Nakheel Properties. The tower was known as Burj Dubai ("Dubai Tower") until its official opening in January 2010. It was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of USD so that Dubai could pay its debts – Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects. In the 2000s, Dubai started diversifying its economy but it suffered from an economic crisis in 2007–2010, leaving large-scale projects already in construction abandoned.|$|R
