5000|$|Accordingly, RateItAll lets users rate a {{wide variety}} of things such as {{consumer}} products, services, movies, people, politics, travel, musicians, actors, colleges, baseball teams, drinks, and other things [...] by uploading ratings and reviews from their computer to the RateItAll website. Reviewers are paid according to readership; this usually amounts to pennies per review, and the total amounts paid are not sizeable, even for prominent reviewers. RateItAll was an early proponent among <b>Internet</b> <b>ratings</b> services of sharing advertising revenues. In addition, the RateItAll website allowed users seeking information to use filters to isolate the opinions of specific demographic groups. Reviewers can manage their ratings lists with online tools. RateItAll also lets users submit lists.|$|E

40|$|Intelligent content caching for mobile devices Abstract — Newer mobile {{devices are}} {{equipped}} with multiple network interfaces {{that can be used}} to preemptively download multimedia content in an efficient and cost effective manner. We propose a content selection algorithm for such push-based multimedia content caching scenarios. Our approach improves cache hit rates by exploiting correlations between users who request similar content: we use this information to select cache content intelligently. Using real data collected from an <b>Internet</b> movie <b>ratings</b> web-site, we experimentally verify the superiority of our approach over the widely used technique of pushing the most popular content onto all mobile devices. We also propose a distributed version of our approach that is suitable for ad hoc mobile device networks. I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Internet</b> <b>ratings</b> {{data are}} {{everywhere}} and increasing rapidly. They are usually ordinal measurements from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10 rated by Internet users {{on the quality}} of all kinds of items; for example, movies, books, etc. The graphical displays of the ratings data have little change over the past years, and the traditional displays does not account for the inter-rater difference. To address this problem, Ho and Quinn 2008 proposed a model-based graphical display. However, in order to identify the model, certain parameters are constrained to be positive. In the present work we first show that such a restriction may have a great impact on the rankings of items. Then we addressed some issues concerning the estimation of model parameters. Two real data sets are used for illustration. Key words: Ordinal item response; posterior distribution; ranking. ...|$|E
40|$|Ratings for {{products}} and services are increasingly important on the Internet, as they allow users to harvest {{the wisdom of the}} community in making decisions. However, the difficulty with ratings is that {{little is known about the}} people providing them. Interpreting ratings well requires that the reputations of raters be factored into the scores computed for rated objects, even though these reputations are not explicitly available. Taking advantage of the insight that reputation can be computed implicitly from ratings, this paper addresses the reputation problem for raters and its application to evaluating rated objects. We develop a general method to automatically compute reputations for raters based on the ratings they and others give to objects, and incorporate these reputations to generate value-added information about rated objects. We evaluate our mechanisms by performing experiments on data from major rating sites, and show that they have the desired properties of a good reputation system. In the process, we analyze some key characteristics of different types of <b>Internet</b> <b>ratings.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first investigation into automatically computing raters ’ reputations and applying these reputations to better evaluate rated objects...|$|E

We develop a model of customer acquisition where any active consumer, not just initial lead users, plays {{an active role in}} the design and modification of products and services, and helps firms gain broader market adoption through channelbased, consumer-mediated interaction. Channels include such vehicles as <b>Internet</b> community sites, <b>ratings</b> services, specialized affinity sites, Internet web-logs (blogs) and wireless text chat (SMS) services. In applying the model, we conducted surveys among approximately 5, 000 Korean and Japanese cellular phone customers over the period 2002 to 2004. Our analysis reports on key differences between Korean and Japanese consumers in their transitions to next-generation wireless services. 1...|$|R

Since the death of Yu Fan (Chen Hanwei), Weiyun's outlook on life had changed. She becomes more cheerful and personable in her dealings with others. She stays with her mother, who has dementia, and a maid and lives life like a swinging bachelorette, focusing on her work. She produces programmes that are sincere and from her heart. As she does not produce shows just to please the viewers, coupled with the rising popularity of <b>internet</b> content, the <b>ratings</b> for TV dramas have been falling, adversely affecting the advertising dollars as a result.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between exposure to and coping with the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001 and PTSD symptoms. Participants were Pace University students from both the Pleasantville and New York City campuses. Participants were assessed on all three variables during the initial survey (6 months post event) using and <b>Internet</b> survey. PTSD <b>ratings</b> were additionally obtained during follow-up surveys at 8, 13, and 18 months post event. A total of 177 participants completed at least one follow-up and were therefore {{included in the final}} analysis. Results indicated that those with greater physical exposure (i. e., physical proximity) and those who used greater maladaptive coping (i. e., high levels of avoidance coping and use of drugs or alcohol) reported higher initial (at 6 months post event) and overall levels of PTSD symptoms. Moreover, high exposure/high maladaptive coping individuals, compared to others, showed relatively smaller decreases in PTSD symptoms over time. These findings, which are consistent with models of PTSD, suggest that use of denial and drugs and alcohol as means of coping might prevent assimilation of traumatic information with previous knowledge, prevent the extinction of a fear response to a previously neutral stimulus, and reinforce shattered assumptions that the world is benevolent, the world is meaningful, and the self is worthy, thereby leading to the maintenance of symptoms over time. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion picture}} {{industry}} {{is an exciting}} industry which generates not only well-known stars but also {{billions of dollars in}} revenue every year. A movie release typically goes through three stages: theater, home video, and TV. Its theatrical release is the most high-profile stage, and has attracted a lot of attention from the industry; as well as marketing academics. ^ In contrast, very little research has been done on the home video business, when in fact home video is the true “cash cow” for the industry. As shown on many Hollywood studios 2 ̆ 7 accounting books, for movies that go to both theaters and videos, home videos on average create higher revenue than domestic box office ticket sales. ^ We investigate two issues related to the home video market in this dissertation: (1) how a movie distributor should strategically choose the optimal way to release its home videos and maximize total profit; and (2) since home video rental/retail sales are closely related to both movie performance and consumer word-of-mouth (WOM), what the relationship is between consumer self-reported/stated evaluation of a movie/video watching experience and the financial performance of the movie. ^ There are two common strategies in the motion picture industry when releasing a home video: sequential release and simultaneous release. Simply put, sequential release is to release the video into the rental market through rental stores for an exclusive period of time before making it available for purchase. Alternatively, a simultaneous release strategy makes home video available to consumers for both rental and retail at the same time. To tackle issue 1, an analytical model is developed based on consumer and market behavior, and corresponding empirical analyses are provided to demonstrate supportive evidence. It appears that sequential release dominates simultaneous release as it offers greater margin for price discrimination. However, the model shows that the optimal choice of home video release depends on both consumer preference heterogeneity and movie characteristics. At the same time, rental demand over time and rental store inventory also influence the release strategy. Implications of the model provide general managerial guidance on what to look for and how to make good choices in releasing home videos. Several extensions of the basic model are provided. ^ For issue 2, we take an further exploratory look at <b>Internet</b> movie <b>ratings</b> obtained from movie information website IMDB. com. The Internet provides consumers a platform to spread WOM. Consumer reviews and ratings of movies, books, and electronics etc. have become an important source of information for product choice. We select 266 movies theatrically released in 2002 and 2003 and exploratorily analyze the ratings they received at IMDB. com. By relating the number of ratings, average, variance, and shape (histogram) of these ratings to the raters 2 ̆ 7 demographics and movie characteristics, we found significant difference in ratings across demographic groups and a close relationship between ratings and movie performance (i. e., box office sales). Discussion of the managerial implications of these findings is provided. ...|$|R
