5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the <b>digital</b> <b>currency</b> Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin <b>digital</b> <b>currency</b> platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E
40|$|The European Anti-Money Laundering Directive 2015 / 849 {{sets out}} {{detailed}} {{rules for the}} prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. It presents a clear framework for financial institutions, covering both cash and electronic payments systems. However, the directive fails to regulate <b>digital</b> <b>currencies,</b> such as bitcoin, leaving a large lacuna in the directive. Financial institutions specializing in <b>digital</b> <b>currencies</b> are thus {{left to their own devices}} with little information about how best to address the obligations set forth in directive 2015 / 849. In this paper, the author will propose the application of the rules on cash to <b>digital</b> <b>currencies.</b> As <b>digital</b> <b>currencies</b> are limited to the digital sphere and operate in a closed environment, they are often mistakenly compared to e-money, but the way <b>digital</b> <b>currencies</b> operate is in fact very close to how cash is used today. <b>Digital</b> <b>currencies</b> are obtained through online exchanges, just as cash is usually obtained from an (automatic) bank teller. Cash and <b>digital</b> <b>currencies</b> are both typically exchanged between individuals without interference of a third party. Finally, there is no entity who can be obliged to track the movement of cash or <b>digital</b> <b>currencies</b> between individuals, except if a payment is exceptionally large. However, unlike anonymous cash, there exists a ledger of all transactions carried out in <b>digital</b> <b>currencies,</b> which can be used by financial intelligence units directly to track suspicious movements. Therefore, it can be argued that the application of the rules on cash could facilitate a smooth incorporation of <b>digital</b> <b>currencies</b> into the existing framework...|$|R

25|$|CS:GO is not {{the first}} video game where players have traded, sold, or bought virtual in-game items, but the ease of {{accessing}} and transferring through the Steam Marketplace made it a successful virtual economy. However, with increased monetary values placed on some skins, the Steam Marketplace became infeasible. The Steam Marketplace only allows sales up to $400, with all transactions subject to a 15% fee collected by Valve. Trades and purchases via the Steam Marketplace required players to add funds to their Steam Wallets to purchase skins from others, with those funds being placed in the Wallet of the seller; such funds could not be taken out as real-world money, as otherwise Valve would be regulated as a bank. As the value of skins grew beyond these limits, new websites opened up that used the Steamworks application programming interface (API) to link players' inventory to these sites as to manage the trading of CS:GO skins while enabling these users to spend more and receive money through other online banking/payment sites like PayPal or using <b>digital</b> <b>currency</b> like Bitcoin, and bypassing Valve's transaction fee.|$|E
