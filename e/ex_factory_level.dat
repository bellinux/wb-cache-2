40|$|Abstract The overall {{equipment}} effectiveness (OEE) met-ric is {{a powerful}} tool {{that can be used}} to measure performance and also perform diagnostics at the equipment level. Although important, gains made in OEE are insufficient; because the ultimate objective is a highly efficient integrated system, not brilliant individual equip-ment. <b>Factory</b> <b>level</b> performance monitoring and diagnos-tics can be facilitated by classifying the entire manufacturing system layout into unique subsystems including “series, ” “parallel, ” “assembly, ” and “expansion. ” The overall throughput effectiveness (OTE) metric is then derived for each of these subsystems. <b>Factory</b> <b>level</b> metric can be computed by synthesizing the subsystem level metrics, capturing their interconnectivity information. The objective of this paper is to present the algorithms developed to automate the factory-level performance monitoring and diagnostics process using OTE. The algorithms are implemented into a software tool called SIMPRO. SIMPRO allows factory professionals to effi-ciently measure performance and conduct <b>factory</b> <b>level</b> diagnostics (i. e., identify bottlenecks/hidden capacity). A glass manufacturing case study is used to illustrate automated performance diagnostics and the benefits obtained by using the approach...|$|R

40|$|Work {{on energy}} and {{resource}} reduction in factories {{is dependent on the}} availability of data. Typically, available sources are incomplete or inappropriate for direct use and manipulation is required. Identifying new improvement opportunities through simulation across factory production, utility and building architecture domains requires analysis of model feasibility, particularly in terms of system data composition, input resolution and simulation result fidelity. This paper reviews literature on developing appropriate model data for assessing energy and material flows at <b>factory</b> <b>level.</b> Gaps are found in guidance for analysis and integration of resource-flows across system boundaries. The process for how data was prepared, input and iteratively developed alongside conceptual and simulation models is described.
