30|$|Nanoparticles {{of noble}} metals are gaining {{importance}} {{because of their}} applications in various fields {{as well as their}} considerable stability. Palladium nanostructures have been known as hydrogen sensors [1] and catalysts for the reactions such as oxidation of hydrocarbon in automobiles (three-way catalyst) [2], hydrogenation [3], Heck reaction [4], Suzuki reaction [5], Stille coupling [6] and C–N coupling [7]. Also, Pd nanoparticles with preferentially exposed { 111 } show high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of 1, 3 -butadiene. Several synthetic methods have been reported regarding the preparation of stable palladium nanoparticles. Some of the methods are sonochemical [8], γ-irradiation [9], UV irradiation [10], microemulsion technique [11] and polyol reduction [12]. However, the facile, cost-effective and large-scale synthetic methods are still elusive. Herein, we report a simple, rapid, surfactantless and room temperature synthesis of Pd nanoparticles by UV <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> of PdCl 2 and K 2 C 2 O 4 solutions.|$|E

The temperature and the geometry of the temperature produced in the reaction cell by a continuous wave IR CO 2 laser were photographed and measured using chemiluminescence, spectroscopic (IR diode laser source spectrometer) and chemical standard techniques. The distribution of the temperature over {{the volume of the}} cell was found to be inhomogeneous, and the diffusion effects on the reaction rate were negligible. The mechanism of the decomposition of CH 3 I, d 3 -CH 3 I and their mixture was investigated using the LPHP technique. The rate of the decomposition of d 3 -CH 3 I was faster than that of CH 3 I. No significant amount of mixed isotopes of the products were observed during the <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture.</b> The reactions of (CH 3) 4 Sn (TMT) and (CH 3) 3 SnSn(CH 3) 3 (HMDT) showed they decomposed, and the major products were CH 4 and metallic layer deposited {{on the walls of the}} reaction cell. A significant amount of CH 3 D was observed during the reaction of TMT in presence of D 2 at a relatively high laser power. The reaction of (CH 3) 3 Al (TMAL) was investigated using LPHP technique and the mechanism of its reaction was presented. A monomeric TMAL form was detected during the reaction using FTIR spectrometer scanning of the reaction zone perpendicularly with the incident CO 2 laser beam. A (CH 3) 2 A 1 (DMAL) radical was found as a result of the decomposition of TMAL. The DMAL radical was trapped and isolated as stable compounds: (CH 3) 2 AIF (DMAF) in dimeric and tetrameric forms, and (CH 3) 2 AICI (DMAC) in dimeric form, using SF 6 and CCI 4, CHCI 3 and CDCI 3 as radical scavengers, respectively. The presence of H 2 and D 2, which are widely used as carrier gases in the metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) technique, did not have major effect on the mechanism of the reaction, but were shown to have isotopic effects on the thermal conductivity of the reaction cell, slowing down the reaction. A new photoacoustic spectroscopic technique, based on the change of the resonance frequency of the reaction cell (r. f.), was introduced to follow and examine the chemical reactions, revealing the change of the cell composition. The results obtained by this technique were fairly comparable with those obtained by IR spectroscopic methods...|$|E

The technique used to evidence molecular alteration is “in situ ” infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Here, we present results obtained irradiating by 3 - 60 keV helium and argon ions, frozen CO, and mixtures CO:O 2 and CO:N 2. <b>The</b> relevance <b>of</b> these studies for astrophysical applications is related to the fact that IR bands of frozen O 2 and N 2 are difficult to be observed.

40|$|Traditionally, <b>the</b> target volumes <b>of</b> curative-intent {{radiotherapy}} for non-small cell {{lung cancer}} include all uninvolved mediastinal nodes. However, {{an improvement in}} tumour control requires an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total dose to the macroscopic target volume. This is only achievable if <b>the</b> <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organs at risk is reduced, i. e. elective <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mediastinum is omitted. The available data suggest that elective mediastinal irradiation may be safely omitted, provided that an adequate staging procedure, including FDG PET-CT, has been performed.
