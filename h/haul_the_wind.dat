50|$|Recently, the Harz National Park has {{suffered}} from bark beetle outbreaks as well as acid rain and other environmental problems. The bark beetle {{is on the rise}} here due to climate change and global warming. Since 2006, there has been increased bark beetle gradation. Hurricane Kyrill also caused severe damage in the region. Stands of trees, especially spruce, were torn down over wide areas. The National Park management came under fire from the local communities {{as a result of the}} bark beetle measures that were subsequently needed. In particular, the National Park community at Ilsenburg criticized the use of technology (e.g. harvesters). Because of the inaccessibility of the terrain there was really no other way to <b>haul</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blown tree trunks from the affected areas.|$|E
60|$|But {{time was}} precious, and Red Nelson ventured the chance. At {{the right moment}} he jibed the {{mainsail}} over and <b>hauled</b> back on <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sun will}} be down in another five minutes," [...] Captain Reuben said, [...] "and {{in half an}} hour it will be dark. The Spaniards can run quite as fast as we can--a bit faster, I think; but we can beat them, close <b>hauled.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> is falling lighter and lighter. If it was not for that, we would haul our wind and be off on the other tack, and throw all of them out. But it will be a dead calm before long, and they will be either {{lowering}} all their boats to attack us, or towing their ships up to us. If we were close under the land they might miss us, but {{they will be able to}} make us out, here. At any rate, we must hold on as we are, until <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> drops altogether." ...|$|R
5000|$|At 3:00pm <b>the</b> Aimable Eugénie <b>hauled</b> off <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> in full sail. Mediator then {{followed}} [...] Ménagère. At 5p.m. he got within gunshot of Ménagère {{and started a}} running fight. At 9:00pm Mediator, having got up with the Ménagère, was {{on the point of}} firing a full broadside. Before she could do so Ménagère struck. At this point the action ended.|$|R
60|$|Every {{thing was}} now in motion on board the Santa Maria, which went dashing ahead for another half hour, when {{she came up with}} the two other caravels, both of which had <b>hauled</b> by <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> under short canvas, and were forging slowly through the water, on {{different}} tacks, like coursers cooling themselves after having terminated a severe struggle by reaching the goal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Within an hour, or I shall {{lose the}} division. As it is, I have been deliberating on {{the propriety of}} calling back the sternmost ships, and {{collecting}} them in close squadron; for this increase and <b>hauling</b> of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> render it probable they will lose the vice-admiral, and that day-light will find the line scattered and in confusion. One mind must control the movements of ships, {{as well as of}} battalions, Sir Reginald, if they are to act in concert." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{returned}} on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering {{mainly with}} one hand, while {{with the other}} hand he held the marine glasses and studied the situation of the boats, paying particular attention to the position of the Macedonia. The only change noticeable in our boats was that they had <b>hauled</b> close on <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and were heading several points west of north. Still, I could not see the expediency of the manœuvre, for the free sea was still intercepted by the Macedonia’s five weather boats, which, in turn, had <b>hauled</b> close on <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> Thus they slowly diverged toward the west, drawing farther away from the remainder of the boats in their line. Our boats were rowing as well as sailing. Even the hunters were pulling, and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly overhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} like it well enough to go again. Here we will part. You shall <b>haul</b> on <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> being <b>the</b> lightest sailer, and make a stretch or two among these houses, until you are well to {{windward}} of yonder church. You will then have plain sailing down upon hearty Joe Joram's, where {{is to be found}} as snug an anchorage, for an honest trader, as at any inn in the Colonies. I will keep away down this hill, and, considering the difference in our rate of sailing, we shall not be long after one another in port." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, Major; I {{should not}} hope to get away, but they would think that I {{was trying to do}} so. My idea is that we should press on {{as fast as we can}} till they open fire at us; we could hold on for a bit, and then <b>haul</b> up into <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and lower our top-sails, which they will take for a proof of surrender." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the boat}} ascended on a sea, her feet touched and I {{released}} her hands. I cast off the tackles and leaped after her. I had never rowed in my life, but I {{put out the}} oars and {{at the expense of}} much effort got the boat clear of the Ghost. Then I experimented with the sail. I had seen the boat-steerers and hunters set their spritsails many times, yet this was my first attempt. What took them possibly two minutes took me twenty, but in the end I succeeded in setting and trimming it, and with the steering-oar in my hands <b>hauled</b> on <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sea-going Mediterranean peoples greatly favoured xebecs as corsairs. The corsairs {{built their}} xebecs {{with a narrow}} floor to achieve a higher speed than their victims, but with a {{considerable}} beam in order {{to enable them to}} carry an extensive sail-plan. The lateen rig of the xebec allowed the ship to sail close <b>hauled</b> to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> something that often give it an advantage in pursuit or escape. The use of oars or sweeps allowed the xebec to approach vessels who were becalmed. When used as corsairs, the xebecs carried a crew of 300 to 400 men and mounted perhaps 16 to 40 guns according to size. In peacetime operations, the xebec could transport merchandise.|$|R
50|$|Both {{ships were}} {{immediately}} cleared for action and commenced maneuvers at 0900. Captain Carden elected not to risk crossing the bows of United States to rake her, but chose instead to <b>haul</b> closer to <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> on a parallel {{course with the}} American vessel. For his part, Decatur intended to engage Macedonian from fairly long range, where his 24 pounders (11 kg) would have the advantage over the 18 pounders (8 kg) of the British.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the close}} of the long French war, Paget, while {{cruising}} in the Endymion on the coast of Spain, sighted a French ship-of-the-line in imminent danger, embayed among rocks upon a lee shore, bowsprit and foremast gone, and riding by a stream cable, her only remaining one. Though it was blowing a gale, Paget bore down to the assistance of his enemy, dropped his sheet anchor on the Frenchman's bow, buoyed the cable, and veered it athwart his hawse. This the disabled ship succeeded in getting in, and thus seven hundred lives were rescued from destruction. After performing this chivalrous action, Endymion, being herself in great peril, <b>hauled</b> to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> let go her bower anchor, club-hauled and stood off shore on the other tack.|$|R
60|$|When the West-Indiaman bore up in chase, we {{were about}} two leagues ahead of our pursuer. So far from {{lessening}} this distance, though she carried royal studding-sails, we gradually increased it to three, until, satisfied he could do nothing, {{the master of the}} strange ship took in his light sails, and <b>hauled</b> by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> again, carrying <b>the</b> late prize-crew in a direct line from England. I afterwards learned that Sennit and his companions were actually landed in the island of Barbadoes, after a pleasant passage of only twenty-six days. I make no doubt it took them much longer to get back again; for it was certain not one of them had reappeared in England six months from that day.|$|R
60|$|The chase was {{virtually}} {{where it had}} begun. The Italians were rowing up the starboard side of the ship, and we were <b>hauled</b> close on <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and slowly edging out from the ship as we worked to windward. Then they darted around her bow and began the row down her port side, and we tacked about, crossed her bow, and went plunging down <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> hot after them. And again, just as I was reaching for the skiff, it ducked under the ship's stern and out of danger. And so it went, around and around, the skiff each time just barely ducking into safety.|$|R
50|$|The frigate , {{commanded}} by Captain Robert Barlow, captured the privateer Heureux in the English Channel off Bordeaux on 5 March 1800. Heureux, of 22 long brass 12-pounders and 220 men, mistook Phoebe for an East Indiaman, and approached her. Heureux did not discover her mistake {{until she had}} arrived within point-blank musket-shot. She then wore upon the Phoebes weather bow and <b>hauled</b> to <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> on <b>the</b> same tack. Heureux opened fire {{in an attempt to}} disable Phoebes masts, rigging, and sails, and thereby enable Heureux to escape. Phoebe's broadside, however, was too powerful and Heureux was forced to strike her colours. Phoebe had three seamen killed, or mortally wounded, and three slightly wounded. Heureux had 18 men killed and 25 wounded, most of whom lost limbs. Eleven former British sailors were found serving among Heureuxs crew, and were placed in irons for transportation back to England.|$|R
60|$|The big sail was hoisted and Cayman's list {{got very}} sharp. One {{could not see}} how far the water crept up her {{inclined}} deck, because a sparkling cascade splashed across her weather bow and swelled the flood. They had <b>hauled</b> her on <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and her channels dragged in the foam. One heard the wire shrouds hum and the masts groan, and {{now and then a}} sea rolled aft and broke against the boat on deck. For all that, the captain held on, and when the sun rose Grand Canary had melted into the silver mist.|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} an hour, the Plantagenet's hull began to sink, to those on a level with it, when the Carnatic tripped her anchor, opened her canvass, shot out of <b>the</b> fleet, <b>hauled</b> by <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and {{followed}} in the admiral's wake. So accurate was the course she steered, that, half an hour after she had braced up, a hawse-bucket, which had been dropped from <b>the</b> Plantagenet in <b>hauling</b> water, was picked up. We may add, here, though {{it will be a}} little anticipating events, that the Thunderer followed the Carnatic; the Blenheim the Thunderer; the Achilles the Blenheim; the Warspite the Achilles; the Dover the Warspite; the York the Dover; the Elizabeth the York; the Dublin the Elizabeth; and the Cæsar the Dublin. But hours passed before all these ships were in motion, and hours in which we shall have some occurrences to relate that took place on shore. Still it will aid the reader in better understanding the future incidents of our tale, if we describe, at once, some of the circumstances under which all these ships got in motion.|$|R
6000|$|Several {{times in}} the course of the first hour, the {{movement}} of the schooner was arrested by the want of sufficient room to pass between projecting points in the cliffs and the edge of the ice. On two of these occasions passages were cut with the saw, the movement of the field not answering to the impatience of the sealers. At the end of that most momentous hour, however, the craft had been hauled ahead a mile and a half, and had reached a curvature in the coast where the margin of open water was more than fifty fathoms wide, and the tracking of the vessel became easy and rapid. By two o'clock the Sea Lion was at what might be called the bottom of the Great Bay, some three or four leagues from the cove, and at the place where the long low cape began to run out in a south-easterly direction. As <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> could now be felt over the rocks, the foretopsail was set, as well as the lower sails, the latter being mainly becalmed, however, by the land; when the people were all taken on board, the craft moving faster under her canvass than by means of <b>the</b> <b>hauling</b> lines. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> was very fresh, and in half an hour more the south-east cape came in sight, close as were the navigators to the rocks. Ten minutes later, the Sea Lion was under reefed sails, stretching off to the southward and eastward, in perfectly clear water! ...|$|R
50|$|Adjusting {{angle to}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> - Braces adjust the {{fore and aft}} angle of a yard (i.e. to rotate the yard laterally, fore and aft, around the mast). Sheets attach to the clew to control the sail's angle to <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> Tacks <b>haul</b> <b>the</b> clew of a square sail forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll want no pilot now. It will be {{scarcely}} {{possible to}} pass anywhere near this {{and not see}} these spars. But this discovery almost induces me to change my own plans. What say you, Rose? We have now reached the northern side of the reef, {{when it is time}} to <b>haul</b> close by <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> if we wish to beat up to Key West. There is a moral certainty, however, that the sloop-of-war is somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Dry Tortugas, which are much the most easily reached, being to leeward. We might run down to the light-house by mid-day, while it is doubtful if we could reach the town until to-morrow morning. I should like exceedingly to have five minutes conversation with the commander of the Poughkeepsie." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> {{increased}} to a gale. The trawls were up now, and the fleet lay to. It {{may be explained}} that this operation is performed by bringing a ship nearly into the eye of <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and then <b>hauling</b> <b>the</b> foresail across, and belaying the sheet. The aft sail--or mizzen--is then <b>hauled</b> tight, and <b>the</b> tiller lashed amidships. As the fore-sail pays the vessel off from <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> after sail brings her up again; and she is thus kept nearly head to sea, and the crew go below, and wait till the storm abates.|$|R
60|$|He <b>hauled</b> <b>the</b> sheet, but {{she would}} not bear the {{pressure}} when she brought <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> abeam, and seeing the water pouring in over her lowered side, Carnally let her fall off again.|$|R
60|$|In <b>the</b> afternoon, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> {{changed a}} little, backing to the north-west; the sky grew brighter, {{and he made}} out shadowy land over his {{starboard}} quarter. By and by he recognised it with a start. It was the high ridge north of Comox, and as he had run farther than he had expected, he must try to hoist the peak of <b>the</b> mainsail and <b>haul</b> her on <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> There was danger in rounding her up, {{but it must be}} faced, though a sea foamed across her as he put down his helm. Another followed, but he scrambled forward and struggled desperately to hoist the downhanging gaff. The halliards were swollen; he could scarcely keep his footing on the deluged deck that slanted steeply under him. He thought he could have mastered the banging canvas had he been fresh; but, worn out as he was, drenched with spray, and buffeted by the shattered tops of the seas, the task was beyond his power. Giving it up, he staggered back, breathless and almost nerveless, to the helm.|$|R
500|$|At 02:00 {{it became}} clear that Linois's ploy had failed and that Swiftsure was still {{following}} Atalante. More importantly, the manoeuvre had severely slowed the frigate. Although Linois <b>hauled</b> closer to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> Boyles was able to come within range at 02:30, firing his starboard guns into the smaller ship. Although his crew were exhausted by the extended chase Linois returned fire, the warships exchanging shot at long-range and the frigate suffering far more serious damage during the brief engagement. [...] By 03:25 Linois was forced to surrender, his ship's rigging in tatters and casualties mounting among his crew. [...] Boyles then provided a prize crew to the frigate and took most of the surviving French crew aboard his own ship as prisoners of war. Casualties on the French ship were heavy, with ten killed and 32 wounded from the 274 men aboard, compared to a single man lost on Swiftsure, which had also suffered some damage to its rigging.|$|R
50|$|A {{stationary}} engine drives <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> drum that <b>hauls</b> <b>the</b> wagons {{to the top}} of the inclined plane and may provide braking for descending loads. Only a single track and cable is required for this type. The {{stationary engine}} may be a steam or internal combustion engine, or may be a water wheel.|$|R
6000|$|... "True!" [...] exclaimed Wilder, {{as though}} he had just become {{conscious}} of her presence. [...] "Quite probable and very true. Mr Earing, the air is getting too heavy for that duck. Hand all your top-gallant sails, and <b>haul</b> <b>the</b> ship up closer. Should <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> hang here at east-with-southing, we may want what offing we can get." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wind is south-south-west, and we {{can have}} her up four points closer to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and still be six points off <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> As she luffs up we shall man the fore and main sheets, slack on <b>the</b> weather, and <b>haul</b> on <b>the</b> lee braces." ...|$|R
60|$|With a loud huzza, Israel <b>hauled</b> down <b>the</b> flag {{with one}} hand, while {{with the other}} he helped the now slowly gliding craft from falling off before <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He does though, {{and means}} to fight us," [...] cried another. [...] "See, he is <b>hauling</b> up <b>the</b> foot of his mainsail, {{but he wants}} to keep <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> of us." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} the Plantagenet's top-sails were {{beginning}} to dip from the cliffs, the Carnatic, the Thunderer, the Blenheim, the Achilles, and the Warspite were all stretching out in line, with intervals of quite two leagues between them, under as much canvass as they could now bear. The admiral had shortened sail the most, and was evidently allowing the Carnatic to close, most probably {{on account of the}} threatening look of the sky, to windward; while he was suffering the frigate and sloop, the Chloe and Driver, to pass ahead of him, the one on his weather, and the other on his lee bow. When the Dover weighed, the admiral's upper sail was not visible from her tops, though the Warspite's hull had not yet disappeared from her deck. She left the fleet, or the portions of it that still remained at anchor, with her fore-course set, and <b>hauled</b> by <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> under double-reefed top-sails, a single reef in her main-sail, and with her main-topgallant sail set over its proper sail. With this reduced canvass, she started away on the track of her consorts, the brine foaming under her bows, and with a heel that denoted the heavy pressure that bore on her sails. By this time, the York was aweigh, the tide had turned, and it became necessary to fill on the other tack in order to clear the land to the eastward. This altered the formation, but we will now revert to the events as they transpired on the shore, with a view to relate them more in their regular order.|$|R
50|$|Raising {{the junk}} sail {{is done by}} easing the sheets until the furled sail is blown down wind. This will take the {{pressure}} off the sail and ease the raising. Then {{it is important to}} watch the lines that will run in while the sail is raised, including <b>the</b> gaff <b>hauling</b> parrel, luff <b>hauling</b> parrel, <b>the</b> downhauls if equipped, and <b>the</b> sheets. <b>Hauling</b> <b>the</b> sail with a 3:1 or 4:1 purchase will ease the burden, but the length of halyard will consequently be very long. The fully battened sail will remain calm in the lee of the mast during <b>the</b> <b>hauling.</b> Due to <b>the</b> weight of a huge canvas sail and its many spars, some junk sailors find a winch is needed for the last few feet. There is probably already a standing tack line in place, so <b>the</b> halyard is <b>hauled</b> until <b>the</b> tack line is taut, although {{there is no need to}} tighten up the leech severely to avoid scallops as in trimming the triangular sails. After <b>hauling</b> and securing <b>the</b> halyard, the fore and aft position of the leech is set by <b>hauling</b> <b>the</b> yard <b>hauling</b> parrel until <b>the</b> halyard is close to the mast. A short pull on <b>the</b> luff <b>hauling</b> parrel may be needed to extend the middle battens toward the leech to control wrinkles in the sail. The last act is to <b>haul</b> <b>the</b> sheets and set the sail to <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|We {{made our}} easting, worked {{down through the}} doldrums, and caught a fresh breeze out of south-by-west. <b>Hauled</b> up by <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> on such a slant, we would fetch past the Marquesas far away to the westward. But the next day, on Tuesday, November 26, {{in the thick of}} a heavy squall, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> shifted {{suddenly}} to the southeast. It was the trade at last. There were no more squalls, naught but fine weather, a fair wind, and a whirling log, with sheets slacked off and with spinnaker and mainsail swaying and bellying on either side. The trade backed more and more, until it blew out of the northeast, while we steered a steady course to the southwest. Ten days of this, and on the morning of December 6, at five o'clock, we sighted land [...] "just where it ought to have been," [...] dead ahead. We passed to leeward of Ua-huka, skirted the southern edge of Nuka-hiva, and that night, in driving squalls and inky darkness, fought our way in to an anchorage in the narrow bay of Taiohae. The anchor rumbled down to the blatting of wild goats on the cliffs, and the air we breathed was heavy with the perfume of flowers. The traverse was accomplished. Sixty days from land to land, across a lonely sea above whose horizons never rise the straining sails of ships.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} after he reached the deck, Mark was fully {{employed}} in executing his orders. Sail was shortened with great rapidity, the men working with zeal and alarm, for they believed their messmate when the captain had not. Although the vessel was under top-mast studding-sails when the command to take in the canvas was given, it was not long before Mark had her under her three topsails, and these with two reefs in them, and the ship on an easy bowline, with her head to the southward. When all this was done the young man felt a good deal of relief, for the danger he had seen was ahead, and this change of course brought it nearly abeam. It is true, the breakers were still to leeward, and insomuch most dangerously situated but <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> did not blow strong enough to prevent the ship from weathering them, provided time was taken by the forelock. The Rancocus was a good, weatherly ship, nor was there sufficient sea on to make it at all difficult for her to claw off a lee shore. Desperate indeed is the situation of the vessel that has rocks or sands under her lee, with the gale blowing in her teeth, and heavy seas sending her bodily, and surely, however slowly, on the very breakers she is struggling to avoid! Captain Crutchely had not been aloft five minutes before he hailed the deck, and ordered Mark to send Bob Betts up to the cross-trees. Bob had the reputation of being the brightest look-out in the vessel, and was usually employed when land was about to be approached, or a sail was expected to be made. He went up the fore-rigging like a squirrel, and was soon at the captain's side, both looking anxiously to leeward. A few minutes after <b>the</b> ship had <b>hauled</b> by <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> both came down, stopping in the top, however, to take one more look to leeward.|$|R
60|$|The others laughed, and, after a {{good deal}} of eager {{chattering}} on the subject, it was quite generally admitted that the stranger was a bona fide craft, of some species or another, though all agreed she was not a felucca, a bombarda, or a sparanara. All this time Ghita was thoughtful and silent; quite as much so, indeed, as Tommaso himself, though from a very different motive. Nothwithstanding all the gossip, and the many ludicrous opinions of her companions, her eyes scarcely turned an instant from the lugger, on which they seemed to be riveted by a sort of fascination. Had there been one there sufficiently unoccupied to observe this interesting girl, he might have been struck with the varying expression of a countenance that was teeming with sensibility, and which too often reflected the passing emotions of its mistress's mind. Now an expression of anxiety, and even of alarm, would have been detected by such an observer, if acute enough to separate these emotions, in the liveliness of sentiment, from the more vulgar feelings of her companions; and now, something like gleamings of delight and happiness flashed across her eloquent countenance. The color came and went often; and there was an instant, during which the lugger varied her course, <b>hauling</b> to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and then falling off again, like a dolphin at its sports, when the radiance of the pleasure that glowed about her soft blue eyes rendered the girl perfectly beautiful. But none of these passing expressions were noticed by the garrulous group around the stranger female, who was left very much to the indulgence of the impulses that gave them birth, unquestioned, and altogether unsuspected.|$|R
