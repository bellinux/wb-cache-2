5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation <b>happens</b> <b>because,</b> as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E

25|$|There are two {{defects in}} this category: hot tears and hot spots. Hot tears, {{also known as}} , are {{failures}} in the casting that occur as the casting cools. This <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> the metal is weak when it is hot and the residual stresses in the material can cause the casting to fail as it cools. Proper mold design prevents this type of defect.|$|E

According to the Regional Electoral Court of São Paulo, the city had in 2014 2,881 voters, a number greater than the number of inhabitants. This <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> the city has many vacationers and students that end up transferring their electoral register to the municipality.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} can be {{used for}} the base-driven hydrolysis of esters (as in saponification), amides and alkyl halides. However, the limited solubility of sodium hydroxide in organic solvents means that the more soluble potassium hydroxide (KOH) is often preferred. Touching sodium hydroxide solution with the bare hands, while not recommended, produces a slippery feeling. This <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> the oils of the hand are converted to soap.|$|E

25|$|In principle, all {{reactions}} are reversible however in practice reactions often effectively occur {{in only one}} direction. This {{may be due to}} significantly higher concentration of reactants compared to the concentration of the products of the reaction. But more often it <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> the products of a reaction have a much lower free energy than the reactants and therefore the forward direction of a reaction is favored more.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of this}} {{construction}} is particularly common with compound subjects, as in, e.g., Eu e ela, nós fomos passear ("She and I, we went for a walk"). This <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> the traditional syntax (Eu e ela fomos passear) places a plural-conjugated verb immediately following an argument in the singular, which may sound unnatural to Brazilian ears. The redundant pronoun thus clarifies the verbal inflection in such cases.|$|E
25|$|Another {{phenomenon}} is relearning. Some studies show that, despite {{the end of}} learning and no language input, a residual learning can happen. Weltens (1989), who studied foreign language learners, identifies an increase in reading and listening comprehension. He says that it <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> a process of maturation happens. Schöpper-Grabe determines that contact and the intensity with the target language cannot be the only variable causing language attrition (Schöpper-Grabe 1998).|$|E

25|$|In {{the acute}} setting, the stroke {{volume of the}} left {{ventricle}} is increased (increased ejection fraction); this <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV {{and a decrease in}} ejection fraction. The increase in stroke volume is explained by the Frank–Starling mechanism, in which increased ventricular pre-load stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forceful.|$|E
25|$|A Tigrinya {{syllable}} may {{consist of}} a consonant-vowel or a consonant-vowel-consonant sequence. When three consonants (or one geminated consonant and one simple consonant) come together within a word, the cluster is broken up {{with the introduction of}} an epenthetic vowel ə, and when two consonants (or one geminated consonant) would otherwise end a word, the vowel i appears after them, or (when this <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> of the presence of a suffix) ə is introduced before the suffix.|$|E
25|$|Deep-water waves {{travel to}} shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's {{wavelengths}} are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water {{interacts with the}} bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls {{on the bottom of}} the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.|$|E

25|$|This <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> {{transitions}} between electronic {{states are}} mediated by a photon which cannot change overall spin. Thus optical transitions must preserve the total spin and occur between {{levels of the}} same total spin. For this reason, transitions 3E↔1A and 1A ↔ 3A are non-radiative and quench the luminescence. Whereas msnbsp&= −1 (excited state) ↔ msnbsp&= 0 (ground state) transition was forbidden {{in the absence of}} an external magnetic field, it becomes allowed when a magnetic field mixes the msnbsp&= −1 and msnbsp&= 0 levels in the ground state. As a measurable outcome of this phenomenon, luminescence intensity can be strongly modulated by magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{costs are}} those that affect females in the future. One such cost <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> sexual {{coercion}} does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice {{and can lead to}} their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not. Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.|$|E
25|$|White Kermode {{bears are}} not albinos. Rather, a single, non-synonymous {{nucleotide}} substitution in the MC1R gene causes melanin {{to not be}} produced. This mutant gene is recessive, so Kermode bears with two copies of this mutant, nonfunctional gene appear white, while bears with one copy or no copies appear black. It is possible for two black bears to mate and produce a white cub if both of these black bears are heterozygous, carrying one copy of the mutant MC1R gene, and both mutant genes are inherited by the cub. Additional genetic studies found that white Kermode bears breed more with white Kermode bears, and black Kermode bears breed more with black Kermode bears, in a phenomenon known as positive assortative mating. One hypothesis is that this <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> young bears imprint on their mother's fur color.|$|E

25|$|Kirin is a silver-haired {{student and}} a student at Seidoukan Academy. She is a shy and quiet girl who becomes the academy's top student as a 13-year-old and has not lost to anyone until Ayato {{challenges}} her a second time. Their first duel <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> Ayato stops her uncle Kouichiro from hitting her and challenges him to a duel. Kirin is his opponent and she uses her lightning speed to defeat him. She seems to be under Kouichiro's influence but her friendship with Ayato allows her to break free and Kirin eventually tells Kouichiro {{that she wants to}} decide things for herself from now on. Kirin enters the Phoenix to clear her father's name and release him. She does not have a personal lux but rather carries her katana called Senbakiri which often makes her greatly marveled by others as she tops the former top student position just by using a Senbakiri. She and Saya team up for the Phoenix tournament but they lose to Arlequint's Ardi and Rimsi in the semifinal. After Ayato's final match, she also attempts to vie for Ayato's attention by squeezing her chest on his head and declares she would make onigiri (rice balls) for him every day.|$|E
25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E
25|$|For air {{dielectric}} capacitors {{the breakdown}} field strength is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 MV/m; for oil, 15 to 25 MV/m; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric. The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by {{factors such as the}} geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy. However, in capacitors with particular dielectrics and thin metal electrodes shorts are not formed after breakdown. It <b>happens</b> <b>because</b> a metal melts or evaporates in a breakdown vicinity, isolating it {{from the rest of the}} capacitor.|$|E
30|$|There is {{also some}} work on test code best practices. In his book, Meszaros [23] enumerates a few code smells. As an example, he {{mentions}} a pattern called Obscure Test, {{which is a}} test difficult to understand at a glance. The Hard-To-Test Code, which is a code difficult to test, according to him, may <b>happen</b> <b>because</b> of a highly coupled code. He mentions that a possible {{solution to this problem}} is to make use of stubs or mock objects. He also proposes the Test Code Duplication pattern, which is the same test code repeated many times. Meszaros says it can <b>happen</b> <b>because</b> of clone code reuse but, as we discussed, it can also <b>happen</b> <b>because</b> of a bad abstraction in the production code. We reemphasize that there is a strong connection between the quality of the test code {{and the quality of the}} production code being tested.|$|R
