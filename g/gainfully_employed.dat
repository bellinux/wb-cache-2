5|$|Large {{crowds and}} an {{efficient}} organization meant that Sunday, the former resident of an orphan home, was soon netting hefty offerings. The first questions about Sunday's income were apparently raised during the Columbus, Ohio, campaign {{at the turn}} of 1912–13. During the Pittsburgh campaign a year later, Sunday spoke four times per day and effectively made $217 per sermon or $870 a day {{at a time when the}} average <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> worker made $836 per year. The major cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and New York City gave Sunday even larger offerings. Sunday donated Chicago's offering of $58,000 to Pacific Garden Mission and the $120,500 New York offering to war charities. Nevertheless, between 1908 and 1920, the Sundays earned over a million dollars; an average worker during the same period earned less than $14,000.|$|E

The resulting sharp edges gave curved objects and diagonal lines an unnatural appearance. However, when the number of available colors increased to 256, it was possible to <b>gainfully</b> <b>employ</b> antialiasing to smooth the appearance of low-resolution objects, not eliminating pixelation but making it less jarring to the eye.

40|$|Logic, Bertrand Russell once wrote, {{teaches us}} “caution in inference. ” Russell {{believed}} that we avoided inferential errors by studying philosophy, {{or what he}} called the “art of rational conjecture. ” Few contemporary social scientists would readily assent with Lord Russell’s position. Today, we learn to avoid inferential errors by learning methodology. Methodology is a lineal descendant of philosophy, especially work on inductive logic. But as various techniques became codified, they acquired intellectual autonomy and could thus be further developed and taught without explicit reference to the philosophical understandings they embodied. Just as one can study and <b>gainfully</b> <b>employ</b> the central limit theorem without any familiarity with the philosophy of probability, one can master regression models without appreciating the bold epistemic shifts that permitted their development...|$|R

Pilots progressed from light single-engined aircraft to more powerful and complicated aircraft in stages. They first qualified on one “class” of aircraft, then gained experience on that class by doing ferrying work with any and all aircraft in that class, before returning to training to qualify on the next class of aircraft. As a result, pilots made progress {{on the basis of}} their own capabilities rather than on a rigid timetable. This ensured not only that as many pilots as possible advanced, but that those that could not were still <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> flying the aircraft types on which they had qualified.|$|E
25|$|The band {{maintained}} a 120-piece block into the 1970s, when director Paul Droste expanded the band first to 160, {{and then to}} 192 members by adding another row of Sousaphones, creating a full row of snare drums, and adding tenor duo-toms to the row of bass drums and cymbals. Women were admitted into the band starting in 1973, {{after the passage of}} the 1972 Title IX legislation. Today, approximately 20–25% of the band's members are women each year. By the mid-1970s, a limitation on the maximum number of years one could be in the Marching Band was imposed. Prior to this, there were people who had spent nearly a decade playing and marching with the band. Some of these band members were <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> graduates of the university, who would continue to pay fees to try out for band. A decision was reached to limit the band to 5 years, 6 under extenuating circumstances and director approval. This allowed for more new students to try out and make the band, and also allowed for a better spirit of competition for the 225 total spots in the band.|$|E
500|$|As Attorney-General, Brownlee was {{responsible}} for administration of the Lord's Day Act, which forbade most commerce on Sundays. Charles Huestis of the Lord's Day Alliance took issue with the Edmonton Orchestra's Sunday concerts, {{on the grounds that}} by opening them only to its subscription holders it was de facto charging admission, and that by paying its musicians honoraria it was <b>gainfully</b> <b>employing</b> them in their regular professions on Sundays. Brownlee declined to prosecute, since courts had previously held that the concerts were legal. [...] Huestis retorted that as Attorney-General Brownlee should make them illegal, to which Brownlee responded that he fully appreciated the importance of the Sabbath and {{did not need to be}} lectured on the subject by Huestis. There were also complaints about farmers violating the act by working Sundays; Brownlee felt that such complaints were often more about conflicts between neighbours than preservation of the Sabbath, and prosecuted only the most gratuitous and flagrant cases.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{progress}} {{in the development and}} deployment of radio-frequency wireless communication devices has created a need for improved system performance in signal processing systems, particularly with respect to component size, battery life, power consumption and cost. These stringent requirements have generated considerable interest in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), due their distinct utility in practical applications, which stems from their small size, fast response, low power consumption, and near-seamless integrability with on-chip electronics. ^ The current work follows this trend by <b>gainfully</b> <b>employing</b> MEMS technology {{in the development of a}} chip-scale mechanical spectrum analyzer. Specifically, a microresonator array architecture, consisting of frequency mistuned microbeams that are elastically coupled through a common shuttle mass, has been developed. A form of vibration localization is exploited in this device, wherein the central shuttle mass, facilitates signal distribution, while each mistuned microbeam creates a frequency band that can be used in mechanical spectral decomposition. This novel approach offers one route to real-time spectral analysis with a simple, low-power, chip-scale device. The system is modeled and analyzed using a lumped parameter approach and then designed using the finite element method. A set of design guidelines is introduced to ensure the existence of mode localization in the device and the attainment of desired performance metrics. A recipe for a three step microfabrication procedure and possible directions for future work are also presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Dr. Fisher is also {{editor of}} the book in which this chapter is included: Research on Community-Based Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents (Research in Community and Mental Health, Volume 13), ISBN 0762311290. Summary: That {{opportunities}} for <b>gainfully</b> <b>employing</b> persons with severe mental illness should be maximized is a position around which there is virtual unanimity. But identifying obstacles to this goal and ways to overcome them is another matter – one that, in different forms, has engaged members {{of a number of}} disciplines. In this volume we bring together diverse disciplinary perspectives from psychology, psychiatry, statistics, occupational therapy and psychiatric rehabilitation research, sociology and labor economics to discuss a range of topics related to employment and mental illness. The papers included here span a range of domains, from “person – level” questions of person-environment fit to the broad societal effects of labor markets. Evaluative perspectives on various approaches that the mental health community has taken in seeking to advance the employment of persons with serious mental illness are also examined. While we will not claim to have represented every perspective currently in play in research on employment for persons with mental illness, we feel this volume represents the multi-disciplinary flavor of the small but growing research establishment in this area.

40|$|Abstract—Receive antenna {{selection}} (AS), {{in which}} a subset of a receiver’s antennas, is selected based on the instantaneous chan-nel condition, enables the receiver to benefit from having mul-tiple antenna elements despite using significantly less hardware. However, the limited hardware resources also impose unique constraints on how channel state information, which is necessary to select the antennas and decode data, can be acquired for AS. We derive novel closed-form expressions for the symbol error probability of MPSK and MQAM over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels using AS. Our analysis explicitly considers a practical and general training model that accounts for noisy channel estimates and training delays that affect both selection and data decoding. Our results show that training {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the overall performance, and can even limit the number of receive antennas that can <b>gainfully</b> be <b>employed</b> in the system.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} students' {{perceptions}} {{of the use of}} asynchronous discussion forums to facilitate case-based learning in financial accounting, measuring whether students' perceptions of the benefits of using online discussion forums are related to – and can be predicted from – students' demographic profiles. The paper commences by briefly reviewing the case study-based learning literature, followed by an in-depth review of the use of asynchronous discussion forums as a delivery platform. These pedagogical approaches are then linked to the emerging needs and learning styles of the current generation of "digital" students. Design/methodology/approach – The study, which is questionnaire-based, uses data collected from two New Zealand universities. A choice modelling approach is used to analyse the data in order to correlate students' preferences for online discussion forum usage with their profiles. Findings – The findings of the study indicate that students perceive numerous benefits to be associated with case-based online discussions, including learning from other students' opinions and perspectives, the opportunity to debate issues critically, encouragement to think independently, a heightened awareness of their communication ability and assisting them to revise prior-held views of accounting. These findings, supported by students' comments, suggest that the use of asynchronous discussion forums has created a social discourse of learning, assisting in the construction of a community of practice in financial accounting. The choice modelling analysis of the results indicates that the students most likely to be positively disposed towards discussion groups are older, male, domestic students, who have English as a first language. Of the international student respondents, Asian students perceive the forum as being most useful. Originality/value – The study provides evidence that accounting students perceive value from the use of asynchronous discussion forums. Furthermore, the choice modelling identifies which particular groups of students may benefit most from the use of online discussion forums. The findings suggest that accounting educators may <b>gainfully</b> <b>employ</b> this learning technique in their courses as a means of developing critical thinking skills, building a heightened awareness of the student's ability to communicate and enhancing overall student engagement and participation in course work. 28 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy {{in combination with}} partial least-squares (PLS) regression was investigated to predict the soil sorption (distribution) coefficient (K(d)) of a nonionic pesticide (diuron). A calibration set of 101 surface soils collected from South Australia was utilized for reference sorption data and MIR spectra. Principal component analysis (PCA) {{was performed on the}} spectra to detect spectral outliers. The MIR-PLS model was developed and validated by dividing the initial data set into four validation sets. The model resulted in a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 69, a standard error (SE) of 5. 57, and a residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 1. 63. The normalized sorption coefficient for the organic compound (K(oc)) approach, on the other hand, resulted in R 2, SE, and RPD values of 0. 42, 7. 26, and 1. 25, respectively. However, the significant statistical difference between the two models was mainly due to two outliers detected via PCA. Apart from spectral outliers, the performance of the two models was essentially similar {{for the rest of the}} calibration set. Outlier detection by the MIR-PLS model may <b>gainfully</b> be <b>employed</b> as a tool for improving prediction of K(d).

40|$|The first Chair of Occupational Health in the United Kingdom was {{established}} by Manchester University in 1945 and held by Ronald Lane, a consultant physician and experienced factor doctor. In his department, occupational medicine was taught as a clinical discipline to both undergraduates and postgraduates. Research was based mostly on clinical observation of workpeople in the field or as hospital outpatients. Although work has become less hazardous, with major risks like pneumoconiosis and lead poisoning brought under control by better occupational hygiene and more effective epidemiology, {{there is still much}} work related illness and injury. Promoting occupational health in its broadest sense still depends on clinical skills to assess fitness for work and to identify responses to adverse factors in the environment. A university department, through its teaching and research, needs to ensure that occupational health is practised as a clinical discipline. Opportunities for research are extensive and include: (1) identifying the extent and severity of injury and illness due to adverse environmental agents and psychosocial factors; (2) assessing fitness among the disabled and the elderly in an aging population enabling them to be <b>gainfully</b> or otherwise <b>employed,</b> (3) improving techniques for measuring work exposures and human responses to adverse work factors, and (4) evaluating intervention procedures. To fulfil its teaching and research commitments, an occupational health department has to maintain contacts with other disciplines in the university and with the industrial world outside. Isolation can be fatal. Academic departments of occupational health offer information to employers, trade unions, and health professionals seeking advice on health and safety problems. Such an Information and Advisory service provides topics for research and earns an income. It should not become the main activity otherwise teaching and research will suffer...|$|R
