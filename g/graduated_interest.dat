40|$|Finding {{qualified}} entry-level transportation engineers is a {{major concern}} for employers of transportation professionals. The problem has two dimensions: (1) the pool of engineering <b>graduates</b> <b>interested</b> in transportation careers has been shrinking in recent years; and (2) employers indicate that entry-level engineers lack significant exposure to transportation engineering methodologies. The Institute of Transportation Engineers, along with other professional organizations, universities, and engineering firms and agencies, has initiated aggressive programs to attract talented individuals to transportation engineering careers. The problem’s second dimension, however, has generated heated debate between practitioners and educators. This debate has centered on the issue of undergraduate program content for an individual preparing for a career in transportation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the issues relevant to undergraduate preparation of transportation engineers and to develop recommendations for both practitioners and educators that will result in program improvement and increased interest in the transportation profession...|$|R
