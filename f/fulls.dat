25|$|In February 2010, the HPA ran {{a massive}} fundraiser {{to support those}} in dire need after the tragic event of the Haiti earthquake. Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those {{a part of the}} Harry Potter Fandom) {{performed}} and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up for bid were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor Tom Felton, handmade earrings from actress Evanna Lynch, and a one thousand word story about whatever the winner wishes it to be written by Maureen Johnson and John Green. The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane <b>fulls</b> of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans. Ophelia Dahl, the daughter of the late British author Roald Dahl was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{built to}} hold pirates, the strong room {{was just a}} few yards from the prison's sewer. It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh air—the smell was {{described}} as [...] "noisome"—and was full of rats and sometimes [...] "several barrow <b>fulls</b> of dung". Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the [...] "best room on the Common side of the jail", said another. This despite the court's having heard that one prisoner's left side had mortified from lying on the wet floor, and that a rat had eaten the nose, ear, cheek and left eye of another.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor a <b>full</b> semi-AFL K, B(K) {{is defined}} as the family of {{languages}} generated by all K-extended basic macro grammars, while H(K) ⊆ B(K) is the smallest <b>full</b> hyper-AFL containing K; a <b>full</b> basic-AFL is a <b>full</b> AFL K such that B(K) = K (hence every <b>full</b> basic-AFL is a <b>full</b> hyper-AFL). For any <b>full</b> semi-AFL K, K is a <b>full</b> basic-AFL if and only if B(K) is substitution closed if and only if H(K) is a <b>full</b> basic-AFL. If K is not a <b>full</b> basic-AFL, then the smallest <b>full</b> basic-AFL containing K is the union of an infinite hierarchy of <b>full</b> hyper-AFLs. If K is a <b>full</b> principal basic-AFL (such as INDEX, the family of indexed languages), then the largest <b>full</b> AFL properly contained in K is a <b>full</b> basic-AFL.
