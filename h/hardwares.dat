40|$|The new {{international}} standard for video compression named H. 264 / MPEG- 4 Part 10 offers significantly better video compression efficiency than previous international standards. Integer-pixel motion estimation {{is the most}} compute-intensive part of an H. 264 video encoder. In order to increase the performance of integer-pixel motion estimation, sub-pixel (half-pixel and quarter-pixel) accurate variable block size motion estimation is performed. In this thesis, we developped an efficient hardware architecture for real-time implementation of sub-pixel accurate variable block size ME for H. 264 video coding standard. We have considered several alternative designs and decided on this architecture based on a cost/performance analysis. The proposed hardware includes novel half-pixel and quarter-pixel interpolation and search <b>hardwares</b> designed for each block size. In the proposed hardware, half-pixel interpolation <b>hardwares</b> are shared by half-pixel search <b>hardwares</b> for reducing area. The proposed design performs quarter-pixel interpolation dynamically for {{reducing the amount of}} computation performed for quarter-pixel interpolation and therefore reducing the power consumption. This hardware is designed to be used as part of a complete H. 264 video coding system for portable applications. The proposed hardware architecture is implemented in Verilog HDL. The Verilog RTL code is verified to work at 60 MHz in a Xilinx Virtex II FPGA. The FPGA implementation can process 34 VGA frames (640 x 480) per second...|$|E

The {{advent of}} digital <b>hardwares</b> {{has made it}} {{feasible}} to implement many communication system components digitally. With the exception of frequency down conversion, the proposed low data rate communication system uses digital <b>hardwares</b> completely. Although the system is designed primarily for deep space communications with large frequency uncertainty and low signal-to-noise ratio, it is also suitable for other low data rate applications with time-shared operation among a number of channels. Emphasis is placed on the fast Fourier transform receiver and the automatic frequency control via digital filtering. The speed available from the digital system allows sophisticated signal processing to reduce frequency uncertainty and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The practical limitations of the system such as the finite register length are examined. It is concluded that the proposed all-digital system is not only technically feasible but also has potential cost reducation over the existing receiving systems...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{architecture}} for large-scale regular expression matching, called dynamically reconfigurable bit-parallel NFA architecture (Dynamic BP-NFA), which allows dynamic loading of regular expressions on-the-fly {{as well as}} efficient pattern matching for fast data streams. This is the first dynamically reconfigurable hardware with guaranteed performance for the class of extended patterns, which is a subclass of regular expressions consisting of union of characters and its repeat. This class allows operators such as character classes, gaps, optional characters, and bounded and unbounded repeats of character classes. The key to our architecture {{is the use of}} bit-parallel pattern matching approach, in which the information of an input non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) is first compactly encoded in bit-masks stored in a collection of registers and block RAMs. Then, the NFA is efficiently simulated by a fixed circuitry using bitwise Boolean and arithmetic operations consuming one input character per clock regardless of the actual contents of an input text.
