40|$|AlMgSi alloys, {{frequently}} used as extruded profiles, generally show excellent corrosionresistance, as Mg {{is incorporated in}} the protective oxide layer, thus providing additionalstabilization. However, localized corrosion forms such as intergranular corrosion (IGC) and pitting corrosion may occur {{as a result of}} improper heat treatment or unfortunate alloying composition. In this study, four variants of AA 6082 have been subjected to an accelerated IGC test in addition to Cyclic Acidified Synthetic Sea Water (Fog) Testing (SWAAT). Moreover,the effects of welding on corrosion behaviour have been examined,and alloys have been subjected to both MIG welding, friction stir welding (FSW) and weld simulation. The effect of Cu content and ageing on the susceptibility to IGC and pitting corrosion have also been studied. Results from this study revealed significant pitting corrosion on all variants, and the severity was found to increase with increasing Cu content and ageing time. Moreover, the heat affected zone of samples welded by FSW and MIG displayed higher corrosion resistance as compared to the weld and the base metal. <b>Despite</b> <b>such</b> <b>observations,</b> no significant variation in corrosion potential as a function of distance from the weld could be observed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} - In {{the context of}} an ageing population, increasing numbers of older people with long-term conditions are presenting to secondary health care facilities in the United Kingdom having experienced a fall or fall-related injury. <b>Despite</b> <b>such</b> <b>observations,</b> falls and long-term conditions have traditionally been regarded as entirely separate entities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the process of behaviour change in a small sample of older people with the fall-associated chronic liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) receiving either a standard or an enhanced programme of strength and balance training (SBT). Methods - A qualitatively driven mixed-methods approach was employed that juxtaposed semi-structured interviews with graphical representations of patient-reported outcome measures collected during the course of an experimental case series in nine older people with the fall-associated chronic liver disease PBC. Results - Participants receiving both the standard and enhanced intervention completed the programme of SBT as instructed throughout the course of the case series. However, only the enhanced intervention, which focused on self-determination and self-management support, was associated with continued active participation on completion of the programme. Conclusions - Longer, but not necessarily more intensive, periods of clinical intervention are necessary to support individuals at risk of falling to move through the incremental stages of behaviour change. Effective self-management support should focus on the development of a wide range of strategies and behaviours to empower older people with long-term conditions develop an ongoing active commitment to SBT...|$|E
40|$|Despite mixed {{performance}} {{reviews and}} experiences, {{customer relationship management}} (CRM) {{is among the most}} widely used and discussed management ideas by managers around the world. Commentators have noted that CRM has become “big business” and that there are many commercial actors selling CRM solutions. <b>Despite</b> <b>such</b> <b>observations,</b> little academic research has examined CRM using theories about management fads and fashions. Using management fashion theory as an analytical lens, this paper casts lights on the emergence and evolution of the market for CRM. The analysis of the supply side of CRM shows that many different actors have been involved, e. g. consulting firms, software vendors, industry analyst firms, and conference organizers. On the demand side, the interest in and usage of CRM remains relatively high despite mixed implementation experiences and failure cases. Based on the analysis, CRM has yet to enter into a downturn phase as is typical of transient management fashions. The longevity and staying power of the CRM fashion can partly be explained by institutional activities carried out by software firms, consultants, and IT industry analysts in training and certifying users, and in developing various complementary products and services. However, similar to what has been observed in relation to other management idea movements, a continuing high number of high-profile failure cases could “wear out” CRM. Therefore, the extent to which organizations are able to capitalize on CRM will likely shape the future trajectory of the CRM idea...|$|E

The present study examined individual differences for a visual anticipation task. Experienced association football goalkeepers attempted to intercept penalty kicks taken with deceptive and non-deceptive kicking actions. Data revealed that differences in the action capabilities of goalkeepers affected the timing and accuracy of movement response behaviors. Faster goalkeepers tended to wait until later before initiating movement in comparison with slower goalkeepers. The study of affordances in sport environments offers a theoretical framework with which to overcome some of the reported methodological limitations in the visual anticipation literature...|$|R

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{deskilling}} impact of technology on factory workers, especially since the publication of Harry Braverman‟s Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century. This paper seeks to complicate the simplistic notion that technological advances in factories deskill workers. Focusing on women assemblers who were employed in large numbers in the 1980 s in Malaysian factories for their alleged „feminine skills‟, such as manual dexterity, and low labor costs, this paper argues that technological changes do not deskill women workers per se. Rather, these changes require new skills. As such, some women are able to find better employment in, for instance, clerical and managerial occupations. Others, however, lose out when changes are implemented because employers no longer associate these new skills, such as numeracy and literacy, with women. With these changes, they have to compete with men, resulting in the decreased proportion of women assemblers and a lowering of women‟s wages. It is also observed that some women move out of the formal labor force into casual work as companies outsource to home-workers to reduce production costs. As <b>such,</b> <b>despite</b> the <b>observation</b> that technology does not deskill per se, women workers bear the negative consequences of technological changes. ii...|$|R
40|$|Retinoic acid (RA), {{the major}} biologically active form of vitamin A, plays {{important}} roles in regulating {{a broad range of}} biological processes. Progressive loss of RARs is associated with skin carcinogenesis both in human and animals. <b>Despite</b> <b>such</b> <b>observations,</b> the biological significance of RAR loss in skin carcinogenesis has not yet been clarified. To this end, we established keratinocyte cell lines deficient in RARalpha, RARgamma, or both and employed a well-established tumorigenesis model to investigate whether loss of RARs is causally related to skin tumorigenesis. We found that RARgamma is the major RAR subtype mediating the growth and AP- 1 inhibitory effects of RA on keratinocytes in vitro. Consistent with this observation, loss of RARgamma, but not RARalpha, predisposed keratinocytes to tumor formation, suggesting that RARgamma may act as a tumor suppressor. Reconstitution of RARs in the RARalphagamma-/- keratinocytes inhibited their tumorigenic potential, further proving that RARs have tumor suppressive effects. As expected, expression of dnRARalpha resulted in profound epidermal defects. Intriguingly, dnRAalphaDBD caused a virtually identical skin phenotype, suggesting that dnRARalpha acts to affect epidermal development via a DNA-binding-independent mechanism. The epidermal phenotype of these transgenic mice is reminiscent of that seen in the p 63 -/- mice, and p 63 expression was indeed significantly reduced in the epidermis expressing dnRARalpha or dnRARalphaDBD, suggesting that downregulation of p 63 by dnRARalpha may be attributable to the epidermal phenotypes associated with the transgenic mice. These observations also suggest that DNA-binding is not required for dnRARalpha to attenuate p 63 expression in the epidermis. Consistent with these observations, I also found that p 63 is indeed not a RAR-target, as no overt changes in p 63 expression were observed in the RARalphagamma-/- epidermis, which appeared normal.

40|$|Muslim {{family members}} {{constitute}} a significant migration {{flow to the}} UK (Kofman et al., 2013). <b>Despite</b> <b>such</b> <b>observations,</b> this form of mobility is under-explored in geographic scholarship on migration. Accordingly, this thesis examines the subjective experiences of migration {{of a small group}} of Muslim women, who migrated either with or to join their families in Scotland. Participant observation, focus groups and the life narratives of eight women are used to gain an in-depth understanding of both the reasons for and the consequences of migration for this group of Muslim women. In addition, this thesis examines the role of a secular community-based organisation in supporting migrants in their everyday lives. Drawing on conceptual approaches to migration, this study reveals diverse and complex motivations among participants in “choosing” to migrate. Far from “victims” or “trailing wives”, participants privileged their children’s needs but also the possibility to transform their sense of self through migration. The study draws attention to the struggles of daily life in Scotland where, bereft of extended family, the synchronisation of migration with childbirth resulted in some participants enduring years of isolation. Such struggles resulted in changes in the home, with husbands providing both physical and emotional support. The experience of migration affected the women’s religious identities, providing solace as well as a way to assert belonging in Scotland by drawing on Islamic theology. The community-based organisation provided a “safe space”, bridging the secular and non-secular and offering women the chance to socialise, learn and volunteer. The study shows that volunteering provided not only a way into paid work but also shaped women’s subjectivities and home lives. However, the re-direction of national government funding towards “Muslim problems” threatens to undermine the organisation’s ability to continue to meet the local needs of Muslim migrant women...|$|E
40|$|A {{traditional}} view purports that primates are ‘visual ’ {{animals with}} a poorly developed {{sense of smell}} (King and Fobes, 1974; Walker and Jennings, 1991; Farbman, 1992; Rouquier et al., 2000). This view is mainly, if not exclusively, based on an interpretation of neuroanatomical features such as the relative size of olfactory brain structures or the absolute size of olfactory epithelia (Stephan et al., 1988; Brown, 2001). However, physiological evidence supporting {{a positive correlation between}} allometric measures of neuroanatomical features and olfactory performance is largely lacking (De Winter and Oxnard, 2000; Schoenemann, 2001). In recent years, an increasing number of behavioural observations call into question the still widely held belief that olfaction is of only little, if any, behavioural relevance to primates and concomitantly that members of this order of mammals have generally only poor olfactory capabilities. There is now evidence from a number of primate species for olfactory involvement in the identification and selection of food (Bolen and Green, 1997; Ueno, 1994) and in social behaviours such as the establishment and maintenance of rank (Kappeler, 1998), territorial defence (Mertl-Millhollen, 1986), identification of sexual partners (Heymann, 1998), recognition of group members (Epple et al., 1993) and communication of reproductive status (Smith and Abbott, 1998). <b>Despite</b> <b>such</b> <b>observations,</b> experimental investigations of olfactory performance in non-human primates have been sparse. Laska and Hudson (1993 a) introduced a new testing paradigm which, for the first time, allowed the olfactory performance of a non-human primate species to be assessed using psychophysical methods. Subsequent studies demonstrated that squirrel monkeys possess highly developed olfactory discrimination abilities for structurally related monomolecular substances (Laska and Freyer, 1997; Laska and Teubner, 1998; Laska et al., 1999 a,b), for artificial odour mixtures (Laska and Hudson, 1993 b) and for conspecific urine odours (Laska and Hudson, 1995). Further, these studies showed that Saimiri sciureus has an excellent long-term memory for odours (Laska et al., 1996), a well-develope...|$|E
