40|$|Obesity {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the most important risk factors for a variety of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension/cardiovascular diseases, steatosis/hepatitis, and cancer. Keishibukuryogan (KBG, Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan in Chinese) is a traditional Chinese/Japanese (Kampo) medicine that has been known to improve blood circulation and is also known for its anti-inflammatory or scavenging effect. In this study, we evaluated the effect of KBG in two distinct rodent models of obesity driven by either a genetic (SHR/NDmcr-cp rat model) or dietary (high-fat diet-induced mouse obesity model) mechanism. Although there was no significant effect on the body composition in either the SHR rat or the <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> models, KBG treatment significantly decreased the serum level of leptin and liver TG level in the <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse,</b> but not in the SHR rat model. Furthermore, a lower fat deposition in liver and a smaller size of adipocytes in white adipose tissue were observed in the DIO mice treated with KBG. Importantly, we further found downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the KBG-treated liver, along with decreased liver TG and cholesterol level. Our present data experimentally support in fact that KBG can be an attractive Kampo medicine to improve obese status through a regulation of systemic leptin level and/or lipid metabolism...|$|E

40|$|Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) {{is highly}} {{effective}} in reversing obesity and associated diabetes. Recent observations in humans suggest a contributing role of increased circulating bile acids in mediating such effects. Here {{we use a}} diet-induced obesity (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model and compare metabolic remission when bile flow is diverted through a gallbladder anastomosis to jejunum, ileum or duodenum (sham control). We find that only bile diversion to the ileum results in physiologic changes similar to RYGB, including sustained improve-ments in weight, glucose tolerance and hepatic steatosis despite differential effects on hepatic gene expression. Circulating free fatty acids and triglycerides decrease while bile acids increase, particularly conjugated tauro-b-muricholic acid, an FXR antagonist. Activity of the hepatic FXR/FGF 15 signalling axis is reduced and associated with altered gut microbiota. Thus bile diversion, independent of surgical rearrangement of the gastrointestinal tract, imparts significant weight loss accompanied by improved glucose and lipid homeostasi...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity-related adipose {{inflammation}} {{has been}} {{thought to be}} a causal factor for the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Infiltrated macrophages in adipose tissue of obese animals and humans are an important source for inflammatory cytokines. Clodronate liposomes can ablate macrophages by inducing apoptosis. In this study, we aim to determine whether peritoneal injection of clodronate liposomes has any beneficial effect on systemic glucose homeostasis/insulin sensitivity and whether macrophage content in visceral adipose tissue will be reduced in diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in lean and <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> Macrophage content in visceral adipose tissue, metabolic parameters, glucose and insulin tolerance, adipose and liver histology, adipokine and cytokine production were examined. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study was also performed to assess systemic insulin sensitivity. Peritoneal injection of clodronate liposomes significantly reduced blood glucose and insulin levels in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> Systemic glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were mildly improved in both lean and <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> treated with clodronate liposomes by intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection. Hepatosteatosis was dramatically alleviated and suppression of hepatic glucose output was markedly increased in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> treated with clodronate liposomes. Macrophage content in visceral adipose tissue of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> was effectively decreased without affecting subcutaneous adipose tissue. Interestingly, levels of insulin sensitizing hormone adiponectin, including the high molecular weight form, were significantly elevated in circulation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Intraperitoneal injection of clodronate liposomes reduces visceral adipose tissue macrophages, improves systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice,</b> which can be partially attributable to increased adiponectin levels...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological studies {{indicate}} that obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes are important comorbidities of patients with ischemic heart disease and increase mortality and development {{of congestive heart failure}} after myocardial infarction. Although ob/ob and db/db mice are commonly used to study obesity with insulin resistance or diabetes, mutations in the leptin gene or its receptor are rarely the cause of obesity in humans, which is instead primarily a consequence of dietary and lifestyle factors. Therefore, we used a murine model of diet-induced obesity to examine physiological effects of obesity and the inflammatory and healing response of diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice</b> after ischemia–reperfusion injury. <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> developed hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, with significant ectopic lipid deposition in the heart and cardiac hypertrophy in the absence of significant changes in blood pressure.

40|$|Aim: Glucagon is an {{essential}} regulator of hepatic glucose production (HGP), which provides an alternative therapeutic target for managing type 2 diabetes with glucagon antagonists. We studied {{the effect of a}} novel human monoclonal antibody against glucagon receptor (GCGR), NPB 112, on glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice.</b> Methods: The glucose-lowering efficacy and safety of NPB 112 were investigated in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> with human GCGR for 11 weeks, and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study was conducted to measure HGP. Results: Single intraperitoneal injection of NPB 112 with 5 mg/kg effectively decreased blood glucose levels in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> for 5 days. A significant reduction in blood glucose was observed in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> treated with NPB 112 at a dose $ 5 mg/kg for 6 weeks, and its glucose-lowering effect was dose-dependent. Long-term administration of NPB 112 also caused a mild 29 % elevation in glucagon level, which was returned to the normal range after discontinuation of treatment. The clamp study showed that <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> injected with NPB 112 at 5 mg/kg were more insulin sensitive than control mice, indicating amelioration of insulin resistance by treatment with NPB 112. <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> treated with NPB 112 showed a significant improvement in the ability of insulin to suppress HGP, showing a 33 % suppression (from 8. 3 mg/kg/min to 5. 6 mg/kg/min) compared to the 2 % suppression (from 9. 8 mg/kg/min to 9. 6 mg/kg/min) in control mice.

40|$|Introduction Effective therapies for {{obesity and}} {{diabetes}} are still lacking. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether a single intravenous infusion of syngeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) can reduce obesity, lower insulin resistance, and improve glucose homeostasis in a high-fat diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model. Methods Seven-week-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks to generate the <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> model. Mice were given a single intravenous infusion of ex vivo expanded syngeneic ASCs at 2 [*]×[*] 10 6 cells per mouse. DIO or CHOW mice injected with saline were used as controls. Body weights, blood glucose levels, glucose, and insulin tolerance test results were obtained before and 2 and 6 weeks after cell infusion. Triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and insulin levels in serum were measured. Expressions of genes related to insulin resistance, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and insulin receptor (InsR), and inflammation (IL- 6, F 4 / 80, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2, or NOD 2), were measured in livers at mRNA level by real-time-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Beta-cell mass in pancrheases from CHOW, DIO, and DIO[*]+[*]ASC mice was quantified. GFP + ASCs were injected, and the presence of GFP + cells in livers and pancreases was determined. Results DIO mice that had received ASCs showed reduced body weights, reduced blood glucose levels, and increased glucose tolerance. ASC treatment was found to reduce TG levels and increase serum HDL levels. In livers, less fat cell deposition was observed, as were increased expression of InsR and PPARγ and reduction in expressions of IL- 6 and F 4 / 80. Treated mice showed well-preserved pancreatic β-cell mass with reduced expression of F 4 / 80 and TNF-α compared with DIO controls. GFP + cells were found in liver and pancreas tissues at 1 and 2 weeks after cell injection. Conclusions ASC therapy is effective in lowering blood glucose levels and increasing glucose tolerance in DIO mice. The protective effects of ASCs arise at least in part from suppression of inflammation in the liver. In addition, ASCs are associated with better-preserved pancreatic β-cell mass...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the antiobesity effect of an extract of the Fomitopsis pinicola Jeseng-containing formulation (FAVA), which {{is a combination of}} four natural components: Fomitopsis pinicola Jeseng; Acanthopanax senticosus; Viscum album coloratum; and Allium tuberosum. High-fat diet- (HFD-) fed male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were treated with FAVA (200 [*]mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks to monitor the antiobesity effect and amelioration of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Body and white adipose tissue (WAT) weights were reduced in FAVA-treated mice, and a histological examination showed an amelioration of fatty liver in FAVA-treated mice without decreasing food consumption. Additionally, FAVA reduced serum lipid profiles, leptin, and insulin levels compared with the HFD control group. The FAVA extract suppressed lipogenic mRNA expression levels from WAT concomitantly with the cholesterol biosynthesis level in the liver. These results demonstrate the inhibitory effects of FAVA on obesity and NAFLD in the diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model.

Food intake was measured at intervals 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h postinjection. In addition, we tested in lean mice the influence of [Gly 2]GLP 2 on gastric emptying {{and the effects of}} GLP 1 alone or in combination with [Gly 2]GLP 2 on food intake. [Gly 2]GLP 2 dose dependently and significantly inhibited food intake in lean and <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> The reduction of food intake occurred in the first hour postinjection and it was sustained until 4 h postinjection in lean mice while it was sustained until 2 h postinjection in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> GLP 2 significantly inhibited food intake in both lean and <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> but only in the first hour postinjection. The efficiency of [Gly 2]GLP 2 or GLP 2 in suppressing food intake was significantly weaker in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> compared with lean animals. The [Gly 2]GLP 2 anorectic actions were blocked by the GLP 2 R antagonist GLP 2 (3 – 33) or by the GLP 1 R antagonist exendin (9 – 39). The coadministration of [Gly 2]GLP 2 and GLP 1 did not cause additive effects. [Gly 2]GLP 2 decreased the gastric emptying rate.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{data have}} linked obesity with immune dysfunction. It {{is known that}} physical exercise with dietary control has beneficial effects on immune function and the comorbidities of obesity. However, the mechanisms underlying the improvement of immune function in obesity after physical exercise with dietary control remain unknown. Here we show that moderate daily exercise with dietary control restores the impaired cytokine responses in diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice</b> and improves the resolution of Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis. This restoration of immune responses {{is related to the}} reduction of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) and TNF. Both FFAs and TNF induce an Akt inhibitor, carboxyl-terminal modulator protein (CTMP). The expression of CTMP is also observed increased in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMΦ) from <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> and restored after moderate daily exercise with dietary control. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2), which increases CTMP induction by FFAs, is inhibited in BMMΦ from <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> or after either FFA or TNF treatment, but unexpectedly is not restored by moderate daily exercise with dietary control. Furthermore, BMMΦ from <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> display reduced histone H 3 (Lys- 9) acetylation and NF-κB recruitment to TNF, IL- 10, and TLR 2 promoters after P. gingivalis infection. However, moderate daily exercise with dietary control restores these defects at promoters for TNF and IL- 10, but not for TLR 2. Thus, metabolizing FFAs and TNF by moderate daily exercise with dietary control improves innate immune responses to infection in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> via restoration of CTMP and chromatin modification...|$|R
40|$|Thymoquinone, {{a natural}} {{occurring}} quinone {{and the main}} bioactive component of plant Nigella sativa, undergoes intracellular redox cycling and re-oxidizes NADH to NAD+. TQ administration (20 mg/kg/bw/day) to the Diet-Induced Obesity (DIO) mice reduced their diabetic phenotype by decreasing fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin levels, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as evaluated by oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests (OGTT and ITT). Furthermore, TQ decreased serum cholesterol levels and liver triglycerides, increased protein expression of phosphorylated Akt, decreased serum levels of inflammatory markers resistin and MCP- 1, and decreased NADH/NAD+ ratio. These changes were paralleled {{by an increase in}} phosphorylated SIRT- 1 and AMPKα in liver and phosphorylated SIRT- 1 in skeletal muscle. TQ also increased insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant HepG 2 cells via a SIRT- 1 -dependent mechanism. These findings are consistent with the TQ-dependent re-oxidation of NADH to NAD+, which stimulates glucose and fatty acid oxidation and activation of SIRT- 1 -dependent pathways.

40|$|Objective—Microarray studies {{identified}} Ch 12 :orf 39 (Spexin) as {{the most}} dysregulated gene in obese human fat. Therefore we examined its role in obesity pathogenesis. Design and Methods—Spexin effects on food intake, meal patterns, body weight, Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER), and locomotor activity were monitored electronically in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice or Wistar rats with dietary-induced obesity (DIO). Its effects on adipocyte [3 H]-oleate uptake were determined. Results—In humans, Spexin gene expression was down-regulated 14. 9 -fold in obese omental and subcutaneous fat. Circulating Spexin changed in parallel, correlating (r = − 0. 797) with Leptin. In rats, Spexin (35 μg/kg/day s. c) reduced caloric intake ~ 32 % with corresponding weight loss. Meal patterns were unaffected. In mice, Spexin (25 μg/kg/day i. p.) significantly reduced the RER at night, and increased locomotion. Spexin incubation in vitro significantly inhibited facilitated fatty acid (FA) uptake into <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> adipocytes. Conditioned taste aversion testing (70 μg/kg/day i. p.) demonstrated no aversive Spexin effects. Conclusions—Spexin gene expression is markedly down-regulated in obese human fat.

40|$|Obesity is now {{recognized}} as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and is called as metabolic inflammation. Delta- 5 desaturase (D 5 D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA) to arachidonic acid (AA). Thus, D 5 D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti-obesity effect of a D 5 D selective inhibitor (compound- 326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model. In vivo D 5 D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA/DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound- 326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily energy expenditure was also observed following administration of compound- 326, in line with sustained body weight loss. These data indicate that the novel D 5 D selective inhibitor, compound- 326, {{will be a new}} class of drug for the treatment of obese and diabetic patients...|$|E
40|$|Obesity and {{diabetes}} are frequently associated with cardiovascular disease. When a normal heart {{is subjected to}} brief/sublethal repetitive ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), adaptive responses are activated to preserve cardiac structure and function. These responses include {{but are not limited}} to alterations in cardiac metabolism, reduced calcium responsiveness, and induction of antioxidant enzymes. In a model of ischemic cardiomyopathy inducible by brief repetitive I/R, we hypothesized that dysregulation of these adaptive responses in diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice</b> would contribute to enhanced myocardial injury. DIO C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were subjected to 15 min of daily repetitive I/R while under short-acting anesthesia, a protocol that results in the development of fibrotic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac lipids and candidate gene expression were analyzed at 3 days, and histology at 5 days of repetitive I/R. Total free fatty acids (FFAs) in the cardiac extracts of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> were significantly elevated, reflecting primarily the dietary fatty acid (FA) composition. Compared with lean controls, cardiac FA oxidation (FAO) capacity of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> was significantly higher, concurrent with increased expression of FA metabolism gene transcripts. Following 15 min of daily repetitive I/R for 3 or 5 days, <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> exhibited increased susceptibility to I/R and, in contrast to lean mice, developed microinfarction, which was associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response.

Here we aimed to identify probiotics with potential antiobesity activity among 88 lactic acid bacterial strains via in vitro screening assays, and a Lactobacillus plantarum strain K 21 was found to harbor abilities required for hydrolyzing bile salt, reducing cholesterol, and inhibiting the accumulation of lipid in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. Furthermore, effects of K 21 on diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice</b> were examined. Male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice received a normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD with K 21 administration (109 [*]CFU in 0. 2 [*]mL[*]PBS/day) for eight weeks. Supplementation of K 21, but not placebo, appeared to alleviate body weight gain and epididymal fat mass accumulation, reduce plasma leptin levels, decrease cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and mitigate liver damage in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> Moreover, the hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) related to adipogenesis was significantly downregulated in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> by K 21 intervention. We also found that K 21 supplementation strengthens intestinal permeability and modulates the amount of Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Clostridium perfringens in the cecal contents of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> In conclusion, our results suggest that dietary intake of K 21 protects against the onset of HFD-induced obesity through multiple mechanisms of action...|$|R

We aimed to explore acute and sub-chronic effects of peripheral Oxt treatment via different routes on food intake and energy balance. Intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Oxt concentration-dependently decreased food intake in mice. Ip Oxt injection induced c-Fos expression in the hypothalamus and brain stem including arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Subcutaneous (sc) injection of Oxt suppressed food intake in normal and high fat diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice.</b> Daily sc injection of Oxt for 17 days in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> reduced food intake for 6 days and body weight for the entire treatment period and additional 9 days after terminating Oxt.

This study {{is aimed at}} determining the mechanisms by which bilirubin treatment reduces obesity and insulin resistance in a diet-induced obesity (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model. DIO mice were treated with bilirubin or vehicle for 14 days. Body weights, plasma glucose, and insulin tolerance tests were performed prior to, immediately, and 7 weeks post-treatment. Serum lipid, leptin, adiponectin, insulin, total and direct bilirubin levels were measured. Expression of factors involved in adipose metabolism including sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP- 1), insulin receptor (IR), and PPARγ in liver were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot. Compared to controls, bilirubin-treated mice exhibited reductions in body weight, blood glucose levels, total cholesterol (TC), leptin, total and direct bilirubin, and increases in adiponectin and expression of SREBP- 1, IR, and PPARγ mRNA. The improved metabolic control achieved by bilirubin-treated mice was persistent: at two months after treatment termination, bilirubin-treated DIO mice remained insulin sensitive with lower leptin and higher adiponectin levels, together with increased PPARγ expression. These results indicate that bilirubin regulates cholesterol metabolism, adipokines and PPARγ levels, which likely contribute to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in DIO mice.

40|$|Obesity is a {{major public}} health problem and is often {{associated}} with type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. Leptin is the crucial adipostatic hormone that controls food intake and body weight through the activation of specific leptin receptors (OB-R) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). However, in most obese patients, high circulating levels of leptin fail to bring about weight loss. The prevention of this “leptin resistance” {{is a major}} goal for obesity research. We report here a successful prevention of diet-induced obesity (DIO) by silencing a negative regulator of OB-R function, the OB-R gene-related protein (OB-RGRP), whose transcript is genetically linked to the OB-R transcript. We provide in vitro evidence that OB-RGRP controls OB-R function by negatively regulating its cell surface expression. In the <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> model, obesity was prevented by silencing OB-RGRP through stereotactic injection of a lentiviral vector encoding a shRNA directed against OB-RGRP in the ARC.

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{characterized}} by the accumulation of fat in the liver and other tissues, leading to insulin resistance. We have previously shown that a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, which inhibits the initial step in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), improved glucose metabolism and decreased hepatic steatosis in both ob/ob and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Here we have determined in the <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> model the efficacy of a related small molecule compound, Genz- 112638, which is currently being evaluated clinically for the treatment of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder. Methodology/Principal Findings: DIO mice were treated with the Genz- 112638 for 12 to 16 weeks by daily oral gavage. Genz- 112638 lowered HbA 1 c levels and increased glucose tolerance. Whole body adiposity was not affected in normal mice, but decreased in drug-treated obese mice. Drug treatment also significantly lowered liver triglyceride levels and reduced the development of hepatic steatosis. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps on the DIO mice treated with Genz- 112638 and showed that insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production increased significantly compared to the placebo treated mice, indicating a marked improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity.

Recently, we found that lean mice challenged {{with high levels of}} dietary fat store TGs in cytoplasmic lipid droplets in the absorptive cells of the intestine, enterocytes, and that this storage increases and then decreases over time after an acute dietary fat challenge. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of obesity on intestinal TG metabolism. More specifically we asked whether TG storage in and secretion from the intestine are altered in obesity. We investigated these questions in diet-induced obese (DIO) and leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice. We found greater levels of TG storage in the intestine of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> compared to lean mice in the fed state, but similar levels of TG storage after fasting. In addition, we found similar TG storage in the intestine of lean and <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> at multiple time points after an acute dietary fat challenge.

Furthermore, we found altered mRNA levels for genes involved in regulation of intestinal TG metabolism in lean and <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> at fasting and in response to an acute dietary fat challenge. More specifically, we found that many of the genes related to TG synthesis, chylomicron synthesis, TG storage and lipolysis were induced in response to an acute dietary fat challenge in lean mice, but this induction was not observed in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> In fact, we found a significant decrease in intestinal mRNA levels of genes related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> in response to an acute dietary fat challenge.

However, it is unclear how the capacity of angiogenesis in each adipose depot is affected by over-nutrition. Therefore, we investigated the angiogenic capacity (AC) of subcutaneous and visceral fats in lean and obese mice. Methods: We compared the AC of epididymal fat (EF) and inguinal fat (IF) using an angiogenesis assay in diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice</b> and diet-resistant (DR) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Furthermore, we compared the expression levels of genes related to angiogenesis, macrophage recruitment, and inflammation using RT-qPCR in the EF and IF of lean mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD), <b>DIO</b> <b>mice,</b> and DR mice fed a HFD. Results: <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> showed {{a significant increase in the}} AC of EF only at 22 weeks of age compared to DR mice. The expression levels of genes related to angiogenesis, macrophage recruitment, and inflammation were significantly higher in the EF of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> than in those of LFD mice and DR mice, while expression levels of genes related to macrophages and their recruitment were higher in the IF of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> than in those of LFD and DR mice.

Central leptin resistance is {{a hallmark of}} diet-induced obesity (DIO). Oral administration of teasaponin (TS) can reduce body weight and fat mass. However, little is known if TS has benefit effect in improving central leptin sensitivity. This study investigated the effects of TS on central leptin sensitivity and leptin signalling in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) of <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> Methods: After 15 weeks of high-fat diet, <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> (n= 40) {{were divided into two}} groups received either intraperitoneal (ip) injection of TS (10 mg/kg, daily) or saline for 20 days. Another group of mice was fed low-fat diet (LF) as control (n= 20). Then both <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> and LF mice were given intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection of leptin or saline. Food intake and pSTAT 3 level in the Arc in response to central leptin administration were assessed. Results: TS significantly decreased body weight gain (- 210 %,...|$|R
40|$|Acylation {{stimulating}} protein (ASP) is an adipokine {{derived from}} the immune complement system, which stimulates fat storage and is typically increased in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Using a diet-induced obesity (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model, the acute effects of ASP on energy metabolism and inflammatory processes in vivo were evaluated. We hypothesized that ASP would specifically exert proinflammatory effects. C 57 Bl/ 6 wild-type mice were put on a high-fat-high-sucrose diet for 12 [*]weeks. Mice were then subjected to both glucose and insulin tolerance tests, each manipulation being preceded by recombinant ASP or vehicle (control) bolus injection. ASP supplementation increased whole-body glucose excursion, and this was accomplished with reduced concomitant insulin levels. However, ASP did not directly alter insulin sensitivity. ASP supplementation induced a proinflammatory phenotype, {{with higher levels of}} cytokines including IL- 6 and TNF-α in plasma and in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle mRNA. Additionally, ASP increased M 1 macrophage content of these tissues. ASP exerted a direct concentration-dependent role in the migration and M 1 activation of cultured macrophages. Altogether, the in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that ASP plays a role in both energy metabolism and inflammation, with paradoxical whole-body glucose-sensitizing yet proinflammatory effects...|$|E
40|$|Obesity is {{characterized}} by the accumulation of fat in the liver and other tissues, leading to insulin resistance. We have previously shown that a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, which inhibits the initial step in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), improved glucose metabolism and decreased hepatic steatosis in both ob/ob and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Here we have determined in the <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> model the efficacy of a related small molecule compound, Genz- 112638, which is currently being evaluated clinically for the treatment of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder. DIO mice were treated with the Genz- 112638 for 12 to 16 weeks by daily oral gavage. Genz- 112638 lowered HbA 1 c levels and increased glucose tolerance. Whole body adiposity was not affected in normal mice, but decreased in drug-treated obese mice. Drug treatment also significantly lowered liver triglyceride levels and reduced the development of hepatic steatosis. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps on the DIO mice treated with Genz- 112638 and showed that insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production increased significantly compared to the placebo treated mice, indicating a marked improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity. These results indicate that GSL inhibition in obese mice primarily results in an increase in insulin action in the liver, and suggests that GSLs may have an important role in hepatic insulin resistance in conditions of obesity...|$|E
40|$|High-fat (HF) diets {{typically}} promote diet-induced obesity (DIO) and metabolic dysfunction (i. e., insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis). Dysfunction of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism {{may contribute}} to the development of hepatic steatosis, via increased de novo lipogenesis or repackaging of circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Hepatic TAG production (HTP) rate can be assessed through injecting mice with nonionic detergents that inhibit tissue lipoprotein lipase. Potential confounding effects of detergent-based HTP tests (HTPTs) used in longitudinal studies—including the impact on food intake, energy balance, and weight gain—have not been reported. To examine this, male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a 10 % or 60 % kcal diet. After 4 weeks, the mice underwent an HTPT via poloxamer 407 intraperitoneal injections (1000 mg/kg). Weight gain, energy intake, and postabsorptive TAG levels normalized 7 – 10 days post-HTPT. The post-HTPT recovery of body weight and energy intake suggest that, in metabolic phenotyping studies, any additional sample collection should occur at least 7 – 10 days after the HTPT to reduce confounding effects. Diet-specific effects on HTP were also observed: HF-fed mice had reduced HTP, plasma TAG, and NEFA levels compared to controls. In conclusion, the current study highlights the procedural and physiological complexities associated with studying lipid metabolism using a HTPT in the <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> model...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity {{has been}} found to be {{associated}} with colon cancer. However, the mechanism of this relationship is unclear and thus a good animal model is required. Our previous research showed that some mice developed diet-induced obesity (DIO) whilst others were diet-resistant (DR) when fed a high-fat diet. Methods: In the present study, we have tested the effects of a high-fat diet on the formation of colon polyps induced by azoxymethane (AOM) in both <b>DIO</b> and DR <b>mice.</b> Results: We found that the <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> have developed 2. 5 times of polyps compared to the DR mice (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and 3. 4 times of polyps compared to the low fat fed mice (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Although the DR mice tended to have more polyps than the low-fat diet fed mice, this was not statistically significant. The <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> could have an increased polyp formation due to obesity-related cancer risk factors and different gene expression from DR <b>mice.</b> Conclusions: <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> could be used as an appropriate model for studying obesity-associated colon cancer; however DR mice are not suitable because they don 2 ̆ 7 t show any significant weight gains to indicate obesity.

40|$|SummaryObesity is {{characterized}} by hyperleptinemia and decreased response to exogenous leptin. This has been widely attributed {{to the development of}} leptin resistance, a state of impaired leptin signaling proposed to contribute to the development and persistence of obesity. To directly determine endogenous leptin activity in obesity, we treated lean and obese mice with a leptin receptor antagonist. The antagonist increased feeding and body weight (BW) in lean mice, but not in obese models of leptin, leptin receptor, or melanocortin- 4 receptor deficiency. In contrast, the antagonist increased feeding and BW comparably in lean and diet-induced obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice,</b> an increase associated with decreased hypothalamic expression of Socs 3, a primary target of leptin. These findings demonstrate that hyperleptinemic <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> retain leptin suppression of feeding comparable to lean mice and counter the view that resistance to endogenous leptin contributes to the persistence of <b>DIO</b> in <b>mice...</b>|$|R
40|$|Signals from {{intracellular}} glucocorticoids (GCs) via 11 b-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 b-HSD 1) in adipose tissues {{have been}} reported to serve as amplifiers leading to de-terioration of glucose metabolism associated with obesity. To elucidate adipose dysfunction via 11 b-HSD 1 activation in the development of obesity-related diabetes, we established novel diabetic mice by implanting a cortisone pellet (CP) in diet-induced obesity (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice.</b> Cortisone pellet–implanted <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> (DIO/CP mice) showed hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and ectopic fat accumulation, whereas corti-sone pellet implantation in lean mice did not induce hypergly-cemia.

40|$|International audienceWhile adipose tissue-associated macrophages {{contribute}} to development of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance of obesity, {{little is known}} about the role of hepatic Kupffer cells in this environment. Here we address the impact of Kupffer cell ablation using clodronate-encapsulated liposome depletion in a diet-induced obese (DIO) and insulin resistant mouse model. Hepatic expression of macrophage markers measured by realtime RT-PCR remained unaltered in DIO mice despite characteristic expansion of adipose tissue-associated macrophages. <b>DIO</b> <b>mouse</b> livers displayed increased expression of alternative activation markers but unaltered proinflammatory cytokine expression when compared to lean mice. Kupffer cell ablation reduced hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 mRNA expression in lean and DIO mice by 95 % and 84 %, respectively. Despite decreased hepatic IL- 6 gene expression after ablation in lean and DIO mice, hepatic STAT 3 phosphorylation, and acute phase protein mRNA expression increased. Kupffer cell ablation in DIO mice resulted in additional hepatic triglyceride accumulation and a 30 - 40 % reduction in hepatic insulin receptor autophosphorylation and Akt activation. Implicating systemic loss of IL- 10, high-fat-fed IL- 10 knockout mice also displayed increased hepatic STAT 3 signaling and hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Insulin signaling was not altered, however. In conclusion, Kupffer cells are a major source of hepatic IL- 10 expression, the loss of which is associated with increased STAT 3 -dependent signaling and steatosis. One or more additional factors appear to be required, however, for the Kupffer cell-dependent protective effect on insulin receptor signaling in DIO mice...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the antidiabetic effect of Moringa olifeira Lam. in a diet-induced obesity (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model. Six mice {{were randomly selected}} as normal controls. Moringa olifeira Lam. leaf extract at a dose of 200, 400 or 600 mg/kg body weight, glibenclamide (Glib) at the dose of 10 mg/kg (positive control) and distilled water at 10 ml/kg (control group) were administered orally by gastric intubation, and each group consisted of six mice. Insulinsensitive tissues (liver, skeletal muscle) were collected to investigate antidiabetic effects and examine the plant's molecular mechanisms. Moringa olifeira Lam. leaf extract prevented weight gain. It also reduced blood glucose in DIO mice. Glib and Moringa olifeira Lam. leaf extract, 400 mg/kg, treatments restored insulin levels towards normal values (P < 0. 05 versus diabetic control group). Western immunoblot analysis of different tissues, collected {{at the end of}} the study, demonstrated that Moringa olifeira Lam. stimulated activation of the insulin-dependent Akt pathway and increased the protein content of Glut 4 in skeletal muscle. The improvement of hepatic steatosis observed in DIO-treated mice was associated with a decrease in the hepatic content of SREBP- 1, a transcription factor involved in de novo lipogenesis. The hepatic PPARα protein content in the plant extract- treated mice remained significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence for direct action of Moringa olifeira Lam. on pancreatic β-cells, enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This correlated with hypoglycaemic effects in diabetic mice associated with restored levels of plasma insulin...|$|E
40|$|Target herbal {{ingredient}} (THI) is {{an extract}} made from two herbs, Scutellariae Radix and Platycodi Radix. It {{has been developed}} {{as a treatment for}} metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. One component of these two herbs has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-obesity activities. However, there have been no reports about the effects of the mixed extract of these two herbs on metabolic diseases. In this study, we investigated the metabolic effects of THI using a diet-induced obesity (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model. High-fat diet (HFD) mice were orally administered daily with 250 mg/kg of THI. After 10 weeks of treatment, the THI-administered HFD mice showed reduction of body weights and epididymal white adipose tissue weights as well as improved glucose tolerance. In addition, the level of total cholesterol in the serum was markedly reduced. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the metabolic effects of THI in vitro, 3 T 3 -L 1 cells were treated with THI, after which the mRNA levels of adipogenic transcription factors, including C/EBPα and PPARγ, were measured. The results show that the expression of these two transcription factors was down regulated by THI in a dose-dependent manner. We also examined the combinatorial effects of THI and swimming exercise on metabolic status. THI administration simultaneously accompanied by swimming exercise had a synergistic effect on serum cholesterol levels. These findings suggest that THI could be developed as a supplement for improving metabolic status.

40|$|Bakground/objectives: Intense drug {{discovery}} {{efforts in the}} metabolic field highlight the need for novel strategies {{for the treatment of}} obesity. Alternative splicing (AS) and/or polyadenylation enable the LMNA gene to express distinct protein isoforms that exert opposing effects on energy metabolism and lifespan. Here we aimed to use the splicing factor SRSF 1 that contribute to the production of these different isoforms as a target to uncover new anti-obesity drug. Subjects/Methods: Small molecules modulating SR protein activity and splicing, we re tested for their abilities to interact with SRSF 1 and to modulate LMNA (AS). Using an LMNA luciferase reporter we selected molecules that were tested in Diet Induced Obese (<b>DIO)</b> <b>mice.</b> Transcriptomic analyses were performed in the white adipose tissues from untreated and treated <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> and mice fed a chow diet. Results: We identified a small molecule that specifically interacted with the RS domain of SRSF 1. ABX 300 abolished diet induced obesity (<b>DIO)</b> in <b>mice,</b> leading to restoration of adipose tissue homeostasis. In contrast, ABX 300 had no effect on mice fed a standard chow diet. A global transcriptomic analysis revealed similar profiles of White adipose tissue (WAT) from <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> treated with ABX 300 and from untreated mice fed a chow diet. Mice treated with ABX 300 exhibited an increase in O 2 consumption and a switch in fuel preference toward lipids.

40|$|Leptin plays a {{critical}} role in the control of energy homeostasis. The sympathetic cardiovascular actions of leptin have emerged as a potential link between obesity and hypertension. We previously demonstrated that in mice, modest obesity induced by 10 wk of a high-fat diet is associated with preservation of leptin ability to increase renal sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) despite the resistance to the metabolic effects of leptin. Here, we examined whether selective leptin resistance exists in mice with late-stage diet-induced obesity (DIO) produced by 20 wk of a high-fat diet. The decrease in food intake and body weight induced by intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of leptin was significantly attenuated in the <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> Regional SNA responses to intravenous leptin were also attenuated in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> In contrast, intracerebroventricularly administered leptin caused contrasting effects on regional SNA in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice.</b> Renal SNA response to intracerebroventricular leptin was preserved, whereas lumbar and brown adipose tissue SNA responses were attenuated. Intact renal SNA response to leptin combined with the increased cerebrospinal fluid leptin levels in <b>DIO</b> <b>mice</b> represents a potential mechanism for the adverse cardiovascular consequences of obesity. Lastly, we examined the role of phosphoinositol- 3 kinase (PI 3 K) and melanocortin receptors (MCR) in mediating the preserved renal SNA response to leptin in obesity. Presence of PI 3 K inhibitor (LY 294002) or MC 3 / 4 R antagonist (SHU 9119) significantly attenuated the renal SNA response to leptin in DIO and agouti obese mice. Our results demonstrate the importance of PI 3 K and melanocortin receptors in the transduction of leptin-induced renal sympathetic activation in obesity...|$|R
