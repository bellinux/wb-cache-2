[...] He was listed by Time as one of the 25 Winter Olympians to watch during the games, and he was placed as a 500–1 shot for the gold medal.

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>now</b> they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>now</b> people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

Jonathan Landman, Blair's editor, told the Siegal committee he felt that Blair's being black played a large part in the younger man's initial promotion in 2001 to full-time staffer.

I DJ {{for him and}} I'm {{not at liberty to}} speak on much, but you know his caliber and what he does. Clearly going to further territories. I think what you would expect, especially after the last go-round. He was just getting his feet back on Relapse and then Recovery just came with the smash hits and everything and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>now</b> — he's Eminem." [...] Prior to the announcement of the album's name, it was named to multiple [...] "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" [...] lists; including MTV, Complex where it was listed in sixth position (and later on in second); and XXL, where it was listed in fifth.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "I'm done with the Democratic Party. As I said on Amy Goodman's show a couple years ago, I've put my 'Proud Democrat' coffee mug in storage. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>now</b> I'll just throw it in the garbage and have done with it" [...] and that [...] "The Constitution has been eviscerated while Democrats have stood by with nary a whimper.

First stage winner Lieuwe Westra (...) then bested Dennis' time by 5 seconds, establishing a new mark. Philip Deignan (...) rode his way to 24th, a time {{that would make him}} lose 3 spots, from fifth to eighth. Cameron Meyer (...) put in a good performance with a time of 50' 20", which translated in a jump from sixth place to third. Michael Rogers (...) then signed what would become the fourth fastest time of the day, saying afterward that the wind played a big role. Being the overall classification leader, Van Garderen rolled off the ramp last, and confirmed his overall ambitions by crushing the stage, registering the only time below 49 minutes (48' 52", 22 seconds faster than Westra). It was Van Garderen's first victory of the year despite some notable results earlier in the season and he declared after the event: [...] "I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch, but I'm ready to win, and I think it's about time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>now</b> I’m finally mature enough to pull through to the end. I think I’m ready to do it." ...|$|E
