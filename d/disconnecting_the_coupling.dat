40|$|In {{this work}} a mixed variational {{formulation}} to simulate quasi-incompressible electro- or magneto-active polymers {{immersed in the}} surrounding free space is presented. A novel domain decomposition is used to <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>coupled</b> problem and <b>the</b> arbitrary free space mesh update problem. Exploiting this decomposition we describe a block iterative approach to solving the linearised multiphysics problem, and a physically and geometrically based, three-parameter method to update the free space mesh. Several application-driven example problems are implemented to demonstrate the robustness of the mixed formulation for both electro-elastic and magneto-elastic problems involving both finite deformations and quasi-incompressible media...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of {{treatment}} in patients {{at high risk}} for fractures is {{to reduce the risk of}} a first or a subsequent fracture. New data are available on the antifracture effects and side-effects of antiresorptive and osteoanabolic drugs, and new emerging therapies with new modes of action are on the horizon. RECENT FINDINGS: Calcium and vitamin D intake should be sufficient, but not too high. Vertebral, nonvertebral (including hip fracture) prevention with antiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate and zoledronic acid) and denosumab exceeds the risk of rare side-effects such as atypical femur fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Teriparatide is an osteoanabolic drug that improves quality of life in severe osteoporosis. Strontium ranelate decreases dynamic parameters of bone formation during the first year {{of treatment}}, and could increase the risk of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Initiation of and adherence to fracture prevention drugs are still low. New potential developments in antiresorptive drugs include odanacatib, a selective inhibitor of cathepsin K, and, in osteoanabolic drugs, monoclonal antibodies against sclerostin. SUMMARY: These recent data indicate that fracture prevention with antiresorptives and teriparatide is effective with a reasonable safety profile. Odanacatib and antisclerostin are promising new drugs with new mechanisms of action, as they are able to <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>coupling</b> between bone resorption and bone formation. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health...|$|R

50|$|What {{turned out}} to be the most popular and longest lasting {{physical}} style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's model 102 telephone. A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use were placed in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram of the model 102 shows the direct connection of the receiver to the line, while the transmitter was induction coupled, with energy supplied by a local battery. <b>The</b> <b>coupling</b> transformer, battery, and ringer were in a separate enclosure from the desk set. The rotary dial in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly <b>disconnecting</b> <b>the</b> line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) permanently <b>disconnected</b> <b>the</b> line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.|$|R

50|$|What {{turned out}} to be the most popular and longest lasting {{physical}} style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's 202-type desk set. A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use sat in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram of the model 202 shows the direct connection of the transmitter to the line, while the receiver was induction coupled. In local battery configurations, when the local loop was too long to provide sufficient current from the exchange, the transmitter was powered by a local battery and inductively <b>coupled,</b> while <b>the</b> receiver was included in the local loop. <b>The</b> <b>coupling</b> transformer and <b>the</b> ringer were mounted in a separate enclosure, called the subscriber set. The dial switch in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly <b>disconnecting</b> <b>the</b> line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of <b>the</b> circuit diagram) <b>disconnected</b> <b>the</b> line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} for any two {{vertices}} x, y of a 6 -connected graph G, there exists a path between them whose removal leaves G 3 -connected. This proves the case of Lovasz’s path removal conjecture (1975), where f(3) = 6. This article examines the relationship between connectivity and path removal. The following definition of connectivity is used frequently Definition 1. A graph G is k − connected if a set S of k vertices <b>disconnects</b> <b>the</b> graph into at least two components C 1 and C 2 and S and no set S of k − 1 vertices <b>disconnects</b> <b>the</b> graph. Definition 2. A k vertex cut in a graph G {{is a set of}} k vertices which <b>disconnects</b> <b>the</b> graph into at least two components C 1 and C 2. Thus any k-connected graph must contain a k-vertex cut which <b>disconnects</b> <b>the</b> graph into at least two components. By definition, the complete graph on n vertices, Kn, is n − 1 -connected. In order to describe a graph in terms of sets we need the following definitions...|$|R
