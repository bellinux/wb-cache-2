25|$|Endosulfan is a {{ubiquitous}} <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminant.</b> The chemical is semivolatile {{and persistent}} to degradation {{processes in the}} environment. Endosulfan is subject to long-range atmospheric transport, i.e. it can travel long distances from where it is used. Thus, it occurs in many environmental compartments. For example, a 2008 report by the National Park Service found that endosulfan commonly contaminates air, water, plants, and fish of national parks in the US. Most of these parks are far from areas where endosulfan is used. Endosulfan {{has been found in}} remote locations such as the Arctic Ocean, {{as well as in the}} Antarctic atmosphere. The pesticide has also been detected in dust from the Sahara Desert collected in the Caribbean after being blown across the Atlantic Ocean. The compound has been shown to be one of the most abundant organochlorine pesticides in the global atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{animal studies}} {{indicate}} that <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminants</b> can have adverse effects on several organs and tissues of the immune system. Such effects are known to lead to increased host susceptibility to microbial infections and to compromised immunosurveillance mechanisms normally instrumental in the elimination of neoplastic cells and the prevention of autoimmune diseases. Evaluation of the potential risk <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminants</b> pose to the human immune system is currently accomplished via extrapolation of experimentally derived animal data to humans. Presently, this process requires that uncertainty factors such as interspecies differences and genetic variability be considered. Naturally, the process of risk assessment would be greatly facilitated if it were based on clinically relevant data derived from studying humans known {{to be exposed to}} <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminants.</b> However, the existing human data are scarce and often described as very limited in scope. To generate the much-needed human data we need to identify a set of clinically relevant immunologic end points that, when adequately standardized, can be incorporated easily into the design of prospective epidemiologic studies.

2500|$|The 2005 WHO report {{stated that}} mercury from amalgam was {{approximately}} 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that {{one-third of the}} total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices. Other studies have shown {{this to be a}} gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries [...] "accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent". Mercury is an <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminant</b> and the WHO, OSHA, and NIOSH have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an external cost not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by amalgam separators and the ISO has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste. It should be noted, however, that mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment {{and the vast majority of}} the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels). Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life. Amalgam separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions. When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the tens}} of {{thousands}} of chemicals in use, only a small fraction has been analyzed in environmental samples. To effectively identify <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminants,</b> methods to prioritize chemicals for analytical method development are required. We used a high throughput model of chemical emissions, fate, and bioaccumulation to identify chemicals likely to have high concentrations in specific environmental media, and we prioritized these for target analysis. This model-based screening was applied to 215 organosilicon chemicals culled from industrial chemical production statistics. The model-based screening prioritized several recognized organosilicon contaminants and generated hypotheses leading to the selection of three chemicals that have not previously been identified as potential <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminants</b> for target analysis. Trace analytical methods were developed and the chemicals were analyzed in air, sewage sludge, and sediment.
