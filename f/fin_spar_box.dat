40|$|The {{considered}} {{program has}} the objective {{to develop and}} validate repair procedures for composite structures which are adaptable to commercial airline maintenance operations. Questions concerning the design and the fabrication of repairs are discussed, taking into account a vertical fin cover panel, a wing cover panel, and a vertical <b>fin</b> <b>spar.</b> The test {{results indicate that the}} use of graphite patch repairs, either precured bonded or employing cure-in-place, is satisfactory for the repair of lightly loaded and highly loaded parts. The use of bolted repairs is satisfactory for lightly loaded structural components. The repair of composite substructures can be accomplished using comparable approaches to those evaluated for skin cover repairs in many previous programs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{sectional}} warping to bend-twist coupling characteristics for <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> of wind turbine blade, section stiffness of different regions are calculated with weather considering warping effect or not, the results show that warping effects differently in different part of the blade and the length width ratio and thickness of spar cap are two factors that determine impact degree of warping. Section stiffness of a 5 MW blade <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> considering warping effect are calculated, bend-twist coupling coefficients are got. The results show that warping effect bend-twist coupling coefficient of <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> greatly and it should be considered when research the blade bend-twist coupling...|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the {{fuselage}} consisted of chrome-molybdenum steel tubing, covered with Haskelite plywood. The cantilever wing was also plywood-covered and had three spruce <b>spars</b> <b>boxed</b> with plywood and had plywood ribs and maple corner blocks. The interior {{structure of the}} fin was steel tubing with plywood ribs with the stabilizer, rudder and elevators having spruce spars, maple corner blocks and plywood ribs. The faired rudder was equipped with a trim tab operated from the cockpit; elevators and ailerons also had trim tabs. A [...] fuel tank was carried forward of the cabin and just aft of the engine behind a metal firewall was a [...] oil tank.|$|R
50|$|The {{wing spars}} were built from spruce spar caps with maple {{doublers}} at all attachment points and two 3/32 in balsa shear webs attached to 1/8 to 3/8 in balsa strips {{on the wing}} spars. The ribs were made from 3/32 in balsa. This construction resulted in a balsa <b>spar</b> <b>box</b> with tapered spruce caps. The leading edge was covered with 1/32 in balsa to form a leading edge D spar. The trailing edge was formed by two 2 in wide 1/32 in sheets forming a triangle with 1/8 to 3/8 in vertical spar sections in between the ribs. The covering was 1/2 mil Mylar. The 32 ft span wing weighed 5 lb and was capable of loads up to 100 pounds.|$|R

50|$|Prior to Paper Lion, Plimpton had {{pitched to}} major league {{baseball}} players and <b>sparred</b> with <b>boxing</b> great Archie Moore, but {{the success of this}} book, which was later adapted into a 1968 film starring Alan Alda as Plimpton, helped launch a kind of second career for Plimpton as an everyman athlete. Plimpton followed Paper Lion with books about golf and ice hockey, as well as two more football books.|$|R
50|$|To {{speed the}} {{completion}} of the first prototype, the Prop-Jet used the wing and undercarriage of a Beechcraft Baron 58P, though a composite structure wing was envisaged for production aircraft. The Beech wing was a two <b>spar</b> aluminium <b>box</b> structure, without sweep and mounted between mid and low positions with dihedral of 6° and fitted with slotted Fowler flaps. The tricycle undercarriage was enclosed behind doors after retraction.|$|R
50|$|Its cantilever, two piece, wooden wing was {{straight}} tapered in plan to semi-elliptical tips. Each wing was {{built around a}} single, spruce <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> and covered with birch plywood. There were short ailerons near the tips and inboard split flaps.|$|R
5000|$|Directed by Jürgen Schadeberg, {{the film}} {{includes}} such images as Oliver Tambo as a lawyer, Trevor Huddleston demonstrating against {{the demolition of}} Sophiatown, Nelson Mandela <b>sparring</b> in the <b>boxing</b> ring, Chief Luthuli the Nobel Prize winner and the singer Miriam Makeba.|$|R
50|$|The Scud's wooden {{cantilever}} {{parasol wing}} had constant chord over about 60% of its span, with some taper outboard {{particularly on the}} trailing edge. It was built around two spars, with stress bearing plywood skin forward of the rear <b>spar</b> forming a <b>box</b> <b>spar.</b> Aft, the wing and full span ailerons were fabric covered. On the prototype, all flying surfaces were edged with cord, resulting in a scalloped finish. All three all-moving, wood-framed and fabric-covered tail surfaces were identical and interchangeable, making the rudder appear unusually tall. Each surface, mounted on a short stub tube, had a straight leading edge and was tapered on the trailing edge, which had a central cut-out.|$|R
50|$|Its one-piece, wooden {{parasol wing}} was built around two <b>box</b> <b>spars</b> and {{was covered in}} plywood. On each side two parallel, airfoil-section struts braced the wing from the lower {{fuselage}} to the spars, each pair only about 1200 mm from the centreline.|$|R
50|$|Jacquet Bazmore, Former World Heavyweight Kickboxing Champion and {{nephew of}} boxing great Archie Moore, trained at Viola and Caliguri's martial arts schools. Noted {{as one of}} the most {{prolific}} kickboxers of his era, he also was a <b>sparring</b> partner for <b>boxing</b> legend Muhammad Ali.|$|R
50|$|The 40-P {{was similar}} in layout and {{construction}} to its larger forebear. Though the smaller span reduced the aspect ratio from 19.4 to 14.5, increasing the induced drag, it allowed {{a reduction of}} profile drag {{by the introduction of}} a cantilever wing without bracing struts. The wings of the Avia 40-P had unbroken straight taper in plan, lacked the strong camber of the 41-P's centre section, and were built around plywood leading edge torsion <b>box</b> <b>spars.</b> Behind the spars the wings were fabric covered apart from the long span ailerons, which filled about two thirds of the trailing edges. New wing features were the upper surface spoilers, mounted on the rear of the <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> just inboard of the ailerons.|$|R
50|$|The SVIT was {{a fairly}} {{conventional}} single-engined aircraft with side-by-side seating for two, though Bucciero favoured a mid wing design rather than the more common low wing. The wing had constant chord, rounded tips and dihedral (aircraft) of 2.5° throughout, built around a two <b>spar</b> torsion <b>box.</b> Its trailing edge carried slotted flaps. The rectangular, low set, tailplane was of the all moving type with full span anti-tabs and the straight tapered fin and rudder was assisted by a small dorsal extension and an underside fin.|$|R
50|$|The wing panels, {{which could}} be rapidly {{detached}} for storage from a narrow wing centre section integrated into the fuselage, were built around two <b>box</b> <b>spars</b> and were strictly trapezoidal in plan, tapering in chord down to 1.50 m at the tips; they were also strongly tapered in thickness.|$|R
5000|$|The Cavalier is a {{two seat}} {{side-by-side}} configuration homebuilt that uses all-wood construction. The landing gear may be configured as fixed, or retractable, in tricycle or conventional layout. The wing uses a single <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> covered in 3/32" [...] plywood leading edge skins. The entire wing is fabric covered.|$|R
5000|$|Carr’s amateur boxing {{career began}} {{at the age of}} 14. His amateur career {{produced}} a record of 56 wins with 6 losses. He won the 1993 Golden Gloves championship, as a light heavyweight at the Chapa's Arena in Houston, Texas, defeating David Costa. Carr is a stylish right-hand boxer that punches with power. [...] Carr has <b>sparred</b> with <b>boxing</b> champions, including seven-time world middleweight champion Tommy [...] "Hit Man" [...] Hearns, the former WBC Continental Middleweight Champion Kid Fire Parks, [...] and 1984 Olympics medal winner Frank Tate, the former world Middleweight Champion.|$|R
50|$|The Exxtacy wing {{is based}} upon a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer {{cantilever}} <b>box</b> <b>spar,</b> with ribs and wing tips, also of the same material. Control is by weight-shift, with roll control augmented by wing top-surface spoilers. For thermalling flight and landing, inboard flaps were installed. The aircraft achieves a glide ratio of 17.5:1.|$|R
50|$|The V 39 was a two bay biplane with {{constant}} chord wings mounted with slight stagger {{and a wide}} gap. The fabric covered wings had <b>box</b> <b>spars</b> and three-ply ribs. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wing, externally rod-connected. The upper wing was centrally supported with cabane struts.|$|R
50|$|The Gnome is an all wood low-wing monoplane, each wing braced {{from above}} with a slender strut {{to the upper}} {{fuselage}} longeron. The wood skinned wings, which are straight tapered and built around <b>box</b> <b>spars</b> and D-section leading edges, carry 2° of dihedral. There are wooden ailerons but no flaps.|$|R
50|$|The Potez 38 was a {{monoplane}} {{with high}} wings built around wooden <b>box</b> <b>spars,</b> spruce ribs and with fabric covering. In plan the wings were rectangular out to rounded tips {{and they were}} braced to the lower fuselage longerons with streamlined V-form struts on each side. There was 3° of dihedral.|$|R
2500|$|The fabric-covered, tapered wings {{were built}} around two <b>box</b> <b>spars.</b> [...] The 1919 machine {{had a single}} piece wing but gliders need to be easily {{transportable}} and so the wings were rebuilt in three pieces. The rudder and elevators were removable and the outer parts of the tailplane could be hinged upwards, again for ease of transport.|$|R
5000|$|The D.430's outer [...] nine {{cylinder}} Algol radial engines {{had long}} chord NACA cowlings, and were mounted on bearings enclosed in long, streamlined nacelles; these were supported under the wings by four steel struts to {{the leading edge}} <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> and to the main spar. The central engine, under a similar cowling, was in {{the nose of the}} fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The Gabbiano was a {{high wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane built from wood {{and covered with a}} mixture of plywood and fabric. Its wing had a single <b>spar,</b> torsion <b>box</b> structure and was constructed in three sections. The central part, about 40% of the span, was rectangular in plan and was without dihedral. The outer panels were straight tapered to blunt tips, the wing becoming thinner and thus acquiring dihedral though retaining a horizontal upper surface. Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels; there were no inboard flaps or air brakes. At 16:1 its aspect ratio was {{similar to that of the}} Konsul.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage {{was made}} from welded 4130 steel tubing, covered in sheet 2024-T3 aluminum. The [...] span wings were made with a spruce wood <b>box</b> <b>spar,</b> with an aluminum front shear and had a wing area of [...] The acceptable power range was [...] and the original engine used was a [...] 2si 808, later replaced with a Rotax powerplant.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane. Its wing was entirely wooden, built around two <b>box</b> <b>spars</b> and plywood covered, with a thick section which thinned continuously from root to tip. In plan each wing was trapezoidal, though long tips produced an approximately elliptical form. Long narrow-chord ailerons, each divided into two, were placed at the outer ends of the trapezoidal part.|$|R
50|$|The B.A.C. II {{was also}} a primary, but instead of an open girder-type frame, it had a <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> fuselage. This first flew at Lenham on 21 September 1930 and about fifteen were sold, {{including}} one in Jamaica. Lowe-Wylde would deliver the gliders personally and demonstrate them at the club's site (and if necessary take the pieces home for repair the same day).|$|R
50|$|The Monitor {{is largely}} a wooden aircraft. Its high wings are built around a single <b>box</b> <b>spar,</b> with a torsion resisting, plywood covered leading edge. Behind the spar the wing is fabric covered. Dihedral is just 0.5°. The wings are braced to the lower {{fuselage}} {{with a pair of}} single lift struts. The ailerons are wood framed and fabric covered; spoilers are wooden.|$|R
50|$|The low, {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} M.112 was built in three parts, a tapered centre-section {{which was part of}} the fuselage and trapezoidal outer panels with elliptical tips. Its aspect ratio of 9.5 was high for the time. The outer panels carried mild dihedral and full-span, narrow-chord ailerons. The wings were completely wooden, with twin <b>box</b> <b>spars</b> and alder plywood skin.|$|R
50|$|The D.IX was {{a single}} bay biplane, its wings {{constructed}} in Fokker's established fashion with two <b>box</b> <b>spars</b> and fabric covering. The interplane struts were N-form while the cabane structure included two fully triangulated forward struts connecting to the forward spar, {{and a pair of}} single struts connecting to the rear spar. Ailerons were only fitted on the upper planes.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{monoplane}} {{with a thick}} section, {{three part}} wing. Its inner section was rectangular in plan, only occupying 20% of the span and without dihedral. The outer sections were trapezoidal out to briefly blunted tips and initially had 11.24° of dihedral. There were plans for further optimization of the dihedral angle during flight testing, {{though it is not}} known if it was changed. Ailerons occupied about 35% of the trailing edges. There were six span-wise members on both the tops and bottoms of the wings, the forward pair forming the rear of a ply covered leading edge <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> and the third and fourth pairs defining a second <b>box</b> <b>spar</b> around mid-wing. A layer of fabric, easily doped and smoothed was stretched over the ply skin, a technique widely used at the time. Each wing was braced from the upper fuselage longerons by V-struts rooted on the two wing spars at about 30% span.|$|R
