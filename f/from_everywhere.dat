5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes <b>from</b> <b>everywhere</b> in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E

25|$|The Delhi Sultanate {{and later}} Mughal Empire {{attracted}} Muslim refugees, nobles, technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, artisans, teachers, poets, artists, theologians and Sufis {{from the rest}} of the Muslim world and they migrated and settled in the South Asia. During the reign of Sultan Ghyasuddin Balban (1266-1286) thousands of Central Asian Muslims sought asylum including more than 15 sovereigns and their nobles due to the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran. At the court of Sultan Iltemish in Delhi the first wave of these Muslim refugees escaping from the Central Asian genocide by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan, brought administrators from Iran, painters from China, theologians from Samarkand, Nishapur and Bukhara, divines and saints {{from the rest of}} Muslim world, craftsmen and men and maidens from every region, notably doctors adept in Greek medicine and philosophers <b>from</b> <b>everywhere.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the request}} of the pope, Montini {{established}} together with Ferdinando Baldelli and Otto Faller the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza (Pontifical Commission for Assistence), which aided large number of Romans and refugees <b>from</b> <b>everywhere</b> with shelter, food and other material assistance. In Rome alone this organization distributed almost two million portions of free food in the year 1944. The Papal Residence of Castel Gandolfo was opened to refugees, as was Vatican City in so far as space allowed. Some 15,000 persons lived in Castel Gandolfo alone, supported by the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza. At {{the request of}} Pius XII, Montini was also involved in the re-establishment of Church Asylum, providing protection to hundreds of Allied soldiers, who had escaped from Axis prison camps, Jews, anti-Fascists, Socialists, Communists, and after the liberation of Rome, German soldiers, partisans, displaced persons and others. As pope in 1971, Montini turned the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza into Caritas Italiana.|$|E

25|$|The White Lady, {{without making}} a sound, {{advances}} along the terrace. Raymonda follows her {{in a state of}} unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear <b>from</b> <b>everywhere</b> surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E

500|$|During the game's early {{development}} stages, {{it was set}} in the Forgotten Realms nation of Rashemen. The location was changed because Obsidian Studios' [...] was {{to take place in}} the same area. At lead designer Luke Scull's suggestion, Westgate became the new setting for the game. Ossian wanted the game's setting to differentiate itself from both Neverwinter Nights and the Baldur's Gate series of games. They found Westgate, situated in another area of the Forgotten Realms setting, to be ideal. Miranda compared Westgate to a city-sized version of Star Wars's Mos Eisley Cantina; a [...] "melting pot" [...] of creatures <b>from</b> <b>everywhere</b> in the setting. Ossian said they decided to make Mysteries of Westgate exclusively single-player in order to improve the game experience.|$|E
500|$|For over 800 {{years the}} cathedral and its {{associated}} buildings—built on an elevation [...] above the nearby fens—have visually influenced {{the city and its}} surrounding area. Geographer John Jones, writing in 1924, reports that [...] "from the roof of King's Chapel in Cambridge, on a clear day, Ely [...] can be seen on the horizon, [...] distant, an expression of the flatness of the fens". In 1954, architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner wrote [...] "as one approaches Ely on foot or on a bicycle, or perhaps in an open car, the cathedral dominates the picture for miles around… and offers <b>from</b> <b>everywhere</b> an outline different from that of any other English cathedral". Local historian Pamela Blakeman reports a claim that [...] "Grouped around … is the largest collection of mediaeval buildings still in daily use in this country".|$|E

500|$|By June 1887, the Emperor's health had {{considerably}} worsened and {{his personal}} doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment. While in Milan he passed two weeks between life and death, even being anointed. While on a bed recovering, on 22 May 1888 he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil. With a weak voice and tears in his eyes, he said, [...] "Great people! Great people!" [...] PedroII returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888. The [...] "whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, <b>from</b> <b>everywhere,</b> arrived proofs of affection and veneration."

500|$|Ibrahim {{recalled}} in 2014 {{that it took}} only one take. Asked in an interview how the title came about, he said: [...] "Because Basil was from Manenberg and for us Manenberg was just symbolic of the removal out of District Six, which is actually the removal of everybody <b>from</b> <b>everywhere</b> in the world, and Manenberg specifically because... it signifies, it's our music, and it's our culture..." [...] The township of Manenberg was considered symbolic with respect to apartheid in the same was as Soweto. The track was released on the album Mannenberg – Is Where It's Happening in the same year. The album only featured two songs; [...] "Mannenberg", and [...] "The Pilgrim" [...] (which was similarly long, at 12 minutes and 47 seconds). The title [...] "Mrs. Williams from Mannenberg", in reference to Gladys Williams, former housekeeper {{of one of the}} musicians, Morris Goldberg, was also considered for the album, and a photograph of her by Ibrahim was used on the album cover.|$|E

[...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] appeared first as a B-side, on the single [...] "How Do U Want It", by Shakur featuring The Outlawz. On June 4, 1996 under the label Death Row Records, [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] was released on compact disc, 12-inch, and a 45 RPM. The original cover for the single had Puffy's head on a snake's body, and Biggie's head on a pig's. It also appeared posthumously on several compilations, including the 2004 release of Shakur's last recorded live performance, [...] [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] was also remixed on Nu-Mixx Klazzics. Upon its release, [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] received frequent radio airplay, which was attributed to the public interest in the ongoing feud and radio stations' desire to garner high ratings. However, some radio stations, such as the Los Angeles-based KPWR, refused to play it. The follow-up to [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] was the song [...] "Bomb First (My Second Reply)".|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew that one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling <b>from</b> <b>everywhere,</b> people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
500|$|Pedro II {{returned}} to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro on 22 August 1888. The [...] "whole country welcomed {{him with an}} enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, <b>from</b> <b>everywhere,</b> arrived proofs of affection and veneration. The emotion from those who saw him disembark, frail, thin, with bent body, weak legs, was one most profound." [...] The cadets from the Military Academy climbed Sugarloaf Mountain and placed a gigantic banner on which was written [...] "Hail." [...] Such popular enthusiasm directed toward the Emperor was not matched even by the celebrations of his majority in 1840, in the Christie Affair of 1864, upon his departure to Rio Grande do Sul in 1865, or even after the victory in the Paraguayan War in 1870. [...] "To judge from the general manifestations of affection that the Emperor and the Empress had received {{on the occasion of}} their arrival from Europe, in this winter of 1888, no political institution seemed to be so strong as the monarchy in Brazil." [...] Even former slaves displayed loyalty towards the monarchy and vehemently opposed the republicans, whom they called [...] "the Paulistas." [...] The [...] "monarchy seemed to be at the height of its popularity." [...] Pedro II had reached the pinnacle of his prestige among Brazilians.|$|E
