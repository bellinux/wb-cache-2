5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using <b>emergency</b> <b>systems</b> as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E

25|$|On 20 April 1967, a British Eagle Bristol 175 Britannia 308F (registration: G-ANCG) {{operating}} a non-scheduled passenger service from London Heathrow to Kuwait made {{an emergency landing}} at RAF Manston after the flightdeck crew experienced problems locking down the aircraft's retracted undercarriage following takeoff from Heathrow. There were no fatalities among the 65 occupants (eleven crew and 54 passengers). Accident investigators established that the undercarriage's failure to lock down {{was caused by a}} loss of hydraulic fluid from both the main and <b>emergency</b> <b>systems.</b> The hydraulic lines had been broken by the incorrect retraction sequence of the port bogie, itself caused by incorrect setup of a replaced sequence valve.|$|E
25|$|Workers plan to pump {{water into}} turbine condensers, but need to pump {{water out of}} them first. Work to {{transfer}} water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a central storage tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers are laying hoses to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on <b>emergency</b> <b>systems</b> on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.|$|E

500|$|The $82.7 million {{construction}} {{contract for the}} transit tunnel renovation was awarded to Balfour Beatty in August 2004, 12 percent below Sound Transit's estimates. The majority of the cost was paid by Sound Transit and supplemented by $8.1 million from King County Metro. As part of the renovations, the tunnel's roadway was lowered by [...] to allow for level boarding, required by the Americans with Disabilities Act; as a result, Metro added strobe lights to bus mirrors, which were lowered to head height, and added warning signs. New electrical, mechanical, and <b>emergency</b> <b>systems</b> were installed, along with a new communications system connecting to a joint-operations center. The project ended up costing $94 million in total, 3.4 percent over the budget set in 2004. During the closure, Metro found that average travel time through downtown increased only 11 percent during the afternoon peak period, and ridership on popular routes only dropped slightly.|$|E

2500|$|Expert advice {{published}} in the 2010 document Planning Guidance for Response to a Nuclear Detonation is to shelter in place, in an area away from building fires, for at least 1 to 2 hours following a nuclear detonation and fallout arriving, [...] with the greatest benefit, assuming personnel are in a building with a high protection factor, is sheltering for no less than 12 to 24 hours before evacuation. Therefore, sheltering {{for the first few}} hours can save lives. Indeed, death and injury from local fallout is regarded by experts as the most preventable of all the effects of a nuclear detonation, being simply dependent on if personnel know how to identify an adequate shelter when they see one and enter one quickly, with the number of potential people saved being cited as in the hundreds of thousands. Or even higher if the remaining occupants of the city are made aware of the contaminated areas, by <b>emergency</b> <b>systems,</b> within hours of the events aftermath. In 2009-2013 a further iteration on sheltering-in-place was made to determine the optimal improvised fallout-shelter-residence-times following a nuclear detonation, with computer analysis, and including a summary of prior studies and guidance, it was found that individuals should quickly get into the best intact building at least under 5 minutes distant in travel time following the detonation and they should stay there for at least 30 minutes before venturing out to find a shelter with a higher protection factor but that is a greater travel time away +10 minutes. However, although this would be effective in cases were the initial building protection factor is less than about 10, it requires a high degree of individual situational awareness that may be optimistic to assume following the shock of a nuclear detonation, if a building with a PF of 20 or more is nearby, such as the fallout shelters depicted in the film, {{in the vast majority of}} fallout circumstances, it would not be advisable to leave it until 3+ hours have elapsed following the initial arrival of the local fallout.|$|E

40|$|Megadoor {{has noted}} that many {{customers}} are asking for an alternative way to open their door when the regular opening function for some reason cannot be used. It is primarily customers from the aerospace industry that have pointed out {{how important it is}} that their doors can be hoisted whether the belt has been ruptured or the engine is malfunctioning. To meet these requirements Megadoor are looking for a solution that should be completely independent. This report describes a proposal on how the problem could be solved. For each of the three belt driven door models 3110, 3116 and 3190 a concept has been developed. They are all based on the same principle which is that the door can be hoisted with wire ropes integrated into the existing structure. This <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> is designed to be offered as an optional function to standard doors. The <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> is equipped with separate engine and gearbox, which will be selected based on customer needs. For model 3110, a manual option for hoisting the door is also suggested. The result is an integrated <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> that will not be dependent of the lifting belt or the engine from the ordinary opening system. To be able to mount the <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> on 3116 and 3190, the doors need to have a total width of at least 7, 2 meters. On model 3110 the <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> will work regardless of width. The <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> can be mounted on all belt driven models without affecting the ordinary opening function of the door. Validerat; 20160821 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
