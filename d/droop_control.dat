30|$|Although the <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> {{is widely}} used as a {{wireless}} control strategy for load sharing, it has some drawbacks that limit its application. For instance, the load sharing accuracy is degraded if the per-unit impedances (the output impedance and the line impedance) of each DG are unbalanced [8]. Usually, P-f and Q-V <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> are used when the equivalent impedance which connecting DGs to the gird is inductive in a microgrid [9]. The active power can be shared accurately using P-f <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> since it is just based on {{the frequency of the}} microgrid. However, the DG voltage output in Q-V <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> is different with the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) because of the different line impedances. Thus the accuracy of reactive power sharing using Q-V <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> is usually substantially affected by the equivalent impedance of DG and line impedance [10].|$|E

40|$|Abstract- in {{transmission}} line, {{there are}} large quantities of distributed generators in micro-grid, which are all connected with PCC (Point of Common Coupling) through inverters. The <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> method is widely used to distribute active and reactive power among parallel inverters because its properties of low cost, high stability and no need of communication channel. In a micro-grid, the inductance values of transmission lines connecting to respective inverters are different due to the low density of distributed generators. In addition the settling time of the traditional <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> is high. In that situation, the reactive power cannot be equally shared even if all the inverters are using the same <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> method.

40|$|DC-AC Converters (inverters) are {{frequently}} employed as interfaces of distributed power sources and energy storage units to ac distribution grids. The approach of operating {{them as a}} voltage source with <b>droop</b> based <b>control</b> loops and using locally measured quantities offers {{an effective way to}} control the amount of active and reactive power they provide/absorb. In this way, fluctuating renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind, can help with power balancing, while grid forming units can better share load variations without dedicated communication channels. Besides, it can allow a smooth transition of a micro-grid from the grid-tie to the autonomous mode in case of a grid fault. However, the dynamic response and steady state operation of a system with <b>droop</b> <b>controlled</b> inverters depends quite a bit on systems parameters, such as feeder impedances, {{as well as on the}} droop characteristics of the other units, what is not usually known. This work focuses on the analysis of the performance of <b>droop</b> <b>controlled</b> inverters operating in various conditions. First, a 10 kVA three-phase inverter with a dq (vector) voltage control loop and active power (P) vs. frequency (f) and reactive power (Q) vs. grid voltage magnitude (V) droop characteristics is designed. Then, its behavior when operating connected to a stiff grid is investigated. Time domain simulations with SIMULINK and the technique of root locus, for which a small signal model is derived, are used to observe how the droop factors, frequency of the low pass filters used in the power measurements and feeder impedance affect the dynamic response. Next, the operation of two grid forming inverters in an autonomous micro-grid is considered. Again, the performance of the system is investigated with time domain simulations and root locus. The need for a virtual impedance loop as a means for allowing large droop factors to be used along with feeders with small inductances is observed and the effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated. The adverse impact of the conventional virtual impedance loop on the load voltage regulation is observed and an alternative implementation that minimizes this problem is proposed and its effectiveness is demonstrated. Finally, an autonomous micro-grid consisting of an inverter and a diesel engine generator set (genset) is studied. Time domain simulations are used to show that when the speed of response, in terms of power, of two grid forming units is very different, the smallest one can be overloaded. An approach for slowing down the fastest unit is proposed to minimize this issue...|$|R

30|$|When {{assuming}} the above <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> scheme, the line impedance between distributed converter and {{point of common coupling}} (PCC) will influence {{the accuracy of}} power sharing. In [21], a virtual output impedance loop added in the <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> system was assumed to solve the problem. In principle, the added virtual impedance will force the equivalent impedance be highly inductive so that the traditional <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> theory can still work effectively. However, when directly implementing the <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> scheme in grid-tied operation condition, it will produce the frequency deviation resulting in the loss of synchronization. In [22], a hierarchical control scheme was proposed where three control levels were defined: primary control, secondary control and tertiary control. In specific, the primary control is indeed a <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> method, including an output virtual impedance loop and the secondary control allows the restoration of deviations produced by the primary control and the tertiary control manages the power flow between the microgrid and the utility grid. The hierarchical control architecture needs communication between distributed sources and central controller and it can be implemented in both grid-tied and islanding operational conditions. Because the <b>droop</b> <b>control</b> method is assumed in the bottom level controller, the controller reliability can still be guaranteed.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{trend of}} the power system is the ever {{increasing}} number of distributed generators (DGs) utilizing renewable energy sources, which have output powers that fluctuate due to unpredictable weather and ambient conditions. This causes fluctuations in system frequency and bus voltages, resulting in poor quality power, higher prices for electricity, and increased chances of reverse power flow and voltage collapse. In order to allow higher levels of DG penetration, methods of reducing the effects of fluctuations must be implemented. This paper proposes a method to mitigate these fluctuations using controllable loads such as heat pump water heaters (HPs) and battery storage systems. The HPs are controlled using a decentralized bang-bang (on/off) control based on the cumulative distribution of water temperature of HPs in the local area and the local frequency. Battery systems are controlled using a smart frequency and voltage <b>droop</b> characteristics based <b>control.</b> The decentralized bang-bang control mitigates local frequency fluctuations by increasing active power consumption to lower frequency as well as decreasing active power consumption to increase the frequency. The smart <b>droop</b> characteristics based <b>control</b> applies a commonly used <b>droop</b> characteristics <b>control</b> to voltage and frequency; however, the control system monitors the state of charge (SOC) of the battery system and takes appropriate actions to prevent the SOC from reaching a critical level.

40|$|Abstract — Generation {{connected}} to electrical distribution systems requires reliable and timely detection of loss-of-mains (islanding). Passive loss-of-mains detection relays typically use measurements of parameters such as frequency, phase, and the magnitudes of voltage and current. If {{a part of}} the power network becomes islanded and there is a very close match between generation and demand of both active and reactive power, there is a risk that the relay {{will not be able to}} detect the loss-of-mains (LOM) event quickly, or perhaps at all. This is the “non-detection zone ” or NDZ. This paper proposes a combination of 2 generator control techniques which allow the NDZ to be avoided even when the generator has significant inertia. Firstly, the natural instability (when islanded) of a grid-connected control scheme consisting of integral and <b>droop</b> <b>controls</b> is recognized and exploited. Secondly, a simple strategy is added which makes occasional small, steady-state adjustments to the reactive power output of the generator. The scheme has been tested in the laboratory and shows that the 2 second detection time required by IEEE 1547 can be achieved, even when an exact match of active power generation and demand is initially configured, and the generator has a significant inertia.
