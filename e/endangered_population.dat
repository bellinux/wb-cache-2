This community comprises three pods which live {{mostly in the}} Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in {{the population in the}} past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.|$|E

Graham red squirrel is distinct or not from red squirrels elsewhere. Studies on genetic data are in progress.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{have questioned}} the usefulness of heterozygosity estimates as measures of the inbreeding coefficient (f), a finding that may have dramatic consequences {{for the management of}} <b>endangered</b> <b>populations.</b> We confirm that f and heterozygosity is poorly correlated in a wild and highly inbred wolf population. Yet, our data show that for each level of f, it was the most heterozygous wolves that established themselves as breeders, a selection process that seems to have decelerated the loss of heterozygosity in the population despite a steady increase of f. The markers contributing to the positive relationship between heterozygosity and breeding success were found to be located on different chromosomes, but there was a substantial amount of linkage disequilibrium in the population, indicating that the markers are reflecting heterozygosity over relatively wide genomic regions. Following our results we recommend that management programs of <b>endangered</b> <b>populations</b> include estimates of both f and heterozygosity, as they may contribute with complementary information about population viability...|$|R

50|$|Since a small founder event {{occurred}} with only about 20 previously domesticated individuals, a genetic bottleneck has inevitably occurred, causing all current individuals in Australia to lack genetic diversity {{as a result}} of inbreeding.
