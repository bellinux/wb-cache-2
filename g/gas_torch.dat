5|$|The torch {{lighting}} ceremony {{took place}} on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector, which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia. In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as {{a gift from the}} Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed overnight in the city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane <b>gas</b> <b>torch</b> {{in order to ensure that}} there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours.|$|E
25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene <b>gas</b> <b>torch</b> welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|E

25|$|Many {{standard}} {{shop and}} woodworking tools {{may be used}} in the process of creating or maintaining deadwood on bonsai. Pliers are used to grip and break off branches for jin, and are also useful for ripping off strips of bark for jin or shari. Manual tools like graving chisels, burins, and blades can carve detail into the surface of the jins or shari, since real or simulated woodgrain is an important characteristic of deadwood on a bonsai. Recent years have seen bonsai practitioners adopt powered tools for deadwood work, particularly small rotary tools for carving and grinding. When shaping is completed, a <b>gas</b> <b>torch</b> burns off remaining small shreds of wood fiber and helps raise the grain in a newly exposed piece of wood. Finally, wire brushes and sanding aids remove toolmarks and simulate weathering.|$|E
25|$|Phosgene {{may also}} be {{produced}} during testing for leaks of older-style refrigerant gases. Chloromethanes (R12, R22 and others) were formerly leak-tested in situ by employing a small <b>gas</b> <b>torch</b> (propane, butane or propylene gas) with a sniffer tube and a copper reaction plate in the flame nozzle of the torch. If any refrigerant gas was leaking from a pipe or joint, the gas would be sucked into the flame through the sniffer tube and would cause a colour change of the gas flame to a bright greenish blue. In the process, phosgene gas would be created due to the thermal reaction. No valid statistics are available, but anecdotal reports suggest that numerous refrigeration technicians suffered the effects of phosgene poisoning due to their ignorance of the toxicity of phosgene, produced during such leak testing. Electronic sensing of refrigerant gases phased out the use of flame testing for leaks in the 1980s. Similarly, phosgene poisoning is a possibility for people fighting fires {{that occur in the}} vicinity of refrigerant leaks from air-conditioning systems or refrigeration equipment, smoking in the vicinity of a freon refrigerant leak, or fighting fires using halon or halotron.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{blowtorches}} used liquid fuel, {{carried in}} a refillable reservoir attached to the lamp. Modern blowtorches are mostly gas-fuelled. Their fuel reservoir is disposable or refillable by exchange. The term [...] "blowlamp" [...] usually refers to liquid-fuelled torches still used in the UK. Liquid-fuelled torches are pressurized by a piston hand pump, while <b>gas</b> <b>torches</b> are self-pressurized by the fuel evaporation.|$|R
40|$|Plasma torches with water-stabilized arc (Gerdien arc) are {{utilized}} in plasma processing for specific applications. In water-stabilized torches an oxygen-hydrogen plasma jet is produced. The torches {{are characterized by}} very low mass flow rates and high power. Plasma enthalpy is thus several times higher than enthalpy of plasmas generated in gas-stabilized torches. High enthalpy is accompanied by very low plasma density. Also other plasma parameters substantially differ from the ones in <b>gas</b> <b>torches.</b> New type of plasma torch with combined stabilization of an electric arc by water vortex and gas flow was investigated. This hybrid water/gas stabilization offers possibility of adjustment of plasma jet parameters {{in a wide range}} from high enthalpy, low density plasmas typical for liquid stabilized torches to lower enthalpy, higher density plasmas generated in <b>gas</b> stabilized <b>torches...</b>|$|R

50|$|Fuel torches are {{available}} in a vast range of size and output power. The term blowtorch applies to the smaller and lower temperature range of these. Blowtorches are typically a single hand-held unit, with their draught supplied by a natural draught of air. The larger torches may have a heavy fuel reservoir placed on the ground, connected by a hose. This is common for butane- or propane-fuelled <b>gas</b> <b>torches,</b> but also applies to the older, large liquid paraffin (kerosene) torches such as the Wells light.|$|R
50|$|Tubing in {{external}} diameters {{ranging from}} about 8-15 mm with a 1 mm wall thickness is most commonly used, although 6 mm tubing is now commercially available in colored glass tubes. The tube is heated in sections using {{several types of}} burners that are selected according {{to the amount of}} glass to be heated for each bend. These burners include ribbon, cannon, or crossfires, as well as a variety of <b>gas</b> <b>torches.</b> Ribbon burners are strips of fire that make the gradual bends while crossfires, when used, make the sharp bends.|$|R
40|$|Context: Alloys {{have been}} {{considered}} to be of paramount importance {{in the field of}} prosthodontics. Long span prosthesis may often require joining of one or more individual castings to obtain better fit, occlusal harmony and esthetics in comparison to one-piece casting. Aim: This study was undertaken to evaluate the mechanical properties of base metal alloys joined by two different techniques, namely, <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>torch</b> soldering and laser fusion, compared to a one-piece casting. Mechanical properties evaluated were tensile strength, percentage of elongation and hardness of the solder joint. In addition, corrosion properties and scanning electron microscopic appearance of the joints were also evaluated. Materials and Methods: The samples were prepared according to American Society for Testing Materials specifications (ASTM, E 8). Specimens were made with self-cure acrylic and then invested in phosphate-bonded investment material. Casting was done in induction casting machine. Thirty specimens were thus prepared for each group and compared with 30 specimens of the one-piece casting group. Statistical Analysis Used: SPSS software (version 10. 0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA and Benferroni post hoc tests were done for multiple comparisons between the groups and within the groups for mean difference and standard error. Results: Results showed that tensile strength of the one-piece casting was higher than laser fused and <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>torch</b> soldered joints. Laser fused joints exhibited higher hardness values compared to that of <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>torch</b> soldered joints. Scanning electron microscopic examination revealed greater porosity in the <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>torch</b> soldered joints. This contributed to the reduction in the strength of the joint. Gas oxygen torch soldered joints showed less corrosion resistance when compared to laser fused joints and one-piece casting. Conclusion: Laser fusion, which is a recent introduction to the field of prosthodontics, produces joints which have properties between those of one-piece casting and the <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>torch</b> soldering...|$|R

[...] "Sweating" [...] is a term sometimes used to describe the soldering of pipe joints.|$|E
50|$|During most {{of their}} history, silversmiths used {{charcoal}} or coke fired forges, and lung-powered blow-pipes for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use <b>gas</b> burning <b>torches</b> as heat sources. A newer method is laser beam welding.|$|R
50|$|Workers must {{completely}} {{strip the}} ship {{down to a}} bare hull, with objects cut free using saws, grinders, abrasive cutting wheels, hand held shears, plasma and <b>gas</b> <b>torches.</b> Anything of value, such as spare parts and electronic equipment is sold for re-use, although labour costs mean that low value items are not economical to sell. The Basel Convention demands that all yards separate hazardous and non-hazardous waste and have appropriate storage units, and this must be done before the hull is cut up. Asbestos, found in the engine room, is isolated and stored in custom-made plastic wrapping prior to being placed in secure steel containers, which are then landfilled.|$|R

Because of leakage into the loading dock below, much of the pool was filled with plantings in the 1980s. On at least one occasion, the sculpture was the target of pranksters who painted large green footprints leading to it from The Spirit of Detroit statue across Woodward Avenue to suggest a late-night visit.|$|R
50|$|Lead burning {{requires}} a <b>gas</b> <b>torch</b> as autogenous processes require an intense, controllable flame {{that can be}} applied to a small area. It was first developed along with the early growth of the bulk chemical industry, as acid manufacture required leakproof lead vessels and flow process plumbing to be made. At the same time, coal gas was increasingly available for domestic lighting. By using a mouth-blown blowpipe, a gas flame could reach temperatures adequate for lead burning. Larger equipment could use mechanical fans.|$|E

Generally, a pressure vessel is a storage tank or vessel that has been designed to operate at pressures above [...] The two main tasks of boilermakers involve using oxy-acetylene <b>gas</b> <b>torch</b> sets to cut or gouge steel plate and tubes, followed by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), or gas metal arc welding (GMAW) to attach and mend the cut sections of tubes and steel plates.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem is}} caused by {{negligence}} from national governments, shipyard operators, and former ship owners disregarding the Basel Convention. According to the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, workers who attempt to unionize are fired and then blacklisted. The employees have no formal contract or any rights, and sleep in over-crowded hostels. The authorities produce no comprehensive injury statistics, so the problem is underestimated. Child labour is also widespread: 20% of Bangladesh's ship breaking workforce are below 15 years of age, mainly involving in cutting with <b>gas</b> <b>torches.</b> [...] Greenpeace discovered that the yard owners and local authorities are complicit in attempting {{to cover up the}} problem in order to reap the economic benefits.|$|R
50|$|In cold conditions, {{snow and}} ice can prevent the correct {{operation}} of switches. In the past, people were employed by railway companies to keep the switches clear by sweeping the snow away, and this is still used in some countries, especially on minor lines. Some were provided with <b>gas</b> <b>torches</b> for melting ice. More recently, switches have had heaters installed {{in the vicinity of}} the points so that the temperature of the rails in these areas can be kept above freezing. The heaters may be powered by gas or electricity.In cases where gas or electric heaters cannot be used due to logistical or economical constraints, anti-icing chemicals can be applied to create a barrier between the metal surfaces of the switch and ice.|$|R

Along with his English navigator, Flying Officer Ken Chapman, Lamason was picked up by members of the French Resistance and hidden at various locations for seven weeks.|$|R
50|$|Metal clay is a {{crafting}} medium {{consisting of}} very small particles of metal such as silver, gold, bronze, or copper mixed with an organic binder and water {{for use in}} making jewelry, beads and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any soft clay, by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired {{in a variety of}} ways such as in a kiln, with a handheld <b>gas</b> <b>torch,</b> or on a gas stove, depending on the type of clay and the metal in it. The binder burns away, leaving the pure sintered metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as bronze, sterling silver, and steel also are available.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with <b>gas</b> <b>torches,</b> a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|R
