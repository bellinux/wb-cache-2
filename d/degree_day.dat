5|$|Lindwall {{resumed his}} {{first-class}} cricket career steadily against Queensland and South Australia. Lindwall gave his first indications of cricketing potential on a 38 <b>degree</b> <b>day</b> {{in the second}} innings of a match against Victoria. A day after suffering a mild malaria attack, Lindwall gave a spell of four overs which netted him three wickets, bowling at speeds not seen in Australia since Larwood. An innings of 134 not out in just 180 minutes against Queensland at the SCG underlined by cutting and driving exhibited his batting skill, and with a haul of 9/77 against South Australia further underlining his allround credential. Lindwall gained further attention when he turned out for New South Wales against the feted Australian Services team of Lindsay Hassett that had played in the 1945 Victory Tests in England. Lindwall's hostile bowling delivered three wickets in each innings, finishing with match figures of 6/95, leading Hassett to rate him as the best fast-bowling prospect in a decade. With 33 wickets for the season, Lindwall as selected for an Australian team tour of New Zealand under Bill Brown. He played in a Test against New Zealand, which was not awarded Test status until 1948. In a match in which Australia fielded seven Test debutants, Lindwall opened the bowling with state teammate Ernie Toshack. Lindwall had limited opportunities on a sticky wicket which favoured the slower bowling of O’Reilly and Toshack, who took eight and seven wickets respectively. He took 1/13 and 1/16 as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. Lindwall made a duck in Australia's only innings.|$|E

The {{areas of study}} include a densely populated and well-developed commercial area (i. e., Tsim Sha Tsui) and three suburban areas (i. e., Cheung Chau, Lau Fau Shan and Sha Tin) with differing degrees of development. The weather station data of respective areas were acquired from the Hong Kong Observatory. The urban heat island intensity, determined as the air-temperature difference between the selected urban/suburban area and the reference rural area (i. e., Ta Kuw Ling) with thin population and lush vegetation, {{was used for the}} analysis. Results showed stronger heat island effect during winter and nighttime than during summer and daytime. An investigation of the cooling and heating <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> indicate that all areas have observed higher number of cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days.</b> However, the cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> were the maximum while heating <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> were the minimum in the urban area (i. e., Tsim Sha Tsui).

The 10 -year (i. e., from 1995 to 2005) average shows that Cheung Chau experienced the least number of cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> while Lau Fau Shan experienced the highest number of heating <b>degree</b> <b>days.</b> Seemingly, the area of Cheung Chau offers better thermal comfort conditions with the minimum number of cooling and heating <b>degree</b> <b>days.</b> © 2010 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Purpose–The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{feasible}} model for the daily average temperatures of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, in order to price temperature-based weather derivatives; also to derive analytical approximation formulas for the sensitivities of these contracts. Design/methodology/approach–This study proposes a seasonal volatility model that estimates daily average temperatures of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen using the mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. It then uses the analytical approximation and Monte Carlo methods to price heating <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> and cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> options for these cities. In addition, it derives and calculates the option sensitivities on the basis of an analytical approximation formula. Findings–There exists a strong seasonality in the volatility of daily average temperatures of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. To model the seasonality Fourier approximation is applied to the squared volatility of daily temperatures. The analytical approximation formulas and Monte Carlo simulation produce very similar prices for heating/cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> options in Beijing and Shanghai, a result that also verifies the convergence of the Monte Carlo and approximation estimators. However, the two methods do not produce converging option prices in the case of HDD options for Shenzhen.
