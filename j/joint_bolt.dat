One of {{the most}} {{important}} reasons for railway traffic accidents is the fatigue failure of the rail <b>joint</b> <b>bolt.</b> Therefore, the research on the fatigue properties of rail <b>joint</b> <b>bolt</b> has important practical significance. This paper analyzed the influence of different pre-tightening torque on the fatigue life of the rail <b>joint</b> <b>bolt.</b> Besides, the best pre-tightening torque of the bolt was acquired through theoretical calculations.

40|$|The article {{describes}} promising structures of clip (screw and friction) connections with incomplete sweep of shaft used in machines and mechanisms {{for the oil}} and gas industry. The contact problems of interaction between semi-hubs and shaft for the symmetric and asymmetric connections are formulated. For structures that are asymmetric relatively the <b>joint</b> <b>bolt</b> two types of interaction are investigated: with and without lateral displacement. Based on a priori assumption about the distribution laws of contact pressure accepted in traditional courses of “Machine Details” an engineering method for calculating of clip connections is developed.

40|$|Water inrush {{from the}} {{excavation}} face often {{occurs in the}} current shield construction of metro tunnels. In this study, the discontinuity of shield tunnel lining and {{the interaction between the}} tunnel segments, the grouting layer, and the surrounding rock are considered. Based on the 3 D nonlinear contact theory, a hybrid model of the shield tunnel is constructed. Considering the fluid-solid coupling effect of water and soil, the influences of different water head differences on the mechanical performance and deformation of segments and joints in the shield tunnel are studied. The water gushing from the excavation face leads to vertical convergence of the cross-sectional area of the shield tunnel, and joint opening and dislocation result in sharp decrease of the waterproof capacity of joints. Meanwhile, the stress in the vicinity of segment joints increases sharply, and local cracks occur in the segment lining. The axial force, shear force, and bending moment in the <b>joint</b> <b>bolt</b> are also significantly increased. Based on the current metro standard and the computational results in this study, an emergency control criterion is put forward by means of controlling the discharge of water: the water head difference over the excavation face is required less than 4. 6 [*]M...|$|E

40|$|Impact loads {{generated}} by derailed trains {{can be extremely}} high, {{especially in the case}} of heavy trains running at high speeds, which usually cause significant safety issues to the rail infrastructures. In shield tunnels, such impact loads may not only cause the damage and deformation of concrete segments, but also lead to the failure of segmental <b>joint</b> <b>bolts.</b> This paper presents a numerical study on the failure behavior of segmental <b>joint</b> <b>bolts</b> in the shield tunnel under impact loading resulting from train derailments. A three-dimensional (3 D) numerical model of a shield tunnel based on the finite element (FE) modelling strategy was established, in which the structural behavior of the segmental joint surfaces and the mechanical behavior of the segmental <b>joint</b> <b>bolts</b> were determined. The numerical results show that the occurrence of bolt failure starts at the joints near the impacted segment and develops along the travel direction of train. An extensive parametric study was subsequently performed and the influences of the bolt failure on the dynamic response of the segment were investigated. In particular, the proposed FE model and the analytical results will be used for optimizing the design method of the shield tunnel in preventing the failure of the <b>joint</b> <b>bolts</b> due to the impact load from a derailed HST...|$|R

In general, double <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> {{were found to have}} greater load carrying capacities than single <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> (by 40 %– 49 %). In single <b>bolt</b> <b>joints,</b> the plate width had insignificant effect on the behaviour of the joint under tensile loading; whereas, increasing the distance of the hole from the edge, considerably enhanced the strength of the <b>joint.</b> In double <b>bolt</b> <b>joints,</b> changing the edge distance had almost no effect on the behaviour of the joint.

40|$|<b>Bolted</b> <b>joints</b> {{are widely}} used {{in a variety of}} {{engineering}} applications where they are dynamically loaded with frequencies of vibration spread over a wide spectrum with the same general effects. When under dynamic loading, <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> can become loose due to a loss in clamping pressure in the joints. This vibrational loosening sometimes can cause serious problems, and in some cases can lead to fatal consequences if it remains undetected. Non-intrusive ultrasonic and image processing techniques were simultaneously used to investigate the relaxation of contact pressure and loosening of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to cyclic shear loading. Three critical areas, the contact interface of the bolted component, the bolt length and the rotation of the bolt head, were monitored during loosening of the joints. The results show that loosening of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> can be grouped into three stages: very rapid, rapid, and gradual loosening. The earliest stage of the loosening of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> is characterised by cyclic strain ratcheting–loosening of the <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> during vibration without rotation of the bolt head. The higher the rate of relaxation at this early stage, the lower is the resistance of the <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> to vibration-induced loosening. Both the dynamic shear load and an additional constant shear load in another direction were observed to affect the rate of loosening, and at this early stage, a rise in the magnitude of the additional constant shear load increases the rate of loosening.
