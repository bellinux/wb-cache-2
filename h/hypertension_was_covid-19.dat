40|$|Background: Ischemic Heart Disease {{has been}} {{increasing}} in the Middle East and North Africa. <b>Hypertension</b> <b>is</b> an important modifiable risk factor of IHD and {{play an important role}} in the epidemic of IHD. <b>Hypertension</b> <b>is</b> responsible for about 45 % of IHD mortality and affects more than one billion people around the world. Objective: This study aims to quantify the population attributable fraction of IHD due to hypertension in the Middle East and North Africa. Methods: Sex-specific prevalence of <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> obtained from national and international studies. Moreover, age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of IHD and <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> extracted from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). HR and sex-specific prevalence of <b>hypertension</b> <b>were</b> used to calculate PAF of IHD due to hypertension in various countries of the region. Results: The sex-specific prevalence of <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> available for seventeen countries of the region. Hypertension ranged from 4. 5 % in Palestine to 47 % in Algeria in females and from 2. 2 %in Palestine to 50. 7 % in Oman in males. The fraction of IHD attributable to hypertension ranged from 4. 3 %in Palestine to 32 %in Algeria in females and from 2. 2 % in Palestine to 33. 7 %in Oman males.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the 1960 s provided {{new insights into}} the nature of high blood pressure disorders. Blood pressure is now categorised into four quadrants:normotension, masked hypertension, hypertension and white-coat hypertension. In white-coat <b>hypertension</b> blood pressure <b>is</b> elevated when taken at the doctor’s office but normal if taken outside the doctor’s office. Several controversies are associated with white-coat <b>hypertension,</b> which <b>are</b> discussed in Chapter 1. Whether white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> a condition of increased cardiovascular risk is the most important current issue. The consensus from prospective studies has been that the cardiovascular risk in white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> similar to normotensives, but recent studies suggest that white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> associated with an increased risk for the development of hypertension, which may mean an increased cardiovascular risk is present but delayed in white-coat hypertension. Examining the literature (Chapter 2) {{at the time of the}} thesis commencement highlighted inconsistencies in the definition for white-coat hypertension, which makes it difficult to determine if white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> associated with biomarkers of increased cardiovascular risk. This thesis by publication investigated whether white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> a condition of increased cardiovascular risk by determining: (1) if biomarkers of increased cardiovascular risk that are known to be present in essential <b>hypertension</b> <b>are</b> present in strictly defined white-coat hypertension based on a consensus definition for white-coat hypertension (Chapter 4); (2) if white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> associated with an increased morning blood pressure surge (Chapter 5); (3) if white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> associated with increased risk for the development of new-onset hypertension; and (4) if biomarkers measured at baseline predict the development of sustained hypertension in white-coat hypertension (Chapter 7). Participants underwent measurement of artery stiffness, autonomic function, glucose and insulin status,circulating measures of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, and twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to confirm blood pressure status. White-coat hypertension participants required two twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitorings to confirm blood pressure status. Participants returned yearly for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for three years. New-onset <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> defined based on elevated mean ambulatory blood pressure. This research has identified that white-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> associated with markers of increased cardiovascular risk, including an elevated baseline two-hour glucose post glucose load and increased progression to sustained hypertension compared to normotensives. Elevated baseline measures of waist circumference, artery stiffness and two-hour load blood glucose were elevated in white-coat hypertension who progressed to sustained <b>hypertension.</b> White-coat <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> not associated with an increased morning blood pressure surge but univariate analysis found lipids were associated with the morning blood pressure surge (Chapter 5), which was confirmed in a larger study that included normotensive, treated and untreated hypertensive participants (Chapter 6). White-coat <b>hypertension</b> should <b>be</b> considered a condition of increased cardiovascular risk. Based on the results of this thesis treating doctors are advised that they should not focus solely on the white-coat hypertensive subject’s blood pressure but on their total cardiovascular risk and such subjects should be monitored for the development of both hypertension and type 2 diabetes...|$|R
