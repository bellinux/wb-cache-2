In spite of that the Spitzberg {{continues to be a}} botanically interesting habitat. On the northern side there is an oak and hornbeam wood (including Small-leaved Lime, Norway Maple, Sycamore Maple and Ash) interspersed with species like the lungworts. In addition the sun-exposed hill is also home to several warmth-loving plants like the Crown Vetch and the <b>Hoary</b> <b>Cinquefoil.</b>|$|E
