40|$|The {{field of}} 2 ̆ 7 {{historical}} ecology 2 ̆ 7 {{is coming to}} maturity {{at a time when}} we, in Australia, are reflecting on our relationship with, and place in, the land. After an essentially ahistorical approach to land use we are now attempting to place land management into the context of environmental change since and immediately preceding Western European settlement. This volume reflects an emerging concern that, collectively, non-indigenous Australians have no 2 ̆ 7 environmental history 2 ̆ 7. One component of 2 ̆ 7 living in 2 ̆ 7 rather than 2 ̆ 7 battling against 2 ̆ 7 the land is developing a sense of our history. Without an oral narrative that is commonly shared, attempts to develop the story of environmental change have to be based on retrospective and reconstructive research. This volume captures part of this movement to develop an environmental narrative and context for our future relationship with the land. There are many methodological approaches to reconstructing a story of the past, from local knowledge and oral history to the 2 ̆ 7 high-tech 2 ̆ 7 and hard sciences. This paper reviews methods that apply stable carbon <b>isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> to reconstruct environmental change. Although well suited to environmental history, carbon <b>isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> remain under-utilised in the Australian context. Here I review applications to highlight the strengths and limitations of carbon <b>isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> in the reconstruction of century-scale vegetation change. There have been two dominant applications of carbon <b>isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> to environmental reconstruction. These applications fall broadly into either stable carbon isotope analysis of organic matter in soils and sediments, or inferences of environmental states have been drawn from carbon isotope analysis of animal tissues and residues. The main strength of stable carbon <b>isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> is that they can be spatially precise while integrating a range of environmental information into one isotopic signal. This integrative strength {{is at the same time}} one of the major limitations of carbon <b>isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> because floristic (taxonomic) resolution is low...|$|R

All the stable isotopes were measured using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS). The physical parameters (such as pH and electrical conductivity, EC) which have been measured in–situ and hydrochemical values were also determined as these results are important as it will be used along with the isotopic data.

40|$|<b>Isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have found}} {{increasingly}} wide {{scope of application}} to the environmental geochemistry of natural waters since 1960. The stable isotope ratio of hydrogen (D/H) varies in natural waters, as dose that of oxygen (18 O/ 16 O), due to isotopic separation during evaporation and condensation processes in the hydrologic cycle. The concentration of radioactive hydrogen isotope (tritium) in natural waters increased sharply following the atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs during the 1950 s and 1960 s. Thermonuclear tritium remaining in natural waters is a good indicator of {{the presence or absence}} of recent recharge and water age (residence time). Since deuterium, tritium and oxygen- 18 are constituents of water molecules (HDO, HTO and H 218 O) they serve as unique tracers in environmental geochemistry of natural waters.

40|$|Stable <b>isotope</b> <b>techniques</b> using {{deuterium}} or 18 O are {{reference methods}} for assessing total body water (TBW) for body composition. In combination, they provide total energy expenditure and human milk intake in exclusively breast-fed (EBF) infants.

40|$|In 18 {{patients}} who were undergoing upper laparotomies the alveolo-arterial oxygen difference and right-to-left shunt were measured before the operation, on the first post-operative day, {{and in some cases}} also later in the post-operative period.

40|$|Infant {{formulas}} {{based on}} soyabean protein isolate {{are often used}} {{as an alternative to}} cows'-based formulas. However, the presence of phytic acid in soya formulas has raised concern about the absorption of trace elements and minerals from these products. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate mineral and trace element absorption from regular and dephytinised soya formula in healthy infants. Soyabean protein isolate with a relatively low native content of phytic acid was used for production of a regular soya formula (300 mg phytic acid/kg liquid formula) and an experimental formula was based on dephytinised soya protein isolate (< 6 mg phytic acid/kg liquid formula). Using a crossover study design, apparent mineral and trace element absorptions were measured by a stable <b>isotope</b> <b>technique</b> based on 72 h faecal excretion of non-absorbed stable isotopes (Zn, Fe, Cu and Ca) and by the chemical balance technique (Mn, Zn, Cu and Ca) in nine infants (69 - 191 d old).

The results from the present study demonstrated that Zn absorption, measured by a stable <b>isotope</b> <b>technique,</b> was significantly greater after dephytinisation (mean value 16 · 7 v. 22 · 6 %; P= 0 · 03). No other statistically significant differences between the two formulas were observed. The nutritional benefit of dephytinisation was marginal in the present study. Based on these results, the use of soyabean protein isolate with low native content of phytic acid should be promoted for production of soya formulas and adequate addition of ascorbic acid to enhance Fe absorption should be ensured in the product...|$|E

Using a double <b>isotope</b> <b>technique,</b> the distribution of radiolabelled microspheres to tumour and normal liver tissue was measured before and after angiotensin II infusion in nine patients with multiple liver metastases. The median increase in tumour: normal ratio following angiotensin II infusion was by a factor of 2. 8 (range 0. 8 - 11. 7, P less than 0. 05).

40|$|The stable {{isotopes}} {{of oxygen}} and hydrogen have been employed worldwide as natural hydrological tracers, and most successfully {{in areas where}} extremes of climatic seasonality or relief exist. This project aims to assess {{the viability of the}} stable <b>isotope</b> <b>technique</b> for studies in the U. K. Systematic sampling was undertaken over two years in the Malham (Carboniferous limestone) and Lambourn (Chalk) areas. The monthly isotopic input signal in precipitation was found to be clearly definable, but less strongly seasonal than found elsewhere. Larger isotopic variations were revealed in weekly and within-storm samples. Snowmelt appeared to provide the most reliable 'spike' for tracing purposes. An attempt to relate weekly precipitation δ 18 0 values to air mass characteristics was encouraging for further investigations. Variations of isotope signal with altitude were erratic and not in accordance with normally accepted relationships. Isotopic variations in groundwaters of both areas, and in surface waters of the Lambourn area, rarely exceeded measurement error, and were close to mean annual values in precipitation. This indicated complete mixing of the input waters over one year or more. The isotopic range in precipitation was reduced by ~ 60 % in surface waters of the Malham area. Early mixing and storage of water in the soil and/or upper karstic zone were indicated by comparison of the isotope data with conventional hydrological measurements at resurgences, and supported by strong signal attenuation measured in soil moisture. At certain sites, isotopic evidence revealed a persistence of winter recharge into summer baseflow. A smooth and strongly seasonal isotope signal, discovered in the waters of Malham Tarn, was attributed to evaporation processes and suggests important practical uses. It is concluded that the general application of the stable <b>isotope</b> <b>technique</b> may be more restricted in the U. K. than elsewhere, but that its provision of a new dimension to conventional data should contribute significantly in the future to selected hydrological studies. </p...|$|E
