Stimulation of protein synthesis over the endogenous background was about 2 -fold with 30 - 40 S viral RNA and about 1. 3 -fold with 60 - 70 S viral RNA as template.

Methods Three-day estimated dietary records were collected from 661 preschoolers aged 2. 5 - 6. 5 y (338 boys and 323 girls). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate the association between animal, plant, and food <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein</b> intake and socio-economic and lifestyle factors. Results Animal proteins (mean 38 g/d) were the main source of total protein (mean 56 g/d), while mean plant protein intake amounted to 18 g/d. The group of meat, poultry, fish and eggs was the main contributor (51 %) to animal protein intake, followed by milk and milk products (35 %). Bread and cereals (41 %) contributed most to the plant protein intake, followed by low-nutritious, energy-dense foods (21 %). With higher educated fathers and mothers as reference, respectively, preschoolers with lower secondary and secondary paternal education had lower animal, dairy-, and meat-derived protein intakes, and those with lower secondary and secondary maternal education consumed less plant, and bread and cereal-derived proteins. Compared to children with high physical activity levels, preschoolers with low and moderate physical activity had lower animal and plant protein intakes. Significantly higher potatoes and grains-, and fish- derived proteins were reported for children of smoking mothers and fathers, respectively, compared to those of non-smoking mothers and fathers. Conclusions The total protein intake of Flemish preschoolers was sufficient according to the recommendations of the Belgian Superior Health Council.

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein</b> reagents, N-bromoacetamide (NBA) and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), modify {{sodium channel}} gating when perfused inside squid axons.

40|$|In {{most of the}} {{bacterial}} agglutinating systems previously {{studied by}} the quantitative method (1 - 5) well defined capsular polysaccharide antigens and their corresponding antibodies were principally involved. The greater part of the antibody produced {{as a result of}} intravenous injections of microorganisms such as type-specific pneumococci or It. influenzae reacts with these capsular antigens, relatively little being directed toward minor antigens such as somatic polysaccharides and proteins. On the other hand, immunization with hemolytic streptococci results in the production of antibodies reactive with a number of different antigenic components, of which the type-specific M- (6) and T- (7) substances, the groupspecific somatic polysaccharide-C (6), and at least two <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein</b> antigens (6, 8 - 11) have been recognized as separate entities.

To identify and characterize E. phagocytophila <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein</b> antigen genes, we prepared and screened HGE agent and Ehrlichia equi genomic DNA expression libraries using polyclonal equine E. equi antibodies. Two clones, one each from HGE agent and E. equi, that were recognized specifically by antibodies to the E. phagocytophila group ehrlichiae had complete open reading frames of 3, 693 and 3, 615 nucleotides, respectively. The two clones were 96. 6 % identical and predicted a protein with at least 11 tandemly repeated ankyrin motifs. Thus, the gene was named ank (for ankyrin). When the encoded protein, named AnkA, was expressed in Escherichia coli, it was recognized by antibodies from rabbits and mice immunized with the HGE agent, sera from humans convalescent from HGE, and sera from horses convalescent from HGE and E. equi infection. Monospecific AnkA antibodies reacted with proteins in HGE agent immunoblots, and AnkA monoclonal antibodies detected cytoplasmic antigen in E. phagocytophila group bacteria and also detected antigen associated with chromatin in infected but not uninfected HL- 60 cell cultures.

40|$|Coronavirus subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) {{synthesis}} occurs via {{a process}} of discontinuous transcription involving transcrip-tion regulatory sequences (TRSs) located in the 5 = leader sequence (TRS-L) and upstream of each structural and group-specific gene (TRS-B). Several gammacoronaviruses including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contain a putative open reading frame (ORF), localized between theM gene and gene 5, which is controversial due to the perceived absence of a TRS. We have studied the transcription of a novel sgmRNA associated with this potential ORF and {{found it to be}} transcribed via a previously unidenti-fied noncanonical TRS-B. Using an IBV reverse genetics system, we demonstrated that the template-switching event during in-tergenic region (IR) sgmRNA synthesis occurs at the 5 = end of the noncanonical TRS-B and recombines between nucleotides 5 and 6 of the 8 -nucleotide consensus TRS-L. Introduction of a complete TRS-B showed that higher transcription levels are achieved by increasing the number of nucleotide matches between TRS-L and TRS-B.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that in certain cell systems {{dexamethasone}} may enhance the production of type C viruses. Conversely, interferon has been shown to inhibit their production. Both appear to exert their influence late in the viral replication cycle rather than on the synthesis of viral-specific RNA. In this report dexamethasone and interferon have been used to study some aspects of the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of type C viruses in murine K-BALB cells following induction of virus production by iododeoxyuridine. Interferon inhibited production of xenotropic type C virus induced by iododeoxyuridine from K-BALB cells both in the absence and presence of dexamethasone, but it did not affect production of N-tropic type C virus. Exposure of the cells to interferon for longer than 12 h was required for maximum effect. Two types of inhibitory effects were observed: one diminished by dexamethasone when the steroid was added 24 h after interferon removal, and the second resistant to dexamethasone. The concentration of intracellular group-specific antigen was diminshed after interferon and increased after dexamethasone exposure. When induced cells were treated with both interferon and dexamethasone, the intracellular <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein</b> concentration was slightly increased, but virus production was reduced 10 -fold compared with induced cells treated with dexamethasone alone. We conclude that interferon and dexamethasone may affect both the synthesis of viral proteins and the assembly or release of virus particles and that dexamethasone can partially nullify the inhibitory activity of interferon. The results also support previous conclusions that the regulatory mechanisms for synthesis of viral proteins and for the release of viral particles may differ and that controls for xenotropic and ecotropic virus formation may not be identical...|$|E
40|$|The severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) open {{reading frame}} 3 a protein has recently been shown to be a structural protein. The protein is encoded by one of the so-called group-specific genes and has no sequence homology with any of the known structural or <b>group-specific</b> <b>proteins</b> of coronaviruses. It does, however, have several similarities to the coronavirus M proteins; (i) they are triple membrane spanning with the same topology, (ii) they have similar intracellular localizations (predominantly Golgi), (iii) both are viral structural proteins, and (iv) they appear to interact with the E and S proteins, as well as with each other. The M protein plays a crucial role in coronavirus assembly and is glycosylated in all coronaviruses, either by N-linked or by O-linked oligosaccharides. The conserved glycosylation of the coronavirus M proteins and the resemblance of the 3 a protein to them led us to investigate the glycosylation of these two SARS-CoV membrane proteins. The proteins were expressed separately using the vaccinia virus T 7 expression system, followed by metabolic labeling. Pulse-chase analysis showed that both proteins were modified, although in different ways. While the M protein acquired cotranslationally oligosaccharides that could be removed by PNGaseF, the 3 a protein acquired its modifications posttranslationally, and they were not sensitive to the N-glycosidase enzyme. The SARS-CoV 3 a protein, however, was demonstrated to contain sialic acids, indicating the presence of oligosaccharides. O-glycosylation of the 3 a protein was indeed confirmed using an in situ O-glycosylation assay of endoplasmic reticulum-retained mutants. In addition, we showed that substitution of serine and threonine residues in the ectodomain of the 3 a protein abolished the addition of the O-linked sugars. Thus, the SARS-CoV 3 a protein is an O-glycosylated glycoprotein, like the group 2 coronavirus M proteins but unlike the SARS-CoV M protein, which is N glycosylated...|$|R

Despite the rapid clearance of virus, the mice developed pneumonia that was at least as severe as in unimmunized mice. Preliminary studies suggest that the rapid clearance {{of influenza}} virus from the lungs of mice immunized with M protein may be initiated by a cell-mediated rather than a humoral response. The mechanism by which a cross-reactive internal virion protein can initiate clearance of the different subtypes of influenza is not clear.

40|$|The {{proteins}} of purified avian oncoviruses {{were analyzed}} by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Certain members of the avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses (ALSV) had group-specific antigens with altered electrophoretic properties. (i) The p 27 protein of Rous-associated virus 0 (RAV- 0) had a lower electrophoretic mobility in SDS gels and a lower isoelectric point than the p 27 of other ALSV. (ii) The p 19 proteins of RAV- 1, RAV- 2, and the Bryan high-titer strain of Rous sarcoma virus had higher mobilities in SDS gels than did the corresponding protein of other viruses. This altered electrophoretic mobility was correlated with specific differences in the tryptic peptides of radioiodinated p 19 s. (iii) The p 15 protein of RAV- 7 had a lower mobility in SDS gels than did the p 15 of other ALSV. These markers were used {{in a study of}} the structural proteins of subgroup E RAV- 60 produced after infection of chicken embryo cells by exogenous ALSV. Although exogenous <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein</b> markers could often be identified in the subgroup E isolates, one RAV- 60 had a p 27 that comigrated with the p 27 of RAV- 0. The p 19 s of two other RAV- 60 isolates had electrophoretic properties that were different than those of p 19 s from either RAV- 0 or the exogenous viruses.

Twelve lambs were inoculated with a lytic OvLV isolate and 3 lambs each with two nonlytic OvLV isolates. Five control lambs were inoculated with either virus-free medium or were left uninoculated. In 8 of 12 lambs inoculated with a lytic OvLV isolate mild to severe lesions of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) and pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia developed, 6 of 12 lambs had lesions of pulmonary lymph node follicular hyperplasia, 3 of 9 female lambs had lesions of lymphoproliferative mastitis, 3 of 10 lambs had lesions of lymphocytic/plasmacytic synovitis, and 3 lambs had no lesions. In 3 of 6 lambs inoculated with nonlytic OvLV isolates only mild LIP lesions developed, without concurrent mammary gland or joint lesions. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples from OvLV-diseased lambs contained on average 1. 5 -fold more numbers of total leukocytes, and 4 -fold more numbers of lymphocytes, compared with bronchoalveolar lavage samples of normal lambs. Monoclonal antibodies to ovine lymphocyte surface markers showed that the SBU-T 8 + lymphocyte (CD 8 equivalent) was the predominant lymphocyte subset (mean of 65 % of total lavaged lymphocytes) in bronchoalveolar lavage samples of 3 diseased lambs. Ovine lentivirus was reisolated from multiple tissues of both groups of OvLV-inoculated lambs, but the percentage of individual tissues infected was greater in lambs inoculated with the lytic viral isolate. Control lambs had no lesions and failed to produce OvLV-specific antibodies or yield OvLV from tissues. All OvLV-inoculated lambs produced either low or undetectable serum virus neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, lambs inoculated with either lytic or nonlytic OvLV produced precipitating antibodies to OvLV glycoprotein and <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein.</b> However, initial detection of precipitating antibodies to OvLV glycoprotein was earlier (mean, 5. 8 weeks after inoculation) in OvLV-infected lambs in which severe lymphoproliferative disease developed and delayed (mean, 10. 2 weeks after inoculation) in OvLV-infected lambs with mild or no lesions.

40|$|Protein 3 a is {{the largest}} <b>group-specific</b> <b>protein</b> of severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which is distributed in endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the plasma membrane in infected or transfected cells. The association of the 3 a protein with the SARS coronavirus structure and its involvement in cellular responses of the host cells implicate that it is involved in the pathogenesis of the SARS infectious disease. In the current study, the intracellular and extracellular trafficking behaviors of the 3 a protein in relation to its cellular effects were investigated. Firstly, it has been found that neither of the tyrosine-based motif nor the adjacent diacidic motif, which has been reported to direct the 3 a protein transporting to cell plasma membrane, is essential for the subcellular localization of the 3 a protein. Using the site-directed mutagenesis and truncation mutants, another two tyrosine-based signals (Y 200 VVV and Y 211 YQL) and a novel phenylalanine rich tetrapeptide signal (F 230 FIF) have been identified to act synergistically to escort protein 3 a to the cell surface. However, these signals have no significant influence on the pro-apoptotic activity of 3 a protein and its extracellular release, which seems to be depended on a mechanism different from the cell surface translocation. An adenoviral expression system has been established to investigate the immune response of the 3 a protein and found that it stimulates the production of chemokines RANTES and IL- 8 by real-time PCR. To understand how the 3 a protein exerts these cellular effects, an unknown human protein, DKFZP 434 H 132, which was previously identified from a lymph node cDNA library to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of protein 3 a using a yeast two-hybrid system. The expression and subcellular localization of this protein has been characterized in different cell lines, and it is found as a universal protein with abundant expression in mammalian cells with phylogenic specificity. Immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that DKFZP 434 H 132 protein co-localizes with protein 3 a only when the later is in absent of the carboxy terminal fusion, providing unequivocal evidence for in vivo interaction between the two proteins.

When ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, 8 ab induced the proteolysis of ATF 6 and the translocation of its cleaved DNA-binding and transcription-activation domains from the ER to the nucleus. Finally, we showed that 8 ab binds to the luminal domain of ATF 6. These findings suggest that 8 ab could modulate the UPR by activating ATF 6 to facilitate protein folding and processing.

40|$|Dengue virus (DENV), {{a member}} of the Flavivirus family, has four {{distinct}} serotypes (DENV serotype 1 [DENV 1], DENV 2, DENV 3, and DENV 4) that require differentiation for the effective prevention of morbid disease. Early and rapid differentiation between flaviviruses remains challenging. Full assays combining four individual, serotype-specific and one <b>group-specific</b> nonstructural <b>protein</b> 1 (NS 1) antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against DENV NS 1 were developed and validated. The sensitivities and specificities of the full NS 1 ELISAs were evaluated with viral cultures and dengue acute-phase sera. Four serotype-specific NS 1 ELISAs displayed high specificities for the detection and differentiation of appropriate serotypes. The group-specific NS 1 ELISA was broadly reactive with the four dengue virus serotypes. None of the NS 1 ELISAs displayed cross-reactivity with the other flaviviruses or samples from febrile patients with non-dengue virus infections. The full serotype- and group-specific MAb-based NS 1 capture ELISAs may provide tools for the early detection and typing of dengue infection, which is preferable to reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for the rapid differential diagnosis of dengue virus infection in the field...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} <b>protein</b> <b>group-specific</b> antigen (Gag) is {{the only}} viral product required for retrovirus assembly and will form virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro {{in the presence of}} nucleic acids. The nature of the contribution of nucleic acid to particle assembly and structure is not fully understood. Further, interactions of Gag protein with nucleic acids have not been characterized in any detail. We have utilized a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to investigate the possible assembly of Gag particles in the presence of three oligonucleotides—TGx 2. 5, TGx 10, and TGx 20 (a 5 -mer, 20 -mer, and 40 -mer, respectively). QCM-D provides information on both mass changes, measured as a change in frequency, and structural changes measured as changes in energy dissipation...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the sites of}} synthesis of avian sarcoma virus-specific proteins in infected chicken cells by immunoprecipitation of the products synthesized in vitro by free and membrane-bound polyribosomes; 85 % of Pr 76, the precursor of the viral internal structural <b>proteins</b> (<b>group-specific</b> antigens), was synthesized on free polyribosomes, and 15 % was synthesized on membrane-bound polyribosomes. Pr 92, the lycosylated precursor of the viral glycoproteins (gp 85 and gp 35), was synthesized exclusively on membrane-bound polyribomes, {{which is consistent with}} its role as a membrane protein. When we investigated the site of synthesis of pp 60 src, the product of the avian sarcoma virus src gene, we found that 90 % was synthesized on free polyribosomes, whereas 10 % was detected on membrane-bound polyribosomes. The implications of these results with respect to the subcellular location of pp 60 src are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} play {{an essential}} role in the coronavirus life cycle. The scope of this thesis was to obtain further insight into membrane-associated processes during SARS-CoV infection by studying various features of different viral membrane proteins. Targets were selected mainly from two different classes of membrane-associated proteins, i. e. replicase (nonstructural) proteins and accessory (or <b>group-specific)</b> <b>proteins.</b> The three hydrophobic nonstructural proteins (nsp) were characterized in order to obtain insight into the membrane anchoring of the coronavirus replication complex. These proteins, nsp 3, nsp 4 and nsp 6, are predicted to represent key components directing the formation of the viral replication structures. Therefore the biosynthesis, processing and membrane topology of each one of these proteins was studied. The analysis of nsp 4 additionally focused on the localization of this protein to replication sites and on the contribution of the host cell to the formation of these sites. The membranes of the replication structures appeared to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and the generation of these structures was found to involve the cellular early secretory pathway. The study of nsp 3 and nsp 6 concentrated particularly on the membrane integration of these complex proteins and on the contribution of each of the hydrophobic domains to this process. Both proteins appeared to contain a hydrophobic domain that fulfills the criteria for a transmembrane domain but which does not actually span the lipid bilayer. This is more often found in RNA virus nonstructural proteins and might be related to functions of these proteins. These domains could be involved in protein-protein interactions or in the shaping of the membrane. Also the SARS-CoV accessory proteins were studied. The accessory protein encoded by ORF 3 a, which had just been shown to be incorporated into virions, was characterized. In view of its remarkable structural similarity to the membrane protein M, we comparatively analyzed the co- and posttranslational modifications of these two proteins. Both proteins were found to be glycosylated although differentially. Whereas the SARS-CoV M protein was N-glycosylated, the 3 a protein was modified by O-linked sugars. Remarkably, in this aspect the 3 a protein resembles the M proteins of the most closely related coronaviruses more than the SARS-CoV M protein does. Finally, the functional expression of the ORF 8 related protein products was examined. This genomic region is of particular interest {{in the evolution of the}} SARS-CoV, since a deletion occurred early during the SARS epidemic, which was found in all later human virus isolates. Because of this deletion only a very small fragment of the original protein, 8 ab+, is still produced. The 8 ab+ protein found in animal viruses accumulates in the ER, where it is N-glycosylated and forms homomultimeric complexes. The deletion clearly had a radical effect on the functional meaning of this genomic region. However, whether and how this influenced the spread of the virus within the human population remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for detecting electrophoretic and quantitative variants of <b>group-specific</b> component (Gc) <b>proteins</b> is described. The technique, in vitro labeling with radioactive vitamin D followed by {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} and autoradiography (PAGE autoradiography), permits sensitive, high resolution detection of Gc variants by virtue of a physiologically significant property: the ability of Gc to bind vitamin D and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D. Using this procedure, anodal Gc variants, with mobility similar to Gc Aborigine and Gc Eskimo, were observed in Chinese, Japanese, African Pygmies, and American Blacks. The gene frequency of these variants ranges from 2. 6 % to 15 %; they were not previously known to be polymorphic in these populations. In addition to qualitative variants, individual variation in Gc band density ratios is documented and discussed. These studies not only illustrate the utility of PAGE autoradiography in screening Gc, but also confirm that a major functional role of Gc in man and other animals is the transport of vitamin D and vitamin D metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Local order: AFP {{belongs to}} the family of albumin genes {{together}} with serum albumin (ALB), <b>group-specific</b> component/vitamin D-binding <b>protein</b> (GC) and afamin/alpha-albumin (AFM). All genes of this family are localized on the long arm of chromosome 4 and are proposed to originate from common predecessor. ALB, AFP and AFM located at the same chromosome locus consequently are proposed to be cooperatively regulated (Lazarevich, 2000). Note 25037 bases. AFP was described as a major fetal serum protein absent in normal adult serum. Later dramatic increase of AFP level was revealed in serum of mice and humans with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, germ cell tumors and gastrointestinal carcinomas (Abelev et al., 1963; Abelev, 1971). These findings allowed to classify AFP that is expressed in embryo, downregulated after birth and reactivated in cancer, as onco-embryonic marker. Alterations of AFP level in blood serum are widely used in diagnostics of several types of epithelial cancers and abnormalities of prenatal development (Abelev and Eraiser, 1999) ...|$|R
40|$|Rickettsia felis, the {{etiologic}} agent of spotted fever, is maintained in cat fleas by vertical transmission and resembles other tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsiae. In the present study, we utilized an Ixodes scapularis-derived tick cell line, ISE 6, to achieve isolation and propagation of R. felis. A cytopathic effect of increased vacuolization was commonly observed in R. felis-infected cells, while lysis of host cells was not evident despite {{large numbers of}} rickettsiae. Electron microscopy identified rickettsia-like organisms in ISE 6 cells, and sequence analyses of portions of the citrate synthase (gltA), 16 S rRNA, Rickettsia genus-specific 17 -kDa antigen, and spotted fever <b>group-specific</b> outer membrane <b>protein</b> A (ompA) genes and, notably, R. felis conjugative plasmids indicate that this cultivatable strain (LSU) was R. felis. Establishment of R. felis (LSU) in a tick-derived cell line provides an alternative and promising system {{for the expansion of}} studies investigating the interactions between R. felis and arthropod hosts...|$|R
