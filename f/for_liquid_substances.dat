The methodic calculation of this resistance for bodies with solid, <b>liquid</b> <b>substance</b> and phase-change materials is offered. Being based on the theory of a regular thermal mode, formulas for calculation of internal thermal resistance of the bodies having {{the form of a}} sphere, the cylinder and a paralle-lepiped are obtained. <b>For</b> bodies with <b>liquid</b> <b>substance</b> this resistance is in view of a wall of vessels and resistance of a boundary layer at natural convection of liquids. In the case of substances with a phase transition heat resistance zones with different states of aggregation shall be determined separately. Electro-thermal model contains of the four thermal resistances, two heat capacity and single voltage source. Internal thermal resistance of solids can be considered as a constant parameter. <b>For</b> bodies of <b>liquid</b> and phase change material internal thermal resistance depends on their thermal state. Therefore, these values should be determined in the calculation processes of their heating or cooling...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the analysis and}} occurrence of organic residues in Iron Age II pottery sherds excavated {{at the site of}} Jneneh. Gas chromatography – mass spectrometry was used for separation and identification of organic constituents. Conventional solvent extraction and alkaline hydrolysis (saponification) were used for the extraction of residues preserved in their fabrics. Three sherds among six unwashed and unhandled sherds showed significant preservation of organic constituents derived from natural materials. The results provide data on the occurrence of beeswax that could have been intentionally added on the internal surface of a collared-rim jar <b>for</b> storing <b>liquid</b> <b>substances</b> or dry goods. Unintentional occurrence of beeswax as a result of storing honey including beeswax fragments of the honeycomb is also possible. In addition, biomarkers of plant oil were detected in a medium jug and a small jar that might have been used for daily needs, such as food preparation. The absence of significant organic constituents in the other three vessels could be attributed to the degradation overtime during burial...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of fuel properties on the spray characteristics of a common-rail type marine diesel injector. Spray characteristics are highly influential in determining engine performance and emission characteristics in direct-injection engine systems containing marine diesel engines. Thus, the relationship between the physical properties of HFO fuel and its spray characteristics is investigated via an analysis of HFO and spray experiments. Data from physical property measurements (e. g., fuel density, dynamic viscosity, and surface tension) are used to derive empirical equations between fuel temperatures and physical properties, and the results follow the common tendencies of temperature-property curves <b>for</b> general <b>liquid</b> <b>substances.</b> In spray experiments, injection quantity measurements, injection rate profiles, and spray visualization were conducted under various injection pressures, energizing durations, and ambient pressures. The test temperatures of HFO were set from the results of physical property measurements. Experimental data reveal that spray characteristics are affected by fuel properties in terms of injection delays, injection profiles, and spray development speed. The injection quantity increased proportionally with fuel densities and the onset of injection was delayed with increased dynamic viscosity. Spray tip penetration decreased with increased fuel temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{focuses on}} the {{detailed}} characterization of ventilation controlled fires of industrial products {{that are likely to}} govern accidental fire scenarios in fire resistant enclosures. Results regarding under-ventilated fires Of Substances that are not polymers are presented to illustrate the capability of the fire propagation apparatus (FPA) to qualify such types of fires. Based on results from heptane fire tests in both well- and under-ventilated fire conditions, a set of recommendations was previously provided in order to check the validity of the experimental results. The application of these recommendations is illustrated <b>for</b> the selected <b>liquid</b> <b>substances</b> containing hetero-atoms. It emerges that the fire propagation apparatus assesses quite easily the performance of well-controlled fires in both well- and under-ventilated conditions. Another major outcome of our work is that the potential of the FPA has the capability to address fire issues outside the conventional use of the equipment, in particular to qualify the burning behaviour of chemicals on the full spectrum of ventilation conditions...|$|R

[...] Some notable examples of Dark Faced Burnished Ware were found at Tell Judaidah (and nearby Tell Dhahab) in Amuq by Robert Braidwood {{as well as at}} Ras Shamra and Tell Boueid. Other finds have been made at Yumuktepe in Mersin, Turkey where comparative studies were made defining different categories of ware that have been generally grouped as DFBW. It is thought to have come as a development of White Ware and takes its name from the often dark coloured choice of clays from which it is made. Vessels are often coarse, tempered with grit or sand, burnished to a shiny finish and made with a variety of clays in different areas. The grit or sand is thought to have made the vessels easier to fire and the burnishing made them less permeable and suitable <b>for</b> heated <b>liquid</b> <b>substances.</b> Later examples are usually finer and more carefully burnished and decorated. Designs included rounded, inverted or straight sided bowls with plain rims, some with basic handles under the rims along with ring bases in the later pieces. Decorations included incised or impressed chevrons or motifs with pattern burnishing appearing in later periods. Other types of pottery were produced around the same time including coarse impressed ware, dark faced unburnished ware and washed impressed ware but these were less prevalent.|$|R

40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} a cuvette {{for use in}} infrared spectroscopy.

Frequently, molecular vibrations in <b>liquid</b> <b>substances</b> are linked to such a high absorption that no investigations on the non-thinned substance are possible using the cuvettes with the smallest gap width available on the market. Since added solvents affect the measuring result, the investigation of non-thinned substances is desirable. The cuvette according to the invention can be manufactured with a small gap width of up to 0. 2 m, thus obviating the need for adding solvents. The cuvette has an inlet and an outlet window made of high-impedance silicon. A layer of silicon dioxide acts as a spacer between the windows. This layer contains a recess acting as a sample volume.
