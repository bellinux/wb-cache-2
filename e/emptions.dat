5000|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, George Kennan {{traveled}} to Russia {{and wrote a}} series of reports on the revolutionaries who had opposed Tsar Alexander II and been sent to prisons in Siberia. Seeing him as a writer sympathetic to the autocratic regime and hostile towards its opponents, the Russian government granted Kennan relative freedom to travel around the country. During his travels, however, the author changed his mind and wrote accounts that were highly critical of the regime. His reports included detailed illustrations of the suffering of those who suffered on account of their opposition to the government. In one article, Kennan told the story of how when the decision to assassinate the Tsar was made, 47 individuals volunteered to carry out the mission. Arguing that individuals fighting for civil liberties were rarely as fanatical as the Russian revolutionaries, Kennan wrote that he believed that it was the treatment of prisoners that led to such stringent opposition to the government. He noted that [...] "playing upon the deepest and most intense of human <b>emptions</b> as a means of extorting information from unwilling witnesses" [...] was routine in prisons holding political offenders. For example, a young woman was led to incriminate her loved ones by being told that they had already confessed. Sometimes, a revolutionary would be told {{that he was going to}} meet his mother, taken to her, and then stopped and later informed that he would only see her if he answered questions about his past activities. A twenty-two-year-old mother was falsely led to believe that if she did not cooperate with the authorities her infant could be taken from her. The author also reported that it was common practice for prisoners to be left is solitary confinement for years while government officials searched the empire for evidence with which the offenders could be charged. Kennan came to see himself as a voice for the Russian liberals and was subsequently banned from the country. His writings on Russia were eventually published in a two-volume book. A representative of the Russian government replied to Kennan's arguments in The Century in 1893 and the magazine subsequently published a rebuttal by the author.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that for {{preemptive}} scheduling on uniform machines there exist polynomial time exact algorithms,whereas for non- preemptive scheduling there are probably no such algorithms. However, {{it is not clear how}} many preemptions (in total,or per job) suffice in order to guarantee an optimal polynomial time algorithm. In this paper we investigate exactly this hardness gap, formalized as two variants of the classic preemptive scheduling problem. In generalized multiprocessor scheduling (GMS),we have job-wise or total bound on the number of pre- <b>emptions</b> throughout a feasible schedule. We need to find a schedule that satisfies the preemption constraints, such that the maxim m job completion time is minimized. In minimum preemptions scheduling (MPS), the only feasible schedules are preemptive schedules with smallest possible make span. The goal is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the overall number of preemptions. Both problems are NP-hard, even for two machines and zero preemptions. For GMS, we develop polynomial time approximation schemes distinguishing between the cases where the number of machines is fixed or given as part of the input. For MPS, we derive matching lower and upper bounds on the number of preemptions required by any optimal schedule...|$|E

40|$|In {{the period}} {{researched}} {{in this article}} (1947 – 1990) the principles of awarding academic degrees were far from stable (or uniform). What is more, difference between individual degrees were of multiple character. In the initial years shortly after the Polish People’s Republic was formed, a lower academic degree was award ed to every higher school graduate. From 1951 on this term referred to degrees awarded to science candidates, and as of 1958 to a degree of a doctor. Secondly, the requirements needed to be satisﬁed {{in order to qualify}} for individual degrees differed and were changing. Thirdly, on and off there were instances where ex <b>emptions</b> were made from the generally binding principles governing awarding of academic degrees, {{especially in the case of}} a science candidate and a doctor. Those exemptions, or exceptional treatment, was justiﬁed by a reference to an exceptional case. Fourthly, lower academic degrees could not always be obtained in every discipline, and the list of the discipline that qualiﬁed candidates for a degree was neither closed nor stable. Fifthly, the rights granted to scientiﬁc councils of institutions of higher education, and later to scientiﬁc councils of units operating within the Polish Academy of Sciences as well, were also changing, mostly to meet the conditions and requirements which those unites were obliged to fulﬁl. Sixthly, depending on the role and position of other bodies or organs involved in the process (the minister competent for schools of higher education, the Main Council of Higher Education, or the Central Qualiﬁcations Committee) their say and role was also changing. For the sake of a certain simpliﬁcation, it may be stated that solutions adopted as a result of the reforms of 1947 and 1951 were comparable, while those implemented in subsequent years, particularly by acts on higher education of 1958, 1982 and 1985 and the act of 1965 on academic degrees and scientiﬁc titles as later amended, differed considerably from earlier solutions. The assessment, from a legal point of view, of the conditions of awarding lower academic degrees in the period researched would, however, have been incom- plete if the organisation of doctoral studies as well as the manner of their delivery leading to the preparation and submission of a doctoral dissertation by a degree candidate, had been examined as well.

Under the UK’s 1989 Guidelines issued by the Investor Protection Committees (IPCs) of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Fund Managers (NAPF), the IPCs will advise their members not to object to non pre-emptive issues which add no more than 5pct to historic non-diluted balance sheet equity in the period from AGM to AGM, and no more than 7.5pct in total over a period of 3 financial years. The pre-emption limits are calculated on the assumption of 100pct probability of conversion, using the figure of undiluted historic balance sheet share capital (where there is assumed a 0pct probability of conversion).

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to investigate the}} effects of the symbiotic association of plants with vesicular - arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the intensity of intraspecific competition and its consequences on population structure I performed four main glasshouse experiments using a non - cultivated species, Rhodanthe chlorocephala ssp rosea, or a cultivated species, Trifolium subterraneum. I grew the plants at different plant densities, under different levels of resources (phosphorus and / or light), in environments with homogeneous and / or patchy distribution of phosphorus (P). In pots with homogeneous distribution of P, the addition of P to R. chlorocephala and mycorrhizal infection in T. subterraneum increased plant biomass of single plants. However, these beneficial effects were reduced by increasing plant density. Shading of plants of T. subterraneum did not generally alter these effects. Mycorrhizal symbiosis and the addition of P always increased the intensity of plant intraspecific competition. In trays with patchy or homogeneous distribution of P, mycorrhizal infection and patchy distribution of P increased the total biomass and size inequality of populations of plants of T. subterraneum. Individual biomass was determined by the local soil P concentration in patchy environments and by mycorrhizal infection in low density treatments. Mycorrhizal infection, but not patchy P distribution, increased relative competition intensity. Asymmetric or symmetric distribution of resources between plants will change these size hierarchies. The distinction between these two types of distributions has lead to two different models explaining the interaction between competition and size inequality (degree to which the biomass is concentrated within {{a small fraction of the}} population &# 40 Weiner and Thomas 1986)) the resource depletion and resource pre - <b>emption</b> models (Weiner and Thomas 1986, Weiner 1988 b). In the first model (resource depletion) competition reduces the relative growth rate of all the individuals by the same proportion, reduces variance of growth rates and reduces variation in sizes. Thus, in this model resource acquisition is proportional to plant size (Weiner 1990). This model is also called symmetric or two - sided competition and applies when competition for nutrients predominates. It predicts that at high density, plants will be smaller but the population will have less inequality than at low density (Weiner and Thomas 1986). In the second model (resource pre - <b>emption),</b> competition increases the variation in relative growth rates and increases variation in sizes. Large plants obtain a more than proportional share of the resources (relative to sizes) (Weiner 1990) and this increases their competitive ability which results in a positive feedback on plant size. This phenomenon is also called snowball cumulation, asymmetric or one - sided competition and it was observed only when competition for light was predominant (Wilson 1988 a). This second model predicts that at high density plant populations will have more inequality than at low density (Weiner and Thomas 1986). Although these two models are generally accepted, alternative analyses and recent experiments show that the degree of asymmetry of the interaction depends on the spatial and temporal distribution of the resource, the spatial distribution of the individuals in the population, neighbourhood competition and the mobility of the resource (Huston 1986; Miller and Weiner 1989, Weiner 1990, Bonan 1991). Weiner (1990) suggested that if nutrients are distributed homogeneously and the uptake is proportional to root size, the competitive interaction will be more symmetric, whereas if patches with more nutrients can be reached by large individuals, asymmetric competition will predominate. This hypothesis has not been tested yet. Turner and Rabinowitz (1983) found that populations with an initial random spatial distribution of individuals had an unexpected increase in size inequality. My results emphasise that the main effects of mycorrhizas at the individual level cannot be expected to be apparent at the population level, because of the influence of density - dependent processes. However, infected individuals with a strong response to the symbiosis would have an advantage in situations of competition. This scenario can explain the maintenance of the symbiotic ability even under conditions such as dense populations, where there is no obvious advantage of the symbiosis at the population level.

40|$|The {{redistribution}} of contaminated tephra by hillslope, fluvial, and pedologic processes is a poorly-constrained but {{important aspect of}} evaluating the radiological dose from an unlikely volcanic eruption at Yucca Mountain (YM). To better evaluate this hazard, we developed a spatially distributed, numerical model of tephra redistribution that integrates contaminated tephra from hill slopes and active channels, mixes it with clean sediment in the channel system, distributes it on the fan, and migrates it into the soil column. The model is coupled with an atmospheric dispersion model that predicts the deposition of radioactive waste-contaminated tephra at specified grid points. The redistribution model begins in the upper Fortymile Wash drainage basin where it integrates the tephra deposited on steep slopes and active channel beds within a GIS framework. The Fortymile Wash drainage basin {{is the focus of}} this model because tephra from only this basin reaches the Fortymile Wash alluvial fan by fluvial processes, and it is on this fan where the radiological dose to a hypothetical individual is compared to the regulatory standard (via additional biosphere models). The dilution effect of flood scour, mixing, and re-deposition within the upper basin is modeled using a dilution-mixing model widely used in the contaminant-transport literature. The accuracy of this model is established by comparing the model prediction with tephra concentrations measured in channels draining the Lathrop Wells volcanic center. The model combines the contaminated tephra transported from the upper basin with the tephra deposited directly on the fan as primary fallout. On the Fortymile Wash fan, channels and interchannel-divide areas are divided on the basis of soil-geomorphic mapping according to whether they are Holocene or Pleistocene in age. This approach allows the model to incorporate the effects of channel migration on the fan within the past 10, 000 yr. The model treats the {{redistribution of}} radionuclides within the soil profile as a diffusion process in a stratified medium, a well-established model in the soil-physics literature. Samples were collected and analyzed from the fan to develop 137 Cs profiles to determine rates of radionuclide migration in soils. Diffusivity values inferred from this analysis are lower on fan surfaces of greater age, most likely as a result of decreased permeability and infiltration rates on older surfaces. The model predicts surface and depth-averaged radionuclide concentrations through time on channels and interchannel divides of the Fortymile Wash fan. We report on model results for a range of possible <b>emption</b> magnitudes, wind speeds, and wind directions...|$|R
