Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. <b>Detection</b> <b>methods</b> had already been developed, making it easy to track.

5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric <b>detection</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|E

40|$|A phase break <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> is {{proposed}} and successfully {{tested for the}} CANVAS analysis software for frequency standards. Phase breaks are detected above the noise floor by classifying a very large phase step as a phase break. This <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> succeeds in numerically quantifying a large visual jump in the phase plot without using input parameters other than the phase data. These phase breaks are automatically identified by the software, and then are removed from the data. To implement this solution, {{it is assumed that}} the frequency standard is well behaved. The most extreme phase steps (1 % of the total data) are assumed to contain all phase breaks and other misbehaving data points, and this small subset of 1 % is neglected during the <b>detection</b> <b>method’s</b> preliminary analysis.
