2500|$|The {{spread of}} {{low-cost}} Internet access {{in developing countries}} has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. [...] Websites, such as DonorsChoose and GlobalGiving, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy {{is the use of}} peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes. Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{propensity}} for very low default rates {{seems to be}} an incentive for investors interested in payday lenders. [...] In the Advance America 10-k SEC filing from December 2011 they note that their agreement with investors, [...] "limits the average of actual charge-offs incurred during each fiscal month to a maximum of 4.50% of the average amount of adjusted transaction receivables outstanding {{at the end of each}} fiscal month during the prior twelve consecutive months". [...] They go on to note that for 2011 their average monthly receivables were $287.1 million and their average charge-off was $9.3 million, or 3.2%. In comparison with traditional lenders, payday firms also save on costs by not engaging in traditional forms of underwriting, relying on their easy rollover terms and the small size of each <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> as method of diversification eliminating the need for verifying each borrowers ability to repay. It is perhaps due to this that payday lenders rarely exhibit any real effort to verify that the borrower will be able to pay the principal on their payday in addition to their other debt obligations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract I {{offer an}} {{explanation}} for the coexistence of joint-liability and individual-liability microcredit contracts. I show that both contracts maximize welfare when credit is rationed due to limited liability, but for different borrowers. Borrowers monitor each other when liability is joint, while the lender monitors <b>individual</b> <b>loans.</b> Joint liability offers poorer borrowers larger loans with less monitoring effort than would have to be exerted by the lender. Individual liability offers the wealthier among credit-constrained borrowers larger loans even without monitoring. The theory explains why <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> serve the wealthier among poor borrowers and are larger, and why businesses funded with <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> grow more.

Some focus on the relative advantages of <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> versus group loans {{in the context of}} moral hazard.

This suggests that securitization activity lead to laxer credit standards. Macroeconomic factors also play a large role explaining the impact of securitization activity on bank lending standards: banks more active in the securitization markets loosened more aggressively their lending standards in the run up to the recent financial crisis but also tightened more strongly during the crisis period.

40|$|AbstractGroup micro-lending {{has been}} used {{successfully}} {{in some parts of}} the world to expand the reach of microcredit programs. However, our study shows that microfinance institutions in Kenya prefer individual lending which is associated with higher default rates compared to group lending. The study also shows that high interest rates increase the odds of client delinquency while loan size is inversely related to delinquency. Given these findings, policymakers need to work for stability in the macro-environment to ensure interest rates charged by microfinance institutions (MFIs) remain stable and affordable. Alternatively, MFIs can develop a graduated scale for charging interest rates in which credit is extended to groups at first to hedge the firm against repayment risk; following this, the firm identifies individuals within the groups whose credit risk has improved and issue progressive <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> to them.
