25|$|Severe {{streetcar}} congestion on {{streets in}} downtown Boston created {{the need for}} subways and <b>elevated</b> <b>rail.</b> These grade-separated railways would add transportation capacity, and avoid delays caused by intersections with cross streets and growing congestion in mixed street traffic.

25|$|Monorail means {{a system}} of guided transit {{vehicles}} operating on or suspended from a single rail, beam, or tube. Usually they operate in trains. Monorails are distinguished from other types of <b>elevated</b> <b>rail</b> system by their use of only a single beam, and from light rail and tram systems by the fact they are always grade separated from other vehicles and pedestrians.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "rapid transit", [...] "underground", [...] "subway", [...] "elevated railway", [...] "metro" [...] or [...] "metropolitan railway" [...] {{system is}} an {{electric}} passenger railway {{in an urban}} area with a high capacity and frequency, and grade separation from other traffic.

25|$|Streetcar {{congestion}} {{in downtown}} Boston {{led to the}} subways in 1897 and <b>elevated</b> <b>rail</b> in 1901. The Tremont Street Subway was the first rapid transit tunnel in the United States. Grade-separation added capacity and avoided delays caused by cross streets. The first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston were built three years before the first underground line of the New York City Subway, but 34 {{years after the first}} London Underground lines, and long after the first elevated railway in New York City, its Ninth Avenue El started operations on July 1, 1868 in Manhattan as an elevated cable car line.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2003, Maxis {{released}} an expansion pack for SimCity 4 dubbed Rush Hour.

Additional features with the expansion also included {{the ability to control}} vehicles, take on missions that can unlock reward buildings much faster, affect their rating with the city and sometimes acquire a cash bonus, and introduced the ability to change between four architectural styles - three of these focus on architectural styles of American cities of differing eras, while the fourth introduces a new range of contemporary European-inspired architecture.|$|E
25|$|It is {{primarily}} {{the likelihood of}} a severe earthquake on the Hayward or San Andreas faults that has spurred a substantial effort to retrofit and sometimes replace large structures at risk, particularly the eastern and western spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco and Oakland city halls, and numerous <b>elevated</b> <b>rail,</b> road, and pedestrian structures and overpasses. Much work remains {{to be done in the}} region and progress is being hampered by budget constraints imposed by trickle down federal-state-regional deficits, design and construction delays due to state and local political bickering over design, and unexpectedly high steel and cement costs due to the extensive construction work being done in China. Nonetheless, Bay area cities and counties have long expected a major earthquake and as a result all building in the past 30 years has been required to adhere to strict guidelines regarding earthquake resistance. Of all the earthquake prone regions of the world, the San Francisco Bay Area is among the most prepared structurally for the eventuality of a major quake while remaining grossly unprepared in both civil response planning and in the retrofitting of older buildings.|$|E

25|$|On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company {{gained control}} of the Staten Island Railway and its boats. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B) {{obtained}} control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company's operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by the B in 1885 through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, President of the B, leased the Railway Ferry Company to the B for 99 years. The B could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Rather than having passengers transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)'s ferries from the Jersey City Terminal to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan, which was not close to any <b>elevated</b> <b>rail</b> stations in the area, the B could now operate to the Whitehall Street terminal, {{where there was a}} direct transfer to an elevated station. Garrett resigned from his position at the B in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island transit operations. Wiman lost {{a lot of money in}} the Panic of 1893, and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts.|$|E

50|$|Another event {{occurred}} on 14 March 1985, when heavy rains caused flooding, {{resulting in the}} evacuation of many homes.Heavy flooding again affected the town on 8 April 2014, when light rains and abruptly mild temperatures resulted in the rapid melting of a large volume of snow {{in a short period}} of time. The <b>elevated</b> <b>railbed</b> passing east-west through the town forms an artificial berm, impeding the flow of meltwater runoff from north to south. With only a couple of culverts to let the runoff go under the railbed, they were quickly overwhelmed and many basements north of the tracks were flooded.|$|R
50|$|This led to {{the first}} {{elevated}} railways in the late 19th century. The <b>elevated</b> <b>rails,</b> being grade-separated, prevented almost all pedestrian/vehicle accidents, and could allow track bends above existing structures. Their construction could still be disruptive, but was usually less so, as pier construction to support their elevated structures did not necessarily close an entire roadway or long stretches of roadway for an extended period. However, conversion from at grade railways to elevated (or below ground) did not always take place, and many lines continued to be at grade in urban areas well into the 20th century.|$|R
