After the letter went, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> but I couldn't; and then I took the chances too. I don't believe he could have ever got forward in politics; he's too honest--or he isn't dishonest in the right way. But that doesn't let me out. I don't defend myself! I did wrong; I behaved badly. But I've suffered for it.|$|E
6000|$|If {{there had}} been any sympathy between mother and child, Neelie might have owned the truth. She might have said frankly: [...] "I am looking ill, because my life is miserable to me. I am fond of Mr. Armadale, and Mr. Armadale was once fond of me. We had one little disagreement, only one, in which I was to blame. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so at the time, and I have {{wanted to tell him}} so ever since; and Miss Gwilt stands between us and {{prevents}} me. She has made us like strangers; she has altered him, and taken him away from me. He doesn't look at me as he did; he doesn't speak to me as he did; he is never alone with me as he used to be; I can't say the words to him that I long to say; and I can't write to him, for it would look as if I wanted to get him back. It is all over between me and Mr. Armadale; and it is that woman's fault. There is ill-blood between Miss Gwilt and me the whole day long; and say what I may, and do what I may, she always gets the better of me, and always puts me in the wrong. Everything I saw at Thorpe Ambrose pleased me, everything I did at Thorpe Ambrose made me happy, before she came. Nothing pleases me, and nothing makes me happy now!" [...] If Neelie had ever been accustomed to ask her mother's advice and to trust herself to her mother's love, she might have said such words as these. As it was, the tears came into her eyes, and she hung her head in silence.|$|E

60|$|I {{should have}} been very glad {{to hear from you}} {{yesterday}} if only for the sweet opportunity it gives me of crying out that I told you so! It gives me more than this--and I didn't tell you so; but I wanted to awfully--and I only smothered my wisdom under my waistcoat. Tell Arthur Benson that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so too--that guileless morning at Victoria: I knew so well, both then and at Delamere Terrace, with my half century of experience, straight into what a purgatory you were all running. The high Swiss mountain inn, the crowd, the cold, the heat, the rain, the Germans, the scramble, the impossible rooms and the still more impossible everything else--the hope deferred, the money misspent, the weather accurst: these things I saw written on your azure brows even while I perfidiously prattled with your prattle. The only thing was to let you do it--for one can no more come between a lady and her Swiss hotel than between a gentleman and his wife. Meanwhile I sit here looking out at my nice, domestic, inexpensive English rain, in my nice bad stuffy insular inn, and thanking God that I am not as Gosses and Bensons are. I am pretty bad, I recognise--but I am not so bad as you. I am so bad that I am fleeing in a day or two--as I hope you will have been doing if your ineluctable fate doesn't spare you. I stopped on my way down here to spend three days with W. E. Norris, which were rendered charming by the urbanity of my host and the peerless beauty of Torquay, with which I fell quite in love. Here I go out for long walks on wet moors with the silent Stephen, the almost speechless Leslie. In the morning I improve the alas not shining hours, in a little black sitting-room which looks out into the strange area--like unto that of the London milkman--with which this ci-devant castle is encompassed and which sends up strange scullery odours into my nose. I am very sorry to hear of any friends of yours suffering by the Saturday Review, but I know nothing whatever of the cataclysm. It's a journal which (in spite of the lustre you add to it) I haven't so much as seen for 15 years, and no echoes of its fortunes ever reach me.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the night}} descended, since Al-Husain's head {{was cut off}} by Yazid's army, Zaynab took it on herself to protect {{the women and children}}. She {{gathered}} all the women and children into one small space in between the gutted tents. Ali Zaynul-Abidin lay on the ground surrounded by the widows and orphans. Eventually, there was no fire and no light, except for that of the moon. However, Zaynab noticed that Sakinah was missing. She asked Rubab, but even she did not know where Sukainah was, so they panicked, and ran out of the tents looking for her. Eventually, in desperation, Zaynab went to the place where the body of Al-Husain lay, and cried, [...] "O my brother, Sayyedah Sakinah, who you left in my care, is nowhere to be found. Where shall I look for her in this wilderness?" [...] Just then, the moon came out from behind a cloud and Zaynab saw Sakinah lying on her father's body, sleeping on his chest as she always used to. She shook the child awake and said, [...] "Oh, Sayyedah Sakinah! How did you recognize your father? A person can be recognized by their face or the clothes they wear. Your father is beheaded and his clothes are covered with red scars of blood." [...] Sukainah replied innocently, [...] "I wanted to tell my father about what the people had done to me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how Shimr had robbed the earrings that my father had so lovingly given me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how he had ripped them from my ears leaving my earlobes torn and bleeding. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how the beast had mercilessly slapped me when I cried in pain. When I was running aimlessly in the desert I thought I heard my father's voice telling me he was here, [...] "Ilaiya Ilaiya Sakinah." [...] I followed the voice and I found him lying here. I told him everything and then I felt like sleeping on his chest the way I always did, for the last time. So I kept my head on his chest and slept till you came." ...|$|E
