5000|$|Earthships use water {{four times}} {{before it is}} discarded. There are cisterns at roof level to collect rain water or snow melt. The cistern for a given Earthship is sized to the local climate. From the cistern the water is fed into a water-organizing module with a pump and {{filtering}} device. The water is pumped into a pressurized tank to meet the building code of required water pressure. This water is used for bathing, drinking, and activities like washing dishes. The water from these activities that is discarded is known as [...] "gray water" [...] and {{is used in the}} flushing of the toilets. [...] "Gray water" [...] is not sanitary for drinking but used for other uses in the Earthship. The gray water passes through a <b>grease</b> <b>filter</b> and then into an interior botanical cell. A botanical cell is an indoor garden with growing vegetation. Oxygenation, transpiration, filtration, and bacteria cleansing all take place in the closed cell which cleans and filters the water. After the botanical cell the process of filtering the [...] "gray water" [...] is complete and the water is used to flush the toilets. The state the water is in after being used in the toilet is known as [...] "black water". [...] "Black water" [...] is not reused inside the Earthship but is transferred to a solar-enhanced septic tank with leach fields and used for watering of exterior botanical cells (landscape plantings).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{treatment}} of <b>grease</b> <b>filter</b> washwater by chemical coagulation and sedimentation using different dosages of aluminum sulfate was investigated. Pollutant removal efficiency {{was measured in}} terms of total solids, pH and optical density. The process was found to be effective at the room temperature and the filter washwater pH (9. 5). The optimum aluminum sulfate dosage was 2 g/L. The treatment reduced the total solids of the wastewater by 89. 6 %, and produced a supernatant with a pH of 4. 15 and an optical density of 0. 194 nm. A fully automated prototype was then constructed for the {{treatment of}} <b>grease</b> <b>filter</b> washwater. Three distinct layers were formed in the system (fat, liquid and sludge) and each was removed separately. The system successfully recovered over 80 % recyclable water with a quality comparable to that of tap water. The combined mixture of sludge and fat (20 %) contained high levels of heavy metals and was not suitable for bioconversion into value added product. However, dewatering the sludge using vacuum filtration reduced its volume to 0. 8 % of the original volume of washwater. As a result, about 99. 2 % of the washwater (treated water) is recycled in the washing operation...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} this work is the {{ventilation}} system of commercial kitchens. This type of ventilation differs a lot from any other because of grease problem: Grease accumulated in the ducts. It leads to numer-ous serious risks which are discussed in this thesis. In this work {{you can also find}} information about grease construction and its sources. The main idea of the thesis is finding out the better solution of grease problem in commercial kitchens. There are two ways of solving grease problem in pro-kitchens: <b>grease</b> <b>filter</b> installation and duct cleaning. Different types of grease filters are compared during this work. The better efficiency among baffle filter, cyclonic filter and Turbo Swing filter is found out. The Turbo Swing filter operational work principle and the gap influence on the efficiency of Turbo Swing filter are studied in the MUAS (Mikkelin University of Applied Sciences) laboratory. The results and analyses of these measurements are presented in this thesis. The ways of duct cleaning are also compared in this work. The information about frequency of pro...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{identify}} the best grease removal technique with the application of low power of UV light to TiO 2 coated <b>grease</b> <b>filters.</b> The treatment with various power series of ozone generating and ozone free lamps to normal <b>grease</b> <b>filters</b> and TiO 2 coated <b>grease</b> <b>filters</b> were examined and the obtained results are compared {{to each other in}} this paper. The effect of ozone reaction was observed and compared with the effect of TiO 2. The experiments were solely based on the photo oxidation and photo catalytic oxidation reactions. TiO 2 is a green catalyst used in the photocatalytic reaction. Sunflower oil was used for grease production and tetracholoroethylene as a solvent. Grease samples were collected from the ventilation duct connected to the cooking hood system. Sample extraction was done in ultrasonic bath with the principle of sonication. The sample analysis was done by FTIR machine. The result determining the concentration of grease was the quantification of saturated C-H bonds in the chosen peak group of the spectrum. A very low power of UVC light functions perfectly with the Titanium dioxide. The experimental results have shown the combined treatment of titanium dioxide and UV light is an effective method in grease removal process. The photocatalytic reaction with titanium dioxide is better than photo oxidation reaction with ozone treatment. Photocatalytic reaction is environmentally friendly, energy efficient and economical...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} and outlines {{a method}} for implementing a program to improve mileage by following a relation ” Better mileage = Better maintenance + Good driving habits”. This method was studied theoretically by observing the past scenario in a renowned company. A Methodology was developed keeping mileage factor in mind. The Methodology consists of maintenance practices like <b>Greasing,</b> <b>filters,</b> oil changing etc. Then the methodology was incorporated in the company’s training program. The results obtained through this method were compared with the past results and it was proved that by implementing this method the mileage can be improved. The company has a fleet of above 450 vehicles and operates in 174 different routes. We conducted a test by selecting five different routes that the company operates between and analyzed the results which showed an improvement in mileage. This also resulted in improved performance of the vehicles {{and a reduction in}} the maintenance costs, there by resulting in profits to the company...|$|R
40|$|Commercial kitchens {{are subject}} to high heat loads, vapour, fumes, odours and various aerosols, which are {{generated}} during cooking processes. Studies have shown, that long term exposure to cooking emissions creates adverse health effects for kitchen workers. To {{be able to control}} kitchen environment, improve thermal conditions and remove harmful cooking emissions, exhaust hoods are utilised. Inside an exhaust hood, separation of grease and condensate takes place in order to reduce ventilation maintenance costs and ensure that fire safety and hygienic requirements are met. A number of <b>grease</b> <b>filtering</b> techniques exist, however, the majority of hoods utilise single stage <b>filtering</b> using <b>grease</b> separators. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine pressure drop and grease extraction efficiency characteristics of exhaust hoods produced by a Lithuanian manufacturer. In this study, pressure drop characteristics of exhaust hoods with condensing plates and two different types of grease separators are determined. Pressure drop characteristics are essential for selection process of an exhaust fan. What is more, these characteristics are also used for determining exhaust hood air flow rate, so that ventilation engineers are able to adjust it to a required air flow rate. A comparative study of 3 different types of grease separators are carried out in order to identify the most efficient type of separators by determining and comparing their fractional separation efficiencies. For this analysis, a special experimental stand is designed and utilized for testing. This study will allow to determine the most efficient type of grease extractors...|$|R
50|$|Constructed {{subsurface}} flow wetlands are meant as secondary treatment systems {{which means that}} the effluent needs to first pass a primary treatment which effectively removes solids. Such a primary treatment can consist of sand and grit removal, <b>grease</b> trap, compost <b>filter,</b> septic tank, Imhoff tank, anaerobic baffled reactor or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification. Most important is the biological filtration through a biofilm of aerobic or facultative bacteria. Coarse sand in the filter bed provides a surfaces for microbial growth and supports the adsorption and filtration processes. For those microorganisms the oxygen supply needs to be sufficient.|$|R
40|$|Coarse stage Nuclepore filters used in GENT aerosol {{sampling}} {{units were}} {{coated with a}} thin film of Apiezon L-type grease in order to minimise the loss of particles on the filters due to 'bounce off'. Originally Freon {{was used as the}} solvent to dissolve the Apiezon grease in the coating process. Because of the environmental impact, Freon was discontinued and replaced with Fluorinert. Apiezon grease did not dissolve freely in the Fluorinert and it was replaced by Fomblin grease in 1995. This increased production costs and coated Nuclepore coarse filters ceased production in 2004. Users were concerned that their stocks of coated Nuclepore filters were diminishing and as no alternative supply was available the feasibility of coating the coarse filters in house needed to be investigated. This report describes experiments conducted at ANSTO and the results obtained during the investigation of the coating process under laboratory conditions. Apiezon grease and Toluene were used in this process. Experiments were based on the procedure proposed by Prof P. Hopke and Dr A. Markwitz [1] with modification to this technique to increase the uniformity of the grease layer across the filter surface and to achieve approximately 100 µg of Apiezon <b>grease</b> per <b>filter...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the results}} of a {{large-scale}} investigation on agricultural machinery are reported. Such research has been based on some activities of monitoring and predictive aintenance carried out in twenty farms of Central Italy. In particular, the casual failures have been experimentally analyzed, during soil tillage operations, while the engine lubrication and tractor engine vibrations have been monitored. About the latter monitoring activities, the research motivation has consisted in the attempt to identify possible positive correlation between increases in the engine vibration and decrements in the tribological oil indices. According to this plan, a notebook has been compiled for each tractor, with the aim of keeping records of the tractor using hours, the quantities of diesel fuel and lubricant employed, in a given time, as well as of <b>grease</b> and <b>filters.</b> In such notebooks, the failures and the interventions have been enumerated and catalogued accordingly to their typologies, excluding those concerning the programmed maintenance operations on oil, filters, and belts. Visual, operational and instrumental controls have been recorded and elaborated in electronic form, in such a way to make failures and consumption charts available. This has been helpful to evaluate the productivity of the machine, since the costs sustained for each tractor and its idle time could be easily monitored...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} two major purposes: (1) to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} introduction of energy labels on the consumers’ purchase decision when buying an extractor hood and (2) to identify which other criteria have an impact on this decision. The research is conducted with particular reference to Miele & Cie. KG with the aim of adjusting its product management in accordance with consumers’ demands. During the last years the European Union has revised the energy labels for domestic appliances which had been introduced in 1992 and has established additional labels concerning a wider range of goods. Since 01 January 2015 this energy label is also mandatory for extractor hoods. Thus Miele & Cie. KG - as a manufacturer of hoods - is highly interested in doing research on the development of consumers’ preferences regarding the purchase of an extractor hood. In a first step the thesis provides an overview of its purpose and background before establishing the basis for the research in a second step. This includes basic principles of market research as well as the characteristics of the market for hoods and the concept of energy labels. In the following the thesis describes the product area of hoods and the implementation of the regulations concerning the energy label at Miele & Cie KG. A detailed central section explains the research which has been conducted {{in the context of this}} thesis. The empirical part of this study draws on a research carried out in Germany in November and December 2014. Data for this research were collected among twenty consumers and six dealers selling household appliances from Miele. The author of the thesis conducted face-to-face interviews on the basis of an interview guide which was developed beforehand. Finally the results of these interviews are presented, compared and summarized to enable the development of a recommended course of action for the product management of hoods at Miele & Cie. KG. The results of the research reveal that the most important purchase criteria regarding an extractor hood are an attractive visual appearance of the hood, the performance of the fan, the quality of the active charcoal and <b>grease</b> <b>filters,</b> the acoustic power level, a satisfactory lighting and a simple cleaning of the appliance. This study indicates that the energy label is of secondary importance regarding the purchase decision of a hood. The average energy consumption of a hood is relatively low in comparison to other household appliances. Therefore the energy saving potential for consumers is limited in this area. As a consequence the performance of a hood is a lot more important to consumers than its energy efficiency expressed by the label. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that the necessary modifications in the product development by virtue of the establishment of energy labels for hoods are quite small. Taken as a whole, the objectives of the product development of hoods at Miele & Cie. KG correspond to the consumers’ demands...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new artificial turf surrogate surface (ATSS) sampler for use in the measurement of mercury (Hg) dry deposition. In contrast to many existing surrogate surface designs, the ATSS utilizes a three-dimensional deposition surface that may more closely mimic the physical structure of many natural surfaces than traditional flat surrogate surface designs (water, <b>filter,</b> <b>greased</b> Mylar film). The ATSS has been designed to overcome several complicating factors that can impact the integrity of samples with other direct measurement approaches by providing a passive system which can be deployed for both short and extended periods of time (days to weeks), and is not contaminated by precipitation and/or invalidated by strong winds. Performance characteristics including collocated precision, in-field procedural and laboratory blanks were evaluated. The results of these performance evaluations included a mean collocated precision of 9 %, low blanks (0. 8 ng), high extraction efficiency (97 %– 103 %), and a quantitative matrix spike recovery (100 %) ...|$|R
