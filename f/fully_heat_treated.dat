40|$|Conventional {{quenched}} and tempered steels {{have long}} been used to fabricate mechanical components, such as plates, shafts, and axles. All of these components are mainly fabricated employing medium carbon hot forged steels in the {{quenched and tempered}} condition. In the last decade, thermomechanical forging at intermediate (warm) temperatures of microalloyed medium carbon steels is increasingly adopted to reduce or eliminate quenching and tempering heat treatments in hot forged components. However, {{the use of these}} steels is still limited, being difficult to achieve a toughness comparable to that of <b>fully</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> ones. In an effort to improve toughness, an experimental campaign was performed to assess strength and toughness properties of three selected microalloyed medium carbon steels after thermomechanical forging simulations at warm temperatures, performed on a thermal and mechanical Gleeble 3800 ® apparatus. Microstructures and mechanical properties of these steels are shown to be highly dependent upon steel composition and thermomechanical schedule. The experimental results suggest that thermomechanical schedules can be designed to produce microalloyed medium carbon steels with refined microstructures, and therefore to realize improved strength and machinability; yet, toughness is still the most critical property as compared to that of quenched and tempered steel...|$|E

Cyclic burner rig hot corrosion (900 C) and oxidation (1050 C) tests indicated that Ni-Al-Cb coatings provided better overall resistance than Ni-Al-Cr coatings.

40|$|The 9 Cr- 1 Mo-V (P 91) {{steel is}} a high {{strength}} alloy that normally transforms completely to martensite during air cooling. This means that {{issues related to the}} handling of weldments during welding operations, and between the completion of welding and post weld heat treatments are important concerns. Measurements of specimen dilations during controlled thermal cycles were used to follow the martensite transformation in a P 91 base metal and a weld deposit. For identical thermal cycles, the base metal transformed completely to martensite after normalizing, but the weld deposit did not. The effect of this difference in transformation behavior was that austenite was retained in the weld deposit after tempering. The retained austenite transformed to martensite upon cooling from the tempering temperature, resulting in small amounts of untempered martensite in <b>fully</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> weld deposit. An analysis of microsegregation by computational thermodynamics suggested that partitioning of alloying elements increased the range between the martensite transformation start and finish temperatures in the weld deposit, increasing the likelihood of retained austenite in it.

40|$|To produce useful strengthening, {{precipitation}} hardenable {{aluminium alloys}} rely on rapid quenching from the {{solution heat treatment}} temperature to suppress the fort-nation of coarse equilibrium second phases. An unavoidable consequence of the rapid quenching of thick sections is the severe thermal gradients that quickly develop in the material. The attendant inhomogeneous plastic flow can then result {{in the establishment of}} residual stresses. The surface and through thickness residual stress magnitudes present in heat treated high strength aluminium alloy components are frequently reported to exceed the uniaxial yield stress of small specimens of the same alloy measured immediately after quenching. In thick section plate and forgings it is proposed that these high residual stress magnitudes are a consequence of hardening precipitation that occurs during quenching which allows for a greater elastic stress to be supported. To investigate this theory, thick sections of the quench sensitive alloy 7175 and the less quench sensitive alloy 7010 were heat treated {{in such a way as}} to allow the internal hardness to be measured immediately, after quenching. The rate of cooling was also monitored during quenching and these data were used in conjunction with time temperature property data to predict the degree of precipitation and subsequent loss of hardening potential in the <b>fully</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> condition.

The supplied rivet stems were heat treated for four hours at temperatures from 520 °C to 560 °C, in increments of 10 °C.

It is recommended that samples be tested for impact toughness to better understand the shear behavior of the rivet stem due to the break notch.
