5000|$|Whitworth's {{main point}} was to {{advocate}} decimalization in place of fractions based on successive halving; but in mentioning thousandths, he was also broaching {{the idea of a}} finer division than had been used previously. Up until this era, workers such as millwrights, boilermakers, and machinists measured only in traditional fractions of an inch, divided via successive halving, usually only as far as 64ths (1, , , , , , [...] ). Each 64th is about 15 thou. Communication about sizes smaller than a 64th of an inch was subjective and hampered by a degree of ineffability—while phrases such as [...] "scant 64th" [...] or [...] "heavy 64th" [...] were used, their communicative ability was limited by subjectivity. Dimensions and geometry could be controlled to high accuracy, but this was done by comparative methods: comparison against templates or other gauges, feeling the degree of drag of calipers, or simply repeatably cutting, relying on the positioning consistency of jigs, fixtures, and machine slides. Such work could only be done in craft fashion: on-site, by feel, rather than at a <b>distance</b> <b>working</b> from drawings and written notes. Although measurement was certainly a part of the daily routine, the highest-precision aspects of the work were achieved by feel or by gauge, not by measuring (as in determining counts of units). This in turn limited the kinds of process designs that could work, because they limited the degree of separation of concerns that could occur.|$|E

30|$|For {{electron}} beam optimization across a large writing field, we first followed the standard process {{to adjust the}} beam at a high magnification of[*]×[*] 50, 000. Then, we exposed, with exponentially increasing line doses of 30 to 500 nC/cm for nitrocellulose, the test pattern containing five identical designs at the writing field center and four corners, respectively. Here, a large writing field of 1  mm[*]×[*] 1  mm obtained at a low magnification of[*]×[*] 100 was chosen. Afterwards, we examined the exposed pattern at high magnification, which naturally revealed a well-defined structure at the writing field center but poorly defined ones at the corners. This is because, when the center is well focused, the corners are actually greatly defocused because {{the distance from the}} electron objective lens to the corner is longer than to the center. Next, the same procedure was repeated at a new location, but with an increased <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> value (the <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> value was entered manually, without physically raising or lowering the stage). At this increased <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> value, the writing field center will be defocused, but the corners will become less defocused. In principle, the stigmation values can also be finely tuned, but here we focus our effort on optimizing the <b>working</b> <b>distance.</b> After several iterations, similar exposed line widths were observed at the writing field center and corners, which suggests that an optimal <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> was achieved to give a relatively uniform exposed pattern across the entire writing field. To verify the effectiveness of our method, under the optimal exposure parameters, we exposed the high-resolution resist PMMA (100 -nm thickness, coated on silicon that was mounted beside the wafer coated with nitrocellulose) at line dose of 400 to 3, 300 pC/cm. Note that the optimal exposure parameters remain valid as long as the aperture size (that determines the depth of focus as well as beam current) and <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> remain the same (if the sample is at a height level different from the nitrocellulose film, the stage can be raised/lowered to obtain roughly the same <b>working</b> <b>distance).</b> After development using the standard developer MIBK:IPA (1 : 3) for 40  s, the pattern was coated with 10 -nm Cr and examined by SEM.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{development}} of neutral helium microscopes has gained increasing interest. The low energy, charge neutrality, and inertness of the helium atoms makes helium microscopy an attractive candidate for the imaging {{of a range of}} samples. The simplest neutral helium microscope is the so-called pinhole microscope. It consists of a supersonic expansion helium beam collimated by two consecutive apertures (skimmer and pinhole), which together determine the beam spot size and hence the resolution at a given <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> to the sample. Due to the high ionization potential of neutral helium atoms, it is difficult to build efficient helium detectors. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the microscope design to maximize the intensity for a given resolution and <b>working</b> <b>distance.</b> Here we present an optimization model for the helium pinhole microscope system. We show that for a given resolution and <b>working</b> <b>distance,</b> there is a single intensity maximum. Further we show that with present-day state-of-the-art detector technology (ionization efficiency 1 × 10 - 3), a resolution of the order of 600 nm at a <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> of 3 mm is possible. In order to make this quantification, we have assumed a Lambertian reflecting surface and calculated the beam spot size that gives a signal 100 cts/s within a solid angle of 0. 02 π sr, following an existing design. Reducing the <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> to the micron range leads to an improved resolution of around 40 nm...|$|R

40|$|What is e-leadership {{and how can}} it be {{framed in}} a {{distance}} context? How can work motivation be understood as a correlated theme? In prior leadership research and theory it has been taken for granted that leadership occurs in a face-to-face environment, so how to study leadership in a remote context? According to recent research, e-leadership defines this leader-member relation in this new arena, and a central focus of this research has been on communication. Communication is a central theme in the remote setting because it is the only interaction arena which allows leadership to be seen and understood. By conducting a case study in a multi media organization with <b>distance</b> <b>working</b> journalists as focus group this essay aims to bring a deeper understanding of how e-leadership works and how it effects work motivation. The field of media organizations is interesting to study as distance work is not an unusual working environment for journalists, and research has indicated that work motivation needs for these highly specified creative workers are somewhat differentiated from other, for example industrial workers, which implies that motivation theories urges an update. The data was collected by individual interviews which later were transcribed and categorized into emerging themes. The themes were then analyzed through the theoretical framework. The results from this case study implies that the <b>distance</b> <b>working</b> context includes several challenges and more responsibilities in a comparative to a physical environment where there are other service units. For example the social aspects of having meaningful social relationships to coworkers and leaders is a challenge in a context where there are few, if any physical meetings. The time pressure in the daily work makes the communication mostly work based, and there is little time over for small talk. The distance work environment also includes more responsibilities in terms of watering the flowers at the office, filling up the printer with paper and other responsibilities not strictly attached to the work assignments, but still a part of them...|$|E
