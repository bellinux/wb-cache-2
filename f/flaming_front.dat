Many solid materials can sustain a smouldering reaction, including coal, cellulose, wood, cotton, tobacco, cannabis, peat, plant litter, humus, synthetic foams, charring polymers including polyurethane foam and some types of dust.

5000|$|The {{energy release}} {{component}} (ERC) {{is a number}} related to the available energy (BTU) per unit area (square foot) within the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> {{at the head of}} a fire. Daily variations in ERC are due to changes in moisture content of the various fuels present, both live and dead. Since this number represents the potential [...] "heat release" [...] per unit area in the flaming zone, it can provide guidance to several important fire activities. It may also be considered a composite fuel moisture value as it reflects the contribution that all live and dead fuels have to potential fire intensity. The ERC is a cumulative or [...] "build-up" [...] type of index. As live fuels cure and dead fuels dry, the ERC values get higher, thus providing a good reflection of drought conditions. The scale is open-ended or unlimited and, as with other NFDRS components, is relative.

30|$|When a fire {{burned through}} a {{transect}} as predicted, {{the methods used}} in this study appear to estimate ROS without bias. An inevitable difficulty is accounting for factors such as wind that affect fire behavior in experimental fires (Gould et al. 2007) (Figure 1). During some of these prescribed fires, we observed <b>flaming</b> <b>fronts</b> advancing periodically through the vegetation in narrow strips. These leading strips usually occurred at focal points along the ignition line where fire was applied directly to the shrub canopy. Installing transects at predetermined focal points may increase the likelihood of collecting accurate one-dimensional ROS measurements.|$|R

30|$|Implementation of {{the methods}} {{used in this study}} is {{relatively}} easy and can be completed {{on the day of the}} burn. Conversely, it is extremely difficult to predict with certainty where the fire will spread and, therefore, precisely where to place the explosive devices or steel stakes. For more than half of the transects installed, the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> did not traverse the transects as predicted even though ignitions were specifically applied to produce headfires. While the explosive devices aided in recording ROS when the direct view of the transect was obstructed, tall vegetation or smoke can interfere with observations. Furthermore, the variability in heat required to detonate the explosive devices is unknown and this may add to the variability in ROS estimations. The limitations with these methods are similar to those reviewed in Simard et al. (1982); however, the triangle method, recording the time required for a fire to traverse an equilateral triangle (Simard et al. 1982, Moore et al. 1995), solves the problem of having to predict the precise direction of the <b>flaming</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E
30|$|For HREC 3, {{view was}} {{obscured}} by {{a bench in}} the slope contour, but the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> appeared to progress upslope through the transect. A flanking fire burned through HREC 4 and therefore ROS was not recorded. Both transects in HREC 5 were burned by headfire conditions. However, fire behavior was influenced by wind blowing across the slope and may have increased ROS. For HREC 6, the first transect was successful at recording upslope ROS; all other transects within this plot were burned by flanking fire.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} the plume are {{substantially}} ameliorated by wind because {{the flow of the}} plume is inclined and dilution is enhanced (Figure 1). The plume model assumes a constant heat release from a line-source <b>flaming</b> <b>front.</b> Clearly, this is an idealization with fire rate of spread and intensity, and canopy exposures, varying across a burning landscape as fuels, winds, and topography change. We use the plume model only to illustrate that substantial xylem cavitation is possible within a range of surface fire intensities typical of management fires (Johnson 1992).|$|E
40|$|Remotely sensed estimations of {{regional}} and global emissions from biomass combustion {{have been used}} to characterize fire behavior, determine fire intensity, and estimate burn area.

As part of the Brazil/United States Fire Initiative, an aircraft campaign was initiated in 1992 and continued in 1994. This multi-aircraft campaign was designed to assist in the characterization of fire activity, document fire intensity and determine area burned over prescribed, agricultural and wildland fires in the savanna and forests of central Brazil. Using a unique, multispectral scanner (AIRDAS), designed specifically for fire characterization, a variety of fires and burned areas were flown with a high spatial and high thermal resolution scanner. The system was used to measure flame front size, rate of spread, ratio of smoldering to <b>flaming</b> <b>fronts</b> and fire intensity. In addition, long transects were flown to determine the size of burned areas within the cerrado and transitional ecosystems. The authors anticipate that the fire activity and burned area estimates reported here will lead to enhanced information for precise regional trace gas prediction...|$|R

Measurements {{on the side of}} trees facing oncoming fires show that integrated heat flux at the stem surface (kJ m− 2) correlates with fireline intensity (kW m− 1) and, in turn, tissue necrosis depth (Bova and Dickinson 2005). Conduction, determined by the thermal diffusivity of bark and underlying wood, is the dominant heat transfer mode in stem heating during fires, and bark thickness is a key determinant of the temperatures reached at the cambium in response to fire exposure (e.g., Spalt and Reifsnyder 1962, Martin 1963 a, and Vines 1968).|$|E
30|$|Fuel {{consumption}} decreased {{along the}} successional gradient from young to older woodlands. Phases 1 and 2 {{had the highest}} herbaceous fuel load, which more likely resulted in a continuous <b>flaming</b> <b>front,</b> as {{was reflected in the}} greater shrub biomass consumption. Thus, when DWD was consumed, it occurred in those phases. Phase 3 was known for a lack of fuel continuity, making it difficult to burn (Blackburn and Tueller 1970, Pieper and Wittie 1990, Miller and Tausch 2001). Fire treatments are therefore often not recommended for Phase 3 (Bates et al. 2000, Miller et al. 2005) because it requires more extreme fire conditions that are conducive to a crown fire (Huffman et al. 2009), which is generally not desired.|$|E

Measurements of fire behavior (ROS and flame length) from chaparral prescribed fires in northern California were much higher than predictions using the current fuel models. Discrepancies in estimates are due to both the difficulties in estimating fire behavior and inadequacy of the models to predict the dynamic nature of fire in live fuels.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Wildland fire can {{drastically}} alter {{both the}} physical and biological characteristics of the forest. For remote sensing applications, it is desirable to know the emissivity, reflectance and temperature of the forest floor {{both before and after}} passage of the fire front in order to correctly interpret images obtained from airborne and orbital assets.. We have measured the surface temperature and infrared emissivity of the forest floor as a function of time after the passage of the <b>flaming</b> fire <b>front.</b> Many measurements of surface temperatures during a fire have been made to study the ecological effects of a fire (Beadle (1940), Daubenmire (1968), Molina (2001)) but none have concentrated on the physical/optical properties of the burn area specifically for remote sensing applications. The primary goal of this project is to determine, for different forest ecosystem types, the length of time the burn scar will remain visible to mid and long-wave infrared sensors. Since the...|$|R
60|$|The knights {{distributed}} among the guns worked them incessantly, directing their fire chiefly against the outside ships, {{so as to}} hinder the crews in their endeavours to arrest {{the progress of the}} flames; but they were soon able to fire impartially into the mass. As the heat of the flames drove the pirates back, scores of men leapt overboard, and made for the shore. Presently, two or three ships were seen making their way along the narrow line of water {{on either side of the}} <b>flaming</b> group in <b>front.</b> As the first advanced, the galley and one of the prizes rowed a short distance forward to meet it. Its deck was crowded with men, among whom a discharge of the cannon from both ships created terrible slaughter.|$|R
30|$|These {{findings}} add to {{the growing}} body of understanding fire and disease interactions. Sudden oak death affects individual trees in a patchy spatial and temporal pattern (Meentenmeyer 2009). This matrix of dead, infected, and living trees complicates simplistic models for canopy spread. On the other hand, the presence of standing dead trees with attached dead leaves provides a somewhat stable source of torching trees, thereby affecting other nearby tanoaks and other intermingled species in these ecologically important forests (Metz et al. 2013). In addition, single tree torches can also substantially affect surface fire rate of spread via lofting dead branches and foliage to cause long-distance spotting beyond the <b>flaming</b> <b>front,</b> as was observed in several 2008 northern California fires in which dead tanoaks were present (Valachovic et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|Prescribed fire {{decreased}} shrub biomass {{by about}} 90 % in Phase 1 and Phase 2 woodlands; however, {{the reduction of}} shrub biomass in Phase 3 was variable. This variability was unexpected. Big sagebrush is particularly sensitive to fire and experiences stand replacement when consumed (Wambolt and Payne 1986, Bunting et al. 1987). Sagebrush biomass {{is expected to increase}} given time, but the recruitment process is slow and it may take 35 to 100  years to fully recover to pre-fire conditions (Pieper and Wittie 1990, Wambolt et al. 2001). The prescribed fire treatment was designed for 100 % of the plots to be blackened; thus, a surviving shrub component indicates an incomplete prescribed fire. This is most likely due to the limited availability of fine fuels to support the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> in a Phase 3 woodland.|$|E
30|$|Prescribed fire is {{a common}} method used to produce desired {{ecological}} effects in chaparral by mimicking the natural role of fire. Since prescribed fires are usually conducted in moderate fuel and weather conditions, models that accurately predict fire behavior and effects under these scenarios are important for management. In this study, explosive audio devices and steel stakes were used to record {{the location of the}} <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> during seven prescribed fires in mature, chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) dominated chaparral in northern California. Intervals between detonations measured the time required for five fires to transverse a fixed distance and were used to estimate the rate of spread (ROS) during headfire burning conditions. In two other fires, a stopwatch was used to measure the time required to travel successive 5 m distances and ROS was calculated. Burns were completed during moderate weather conditions: average temperature 17 °C, average relative humidity 42 %, and wind light and variable, generally from the west ranging from 0 km h− 1 to 8 km h− 1. Average percent moisture was 92.1 % for chamise live one-hour fuels, and 8.8 % for chamise dead one-hour fuels. Live fuel height averaged 1.2 m. Overall average ROS was 0.36 m s− 1 (range 0.22 m s− 1 to 0.56 m s− 1) for areas where the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> advanced upslope. Measurements of ROS were indeterminable for many of the points along the line transects due to lack of visibility from smoke and from fire not traversing the terrain as predicted. For comparison, BehavePlus fire modeling was performed using five different shrub fuel models (NFFL 4, SH 5, SH 7, SCAL 15, SCAL 17); all models underestimated ROS and flame length with NFFL model 4 producing values most similar to that recorded during the prescribed fires. Users of the recently developed fuel models may benefit from field studies to verify model adequacy and fire behavior predictions.|$|E
30|$|The {{prescribed}} burns {{ranged from}} 200 ha to 630 ha in area and were ignited between mid-October and early November following early fall precipitation events (Table 1). The burns {{were part of}} a restoration program designed to incrementally reintroduce fire as an ecosystem process in the historically low to mixed severity fire regimes that dominate the landscapes (Taylor 2000). Thus, these were first-entry burns conducted under cool conditions with the intent of reducing surface fuel loads while limiting overstory mortality of old growth (in preparation for subsequent burning). The Energy Release Component, an index related to potential energy or heat release in a <b>flaming</b> fire <b>front</b> (Bradshaw et al. 1983), ranged from 15 th to 50 th percentile on the days the aspen sites burned (Table 1). Fire behavior consisted predominantly of creeping, low intensity (flame length < 30 cm) surface fires through surface fuels (torching was rare and limited to individual trees). Stand level fire severity mapped from satellite imagery (one year post-fire) was classified as “unchanged/low” for pixels in each grove, indicating little or no conifer overstory mortality at 30 m mapping resolution (Eidenshink et al. 2007). Surface fuel consumption varied greatly at finer spatial scales depending on the presence and amounts of coarse woody debris, which supported higher flame lengths and longer residence times.|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} finding {{from this}} study is that oblique photographs of fire behaviour taken from the air could be effectively used for estimating spread rates. Other photographic records are currently being examined for their potential in fire behaviour analyses, and much work could be done to improve the interpretation process. For managers also contemplating the use of such photographs for research purposes, we have noted that near-nadir views produce the greatest positional accuracy, but side profiles of the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> (flames visible underneath the smoke column) are superior for identifying fire type and fire behaviour details. Photos should be from a wide angle perspective so that landscape features are visible as much as possible. Higher resolution will permit zooming in to identify landscape features, vegetation, and fire behaviour details. Finally, ensuring proper time settings on digital cameras will help reduce confusion in spread rate calculations.|$|E
30|$|Fire {{intensity}} is typically characterized by measures of fire temperature {{and rate of}} spread (RoS; Keeley 2009). In all five burn units, we measured maximum temperature reached at the soil surface using 10 sets of copper tags painted with 24 temperature sensitive paints (OmegaLaq, Stamford, Connecticut, USA), ranging from 79 ° C to 760 ° C, in increments of approximately 28 ° C. We placed tags in 10 randomly chosen quadrats within each burn. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, half of these quadrats experienced a head fire and half experienced a backing fire (n = 5 per burn). At these two sites, we measured RoS by timing {{the spread of the}} <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> over a 1 m distance at two to four different locations within each burn treatment (head fire, backing fire). Additionally, we visually estimated flame lengths at the same points at which RoS measurements were taken to help characterize the fire intensity. We collected these observational data solely for the purpose of characterizing the burns and therefore did not subject them to statistical analysis.|$|E
30|$|The {{most likely}} {{explanation}} for these inconsistencies {{is that we}} did not account for fuel moisture nor measure wind during burns at a scale useful for these spatial analyses. Fuel moisture and wind changes during burns likely introduced additional layers of spatial variation onto the patterns of pre-burn fuel loads. For example, Robichaud and Miller (1999) found that fuel consumption in a Douglas fir/lodgepole pine forest varied according to both pre-burn duff thickness and duff moisture content. Fuel moisture and relative humidity differences may explain why the central section of Plot 6 burned at lower temperatures despite having high loading of 1 – 1000 hour fuels and standing biomass. This section was located in a moist erosion gully that had a larger hardwood component and was more shaded {{than the rest of the}} plot. While measuring fuel moisture across small spatial scales could be easily incorporated into future studies, the costs of developing a technique to measure wind speed and direction (at the time of <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> passage) at more than 100 spatially referenced points over a landscape scale would be prohibitive.|$|E
40|$|We {{quantified}} fire behavior, fuel consumption, and forest-floor {{responses to}} understory fires prescribed {{to cover a}} wide range and variable combination of fuel loadings, fuel moisture levels, and weather conditions in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests. At each of three locations, five burns were conducted under each of four different prescriptions (n =  60). Fuel loads ranged from 75 – 102  Mg/ha on an open site of low productivity to 125 – 177  Mg/ha on more productive sites. Total fuel consumption ranged from 15 % in early spring burns to 92 % in early fall burns. Organic horizons (litter and duff) composed 62 – 84 % of the total fuel load. Consumption of the organic horizons ranged from 11 to 94 %. Lower duff (Oa horizon) moisture content was 135 % in the former and 15 % in the latter. Consumption of the organic horizon was significantly correlated with lower duff moisture content (r 2  =  0. 51). More than 72 % of all fuel was consumed after the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> had passed over an area. Postburn mineral soil exposure was strongly influenced by fuel consumption, season of burn, and characteristics of the site. In the late spring burns at one site, bare ground exposure was 3 % before fire, 60 % two months after fire, and 8 % thirteen months after fire. There were slight to nonexistent increases in bare ground exposure from burns prescribed during early spring or late autumn (i. e., burns of low to moderate consumption) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{wildland}} fire management, reliable fire intelligence {{is needed to}} direct suppression resources, maintain firefighter safety, predict fire behavior, mitigate fire effects in the environment, and justify and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} fuel management. Fire intelligence needs to be synoptic, quantitative, consistent, and timely. Airborne remote sensing with specialized infrared radiometers is now providing an unprecedented level of information on fire behavior and effects. The temperature, radiant intensity, carbon and sensible heat fluxes, and fuel consumption associated with the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> of a {{wildland fire}} have been estimated by remotely measuring its radiance at short- and mid-wave infrared wavelengths. Measurements of upwelling long-wave or thermal-infrared radiation provide estimates primarily of ground-surface temperatures, even beneath flaming fronts, that reflect a local time course of energy release and fuel consumption. Characteristics of flames and hot ground can be discriminated from radiances measured at wavelengths near 1. 6, 3. 9, and 11. 9 mm. Fire radiance at 3. 9 mm appears to be a good estimator of radiant-flux density, which integrates across wavelengths. There are strong temperature gradients along and within flaming fronts, and although their temperatures are high—commonly exceeding 10001 C along the line of a savanna fire, for instance—flames may not be bright when compared with a blackbody radiator. The combination of that low bulk emissivity and uncertainty as to the composition and radiance of nonfire background within the sensor’s instantaneous field of view dictates that fire properties are best estimated from measurements of high spatial resolution in comparison with the scale of a fire front. The USDA Forest Service is now applying a FireMappert thermal-imaging radiometer for fire research and support of inciden...|$|E
30|$|Fire {{seasonality}} {{is defined}} as a combination of the date a fire starts and its duration. Fire return interval is the length of time between fires at a specific point on the landscape and can be expressed as a mean, median, minimum, or maximum. Other measures related to fire return interval include fire rotation, which is the time necessary for fire to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem (Heinselman 1978), and fire frequency, which is the inverse of fire return interval. Fire size is the area burned by the fire, and spatial complexity {{is defined as}} the variability in the patchiness and gradient structure of the burned area. Fireline intensity is the rate of energy release per unit of fire <b>flaming</b> <b>front.</b> Although other measures of fire intensity, such as reaction intensity, might be better related to fire effects, fireline intensity can be visualized through its relationship with flame length (Byram 1959) and the burning index, an estimate of potential flame length and fireline intensity (Deeming et al. 1977). Fireline intensity is also the measure of fire magnitude that is most commonly understood and used by fire behavior analysts. Fire severity is defined as the magnitude of the effect that a fire has on the environment (van Wagtendonk 2006). It is commonly measured using remote sensing indexes, but other methods such as field surveys of fire effects are also used (Key 2006, Key and Benson 2004). Fire type describes the vegetation and fuel layers through which a fire propagates and includes ground fires, surface fires, and crown fires. Van Wagner (1977) defined three phases of crown fires: passive crown fires torch individual trees or groups of trees, active crown fires spread through the crowns in conjunction with a surface fire, and independent crown fires spread far ahead of or {{in the absence of a}} surface fire.|$|E
30|$|Duff {{can either}} {{insulate}} or heat the soil, {{depending on whether}} it is consumed. Bradstock and Auld (1995) found that soil heating was more related to fuel consumption than fireline intensity in low consumption bushfires (≤ 2 kg m− 2), explaining why soil heating resulting from rapidly spreading, low consumption surface fires has generally proven to be inconsequential (e.g., Viegas et al. 2000). Palmer (1957), and later Hawkes (1993), report measurements that indicate that a critical minimum duff layer depth exists, below which heat loss exceeds heat generated by combustion, implying that for a layer with thickness less than the minimum depth, no sustained combustion will occur and, consequently, the duff is primarily a soil insulator. Valette et al. (1994) report that when the ground surface is exposed to low- to moderate-intensity heating (< 100 kW m− 2), unconsumed duff layers reduce maximum soil temperatures {{by as much as}} an order of magnitude. Van Wagner (1972) related duff consumption to downward radiation from the flame front, which implies that, in systems with intense fires and thin duff, duff consumption during the flaming phase may contribute to soil heating. Including root heating in tree mortality models would likely be most important where there was long-term duff consumption or where patchy accumulations of woody fuel result in long-term soil surface heating (see Stephan et al. 2010). In systems with deep duff, smoldering independent of the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> will be the key cause of soil heating (Miyanishi and Johnson 2002). Relatively little is known about duff as an energy source for soil heating, so boundary conditions will have to be obtained from future experiment and modeling that incorporate the effects of duff depth and moisture.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{small number}} of fires escape initial attack {{suppression}} efforts and become large, but their effects are significant and disproportionate. In 1983, of 200, 000 wildland fires in the United States, only 4, 000 exceeded 100 acres. However, these escaped fires accounted for roughly 95 percent of wildfire-related costs and damages (Pyne, 1984). Thus, future research efforts logically {{will focus on the}} difficult and complicated task of modeling large fires. Large fires often demonstrate higher fireline intensities, different modes of propagation and different distribution patterns through time than do steady-state fires. It is essential, although difficult, to simulate, model, and predict large fire management considerations. In the future, wildland fire modeling efforts are likely to focus on the concepts and peculiarities that large fires present in terms of behavior, suppression and control attributes. This paper reviews the problems that large fires pose to fire analysts. CONSIDERATIONS FOR MODELING LARGE FIRES No known computer model is currently available that can reliably simulate the behavior of large fires. The reasons are several: 1. Heterogeneous conditions of weather, fuel, and topography are encountered during a large fire because of the lengthy burning times and the large size that the fire finally attains. Hence, every model's inherent assumptions of fuel and weather continuity and uniformity are violated by large fires. 2. Large fires spread by means other than a <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> through surface fuels. Crowning and spotting are different modes of propagation that often occur during a conflagration. 3. Fire-related phenomena [...] such as firewhirls, horizontal roll vortices, and convection columns [...] not common during small fires, often are present during large fires. Those phenomena magnify the spread and heat output rates and make the suppression efforts more difficult...|$|E
40|$|First order {{fire effects}} in mixed grass and tallgrass prairies 				may differ between current and {{historic}} fire regimes. To 				determine potential differences, the thermal dynamics of nine 				prescribed grassland fires and six experimental fires were 				evaluated. Fires were instrumented with dataloggers and arrays {{of up to}} 				twelve thermocouples set at heights ranging from - 5 cm to 300 				cm. Soil moisture and texture were documented, along with fuel 				characteristics. A series of experimental fires allowed soil 				moisture to be manipulated while minimizing other variables. Maximum temperature for the prescribed fires was 875 °C at 75 cm, 				and for the experimental fires 920 °C at 10 cm. In experimental 				fires, the greatest temperature difference was at the surface 				with the dry substrate averaging 130 °C higher than saturated. 				Average temperatures at - 1 cm differed by 33 °C. At 60 °C, 				residence times in dry substrate averaged almost four minutes, 				while the average for saturated treatment was only 1 second. 				Surface residence times on dry substrate averaged over 7 				minutes, almost 3 times longer than saturated. Soil moisture was shown to influence relative humidity and fine 				fuel moisture near the ground surface. An increased evaporation 				of soil water at the surface is suggested by a slight drop in 				subsurface temperatures as the <b>flaming</b> <b>front</b> moves over the 				surface. These data suggest that soil moisture affects fire 				intensity, decreasing temperatures {{at all levels of}} a fire. Temperatures and residence times were compared with data from 				studies documenting temperatures significantly affecting seed 				germination and edaphic effects at and below the surface. 				Temperatures increasing the germination of some seeds were found 				at all heights. Temperatures documented can be expected to 				decrease organic matter content and aggregate stability at the 				surface, slightly increasing erodibility. Thermal dynamics from the fires in this study represent a broad 				range of grassland fires under conditions common for prescribed 				fire. Soil moisture appears to significantly affect temperatures 				and residence times below, at, and above the soil surface. Data were compared with output from FOFEM 5. 2 to access the 				applicability of FOFEM for use in mixed grass and tallgrass 				prairie.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Root {{disease and}} {{wildfire}} are important disturbance agents in western North American forests. It {{has been speculated}} that root disease increases potential fire behavior, since root disease kills trees and contributes to available fuels. However, little quantitative evidence of this effect on wildfire has been offered. This research quantifies the effect of Armillaria root disease on potential wildfire behavior in a managed ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest near Glenwood, Washington. Armillaria, like other conifer root diseases, creates slowly expanding centers of tree mortality. Forest structure and composition {{data were collected from}} paired plots within and outside of mortality centers. Differences in forest structure and composition variables were identified using pairwise t-tests with alpha = 0. 05. Plant community composition was largely the same between plot types, with slightly more grasses in the diseased plots. There were several differences in stand structure: diseased plots had lower basal area and density in the overstory and midstory canopy, diseased sites had more snags in the older age classes, and diseased plots had higher 100 and 1000 hr fuels. Two fuelbeds were created based on these differences and fire behavior was modeled using the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS). FCCS calculates standard fire behavior metrics as well as fire behavior potentials calculated on a unit-less 0 - 9 scale which reflects the ability of a fuelbed to support a given fire behavior. Overstory canopy cover was significantly reduced in plots with Armillaria. There was no difference in abundance of ladder fuels. This led to a decrease in crown fire potential in the diseased fuelbed. Significantly greater 100 and 1000 hr fuel loadings were detected in the diseased plots but no differences in 1 and 10 hr fuels. There were also differences in forest floor litter. Few differences were detected in the shrub or herb layers. Increased reaction potential for surface fire was predicted for the diseased fuelbed, however rate of spread (ROS) and flame length were reduced. The simultaneous increase in reaction potential and decrease in ROS and flame length in the diseased fuelbed is counterintuitive. Increased 100 and 1000 hr fuels in the diseased fuelbed initially act as a heat sink, absorbing the energy of the <b>flaming</b> <b>front.</b> This study suggests that root disease may decrease wildland fire severity and highlights the need to consider multiple competing effects when assessing the impact of disturbances on wildland fire...|$|E
