60|$|The {{greater number}} of Turner's {{paintings}} of open sea belong to a somewhat earlier period than these drawings; nor, generally speaking, are they of equal value. It appears {{to me that the}} artist had at that time either less knowledge of, or less delight in, the characteristics of deep water than of coast sea, and that, in consequence, he suffered himself to be influenced by some of the qualities of the Dutch sea-painters. In particular, he borrowed from them the habit of casting a dark shadow on the near waves, so as to bring out a stream of light behind; and though he did this in a more legitimate way than they, that is to say, expressing the light by touches on the foam, and indicating the shadow as cast on foamy surface, still the habit has induced much feebleness and conventionality in the pictures of the period. His drawing of the waves was also somewhat petty and divided, small forms covered with white <b>flat</b> <b>spray,</b> a condition which I doubt not the artist has seen on some of the shallow Dutch seas, but which I have never met with myself, and of the rendering of which therefore I cannot speak. Yet even in these, which I think among the poorest works of the painter, the expressions of breeze, motion, and light, are very marvellous; and it is instructive to compare them either with the lifeless works of the Dutch themselves, or with any modern imitations of them, as for instance with the seas of Callcott, where all the light is white and all the shadows gray, where no distinction is made between water and foam, or between real and reflective shadow, and which are generally without evidence of the artists having ever seen the sea.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the spray pattern {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the pattern sprays out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the spray pattern is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of <b>flat</b> <b>spray,</b> tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the spray pattern. <b>Flat</b> <b>spray</b> patterns with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles. This spray pattern is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire sprayed surface. Non-tapered <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform spray pattern without any overlap in spray area.|$|E
50|$|Nozzle {{type and}} capacity: Full cone nozzles {{have the largest}} drop size, {{followed}} by <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles. Hollow cone nozzles produce the smallest drop size. Spraying pressure: Drop size increases with lower spraying pressure and decreases with higher pressure. Flow rate: Flow rate has a direct effect on drop size. An increase in flow rate will increase the pressure drop and decrease the drop size, while a decrease in flow rate will decrease the pressure drop and increase the drop size.|$|E

The transverse distribution of the spray mixture in the target area must be even, where relevant. Spray jets of double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles are angled forward and backward.

Problems arise with lift masts which are fitted very close to the frame of the sprayer. Solutions might be technical modifications of the boom and tube. If technical changes are not possible, the use of <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles on the boom is recommended in the critical area in combination with double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles.

40|$|The size of subcooled liquified {{nitrogen}} droplets {{are measured}} with a 5 mW He-Ne laser {{as a function of}} pressure difference (delta P) across <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> and full cone pressure atomizing nozzles. For delta P's of 3 to 30 psid, the spray sauter mean diameter (SMD) ranged between 250 to 50 microns. The pressure range tested is representative of those expected during cryogenic fluid transfer operations in space. The droplet sizes from the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles were greater than those from the full cone nozzle. A power function of the form, SMD varies as delta P(exp a), describes the spray SMD {{as a function of the}} delta P very well. The values of a were - 0. 36 for the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> and - 0. 87 for the full cone. The reduced dependence of the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> SMD on the delta P was probably because of: (1) the absence of a swirler that generates a turbulence within the nozzle to enhance atomization, and (2) a possible increase in shearing stress resulting from the delayed atomization due to the absence of turbulence. The nitrogen quality, up to 1. 5 percent is based on isenthalpic expansion, did not have a distinct and measurable effect on the spray SMD. Both bimodal and monomodal droplet size population distributions were measured. In the bimodal distribution, the frequency of the first mode was much greater than the frequency of the second mode. Also, the frequency of the second mode was low enough such that a monomodal approximation probably would give reasonable results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the thickness measurement of liquid sheet spray. Two types of liquid sheet spray were measured, i. e. the wall impingement spray and <b>flat</b> <b>spray.</b> The measurement {{was carried out}} by a light absorption method using He-Cd laser and diode laser. Figure 1 shows the experimental apparatus in this study. Moreover, the thickness change of the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> prior to the breakup point was further clarified from the movement of 4 -points of photochromic dye traces by using laser tagging method (See Fig. 2). In other words, the thickness data both from the light absorption method and laser tagging method was compared to clarify the characteristics of the breakup phenomena of liquid sheet. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there were two kinds of thickness change for both sprays. The first one shows the decreasing trend up until the breakup point. Another kind of change was the increasing trends of the thickness after having the decreasing trend. The reason for these phenomena {{can be attributed to the}} ligament formation in the liquid sheet as shown in the Fig. 4. In other words, the increasing trend re{{presents the}} moment when the 4 -points of dye traces accumulated into the ligament, while the decreasing trends indicates the moment when the dye traces were located in between two ligaments. Therefore, the change of liquid sheet thickness between two ligaments can be clarified by the laser tagging method, which is normally difficult to be achieved by using the light absorption method...|$|E

40|$|Oxides of {{nitrogen}} from coal-fired power stations {{are considered to}} be major pollutants, and there is increasing concern for regulating air quality and offsetting the emissions generated from the use of energy. Reburning is an in-furnace, combustion control technology for NOx reduction. Another environmental issue {{that needs to be addressed}} is the rapidly growing feedlot industry in the United States. The production of biomass from one or more animal species is in excess of what can safely be applied to farmland in accordance with nutrient management plans and stockpiled waste poses economic and environmental liabilities. In the present study, the feasibility of using biomass as a reburn fuel in existing coal-fired power plants is considered. It is expected to utilize biomass as a low-cost, substitute fuel and an agent to control emission. The successful development of this technology will create environment-friendly, low cost fuel source for the power industry, provide means for an alternate method of disposal of biomass, and generate a possible revenue source for feedlot operators. In the present study, the effect of coal, cattle manure or feedlot biomass, and blends of biomass with coal on the ability to reduce NOx were investigated in the Texas A&M University 29. 31 kW (100, 000 Btu/h) reburning facility. The facility used a mixture of propane and ammonia to generate the 600 ppm NOx in the primary zone. The reburn fuel was injected using air. The stoichiometry tested were 1. 00 to 1. 20 in the reburn zone. Two types of injectors, circular jet and fan spray injectors, which produce different types of mixing within the reburn zone, were studied to find their effect on NOx emissions reduction.

Three of these techniques were directly carried out and compared in a one-to-one comparison for this study.

This study aimed to evaluate the droplet spectrum, the deposition and uniformity of spray distribution with different spraying systems and traveling speeds of a self-propelled sprayer in two phenological stages of the cotton plant (B 9 and F 13). The experimental design was randomized blocks and treatments were three spraying techniques: common <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> tips; tilted flat jet with air induction, at 120 L ha- 1; and rotary atomizer disk, 20 L ha- 1, combined with four traveling speeds: 12, 15, 18 and 25 km h- 1, with four replications. Spraying deposition was evaluated for both leaf surfaces from the cotton plant apex and base (stage B 9) and middle part of the plant (stage F 13) with a cupric marker. A laser particle analyzer also assessed the droplet spectrum. The centrifugal power spray system produces more homogeneous droplet spectrum and increased penetration of droplets into the canopy in both phenological stages. Variation on the operating conditions necessary for increased traveling speed negatively influences the pattern of spraying deposits...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{atomization}} is {{a largely}} widespread unit operation. The disintegration of a liquid into droplets {{depends on the}} nature of the nozzle, on the process parameters as well as physicochemical characteristics of the fluid. The aim of this work is to study the contribution of the process (liquid outlet speed and air pressure) and physicochemical (viscosity and surface tension) factors on the size distribution of droplets generated by single- and two-fluid <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles. The obtained droplet median diameters which range between 77 and 594 mu m for the single-fluid nozzle and between 11 and 599 mu m for the two-fluid nozzle, are discussed in relation with operating conditions of atomization process. Dimensional analysis was performed as a modeling approach. Despite energy input for the droplet formation is known to be influenced by different origins according to single and two-fluid nozzles, it is shown that a unique correlation, with specific values of parameters for each nozzle type, gathers all the parameters affecting droplet size. In the range of process and formulation parameters tested, this correlation is validated and gives satisfactory agreement for the single- and two-fluid nozzles...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a system of {{homogeneous}} second-order ordinary differential equations (spray) is necessarily isotropic in order to be metrizable by a Finsler function of scalar flag curvature. In Theorem 3. 1 we show that the isotropy condition, together with three other conditions on the Jacobi endomorphism, characterize sprays that are metrizable by Finsler functions of scalar flag curvature. The proof of Theorem 3. 1 provides an algorithm to construct the Finsler function of scalar flag curvature, in the case when a given spray is metrizable. One condition of Theorem 3. 1, regarding the regularity of the sought after Finsler function, can be relaxed. By relaxing this condition, we provide examples of sprays that are metrizable by conic pseudo-Finsler functions as well as degenerate Finsler functions. Hilbert's fourth problem asks to determine the Finsler functions with rectilinear geodesics. A Finsler function that is a solution to Hilbert's fourth problem is necessarily of constant or scalar flag curvature. Therefore, we can use the conditions of [11, Theorem 4. 1] and Theorem 3. 1 to test when the projective deformations of a <b>flat</b> <b>spray,</b> which are isotropic, are metrizable by Finsler functions of constant or scalar flag curvature. We show how to use the algorithms provided by the proofs of [11, Theorem 4. 1] and Theorem 3. 1 to construct solutions to Hilbert's fourth problem. Comment: 15 page...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates binder {{distribution}} in wet granulation {{and focuses on}} the nucleation zone, which is {{the area where the}} liquid binder and powder surface come into contact and form the initial nuclei. An equipment independent parameter, dimensionless spray flux Psi (a), is defined to characterise the most important process parameters in the nucleation process: solution flowrate, powder flux, and binder drop size. Ex-granulator experiments are used to study the relationship between dimensionless spray flux, process variables and the coverage of binder fluid on the powder surface. Lactose monohydrate powder on a variable speed riffler passed under a <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> once only. Water and 7 % HPC solution at two spray pressures were used as binders. Experiments with red dye and image analysis demonstrate that changes in dimensionless spray flux correlate with a measurable difference in powder surface coverage. Nucleation experiments show that spray flux controls {{the size and shape of}} the nuclei size distribution. At low Psi (a), the system operates in the drop controlled regime, where one drop forms one nucleus and the nuclei size distribution is narrow. At higher Psi (a), the powder surface cakes creating a broader size distribution. For controlled nucleation with the narrowest possible size distribution, it is recommended that the dimensionless spray flux be less than 0. 1 to be in the drop-controlled regime.
