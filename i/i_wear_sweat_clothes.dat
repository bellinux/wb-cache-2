Sauna suits are primarily used for temporary weight loss.|$|R

Eight months later in June 1969, she {{was named to the}} Canadian {{national}} team.

40|$|Background: To {{facilitate}} the monitoring {{of drug abuse}} by patients, a method was developed and validated for fast and highly selective screening for amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, morphine, codeine, heroin, 6 -monoacteylmorphine, methadone, 2 -ethylidene- 1, 5 -dimethyl- 3, 3 -diphenylpyrrolidine, nicotine, and cotinine in PharmCheck sweat patches. The analysis of sweat patches would provide a noninvasive alternative matrix to urine or blood samples. Methods: The sweat patches were extracted during vigorous shaking for 10 minutes with 1. 5 mL of 20 mmol/L ammonium formate, pH 7, and methanol (50 %: 50 % vol/vol). The extracts were cleaned up by filtering through Whatman mini-Uniprep syringeless filter vials before injection. The method uses a single injection to detect and confirm all 16 drugs and metabolites within 9. 6 minutes. Results: The validated substances have a linear range of 3. 0 - 300 nanograms per patch, except for nicotine which has a linear range of 30 - 3750 nanograms per patch. Stabilities of all substances in <b>worn</b> <b>sweat</b> patches were validated {{at room temperature for}} 7 days and as a processed sample in the autosampler at 10 degrees C for 5 days. Only heroin was unstable, with high individual variability and reported bias and coefficient of variation of, respectively, - 30. 6 % and 22. 1 % in <b>worn</b> <b>sweat</b> patches at room temperature. The monitoring of ion ratios was added to the validation criteria. This resulted in analytical cutoff concentrations of 3. 0 and 60 nanograms per patch for nicotine with validated qualifier/quantifier ratios. All analytical cutoff concentrations were lower than the cutoff concentrations proposed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Conclusions: The method uses validated cutoff concentrations, qualifier/quantifier ratios, and a simple extraction without extensive sample treatment for the analysis of 16 drugs and metabolites with a runtime of 9. 6 minutes. This method was successfully applied for the analysis of 96 <b>worn</b> <b>sweat</b> patches to monitor patients for drug abuse. The results provided the physician or health-care professional with information about drug abuse and could be used to improve patient care with patient-specific therapy...|$|R
5|$|The two {{duplicate}} {{characters are}} Ippo and Mamoru Takamura. The two characters are weaker than their normal versions and are embodiments {{of parts of}} the original story. The weaker Ippo is {{the first version of}} the character available. He <b>wears</b> <b>sweats</b> and a T-shirt rather than the boxing trunks the other characters wear. This version is based on when Ippo began boxing and was training to fight his rival, Ichiro Miyata. The weaker Takamura has less muscle mass and looks ill.

5000|$|A sauna suit is {{a garment}} made from {{waterproof}} fabric {{designed to make}} the <b>wearer</b> <b>sweat</b> profusely. A sauna suit is sometimes called a [...] "rubber suit" [...] because the early types were made of rubber or rubberized cloth. Now, sauna suits are typically made of PVC or coated nylon cloth. The construction is typically {{in the style of}} a waterproof sweat suit, consisting of a pullover jacket and drawstring pants. The closures at waist, neck, wrists and ankles are all elasticated to help retain body heat and moisture within the garment. In some sauna suits, the jacket also includes a hood to provide additional retention of body heat.|$|R
