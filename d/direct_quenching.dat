Results indicate that a decrease in FRT close to Ar 3 temperature significantly influenced the microstructure following phase transformation, especially at the subsurface (~ 50 - 400 μm) of the rolled strip. On decreasing the FRT, the subsurface microstructure revealed a fine mixture of ferrite and bainite obviously {{as a result of}} strain-induced transformation, whereas the structure at the centreline remained essentially martensitic. Further, Nb-microalloying promoted the formation of ferrite and bainite even at higher FRTs, thus influencing the mechanical properties.

40|$|The basic {{characterization}} of the austenite grain size and shape prior to quenching to martensite was already {{used in the past}} to optimize the mechanical properties and impact toughness of low Carbon martensitic steel. This basic characterization can typically be done by optical microscopy. To better understand the mechanisms that generate the different properties, however, a more detailed analysis is required. An algorithm has been developed to calculate the austenite orientation starting from the martensite orientation measured by EBSD. The method has been applied to explain the different properties of martensite after austenitization and <b>quenching</b> and of <b>direct</b> <b>quenched</b> martensite with different levels of accumulated strain.

40|$|Improved {{crucibles}} consisting {{mainly of}} metal-reinforced ceramic ampules {{have been developed}} for use in experiments in which material specimens are heated in the crucibles to various high temperatures, then quenched by, for example, plunging the crucibles into water at room temperature. In a traditional quench crucible, the gap between the ampule and the metal cartridge impedes the transfer of heat {{to such a degree that}} the quench rate (the rate of cooling of the specimen) can be too low to produce the desired effect in the specimen. One can increase the quench rate by eliminating the metal cartridge to enable <b>direct</b> <b>quenching</b> of the ampule, but then the thermal shock of <b>direct</b> <b>quenching</b> causes cracking of the ampule. In a quench crucible of the present improved type, there is no gap and no metal cartridge in the traditional sense. Instead, there is an overlay of metal in direct contact with the ampule, as shown on the right side of the figure. Because there is no gap between the metal overlay and the ampule, the heat-transfer rate can be much greater than it is in a traditional quench crucible. The metal overlay also reinforces the ampule against cracking...|$|E

A numerical {{analysis of a}} vacuum gas quenched die block made of H 13 was carried out utilising a nonlinear thermoelastic-plastic stress model together with the fluid flow and thermal profiles within the furnace. Simulation procedures for stress behaviour of the die were developed for both direct quench and marquench processes.

Simulation of the cooling rates at the surface and core of the die during marquenching correlated well with the experimental data. Further stress simulation indicated that the final thermal distortion and residual stresses in the die after <b>direct</b> <b>quenching</b> were larger than those due to marquenching. The findings of the numerical analysis suggested that marquenching is recommended for this die because it could reduce the temperature difference in the die and thus result in less thermal distortion and residual stresses...|$|E

On the other hand, the demands for reducing manufacturing costs and energy consumption of the steelmaker are increasing. This has led to development of energy efficient <b>direct</b> <b>quenching</b> (DQ) steelmaking process {{as an alternative to the}} conventional quenched and tempered or thermomechanical rolling and accelerate cooled processes. Ruukki has employed thermomechanical rolling and <b>direct</b> <b>quenching</b> process (TM + DQ) for a novel type of ultra-high-strength strip and plate steels since 2001. Advantages of the ultra-high-strength level (> 900 MPa) can be fully utilized only if fabricated properties are on a sufficient level. Bending is one of the most important workshop processes and a good bendability is essential for a structural steel. Hence, the metallurgy and bendability of Ruukki´s TM + DQ strip steel Optim ® 960 QC have been investigated closely. It was found that by optimizing process parameters and chemical composition, a good combination of strength and ductility can be achieved by a modification of martensitic-bainitic microstructure. Despite of smaller total elongation, the bendability of Optim ® 960 QC is at least on the same level as on conventionally manufactured 960 MPa steels. However, it is important to pay special attention to bending process (tool parameters, springback, bending force, material handling) when bending UHSS. It was also found that the bendability of Optim ® 960 QC can be significantly enhanced by local laser heat treatments or roll forming...|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} a method for treating and recycling the effluent from a supercritical water oxidation reactor and more specifically to a method for treating and recycling the effluent by expanding the effluent without extensive cooling. Supercritical water oxidation is the oxidation of fuel, generally waste material, in {{a body of water}} under conditions above the thermodynamic critical point of water. The current state of the art in supercritical water oxidation plant effluent treatment is to cool the reactor effluent through heat exchangers or <b>direct</b> <b>quench,</b> separate the cooled liquid into a gas/vapor stream and a liquid/solid stream, expand the separated effluent, and perform additional purification on gaseous, liquid, brine and solid effluent. If acid gases are present, corrosion is likely to occur in the coolers. During expansion, part of the condensed water will revaporize. Vaporization can damage the valves due to cavitation and erosion. The present invention expands the effluent stream without condensing the stream. Radionuclides and suspended solids are more efficiently separated in the vapor phase. By preventing condensation, the acids are kept in the much less corrosive gaseous phase thereby limiting the damage to treatment equipment. The present invention also reduces the external energy consumption, by utilizing the expansion step to also cool the effluent...|$|R

The <b>direct</b> <b>quenching</b> of {{low-carbon}} steel {{has been shown}} to be an effective way of producing ultra-high-strength, tough structural steels in the as-quenched state without tempering. However, in the present study, the influence of tempering at 500 °C has been studied in order to evaluate the possibilities of widening the range of strengths that can be produced from a single base composition. The chosen composition was 0. 1 C- 0. 2 Si- 1. 1 Mn- 0. 15 Mo- 0. 03 Ti- 0. 002 B. In order to compare <b>direct</b> <b>quenching</b> with conventional quenching, two pre-quench austenite states were studied: a thermomechanically rolled, non-recrystallized, pancaked austenite grain structure and a recrystallized, equiaxed grain structure. Quenched and quenched-and-tempered microstructures were studied using FESEM and FESEM-EBSD. The as-quenched microstructures of the reheated and quenched and direct quenched specimens were fully martensitic and martensitic-bainitic, respectively. In both cases, tempering made the needle-shaped auto-tempered carbides of the as-quenched materials more spherical. In the case of the direct quenched (DQ) material, tempering led to a notable increase in the size of the grain boundary carbides. Prior austenite grain size and effective grain size after quenching were larger in the case of reheated and quenched material (RQ). Tempering had no effect on effective grain size.

Factors affecting bendability has been widely studied, yet there exists a lack of information concerning a fundamental comprehension of the effect of microstructure on bendability of UHSS. The aim of this work was to study the microstructural factors governing bendability of UHSS. In particularly the effects of surface hardness and homogeneity of surface microstructure, i. e. deviation of hardness, were studied. The materials used in this work were <b>direct</b> <b>quenched</b> 8 - 12 mm thick UHSS microalloyed with niobium and comprising various carbon (C) and manganese (Mn) contents, rolled to different temperatures. In present work microstructural examination was performed by applying FESEM. The effects of finish rolling temperature (FRT), and C and Mn contents on the developing microstructure were studied. Bending tests were carried out for determining minimum bending radius and for comprehending failure in bending. Microhardness measurements were performed in order to comprehend the effects of hardness and homogeneity on bendability, and to relate microstructure with hardness. The microstructures of the materials comprise principally a mixture of lath-like bainite and martensite, and a surface layer of granular bainite and/or ferrite reaching to various depths. It is found that microstructure is highly dependent on FRT, and C and Mn concentrations. The results suggest that strain localization, i. e. development of shear bands, is precursor for damage in bending in case of complex phase UHSS. Shear bands are observed to develop at the depth range of 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm from upper surface at maximum 45 ° shear stress directions. Hence it is suggested that the properties of the upper surface layers govern bendability. It is found that hardness of surface determines bendability due to its relation with several properties, which govern the onset of diffuse necking and strain localization. The soft layer is required to reach to 2. 3 - 4. 4 % relative to the total sheet thickness, and requirements concerning its hardness level are determined by the desired bending radius. The soft layer is achieved by low FRT and by adjusting the carbon and manganese concentrations. Furthermore it is found that a homogenous surface microstructure contributes to increased bendability. In an inhomogeneous microstructure resistance to dislocation movement varies locally. Therefore grains possessing softer orientations and phases possessing lower hardness levels are susceptible to strain localization...|$|R
