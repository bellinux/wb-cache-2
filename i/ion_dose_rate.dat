We demonstrate that the changes in value of transistor parameters (such as threshold voltage, V{sub t}) are essentially the same for exposure to a Ga+ ion beam at 30 and 50 keV under the same exposure conditions. We characterize the effects of FIB exposure on test transistors fabricated in both 0. 5 {micro}m and 0. 225 {micro}m technologies from two different vendors.

The development of different damage components was monitored by comparing a Raman signal which is specific to amorphization in GaAs to ion channeling results which are sensitive to smallvolume crystalline defects, {{as well as to}} amorphous regions.

In this regard, two HNSCC cell lines were irradiated with photons or 72 [*]MeV/n carbon <b>ions</b> at a <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 5, 2, or 10 [*]Gy/min. For both radiosensitive and radioresistant cells, the change in <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> significantly affected cell survival in response to photon exposure.

Irradiations were performed at room temperature in transmission geometry with Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe ions at energies between 100 and 600 keV.

The Los Alamos Nuclear Science Center (LANSCE) neutron facility's " 30 L" beam line is known to generate neutrons that simulate the secondary neutron spectrum of the Earth's atmosphere at high altitude. The neutron spectrum is also similar to that measured onboard spacecraft like the MIR and the International Space Station (ISS). To evaluate the biological damage, we exposed human epithelial cells in vitro to the LANSCE neutron beams at an entrance <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> of 2. 5 cGy/hr or gamma-ray at 1. 7 cGy/hr, and assessed the induction of chromosome aberrations that were identified with mBAND. With this technique, individually painted chromosomal bands on one chromosome allowed the identification of inter-chromosomal aberrations (translocation to unpainted chromosomes) and intra-chromosomal aberrations (inversions and deletions within a single painted chromosome). Compared to our previous results for gamma-rays and 600 MeV/nucleon Fe <b>ions</b> of high <b>dose</b> <b>rate,</b> the neutron data showed a higher frequency of chromosome aberrations. However, {{detailed analysis of the}} inversion type revealed that all of the three radiation types in the study induced a low incidence of simple inversions.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of the multicolor banding in situ hybridization (mBAND) technique {{is its ability to}} identify both inter- (translocation to unpainted chromosomes) and intra- (inversions and deletions within a single painted chromosome) chromosome aberrations simultaneously. To study the detailed rearrangement of low- and high-LET radiation induced chromosome aberrations in human epithelial cells (CH 184 B 5 F 5 /M 10) in vitro, we performed a series of experiments with Cs- 137 gamma rays of both low and high <b>dose</b> <b>rates,</b> neutrons of low <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> and 600 MeV/u Fe <b>ions</b> of high <b>dose</b> <b>rate,</b> with chromosome 3 painted with multi-binding colors. We also compared the chromosome aberrations in both 2 - and 3 -dimensional cell cultures. Results of these experiments revealed the highest chromosome aberration frequencies after low <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> neutron exposures. However, detailed analysis of the radiation induced inversions revealed that all three radiation types induced a low incidence of simple inversions. Most of the inversions in gamma-ray irradiated samples were accompanied by other types of intra-chromosomal aberrations but few inversions were accompanied by inter-chromosomal aberrations. In contrast, neutrons and Fe ions induced a significant fraction of inversions that involved complex rearrangements of both inter- and intrachromosomal exchanges. The location of the breaks involved in chromosome exchanges was analyzed along the painted chromosome. The breakpoint distribution was found to be randomly localized on chromosome 3 after neutron or Fe ion exposure, whereas non-random distribution with clustering breakpoints was observed after -ray exposure. Our comparison of chromosome aberration yields between 2 - and 3 -dimensional cell cultures indicated a significant difference for gamma exposures, but not for Fe ion exposures. These experimental results indicated that the track structure of the radiation and the cellular/chromosome structure can both affect radiation-induced chromosome aberrations...|$|R

A comparison of results following constant <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> vs. variable <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> is made to explore how well the constant <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> used for typical part testing predict the performance during a simulated space-like mission.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{investigate}} the possibilities of doping cadmium telluride CdTe by the technique of ion implantation. Crystals grown by different techniques have been implanted with hydrogen, argon, indium, tellurium and bismuth ions at energies which produce lattice disorder to a mean depth of about 300 A. Electrical activity generated in implanted layers has been studied as a function of <b>ion</b> type, <b>dose,</b> implantation temperature and annealing temperature. The lattice disorder in these layers has also been investigated as a function of implanted <b>ion</b> energy, and <b>dose</b> <b>rate.</b> Measurements using the thermal probe, sheet resistivity and Hall effect techniques have been taken to assess material suitable for implantation and to investigate electrical activity in implanted layers. Damage centres in the CdTe bandgap have been investigated as a function of ion type and annealing temperature, using the Thermostimulated current technique. The Rutherford Backscattering and channelling of alpha particles has been applied to all implanted material to yield information about the amount and distribution of lattice disorder. The technique also gave information on the position of implanted bismuth in the CdTe lattice. Lattice disorder, produced by the above heavy. ions, exhibited annealing characteristics which were dependent on dose and implant conditions. Complete reordering of the lattice was not detected, due to surface evaporation above 450 Â°C. Bismuth ion movement was detected but no substitutional component was observed. On annealing above 450 Â°C implanted bismuth was rapidly lost from the surface. Besides the generation of radiation induced trapping levels, no electrical activity was detected in samples implanted at room temperature. Implanting indium into substrates held at 200 Â°C produced a dose dependent activity and in the best case one in three of the implanted indium ions became electrically active...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{energy is}} a sustainable, efficient, carbon-neutral energy source {{to meet the}} {{ever-increasing}} global energy demands. Some current advanced reactor concepts require reactor core components, such as fuel cladding and ducts, to withstand up to 300 ? 500 dpa neutron irradiation. Achieving such a dose level in test reactors would require years or even decades of radiation, which makes reactor irradiation impractical for materials development and testing. As an alternative approach to study high-dose irradiation effects in materials, ion irradiation techniques are regaining popularity due to their high damage production rate. To date, the correspondence between neutron and ion irradiation is still being investigated, and correlations of microstructural features between neutron and ion irradiated materials are still not well understood. As a means to understand these correlations, the microstructures of neutron- and ion-irradiated steel alloy MA 957 were examined and compared. This material was selected due to its high relevance to high-dose applications. The characterization relies heavily on atom probe tomography (APT). The results show that YTiO oxide particles in MA 957 followed similar trends with irradiation temperature after neutron and ion irradiation but size and number density were not identical. The presence of alpha-prime phase has been confirmed at lower irradiation temperatures in both neutron and ion irradiations. Assessing effects on grain boundary segregation after ion irradiation is more challenging. Thus, only qualitative comparisons of segregation of Cr, Ti, and TiO were conducted between neutron and ion irradiation. Rate theory calculations were carried out to investigate precipitate stability. The defect balance equation and precipitate stability models were reanalyzed using materials-specific and experiment-specific parameters. Precipitate nucleation {{was not included in}} the analysis, and so size change is more readily predicted with this model than number density change. Predicted results of particle stability were found to be in good agreement with our experimental results. The ratio of diffusivity to <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> was identified as a probable measure to determine whether application of temperature shift is necessary for reproducing microstructural evolution in <b>ion</b> irradiation.

METHODS For <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> analysis, using Monte Carlo methods, dose distributions {{are calculated}} in sectors of consecutive DICOM control points and each multiplied with the MU-rate obtaining <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions for every voxel at every time-point during a treatment fraction. <b>Dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions {{were calculated for}} a clinical head and neck, cranial (2 Gy fraction dose) and a SBRT liver treatment case (5 Gy per fraction). To assess optimizer influence on <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions, five conventionally fractionated head and neck cases were optimized using the progressive resolution optimizer (PRO) versions 2 and 3 (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). RESULTS Firstly, histograms of <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> {{over the course of}} treatment delivery in volumes of interest were generated for the PTV and spine or brainstem of the clinical treatment plans. Secondly, <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> were assessed as color wash overlay on top of CT slices, allowing the user to explore the <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> variation over time. For the cases considered, <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> were spread out over a continuous spectrum with a mean value in the lower half. PRO 3 generated plans showed higher maximum <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> compared to PRO 2 (699. 80 cGy/min vs. 543. 46 cGy/min) and modulation of MU rates in blocks as opposed to gradual modulation.

40|$|A {{survey of}} natural gamma {{background}} radiation (NGBR) {{levels in the}} Kinta District was carried out for three years between 2003 and 2005. <b>Dose</b> <b>rates</b> were measured from 1007 locations by using a portable gamma-ray survey meter manufactured by Ludlum,Model 19 MicroR Meter. The measured <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 39 to 1039 nGy h- 1. It has a mean <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> of 222 Â± 191 nGy h- 1. Small areas of hot spot around Kampung Sungai Durian with <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> of 1039 Â± 104 nGy h- 1. This is the highest recorded in Perak to date.

40|$|We have {{presented}} results of ultra-low <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> irradiations (< or = 10 mrad(Si) /s) {{for a variety}} of radiation hardened and commercial linear bipolar devices. We observed low <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> enhancement factors exceeding 1. 5 in several parts. The worst case of <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> enhancement resulted in functional failures, which occurred after 10 and 60 krad(Si), for devices irradiated at 0. 5 and 10 mrad(Si) /s, respectively. Devices fabricated with radiation hardened processes and designs also displayed <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> enhancement at below 10 mrad(Si) /s. Furthermore, the data indicated that these devices have not reached the damage saturation point. Therefore the degradation will likely continue to increase with increasing total dose, and the low <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> enhancement will further magnify. The cases presented here, in addition to previous examples, illustrate the significance and pervasiveness of low <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> enhancement at <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> lower than 10 mrad(Si). These results present further challenges for radiation hardness assurance of bipolar linear circuits, and raise {{the question of whether the}} current standard test <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> is conservative enough to bound degradations due to ELDRS...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe give a {{novel and}} very general {{treatment}} {{to a standard}} model describing <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> effects in systems damaged by carrier trapping. This model is well adapted for optical fibers, but the lessons we draw may also be helpful to discuss <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> effects (DRE) in electronic devices. By highlighting the few determinant ratios of physical parameters that govern the system behavior, we clarify when, how and how much <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> effects affect trap filling and radiation-induced degradation. Critical <b>dose</b> <b>rate,</b> marking the demarcation between low and high <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, is also estimated {{as a function of}} these parameters. Taking this step back is important to enlighten contradictory results reported on DRE behaviors. The <b>dose</b> and <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> dependencies of trap filling measured on silica optical fibers, as well as the critical <b>dose</b> <b>rate,</b> are successfully reproduced with a single set of a few adjustable physical parameters...|$|R

Tests at low temperature with a one-second radiation pulse width show that damage continues to increase for more than 3000 seconds afterward, consistent with predictions of the CTRW model for oxides with a thickness of 700 nm...|$|R
