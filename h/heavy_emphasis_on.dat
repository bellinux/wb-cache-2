Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> a synthesizer.

5|$|While {{developing}} Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately {{departed from}} the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences {{that might otherwise be}} put off by a <b>heavy</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.|$|E

5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place <b>heavy</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> ethical issues, it did see {{the family as}} the cornerstone of society.

Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E

5|$|Shot {{mostly on}} {{location}} on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, Jaws {{was the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean. As a result, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a <b>heavy</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> television spots and tie-in merchandise.|$|E

50|$|The Quarab is a horse breed {{from the}} United States, {{developed}} from a part-Arabian cross of Arabian horses, American Quarter Horses and Paint horses. Members of the breed are found that resemble {{all three of}} the foundation breeds, leading to three recognized types: Straight or Foundation (an even cross between the Arabian and stock horse types), Stock (a <b>heavier</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> stock horse breeding) and Pleasure (a <b>heavier</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> Arabian breeding). Although there have been records of crosses between the three breeds throughout the history of their respective registries, the first Quarab registry was formed in 1984, but later went out of business. In 1999, the International Quarab Horse Association was formed and remains the leading force in Quarab breeding. In order to be registered with the IQHA, horses must have at least 1/8 blood from both the Arabian and stock horse types.|$|R
5|$|The game {{features}} <b>heavy</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> environmental destruction using {{a procedural}} destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, {{and the system}} aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers {{can be used in}} a round.|$|E
5|$|The {{last week}} of {{production}} was fraught with issues. Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage; the lights were faulty, and three people were nearly electrocuted. On January 26, 1979, the film finally wrapped after 125 days. The three leads (Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley) delivered their final lines at 4:50 pm. Before the crew could go home, a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V'Ger. The script prescribed a <b>heavy</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> lighting, with spiraling and blinding white lights. Collins was covered in tiny dabs of cotton glued to his jacket; these highlights were designed to create a body halo. Helicopter lights, 4000–watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker's fusion with the living machine. The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew. The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles {{in the air to}} be illuminated, creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard. During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly, and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print.|$|E
