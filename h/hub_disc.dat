2500|$|Run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about [...] from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around [...] Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the <b>hub.</b> <b>Disc</b> face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.|$|E
5000|$|A {{live axle}} is {{probably}} the most common axle setup used on mini choppers. The [...] "live" [...] term indicates that the axle spins along with the wheel, sprocket, and other pieces anchored to the axle. Since the axle spins, bearings are mounted to the swing arm frame. This is a very simple axle setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel <b>hub,</b> <b>disc</b> brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the axle and are held in place by set screws or locking collars. The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the axle spins, the wheel, brake, and sprocket components must be locked to the axle. This is accomplished by using a square key that fits into a groove on the axle and the components.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{brakes on}} the RS4 are of two-piece construction.

25|$|Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, {{in which}} {{friction}} pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is {{contained within the}} wheel <b>hub,</b> or <b>disc</b> brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes.

5000|$|The {{difference}} between the two styles is that single disc couplings cannot accommodate parallel misalignment due to the complex bending that would be required of the lone disc. Double disc styles allow the two discs to bend in opposite directions to better manage parallel offset. The discs are fastened to the hubs (and center spacer on double disc styles) with tight fitting pins that do not allow any play or backlash between the <b>disc</b> and the <b>hubs.</b> The <b>discs</b> can be bent easily and as a result, disc couplings have some of the lowest bearing loads available in a motion control coupling.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{standards}} for the manufacturing inspection of railroad wheels using ultrasound, such as UIC 812, {{have been replaced by}} new standards, for example EN 13262 and RD 32. 144 - 2000, both requiring ultrasonic testing in immersion technique. These new standards require the development of an ultrasonic technique for 100 % coverage of the wheel rim and wheel hub, and in special cases for both straight and curved wheel disks. In order to encompass a large variety of railroad wheel designs, inspection and handling techniques should be capable of dealing with wheel diameters ranging from 600 mm to 1300 mm (23 " to 51 ") at testing cycles from 1 to 4 minutes per wheel. The current requirement for the minimum detectable flaw size is DSR 1 mm (disc shape reflector, DSR, 1 mm diameter) for high-speed train wheels rims and DSR 2 mm for all other wheel rims. The minimum detectable flaw size for all other wheel areas (hub and disk areas) is DSR 3 mm. To meet all these criteria, the Rail Wheel Inspection (RWI) System was developed by IZFP and their partners. The system consists of an ultrasonic testing sub-system, immersion tank and transportation/handling sub-systems. Test cycles of 1 minute per wheel require two immersion tanks and two transportation/handling subsystems. The ultrasonic sub-system features modular computer-aided 6 to 16 - channel UT electronics (PCUS 11) to employ 6 to 16 ultrasonic transducers (the precise number is determined by the testing procedure). This presentation paper offers descriptions of, and results from three of these systems that have been integrated into manufacturing processes at German and Russian wheel manufacturers, and provides details on the following topics: Wheel rim inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 4 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Bochum, Germany) Wheel rim, <b>hub</b> and <b>disc</b> inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 2 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Ilsenburg, Germany) Wheel rim, <b>hub</b> and <b>disc</b> inspection, dual-tank immersion technique, 1 minute inspection cycle per wheel (Nishny-Tagil, Russia...|$|R

50|$|The 33 became {{renowned for}} its nimble {{handling}} and powerful boxer engines, but also became equally well known for its unreliable electronics and tendencies to rust (a frequent complaint on Italian cars in general at the time).

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of mowers: sickle bar mowers, disc mowers, and drum mowers. Sickle bar mowers use a {{reciprocating}} blade to cut the grass and typically use a reel to fold the grass over the knife. Disc mowers {{have a number of}} hubs across the cutting width, each hub having a small (18") rotating disc with knives. Drum mowers use two or three large plates (called the drums, about 36" [...] across) which ride over the ground as they are spinning. A sickle bar mower's main advantage over disc mowers and drum mowers is the reduced horsepower requirements. Its disadvantage is the extra maintenance required due to the high number of moving parts and wear items. Disc mowers were historically considered an [...] "all the eggs in one basket" [...] kind of mower because all the mower hubs were in one large gearbox. If one blade hit something and a gear tooth broke, the whole gearbox would suffer a catastrophic failure, and there would be nothing worth fixing. If anything broke, everything broke. Drum mowers prevented this by having typically two belt-driven drums compared to six or more gear-driven <b>hubs.</b> Modern <b>disc</b> mowers use isolated gearboxes, and if one fails it can be swapped out without rebuilding the entire machine.|$|R

50|$|Open-die forging is {{also known}} as smith forging. In open-die forging, a hammer strikes and deforms the workpiece, which is placed on a {{stationary}} anvil. Open-die forging gets its name {{from the fact that the}} dies (the surfaces that are in contact with the workpiece) do not enclose the workpiece, allowing it to flow except where contacted by the dies. The operator therefore needs to orient and position the workpiece to get the desired shape. The dies are usually flat in shape, but some have a specially shaped surface for specialized operations. For example, a die may have a round, concave, or convex surface or be a tool to form holes or be a cut-off tool.Open-die forgings can be worked into shapes which include <b>discs,</b> <b>hubs,</b> blocks, shafts (including step shafts or with flanges), sleeves, cylinders, flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and some custom shapes.Open-die forging lends itself to short runs and is appropriate for art smithing and custom work.

2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all <b>hub</b> brakes except <b>disc</b> brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|R
