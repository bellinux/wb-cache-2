5|$|In {{part due}} to his {{advanced}} years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved {{in the affairs of}} other states, including those in the <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Community. Despite his reservations about any immediate <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity's Conciliation Commission on the Congo.|$|E

30|$|A {{review of}} genetic and {{lifestyle}} factors {{of the performance}} of the <b>East</b> <b>Africans</b> distance runners concluded that the findings on candidate genes linked to performance of Caucasian populations were not confirmed in <b>East</b> <b>Africans</b> showing research methods’ limitations and the polygenic nature of performance (Tucker et al. 2013). This was in agreement with another review showing that distance running success of <b>East</b> <b>Africans</b> was not based on a unique genetic profile (Wilber and Pitsiladis 2012). Another parameter that has not been studied previously as much as the abovementioned parameters might be the physical activity and inactivity levels when athletes did not practise their sport. Surprisingly, a study in marathon and half-marathon runners showed that these athletes trained for 6.5  h weekly, but they also spent much more time sitting (Whitfield et al. 2014). The aforementioned study found no relationship between sitting time and performance. However, potential differences in non-sport physical activities and inactivity levels between <b>East</b> <b>Africans</b> and Europeans should be examined in future studies.|$|R

5|$|Kenya Airways was {{established}} by the Kenyan government on , following the break-up of the <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Community and the consequent demise of <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Airways (EAA). On , two Boeing 707–321s leased from British Midland Airways inaugurated operations, serving the Nairobi–Frankfurt–London route. On internal and regional flights, the carrier deployed aircraft formerly operated by the EAA consortium, such as one Douglas DC-9-52 and three Fokker F-27-200s. In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient. The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services. Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years.|$|E

40|$|Human genetic {{variation}} particularly in Africa is still poorly understood. This is despite {{a consensus on}} the large African effective population size compared to populations from other continents. Based on sequencing of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit II (MT-CO 2), and genome wide microsatellite data we observe evidence suggesting the effective size (Ne) of humans to be larger than the current estimates, with a foci of increased genetic diversity in east Africa, and a population size of <b>east</b> <b>Africans</b> being at least 2 - 6 fold larger than other populations. Both phylogenetic and network analysis indicate that <b>east</b> <b>Africans</b> possess more ancestral lineages in comparison to various continental populations placing them {{at the root of}} the human evolutionary tree. Our results also affirm east Africa as the likely spot from which migration towards Asia has taken place. The study reflects the spectacular level of sequence variation within <b>east</b> <b>Africans</b> in comparison to the global sample, and appeals for further studies that may contribute towards filling the existing gaps in the database.

5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus {{can produce a}} viable male hybrid, {{though it is not}} known if it is sterile. An {{accidental}} crossing of an <b>east</b> <b>African</b> common eland (T. o. pattersonianus) with an <b>east</b> <b>African</b> kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common <b>East</b> <b>African</b> shilling.|$|E
