The circular barren patches capture water which then flows to the outer <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> More water available increases biomass and roots which leads to the soil becoming looser.

40|$|We {{consider}} arbitrary {{quantum wire}} networks modelled by finite, noncompact, connected quantum graphs {{in the presence}} of an external magnetic field. We find a general formula for the total scattering matrix of the network in terms of its local scattering properties and its metric structure. This is applied to a quantum ring with N external edges. Connecting the external <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> to heat reservoirs, we study the quantum transport on the graph in ambient magnetic field. We consider two types of dynamics on the ring: the free Schrödinger and the free massless Dirac equations. For each case, a detailed study of the thermal noise is performed analytically. Interestingly enough, in presence of a magnetic field, the standard linear Johnson-Nyquist law for the low temperature behaviour of the thermal noise becomes nonlinear. The precise regime of validity of this effect is discussed and a typical signature of the underlying dynamics is observed. Comment: 27 page...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{properties}} of an object in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF) classified as a galaxy in on-line data bases and revealed on the Subaru images as a genuine polar-ring galaxy (PRG) candidate. We analyse available photometric data and conclude that this object consists of a > 5 Gyr old early-type central body surrounded by a faint, narrow inner ring tilted at a ~ 25 deg angle relative to the polar axis of the host galaxy. The halo surrounding the main stellar body exhibits a diversity of spatially extended stellar features of low surface brightness, including a faint asymmetric stellar cloud and two prominent loops. These faint features, together with the unperturbed morphology of the central host, are clear signs of a recent coalescence of two highly unequal mass galaxies, most likely a pre-existing early-type galaxy and a close-by gas-rich dwarf galaxy. The presumed stellar remnants observed near the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> including possibly the surviving captured companion itself, indicate that the merger is still taking place.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} clustering {{analysis of the}} young stellar population across the star-forming ring galaxy NGC 6503, based on the deep HST photometry obtained with the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We apply a contour-based map analysis technique and identify in the stellar surface density map 244 distinct star-forming structures at various levels of significance. These stellar complexes {{are found to be}} organized in a hierarchical fashion with 95 % being members of three dominant super-structures located along the star-forming ring. The size distribution of the identified structures and the correlation between their radii and numbers of stellar members show power-law behaviors, as expected from scale-free processes. The self-similar distribution of young stars is further quantified from their autocorrelation function, with a fractal dimension of ~ 1. 7 for length-scales between ~ 20 pc and 2. 5 kpc. The young stellar radial distribution sets the extent of the star-forming ring at radial distances between 1 and 2. 5 kpc. About 60 % of the young stars belong to the detected stellar structures, while the remaining stars are distributed among the complexes, still inside the ring of the galaxy. The analysis of the time-dependent clustering of young populations shows a significant change from a more clustered to a more distributed behavior in a time-scale of ~ 60 Myr. The observed hierarchy in stellar clustering is consistent with star formation being regulated by turbulence across the ring. The rotational velocity difference between the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> suggests shear as the driving mechanism for this process. Our findings reveal the interesting case of an inner ring forming stars in a hierarchical fashion.

40|$|We present high {{sensitivity}} {{maps of the}} High Velocity (HV) CO emission {{toward the}} molecular outflows around IRc 2 and Orion-S in the Orion A molecular cloud. The maps reveal the presence of HV bullets in both outflows with velocities between 40 - 80 kms- 1 from the ambient gas velocity. The blue and redshifted CO HV bullets associated with the IRc 2 outflow are distributed in thin (12 "- 20 ", 0. 02 - 0. 04 pc) elliptical ring-like structures with a size of ~ 10 "x 50 " (0. 02 x 0. 1 pc). The CO emission at the most extreme blue and redshifted velocities (EHV) peaks 20 " north of source I, just inside the rings of the HV bullets. The low velocity H 2 O masers and the H 2 * bullets around IRc 2 are located at the inner <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of CO HV bullets and surrounding the EHV CO emission. Furthermore, the high velocity H 2 O masers are very well correlated with the EHV CO emission. This morphology {{is consistent with a}} model of a jet driven molecular outflow oriented close to the line of sight. In the Orion-S outflow, the morphology of the CO HV bullets shows a bipolar structure in the southeast-northwest direction, and the H 2 O masers are found only at low velocities in the region between the exciting source and the CO HV bullets. The morphology of the CO HV bullets, the radial velocities and the spatial distribution of the H 2 O masers in both outflows, as well as the H 2 * features around IRc 2, are consistent with a model in which these outflows are driven by a jet variable in direction. In this scenario, the large traverse velocity measured for the H 2 O masers in the IRc 2 outflow, ~ 18 kms- 1, supports the evolutionary connection between the jet and the shell-like outflows.

40|$|Cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic {{oligosaccharides}} {{composed of}} six to more than sixty glucose units. α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD are well known CD consisting of 6, 7 and 8 glycopyranose units, respectively, that are torus-like rings built up from glycopyranose units. The secondary hydroxyl groups are situated {{on one of the}} two <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> whereas all the primary ones are placed on the other edge. The ring is a conical cylinder, which is frequently characterized as a doughnut or wreath shaped truncated cone. The cavity is lined with hydrogen atoms and glycosidic oxygen bridges, respectively. The primary and secondary hydroxyls {{on the outside of the}} cyclodextrins make cyclodextrins water-soluble. The cavity of the cyclodextrin consists of a ring of C-H groups, a ring of glycosidic oxygen atoms and again a ring of C-H groups. This renders the interior of the cyclodextrin rings less polar. As a consequence, the hydrophilic sites which are outside of the torus enable CD to be soluble in water, whereas the apolar cavity site which provides a hydrophobic matrix, enables CD to form inclusion complex with a variety of hydrophobic guest molecules. In addition, CD contains repeating units of ‒OCCO‒ binding motif on both their primary and secondary faces. This makes CD able to form extended structures with metal cations of Group IA and IIA (MOFs). The main goal of this thesis was to design, prepare and characterize new crystal systems based on cyclodextrins properties in combination with: 1. Para aminobenzoic acid (pABA) as a drug model to study the effect of complexation phenomena on the solubility of drugs. Their structure and mode of interaction were characterized by combination a theoretical and experimental approaches. 2. Potassium hydroxide to prepare cyclodextrin Metal-Organic Frameworks (CD-MOFs) formed by coordinating the cyclodextrins to potassium cation. Consequently, taking the advantages of this interaction between cyclodextrin and alkali metal cation, formation of inclusion complexes as CD-MOFs drug carrier was favored. 3. Aegelinol, a natural product, for analytical purposes to determine the absolute configuration of this compound by formation of an inclusion complex with a host of known chirality (cyclodextrins consists of several optically active D-glucose units). This should allow direct determination of the absolute configuration of the guest (aegelinol). (DOCSC 02) [...] FUNDP, 201...|$|E
40|$|Syn- and post-eruptive {{erosion of}} {{volcanic}} cones {{plays an important}} role in mass redistribution of tephra over short periods. Descriptions of the early stages of erosion of tephra from monogenetic volcanic cones are rare, particularly those with a well-constrained timing of events. In spite of this lack of data, cone morphologies and erosion features are commonly used for long-term erosion rate calculations and relative age determinations in volcanic fields. Here we provide new constraints on the timing and nature of erosion from a tephra ring erupted in 1913 in West Ambrym, Vanuatu and exposed along a continuous 2. 5 km long coastal section. The ring surrounds an oval shaped depression filled by water. It is composed of a succession of a phreatomagmatic fall and base surge beds, interbedded with thin scoriaceous lapilli units. Toward the outer <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> base-surge beds are gradually replaced in the succession by fine-ash dominated debris-flows and hyperconcentrated-flow deposits. The inter-fingering of phreatomagmatic deposits with syn-volcanic reworked volcaniclastic sediments indicates an ongoing remobilisation of freshly deposited tephra already during the eruption. Gullies cut into the un-weathered tephra are up to 4 m deep and commonly have c. 1 m of debris-flow deposit fill in their bases. There is no indication of weathering, vegetation fragments or soil development between the gully bases and the basal debris flow fills. Gully walls are steep and superficial fans of collapsed sediment are common. Most gullies are heavily vegetated although some active (ephemeral) channels occur. Hence, we conclude that the majority of the erosion of such tephra rings in tropical climates takes place directly during eruption and possibly for only a period of days to weeks afterward. After establishment of the gully network, tephra remobilisation is concentrated only within them. Therefore the shape of the erosion-modified volcanic landform is predominantly developed shortly after the eruption ceases. This observation indicates that gully erosion morphology may not necessarily relate to age of such a landform. Different intensities of erosion during eruption (related to water supply or rainfall) are probably the major influence on gully spacing, modal depth and form. Longer-term post-eruption processes that could be indicators of relative age may include internal gully deepening (below basal debris-flow fill sediments) and possibly widening and side-slope lowering due to undercutting and side-collapse...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Forest {{rings are}} large {{circular}} features distinctive of Ontario’s boreal forest. They are centred on areas of negative redox charge and {{characterized by a}} slight depression in the mineral soil around <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> A field and laboratory investigation of forest <b>rings</b> is investigating <b>the</b> complex relationship between physical, chemical and microbiological processes occurring at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> these features. Physical changes that are known to occur include a slight positive electrical field anomaly over <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> a negative thermal and hydraulic-conductivity anomaly. Chemical changes are profound and most exemplified by a very sharp redox gradient at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> between <b>the</b> chemically reduced interior and the oxidized exterior.
