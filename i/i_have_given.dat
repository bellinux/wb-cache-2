5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> such {{descriptions}} of engines for wheel carriages as I {{could do in}} the time and space I could allow myself; {{but it is very}} defective and can only serve to keep other people from similar patents.|$|E
25|$|What so ever <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given,</b> granted, conferred, or {{appointed}} {{to my wife}} in the former part of this my Will, I do now for just and great causes, utterly revoke, and make void, and leave her to her right only.|$|E
60|$|Holmes {{was sitting}} {{with his back to}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> him no sign of my occupation.|$|R
60|$|A noise had {{disturbed}} him. While {{absorbed in}} what the two were doing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> an involuntary cough.|$|R
5000|$|... "Rhyme ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up; but meeting Fergusson's Scotch Poems, I strung anew my wildly-sounding, rustic lyre with emulating vigour." ...|$|R
25|$|Hear ye! I {{make known}} {{to you that}} I am in perplexity by reason of {{difficulties}} into which I have been brought without cause, therefore <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> away the life of our land. Hear ye! but my rule over you, my people, and your privileges will continue, for I have hope that {{the life of the}} land will be restored when my conduct is justified.|$|E
25|$|I am {{now before}} {{you in a}} public character. If, in that situation, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> you offence, you have an undoubted right to call for an apology or defence; but if I have erred as a private individual, {{the nature of that}} error cannot with {{discretion}} come under your notice. It will probably be investigated by a court, constituted to hear both the accuser and the accused, and where justice only can be done.|$|E
25|$|That we are {{commanded}} to take {{possession of}} the Land which the Almighty, Blessed Be He, gave to our forefathers, to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Yaakov; and not to abandon it to other nations, or to leave it desolate, as He said to them, You shall dispossess {{the inhabitants of the}} Land and dwell in it, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the Land to you to possess it, (Numbers, 33:53) and he said, further, To Inherit the Land which I swore to your forefathers, (to give them,) behold, we are commanded with the conquest of the land in every generation.|$|E
60|$|The bare {{suspicion}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> her pain was intolerable to me. I rang my bell, to make inquiries.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{last night}} I thought you'd made your last joke, old man, and that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> my last dose of quinine.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> all my {{reward for}} all that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up. <b>I</b> forgot Mr. Playmore; I forgot Gleninch. Our new honeymoon dates, in my remembrance, from that day.|$|R
500|$|The Gospels relate {{that on the}} eve of his Crucifixion, Jesus Christ ate a {{meal with}} his disciples. [...] After the meal, it is {{recorded}} that Jesus washed their feet, and gave them the following mandatum or command: [...] "If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. [...] For <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> you an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you." [...] Mandatum is the derivation of the word [...] "Maundy", and the Royal Maundy service evolved from Jesus' command to his disciples.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary reviewers {{and modern}} critics have {{postulated}} numerous possible {{sources of the}} story, a search Jershua McCormack argues is futile because Wilde [...] "has tapped a root of Western folklore so deep and ubiquitous that the story has escaped its origins {{and returned to the}} oral tradition." [...] Wilde claimed the plot was [...] "an idea that is as old as the history of literature but to which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a new form". Modern critic Robin McKie considered the novel to be technically mediocre, saying that the conceit of the plot had guaranteed its fame, but the device is never pushed to its full.|$|E
500|$|The {{nation was}} shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to Queen Victoria, [...] "Gladly would <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> {{my life for}} his". Princess Mary wrote to Queen Victoria of the Princess of Wales, [...] "the despairing {{look on her face}} was the most heart-rending thing I have ever seen." [...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, it is too late now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen on George's accession.|$|E
6000|$|Rowland smiled. [...] "Even against her," [...] he said, [...] "I {{should be}} sorry to {{conclude}} until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> her my respectful attention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' I said, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> him a {{cigar and}} filled his glass, 'and {{how have you}} been getting on, Mr Fisher? Any luck?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{always been}} plain to me. But what I didn't realize, until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> my promise over again, was that I dislike him acutely." ...|$|R
500|$|Seward's wife Frances {{was deeply}} {{committed}} to the abolitionist movement. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Seward's frequent travel and political work suggest that it was Frances who played the {{more active role in}} Auburn abolitionist activities. In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William [...] "Jerry" [...] Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, [...] "two fugitives have gone to Canada—one of them our acquaintance John." [...] Another time she wrote, [...] "A {{man by the name of}} William Johnson will apply to you for assistance to purchase the freedom of his daughter. You will see that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him something by his book. I told him I thought you would give him more." ...|$|E
500|$|Babayane and Mshete {{had arrived}} back in Bulawayo in August, {{accompanied}} by Maund, and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall, reaffirming that [...] "If the Queen hears that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> away the whole country, {{it is not}} so." [...] But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October, too late to make a difference. Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt {{and that he would}} just have to accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: [...] "Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly." ...|$|E
500|$|The heroine {{role of a}} [...] "devoted Iyengar Brahmin girl" [...] was {{originally}} offered to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who {{was too busy to}} accommodate production dates. After months of waiting for her call sheet, Shankar eventually offered the role to Sadha. Expressing hope that it would be [...] "an important movie" [...] in her career, Sadha accepted the offer, working on the film for 120 days, adding, [...] "I have a major role to play in Anniyan. There are few heavy portions involving me in the movie that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> my best." [...] She considered being a part of a Shankar film, especially during the early stages of her career, as a [...] "god's gift" [...] and a [...] "once-in-a-lifetime experience". However, when offered similar roles following the film's success, she refused to be typecast and stated, [...] "I am now looking for roles where my creative potential is tapped. I don't {{want to be part of}} such cinema where all one has to do is dance around trees." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Ray {{moved forward}} and placed {{deliberately}} upon the table {{the roll of}} papers which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up to him a few hours ago.|$|R
60|$|I {{went over}} the plans <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made for communicating, and the things I thought she might do. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> her the address of a {{solicitor}} she might put some trust in.|$|R
60|$|Peggotty {{cried out}} No! with an {{astonishing}} volume of voice; {{and then sat}} down, and began to pant, and said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> her a turn.|$|R
500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we owe it to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But I have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and I only hope that women who have experienced it will think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E
500|$|After {{successfully}} rehabilitating {{his knee}} in the offseason, Rivera announced on March9, 2013, {{that he would}} retire after the 2013 season, his 19th in the major leagues. Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball. He explained: [...] "It was {{important for me to}} meet the people who make baseball what it is, the people who work in the game every day. They have given me far more than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> them." [...] Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city: in Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song [...] "Enter Sandman"; the Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many broken personally by Rivera's cutter, called the [...] "Chair of Broken Dreams"; the rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park. Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, the pitcher's charitable organization. Corporate sponsors of the Yankees paid tribute as well; Delta Air Lines dedicated a Boeing 757 airplane with Rivera's signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior, while Hard Rock Cafe retired [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] from its song system at all locations except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1865, Whitman's friend, John Burroughs (1837–1921), an {{aspiring}} nature writer, had returned to Washington to his position at the Treasury department after a long vacation in the woods. Burroughs recalled that Whitman had been [...] "deeply interested in what I tell him of the hermit thrush, {{and he says he}} largely used the information <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him in one of his principal poems". Burroughs described the song as [...] "the finest sound in nature...perhaps more of an evening than a morning hymn...a voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments." [...] Whitman took copious notes of his conversations with Burroughs on the subject, writing of the hermit thrush that it [...] "sings oftener after sundown...is very secluded...likes shaded, dark places...His song is a hymn...in swamps—is very shy...never sings near the farm houses—never in the settlement—is the bird of the solemn primal woods & of Nature pure & holy." [...] Burroughs published an essay in May 1865 in which he described the hermit thrush as [...] "quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits" [...] found [...] "only in the deepest and most remote forests, usually in damp and swampy localities". Loving notes that the hermit thrush was [...] "a common bird on Whitman's native Long Island" [...] Biographer Justin Kaplan draws a connection between Whitman's notes and the lines in the poem: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What could induce thee," [...] {{resumed his}} monitress, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> thee aims indeed, to abandon them for objects that could end in nothing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis right {{it should}} be so," [...] she said. [...] "I have waited, feeling {{in my heart that}} the vow <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> would bind me for life, and I should be content to wait years longer if needs be. But I am bound by no vows, and can {{acknowledge}} that you have long been the lord of my life, and that so long as you wore the heart <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> you, so long would I listen to the wooing of no other." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sal. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{looked to}} all things needful, and will now [...] Receive reports of {{progress}} made in such [...] Orders as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given,</b> and then return [...] To hear your further pleasure.|$|R
500|$|Tao {{made her}} Olympic début for Singapore at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, {{arriving}} ranked 26th out of 49 butterfly swimmers. On 9 August, {{the second day}} of the swimming competition, she qualified fourth fastest for the semifinals of the 100metres butterfly after winning her heat with a personal best time of 57.77seconds. The following day she made it to the finals, shaving off 0.23seconds for another personal best time and new Asian record of 57.54seconds. She came in fourth behind her role model, Australian swimmer Lisbeth Trickett, and the USA's Christine Magnuson and Australia's Jessicah Schipper. She thus set two Asian records and the national record for the event, and became the eighth fastest butterfly swimmer in the world and first Singaporean swimmer to qualify for an Olympic Final. On 11 August, she came fifth at the 100metres butterfly finals with a time of 57.99seconds. The top three spots were taken by Trickett (56.73seconds), Magnuson (57.10seconds) and Schipper (57.25seconds). Asked by The Straits Times about her performance, Tao said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> another personal best, it would not have gotten me a medal. The top three winners were just too good. I wanted to do my best and I pushed all the way and hoped for the best." [...] Given Tao's age compared to those of the medallists, there were hopes that she would be able to improve on [...] her performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.|$|E
2500|$|Gen 1:29-30 - [...] "And Elohim said, 'Behold, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> {{you every}} herb bearing seed, which is upon {{the face of}} all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree {{yielding}} seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> every green herb for meat.' And it was so." [...] (Malchut) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> this {{question}} {{a great deal}} of thought. I have seen the Land Question in parliament brought forward with unanswerable eloquence, but with what result? ...|$|E
5000|$|Then Peter said, [...] "Silver {{and gold}} <b>have</b> <b>I</b> none; but such as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>give</b> <b>I</b> thee: In {{the name of}} Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk".|$|R
