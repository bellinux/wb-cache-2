40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with decentralized models of market equilibrium in which the primary interest lies {{in the nature of}} the <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> govern trade. There are two separate branches in this literature. In the first, the <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> govern trade are taken to be given exogenously. The primary motivation for models in this class is essentially the study of comparative institutions. In particular the papers are interested in whether there are specific <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> will generate Walrasian prices and allocations approximately when transactions costs are small. In the second branch of the literature, the <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> govern trade themselves are made endogenous. These models characterize the nature of these endogenously generated institutions and examine their efficiency in environments where transactions costs are small. ...|$|R
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total <b>institution</b> <b>that</b> educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E

5|$|Departing {{from the}} main central {{administrative}} system generally known as the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which was instituted by various dynasties since late Han (202 BCE – 220 CE), the Ming administration had only one Department, the Secretariat, that controlled the Six Ministries.

Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers. The Grand Secretariat, at the beginning a secretarial <b>institution</b> <b>that</b> assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork, was instituted, but without employing grand counselors, or chancellors.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national <b>institution</b> <b>that</b> wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E
