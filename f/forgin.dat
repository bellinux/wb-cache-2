40|$|International audienceA contact {{smoothing}} {{technique is}} {{developed in the}} frame of metal forming applications, especially for processes where the contact area is quite small with respect to the component size. In fact, the non-smoothness of contact surfaces discretized by finite elements shows to be a key problem to the simulation accuracy. The smoothing technique is based on building a higher order quadratic interpolation of the curved surface, using the node positions and their normal vectors, as proposed by Nagata. Within a local and easy to parallelize procedure, accurate normal vectors are calculated at each node from the existing discretized surface by considering a patch of surrounding elements and following a normal voting strategy. Corner and edges are automatically detected by analysing eigenvalues of derived covariant matrix. The efficiency and reliability of the resulting contact model are assessed on several examples, such as ironing a bulk parallelepiped or a plate, before being applied to metal forming processes, such as wire drawing, rolling of long products and orbital <b>forgin...</b>|$|E

Owing {{to the fact that}} SAFT (Synthetic Aperture Focussing Technique) neither uses an amplitude threshold nor rectifies the A-scans, this imaging method has been used for the investigation of a <b>forgin</b> with 780 mm diameter. Nonmetallic inclusions of circular or oval cross section located very close to each other were detected in the disc. The shape and size of the nonmetallic inclusions, consisting of a mixture of Al 2 O 3 and CaO, are clearly visible in the two cross-sectional images. The individual indications are of longitudinal shape, measuring up to some 10 mm in length and between 0, 2 and 0, 3 mm in thickness.

40|$|The most {{critical}} {{stage in the}} heat treatment of high strength aluminium alloys is the rapid cooling necessary to form a supersaturated solid solution. During cold water quenching of thick sections, the thermal gradients are sufficient to cause inhomogeneous plastic deformation which in turn leads {{to the development of}} large residual stresses. Two 215 mm thick rectilinear forgings made from 7075 and 7010 were heat treated, and the through thickness residual stresses measured by neutron diffraction and deep hole drilling. The distribution of residual stresses was found to be similar for both alloys varying from highly triaxial and tensile in the core to a state of biaxial compression in the surface. The 7010 forging exhibited significantly larger tensile stresses in the core. 7075 is a much more quench sensitive alloy when compared to 7010. This results in loss of supersaturation by second phase precipitation during quenching in the core of the 7075 <b>forgin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear behaviour of two Zr 02 -AlJO composite materials, ADZ (20 wt % AlzO, dispersed in yttria-doped ZrOz matrix) and ZTA (AI,O,- 1. 5 wt % ZrO,), were investigated. Sliding wear tests {{were carried out}} on these materials under dry condi-tions using a ball-on-plate configuration. The eflects of grain size and zirconia phase transformation on {{friction and}} wear behaviour were examined. Sinter forging was applied to determine the role of grain boundaries on the wear process. It was found that for ADZ composites the wear resistance increased with decreasing rain size. Only limited grain pull-out occurs in these systems, which also explains {{the fact that in}} this case sinter forging has no positive eflect on wear resistance. For ZTA composites a compressive surface caused by zirconia phase trans-formation has a beneficial eflect on wear resistance.

40|$|In {{production}} engineering cold forging processes are {{of great importance}} due to the high material utilization and the associated energy and resource efficiency. In order to perform cold forging processes successfully, liquid and solid lubricants are used, which are often questionable due to ecological, economic, and legislative reasons. For these reasons, dry metal forming exhibits an increased research potential. The absence of lubricants in dry metal forming contributes significantly to the waste reduction in manufacturing processes and {{to the goal of}} a lubricant-free factory. However, the abdication of lubricants goes along with the requirement that the dry tribological system has to withstand the increased tribological loads. In this contribution an empirical approach to meet the challenges in dry metal forming is proposed. Shot peened surface structures on workpieces are numerically investigated in order to identify friction and, thus, tool-load reducing surfaces compared with non-structured workpieces. In future work, this approach will be synthesized with a (Cr,Al) N PVD-tool-coating with self-lubricating disulfides to achieve a lubricant free cold <b>forgin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The last {{parameter}} of big-bang nucleosynthesis, the baryon density, {{is being}} pinned down by {{measurements of the}} deuterium abundance in high-redshift hydrogen clouds. When it is determined, it will fix the primeval light-element abundances.

Two key tests of the consistency of the standard theory are on the horizon: an independent, high-precision determination of the baryon density from anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation and a precision determination of the primeval 4 He abundance. 1 From Gamow to Keck Over the last two decades big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) has {{emerged as one of the}} cornerstones of the big bang, joining the Hubble expansion and the Cosmic microwave Background Radiation (CBR) in this role.

40|$|This paper aims {{to further}} the {{alignment}} among different theoretical approaches and future scholarship on the complex themes related to the micro-foundational processes characterizing the emergence and development of organizational routines and capabilities. It has been constructed with a typical Hegelian structure represented by a thesis, an antithesis and an attempt of a synthesis, each presented by different scholars, primed by {{a common set of}} questions related to the role of individual actors in shaping organizational change processes. The dialogue is introduced by Koen Heimeriks, followed by Sidney Winter proposing the ‘thesis ’ for an evolutionary perspective on the problem, and an ‘antithesis ’ is offered by Nicolai Foss with a number of critical points made from different economics and social science perspectives. Finally, Maurizio Zollo offers an attempt of a synthesis between the two positions with some proposals for conceptual and empirical advancement. The dialogue points to a convergence on the usefulness of evolutionary theory as a theoretical lens, but also on the need to add to the central notion of routinized behavior, other stable organizational traits of evolutionary relevance, such as the cognitive, motiva-tional and identity-based antecedents to behavior, as well as key dimensions of intentionality and consciousness of change, which have been so far given either implicit or axiomatic roles.

40|$|Abstract. In the Java Virtual Machine, the byte-code {{verifier}} checks low-level security {{properties that}} {{ensure that the}} downloaded code cannot bypass the virtual machine's security mechanisms. One of the statically ensured properties is type safety. The type-inference phase is the overwhelming resource-consuming part of the verification process. This paper addresses the RAM bottleneck met while verifying mobile code in memory-constrained environments such as smart-cards. We propose to modify the algorithm {{in a way that}} significantly reduces memory consumption. 1 Introduction The Java Card architecture for smart cards allows new applications, called applets, to be downloaded into smart-cards. While bringing considerable flexibility and extending the horizons of smart-card usage this post issuance feature raises major security issues. Upon their loading, malicious applets can try to subvert the JVM's security in a variety of ways. For example, they might try to overflow the stack, hoping to modify memory locations which they are not allowed to access, cast objects inappropriately to corrupt arbitrary memory areas or even modify other programs (Trojan horse attacks). While the general security issues raised by applet download are well known, transferring Java's safety model into resource-constrained devices such as smart-cards appears to require the devising of delicate security-performance trade-offs. Upon download, an applet's byte-code is subject to a static analysis called byte-code verification which purpose {{is to make sure that}} the applet's code is well-typed. This is necessary to ascertain that the code will not attempt to violate Java's security policy by performing ill-typed operations at runtime (e. g. <b>forgin...</b>|$|E
