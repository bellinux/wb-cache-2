5|$|From October to November 1944, the Yugoslav Partisans, {{supported}} {{by both the}} Western Allies and the Soviet Union, and assisted by the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the Bulgarian Fatherland Front and two brigades of Albanian partisans, retook the region of Kosovo as the Germans withdrew. The area was reincorporated into the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. With no chance of victory, the withdrawing Germans helped Albanian collaborators escape the country as the communists drew closer. Many failed to escape and were executed by the communists upon capture. On 28 November 1944, the communist <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Enver Hoxha emerged victorious in Albania. Hoxha subsequently implemented a totalitarian Stalinist government which banned all religions in the country.|$|E

30|$|The normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> {{the foot}} {{is the main}} component, and it is often larger than the {{tangential}} <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the foot. From the perspective of posture and balance, the main factors influencing the poses of the multi-legged robots are pitch, roll, and vertical fluctuation. The factors {{are directly related to}} the normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the foot on every leg [17]. From the perspective of power consumption for the mobile system of robot, the power consumption of joint is primarily confirmed by the normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot. The reason is that the mass and load of robot are counterpoised by the normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot of each leg. Hence, it shows that the normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot directly affects the posture and balance of robot and power consumption of mobile system. However, the normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the foot varies when the same leg is under different walking modes or gait. The walking mode and gait of robot are inherently associated with the normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the foot. Hence, the relationship between the gait and the normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot will be important for reducing the power consumption of mobile systems and improving the load to mass ratio and stability of heavy-duty multi-legged robots.|$|R
