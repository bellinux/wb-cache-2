25|$|Macmillan {{was badly}} burned {{in a plane}} crash, trying to climb back into the plane to rescue a Frenchman. He {{had to have a}} plaster cast put on <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> {{delirium}} he imagined himself back in a Somme casualty clearing station and asked for a message to be passed to his mother, now dead.|$|E
25|$|While Polish {{commentators}} saw Putin's {{participation in}} the ceremony held on April 7 as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers {{at the site of}} the crash. Tusk knelt and briefly hid <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours.|$|E
500|$|To his left, in the center, are the [...] "traitors", {{many of them}} on the Russian payroll, {{and future}} members of the Targowica Confederation. Adam Poniński, marshal of the Sejm, {{pointing}} in red court dress, either demands that Rejtan leaves or points to the armed Russian guards outside the door; he holds a simple wooden walking stick instead of a [...] more elaborate marshall's staff, which Rejtan stole a day earlier. Behind him are bishop Ignacy Massalski and Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk. To his right, Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki hides <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands; which likely was Matejko's solution for a prosaic problem — he probably did not have access to a likeness of Branicki. Szczęsny Potocki, with the blue sash, looks to the ground, embarrassed. Behind the overturned chair, his father, Franciszek Salezy Potocki, also embarrassed, drops a quill pen and looks away. Between the two Potockis Jacek Małachowski is engaged in discussion with Samuel Korsak, while Karol Radziwiłł simply observes the situation, amused. On the ground, turned over, lies an amchair, with Branicki's hat and a coin purse, from which the coins spill towards Poniński, alluding to the real reason he is intent on concluding the debate.|$|E
60|$|GREGORY [burying <b>his</b> shamed <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands]. No: I'd die first. Oh, I hate myself.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Robert's head was bent again, and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|Bude {{had fallen}} into a deck-chair, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, his arms rocking convulsively.|$|R
2500|$|Doomadgee family spokesman, Brad Foster, {{claimed that}} after the men had been put into the cells, fifteen minutes lapsed before a seven-second check was done on the inmates. Forty two minutes later a second police officer {{observed}} that Mulrunji was a strange colour and was cold to the touch. The officer {{could not find a}} pulse. [...] When alerted to this, Arresting Officer Chris Hurley came into the cell and thought he could detect a pulse. According to statements an ambulance was then called taking fifteen minutes to arrive. [...] During this time no attempts were made to resuscitate the prisoner, although the autopsy found that {{there would have been no}} chance of saving him. The videotape footage from the cell shows Chris Hurley checking for breathing and pulse then [...] "sliding down the wall of the cell until he sat with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands".|$|E
2500|$|Assigned by General Lee to {{hold the}} vital sunken road, or [...] "Bloody Lane", during the Battle of Antietam, Gordon's {{propensity}} for being wounded reached new heights. First, a Minié ball passed through his calf. Then, a second ball hit him higher in the same leg. A third ball went through his left arm. He continued to lead his men {{despite the fact that}} the muscles and tendons in his arm were mangled and a small artery was severed. A fourth ball hit him in his shoulder. Despite pleas that he go to the rear, he continued to lead his men. He was finally stopped by a ball that hit him in the face, passing through his left cheek and out his jaw. He fell with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cap and might have drowned in his own blood if it had not drained out through a bullet hole in the cap. A Confederate surgeon thought he would not survive but after he was returned to Virginia, he was nursed back to health by his wife.|$|E
60|$|The Prince buried <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, and {{remained}} silent.|$|E
60|$|Xodar still {{sat with}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands. I walked {{to his side}} and placed my hand upon his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{he is gone}} then! my dear, dear father!" [...] and Endymion {{burst into}} passionate tears, and leant on the table, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> hid <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom!" [...] {{says his}} father, {{who has been}} sitting quietly, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> covered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> handkerchief, {{listening}} to all, while holy tears of gratitude steal down <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|He stopped, {{his eyes}} dimmed, he buried <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|Hugh hid <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{hands and}} sobbed in his {{helpless}} rage.|$|E
60|$|Stroeve hid <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{hands and}} swayed {{backwards}} and forwards, groaning.|$|E
60|$|M. de La Tour d'Azyr, overcome, reeled {{away to a}} {{chair and}} sat down heavily. Losing command of himself for a moment, he took <b>his</b> haggard <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] said Eustace. [...] "Cruel! {{have you}} not {{degraded}} me enough already?" [...] and the wretched young man burst into tears, and hid <b>his</b> bleeding <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|He waved <b>his</b> hand <b>in</b> an {{imperative}} {{gesture of}} command. The red once more leaped to <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> steel-blue eyes glinted a pin-point of curiosity.|$|R
60|$|Campbell buried <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, and {{a shudder}} passed through him.|$|E
60|$|John hid <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{hands with}} a murmur of intense thanksgiving.|$|E
60|$|Clayton rolled over, and, burying <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms, {{gave up the}} battle.|$|E
60|$|He sprang forward too late; Lester, with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms, {{had rolled}} {{over on the}} floor fast asleep, and his utmost efforts failed to awaken him.|$|R
60|$|Bill {{groaned and}} hid <b>'is</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 'ands, and then Peter Russet went and spoilt things {{by saying that}} the safest place for a murderer to 'ide in was London. Bill gave a dreadful groan when 'e said murderer, but 'e up and agreed with Peter, and all Sam and Ginger Dick could do wouldn't make 'im alter his mind. He said that he would shave off 'is beard and moustache, and when night came 'e would creep out and take a lodging somewhere right the other end of London.|$|R
6000|$|Birch buried <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> both <b>his</b> hands, and {{his whole}} frame shook; the {{sergeant}} regarded him closely, but good feelings soon {{got the better}} of his antipathies, and he continued more mildly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Donatello {{had hidden}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, and {{was leaning against}} the parapet.|$|E
60|$|Hagon {{collapsed}} into a chair. He buried <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands and groaned.|$|E
60|$|The old officer {{sat down}} at the table and hid <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} {{brought him to}} his friend's lodging, but The Times had arrived there before him. Bracebridge was sitting over his untasted breakfast, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} that our hero had not gone there to drink, for the beer {{remained}} untouched at his elbow, as he sat with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|At {{this same}} hour the pirate captain was seated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cell {{on the edge}} of the low bedstead, with his elbows resting on his knees and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|The wretched man collapsed. He sank <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, and trembled all over.|$|E
60|$|The man {{groaned and}} sank <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands. We waited, {{but he was}} silent.|$|E
60|$|The General buries <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands. Mrs George comes {{round the}} table to him.|$|E
60|$|But Mr. Stephens had {{knelt down}} beside Sadie and buried <b>his</b> haggard <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> long, thin hands. Only the Colonel and Monsieur Fardet {{remained}} standing. Cochrane {{looked at the}} Frenchman with an interrogative eye.|$|R
60|$|No tears! no flaming-up of {{the quick}} temper that I knew so well! Nothing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> nothing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> voice, nothing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> manner, but a {{composure}} miserable to see--the composure of despair.|$|R
60|$|As {{the unhappy}} {{merchant}} sat thus, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, {{a small boat}} came alongside and a passenger mounted to the deck. This person, after asking a few questions, approached Mr. Delaplaine.|$|R
