500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could write him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You can fix it, George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{betrayal}} of the POUMists, the terror and the murder of Nin and Smillie, Orwell had been depressed by {{the attitude of the}} British press. [...] "In Spain ... I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts ... I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various party lines." [...] Carr writes, [...] "He was appalled at the treatment of the May days as a 'Trotskyist Revolt' in papers like the News Chronicle which simply swallowed uncritically the Communist line; or Ralph Bates' report in The New Republic that POUM militiamen were playing football with Fascist troops ... Given this supresio vero by interested parties, how could true history be written? Propaganda would pass as truth; 'facts' could be manipulated. Those who monopolized communication could create their own history after the event—the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four." [...] Orwell attacked sections of the left wing press for suppressing the truth about Spain, indicting the Communists for instigating a [...] "reign of terror"; and he never forgave Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New Statesman who turned down his articles on the Spanish Civil War {{on the grounds that they}} [...] "could cause trouble." [...] Malcolm Muggeridge remembered: [...] "Once when we were lunching at a Greek restaurant in Percy Street <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would mind changing places. I readily agreed but asked him why. He said that he just couldn't bear to look at Kingsley Martin's corrupt face, which, as Kingsley was lunching at an adjoining table, was unavoidable from where he had been sitting before." [...] "Ten years ago it was almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Communism; today it is almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Anarchism or 'Trotskyism'," [...] Orwell wrote bitterly in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, sir," [...] added James, with respectful suggestiveness, [...] "he {{wants to}} talk. At least, sir, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you would likely come downstairs before your company arrived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'E {{said that}} was only your nonsense, sir, and that I'd better have enough for one to begin with; and then <b>'e</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I'd been eating green apples again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do. I {{play for}} a village near here. Place called Little Borlock. A man who played against Wrykyn for the Free Foresters captains them. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I'd like some games for them." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} its Chief, a certain Umslopogaas or Bulalio. I answered, Yes, that I {{had met him}} there {{for the first time}} and thought him a very {{remarkable}} man.|$|E
6000|$|At night, when I {{had gone}} to bed, Joe came into my room, {{as he had done}} all through my recovery. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> felt sure that I was {{as well as in the}} morning? ...|$|E
60|$|CHR. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had a family? And I told him. But, said I, I am so loaden {{with the}} burden {{that is on}} my back, that I cannot take {{pleasure}} in them as formerly.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you don't," [...] said Beetle, {{sitting on}} a boot-basket. [...] "That's just what I didn't tell him. I spoke the giddy truth. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> there was {{much of it in}} the house; and I said I didn't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{we asked}} a few questions, and brought out remarks, with great difficulty, at long intervals. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> lying here was not a great nuisance, and, at last, he grew tired of {{twisting}} his moustache, and went away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Course I do," [...] Ikey replied, {{as if he}} was {{accustomed}} to making such large sales. [...] "Why, I had one man who got twenty cents' worth, an' <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> the stand was goin' to be kept open right along now." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{told him}} I would do so, {{with all the}} {{interest}} and curiosity that his preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers [...] "at it?" ...|$|E
60|$|In reply, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{would take}} it {{for a piece of}} sincerity, if, after a trial, he should tell me his mind, and would not be displeased if he {{declined}} speaking his thoughts till he had talked with them.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Campbell, the {{minister}} of Essendean, {{was waiting for me}} by the garden gate, good man! <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had breakfasted; and hearing that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it kindly under his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Titmarsh," [...] said Lady Fanny, {{laughing}} to me, [...] "who is {{that great}} fat curious man, {{the master of}} the house? Do you know <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you were not related to us? and I said, 'Oh, yes, you were.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had {{not only}} ordered my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook? ...|$|R
6000|$|The Porter answered, [...] "This man is on {{a journey}} from the City of Destruction to Mount Zion; but, being weary and benighted, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might lodge here to-night; so I told him I would call for thee, who, after {{speaking}} with him, mayest do as seemeth thee good, even {{according to the law}} of the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he {{answered}} with {{no loss of}} promptness, [...] "is what even Chad himself asked me last night. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't mind the loss--well, the loss of an opulent future. Which moreover," [...] he hastened to add, [...] "was a perfectly natural question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Sylvanus? I'm very poorly." [...] He came closer, {{and lowered}} his voice: [...] "Why did you get me to make that settlement? I must have been mad. I've had a man called Ventnor--I didn't like his manner. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew a Mrs. Larne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were {{standing}} with him, {{in front of}} the little house, when I save you yesterday. His name was Redbrook. It appears that he had seen me," [...] Victoria replied, [...] "when I went to Mercer to call on Zeb Meader. And <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew you." ...|$|E
60|$|The porter answered, This man is in {{a journey}} from the City of Destruction to Mount Zion, but being weary and benighted, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might lodge here tonight; so I told him I would call for thee, who, after {{discourse}} had with him, mayest do as seemeth thee good, even {{according to the law}} of the house.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{did take}} my {{trousers}} to the meeting," [...] {{he explained the}} press conference. [...] "He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I had resin in my pocket;I replied 'no'. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> there had been any other substance; I replied 'no'. That is where I made my mistake. I was thinking of other substances such as iron filings or Lipsyl. There was absolutely no other substance from earth in my pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{like to lose}} you, but I {{think you}} are right. Your {{beginning}} with me was a mistake. There is not enough work for three of us; but you know Easterby would be delighted to have you at St. Nicholas. He says his most promising people talk of what you said {{to them when they}} were ill, and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you could possibly come to him." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was silent}} again, and then hazarded a remark about Robert Louis Stevenson. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had been up}} to Vailima. For some reason he was {{making an effort to}} be {{agreeable}} to me. He began to talk of Stevenson's books, and presently the conversation drifted to London.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{wrote for}} any of the newspapers. I told him I never even read them. He seemed terribly {{disappointed}} at that, and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought." ...|$|E
60|$|Brown was {{the first}} to break the silence that followed. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any brandy on board. He said he felt he should like just a nip of brandy before going to bed. That is one of the chief charms of Jephson's stories: they always make you feel you want a little brandy.|$|E
5000|$|... "Yet {{beneath the}} gruff exterior, {{he was a}} kind man, as he {{demonstrated}} once when I met him. My shoes {{must have been a}} sight, for when he looked down at them, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> they were the only pair I had. I nodded. The next morning, he summoned me to his office and handed me a pair of Irish brogues, the strongest, most beautiful shoes I'd ever seen. And I had them for years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Caretto {{prepared}} me for this," [...] he said, smiling, [...] "when <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you might accompany him to Genoa. The Order will be a loser, for you would assuredly have risen to the grand priorage of your langue some day. But we {{have no right to}} complain; you have done your duty and more, and I doubt not that should Mahomet again lay siege to Rhodes, we may count on your hastening here to aid us?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Australian version starts: [...] "Well, I was humpin' my bluey on {{the dusty}} Oodnadatta road, When along came a semi with a high and canvas-covered load, 'If you're goin' to Oodnadatta, mate, um, with me you can ride,' so I climbed in the cabin, and I settled down inside, <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> i'd seen a road with so much dust and sand, I said listen mate, I've {{traveled}} every road in this here land. 'Cause..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What Mr. Gissem said. He {{was awful}} mad {{after he was}} in here, and he told Mr. Fillow he wished that you would burn out or that the water pipes would burst and drown you out. Then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> couldn't worry you a bit, and I said I'd try, and that's the truth of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Of course!” said Tony. “I {{shall be}} very {{genuinely}} sorry if his fancies turn out right. That, however, {{is not the}} question. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> still believed in Bernard, and I had {{a difficult thing to}} do. It seems that your faith in the man had almost convinced him. He wanted to believe him innocent, and leave him something in his will.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{asked me}} what he'd better do, but I didn't know. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion behind. I said I could if he didn't go no higher than he was now; but if he went higher I would lose my head and fall, sure. So he said, [...] "Take a good grip," [...] and he started.|$|E
5000|$|Vacca continued: It {{turned out}} that it was a foreigner—a tourist—who had been talking with Essad Bey. He {{misunderstood}} the custom and thought I was introducing myself as [...] "Kurban Said." [...] And so the foreigner had smiled and replied: [...] "Nice to meet you, Mr. Kurban Said." [...] "Ever since then, Essad Bey jokingly called me 'Kurban Said,' and when {{he was looking for a}} pseudonym for the novel, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could use it and I agreed." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I {{would please}} to grant him one thing, that, {{whatever}} his opinion should be, {{what he should}} say should be no prejudice to them in their present condition.|$|R
6000|$|... 'At any rate, father, I {{could never}} marry Lord Halliburn unless this matter were entirely cleared up; {{it would be}} unfair to him in the extreme. He might receive an {{anonymous}} letter from these people, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> it was true, what could I say? He has been greatly upset by the other business, what would he say did he know that I have been accused of theft? That {{brings us back to the}} subject of my engagement. You have been thinking it over since lunch, father?' ...|$|R
