40|$|I have {{developed}} an interactive tool for the simulation of a classical Von Neumann computer architecture. The simulation {{takes place at the}} register, bus, and gate level. The simulated system consists of 9 registers, 4 buses, 40 gates, an adder, a memory, a micro-programmed control subsystem, a 3 -phase clock, a &quot;scratch &quot; register, logical inverters, a bi-directional shift register, several constant registers, and zero-detect logic. A friendly user interface was also implemented, featuring an assembler, a microcode interpreter, and a terminal-independent full-screen display facility. My simulator prototype could effectively be used as an educational tool for the introduction of novices to the fundamentals of computer organization. Alternatively, the construction of such a simulator may in itself constitute a good term project for an upper <b>division</b> <b>hardware</b> course...|$|E
40|$|The Beams Division at Fermilab is {{applying}} Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) to {{a diverse}} group of control and measurement systems. This paper presents Fermilabs use of the Analog Devices SHARC DSP on custom VXI and commercial VME cards in a variety of systems. It explores how these systems take advantage of an architecture that allows for software and hardware re-use, flexibility, and evolution in systems with real-time and computationally intensive requirements. 1 Introduction When Fermi Run II physics resumes in 1999, the Booster, Main Injector, Tevatron, and Recycler Ring will all have low level RF systems built around the SHARC DSP. Other key control and instrumentation systems using the SHARC will also come on line for the next run. This work started in 1994 for the Low Level RF group upon reception of an engineering sample DSP. Since this time the scope of application has increased beyond Low Level RF to projects in other departments in the <b>division.</b> <b>Hardware</b> and software desig [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Implementing integer <b>division</b> in <b>hardware</b> is {{expensive}} {{when compared to}} multiplication. In the case where the divisor is a constant, expensive integer division algorithms can be replaced by cheaper integer multiplications and additions. This paper presents the conditions for multiply-add schemes to perform correctly rounded unsigned invariant integer division under one of three rounding modes. We propose a heuristic to explore the space of implementations meeting the conditions we derive. Experiments show that an average speed up of 20 % and area reduction of 50 % can be achieved compared to existing correctly rounded approaches. Extension to two’s complement numbers is also presented. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new method of {{performing}} <b>Division</b> in <b>Hardware</b> and explore different ways of implementing it. This method involves computing a preliminary estimate of the quotient by splitting the Dividend, performing division {{of each of the}} parts in parallel and merging them. The estimate is refined iteratively to get the final quotient. This method is significantly fast since it carries out parallel operations to compute the preliminary quotient and makes use of a fast multiplier to refine the result. It is possible to pipeline the execution of the unit yielding further increase in throughput. Speed estimates show that this method yields a much higher throughput than other fast methods, while area and latency are comparable 1...|$|R
