5|$|However, {{there was}} a desire among many women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert {{communities}} such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works <b>expressly</b> for exhibition and sale.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was <b>expressly</b> supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also <b>expressly</b> endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Sometime after 1630, {{the town}} of St. John's was {{established}} as a permanent community. Before this they were <b>expressly</b> forbidden by the English government, {{at the urging of}} the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast.|$|E
5|$|They go on {{to suggest}} that some unknown number of those {{participating}} in the ensuing riot may have traveled to Scranton <b>expressly</b> for that purpose, and not {{in support of the}} strikers or their objectives.|$|E
5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not <b>expressly</b> subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} private Acts {{establishing}} religious organizations <b>expressly</b> confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions. For instance, {{a person may}} only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board, which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments, {{if he or she}} is Hindu. Similarly, one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board, which manages gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Singapore, if one professes the Sikh faith.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledgment of {{the wrongs}} {{done by the}} {{residential}} school system began in the 1980s. In 1986, at its 31st General Council, the United Church of Canada responded to the request of Indigenous peoples that it apologize to them for its part in colonization and in 1998 apologized <b>expressly</b> for the role it played in the residential school system.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{included}} Kitty Kelley, who falsely {{alleged that}} during the Second World War Elizabeth did not abide by the rationing regulations. This, however, was contradicted by the official records, and Eleanor Roosevelt during her wartime stay at Buckingham Palace reported <b>expressly</b> on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted.|$|E
5|$|Ministry of Interior {{proposed}} {{a constitutional amendment}} on 15 December 2016 aimed at providing constitutional right to acquire, possess and carry firearms. The proposed law would, if passed, add a new section to Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic, <b>expressly</b> providing {{the right to be}} armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order.|$|E
5|$|Owing to Henry Drummond's {{concerns}} in 1852 that the LNC was a front for land speculation, {{the sale of}} LNC-owned land for building had been <b>expressly</b> forbidden by the Act of Parliament establishing the LNC, and consequently much of the land not in use for burials remained undeveloped, aside from the land sold in the 1850s and 1860s, and the areas sold by Cyril Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal was <b>expressly</b> {{composed}} for {{the stage}} at Bayreuth {{and many of the}} most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage. In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth. These are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc. They also contain the only sound evidence of the bells constructed for the work's premiere, which were melted down for scrap during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations {{associated}} with the Restoration Movement had been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew between those who emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church. In contrast, the Christian Church may consider any practice not <b>expressly</b> forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Rex's mother, Phyllis Van de Kamp (Shirley Knight), {{comes to}} town for Rex's funeral. She and Bree clash heads {{throughout}} her visit, especially when Phyllis claims that Bree made Rex miserable during his last years, prompting Bree to disinvite her from the funeral. Eventually, Bree reconsiders; however, during the service, Bree discovers that Rex is being buried in his high school tie, which Phyllis insisted but Bree <b>expressly</b> forbade. Bree changes Rex's tie {{in the middle of}} the funeral.|$|E
5|$|SS Wittekind {{was built}} by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg for North German Lloyd’s Roland Line, which was a {{fortnightly}} steerage and freight service from Bremen to New York. Launched on 3 February 1894, Wittekind—named for Wittekind (c. 730–808), the Duke of Saxony—and sister-ship Willehad were the first twin-screw steamers <b>expressly</b> built for North German Lloyd. The new liner sailed on her maiden voyage to Hoboken, New Jersey on 14 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{freedoms of}} speech, {{assembly}} and association {{guaranteed by the}} Constitution are enjoyed only by Singapore citizens. In Review Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Lee Hsien Loong (2009), it was held that the appellant newspaper company {{did not have the}} requisite locus standi to rely on the constitutional right of free speech and expression as it was not a Singapore citizen, and Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution <b>expressly</b> provides that only Singapore citizens are entitled to the right.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 <b>expressly</b> banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E
5|$|However, slaves did {{belong to}} their master's household. A newly-bought slave {{was welcomed with}} nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part {{in most of the}} civic and family cults; they were <b>expressly</b> invited to join the banquet of the Choes, second day of the Anthesteria, and were allowed {{initiation}} into the Eleusinian Mysteries. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and could keep their own religious customs if any.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the New York City {{office of}} the American Civil Liberties Union, {{wrote a letter to}} Mayor de Blasio {{outlining}} their privacy concerns. In the letter, representatives for the NYCLU wrote that CityBridge could be retaining too much information about LinkNYC users. They also stated that the privacy policy was vague and needed to be clarified. They recommended that the privacy policy be rewritten so that it <b>expressly</b> mentions whether the Links' environmental sensors or cameras are being used by any NYPD or city systems.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it <b>expressly</b> refuses to decide whether the dues {{prohibition}} and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148. Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England to summon the bishops to Reims, and after that appointed three of the bishops as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was <b>expressly</b> forbidden to attend, {{but he managed to}} evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|Maryland holds {{a unique}} {{place in the}} history of {{same-sex}} marriage in the United States. In 1973, it became the first state in the nation to define marriage as a union {{between a man and a}} woman, <b>expressly</b> banning same-sex marriage. The General Assembly passed the law a short time after voters in the state ratified Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, commonly referred to as the Equal Rights Amendment, in November 1972. The constitutional provision prohibited discrimination in equality of rights on the basis of sex.|$|E
5|$|Menominee Tribe v. United States is a {{landmark}} case in Native American law, {{primarily in the}} area of reserved tribal rights. It has been used in college courses to explain tribal sovereignty rights and that tribes retain some rights even if the tribe has been terminated, as the Menominee tribe was. The decision in the case has affected subsequent legislation, such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in which Congress <b>expressly</b> extinguished all aboriginal rights. The case has been discussed internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or aboriginal title.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{democracy}} {{began in}} the 1940s {{when the number of}} elected seats in the legislature gradually increased, until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958. At present, Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of representative democracy. Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage. Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not <b>expressly</b> mentioned in the Constitution, the Government has affirmed that the right may be implied into the constitutional text.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance. Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and moral authority {{to serve as a}} check on the executive's powers. The President's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore's past reserves and the preservation of the integrity of the public service. However, the President's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers. In fact, the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law, unless the contrary is <b>expressly</b> provided for.|$|E
5|$|The Beacon-class gunvessels were a {{class of}} {{composite}} gunboats built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s. They were the first warships of the Royal Navy <b>expressly</b> designed to use the engines of an older class of ships with a different hull shape. They were generally deployed overseas to the China, East Indies, West Africa, Pacific, North America and West Indies Stations. In addition to , the ships fought pirates and suppressed the slave trade in East and West Africa. As their engines wore out in the mid-1880s, they were mostly retired and scrapped {{by the end of}} the decade. A few survived into the early 1900s as they were modified for harbour service before being sold or scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that her helmet was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the helmet, and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in the helmet were not a separate piece affixed to the helmet, <b>expressly</b> banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} the helmet, which made the helmet legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive security arrangements. The Protective Security Coordination Centre, of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian Attorney-General's Department, oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed <b>expressly</b> for the APEC meetings. In order to secure and monitor the summit, the New South Wales Police Force instituted the APEC Police Security Command. Many public roads in Sydney were closed, as leaders, officials, and personnel travelled in motorcades around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at a Senate committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost $170million.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law <b>expressly</b> preserved hunting and fishing rights. In {{the event that the}} court would decide that the hunting and fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} regarding which European settlement is the oldest in North America. As mentioned above, while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St. John's in the 16th century, they were <b>expressly</b> forbidden by the English government, {{at the urging of}} the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast. As a result, the town of St. John's was not established as a 'permanent' community until after the 1630s. With respect to the oldest surviving permanent English settlements in North America, it was preceded by Jamestown, Virginia (1607), the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids (1610), St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace (1618).|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{is divided}} into 95 {{counties}} and 38 independent cities, the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents. This general method of treating cities and counties on par with each other is unique to Virginia; only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the United States, each in a different state. Virginia limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand laws <b>expressly</b> allowed by the Virginia General Assembly under {{what is known as}} Dillon's Rule. In addition to independent cities, there are also incorporated towns which operate under their own governments, but are part of a county. Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, {{assisted}} by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after {{the introduction of a}} government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of the}} Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works <b>expressly</b> for exhibition and sale.|$|E
