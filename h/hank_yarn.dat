40|$|AbstractThere exist many {{problems}} {{in the process of}} cashmere yarn dyeing such as great difficulty in dyeing, large damage to yarn, low strength, and lack of brightness in color. Currently the technologies of <b>hank</b> <b>yarn</b> dyeing in foreign countries are very advanced, but most of them aim for <b>hank</b> <b>yarn</b> dyeing of cotton and silk with few reports on the research about hank dyeing of cashmere. In this paper, we will use reactive dyes to dye cashmere yarn, do comparative experiment on pre-treatment lotion Kierlon OL and Da ai wen, and add a smooth anti-creasing agent Primasol JET and cashmere protective agent WSM in the dyeing process and analyze their impact on the performance of cashmere <b>hank</b> <b>yarn</b> dyeing to determine a reasonable dose of accessory ingredient. This dyeing program can be applied to guide the actual production, achieving the effects of improving the performance of cashmere <b>hank</b> <b>yarn</b> dyeing and enhancing the quality of dyed yar...|$|E

In some legends it is on Saint John’s day that the moura encantada spreads figs or a <b>hank</b> of <b>yarn</b> on a large rock, in the moon light. In other variations the moura spreads the figs or the golden <b>hank</b> of <b>yarn</b> in the sun on large rocks. These legends are possibly related with the popular tradition of, in some regions, of harvesting the “figo lampo” (a type of white fig that were offered as a gift in Saint John’s day). This day marks the date of the summer solstice, its reference is perhaps reminiscent of some pagan sun-worship or spring time deity referenced as [...] "São João o verde" [...] (St.John, the green one).|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} country governments discriminate against sectors that export primary commodities. India, for example, discriminates against cotton production. Exports of cotton have been restricted by quotas, and the mill {{industry has been}} subject to such regulations as the obligation to supply <b>hank</b> <b>yarn</b> for Indian handlooms. These interventions have led to stagnating cotton yields, rent-seeking activities, manipulation of cotton statistics, and low profitability in cotton mills' offsetting the short-run benefits of inexpensive cotton in India. The author develops a numerical model to measure the impact of liberalizing cotton exports. This is the first simulation model of its type, and the first multimarket model that computes price elasticities endogenously, based on the ratios between product prices and input costs. The model distinguishes short-run from long-run effects by drawing {{on the principle that}} the cost of capital varies only in the long run. Results of the simulation under complete liberalization indicate heavy (16 percent) net losses in income in the handloom sector. The government subsidies needed to compensate for those losses amount to US$ 423 million, or about 25 percent more than current government revenue in India's cotton sector. Such costly subsidy of handlooms is undesirable not only budgetarily but also politically, because it creates new vested interests. The author proposes politically feasible programs for managing the adverse impact of liberalization on the handloom sector, including handloom conversion and involvement of mills in cotton cultivation. Governments tend to prefer an export quota to an export tax because it is easier to change a quota than a tax rate if market conditions change. But flexible controls actually facilitate rent-seeking activities. As quotas are changed more often than tax rates, more interest groups get involved in lobbying and in padding crop estimates. In other words, the political and economic problems that result from restrictions on commodity exports can be more serious than those relating to resource misallocation. It is important to consider how policy changes will affect the political power structure and the objectives of different interest groups...|$|E

A hank of wool is 560 yards long (560 yd/lb = 1.129 km/kg). In theory a pound of 62s wool could produce 34720 yards of yarn.|$|R

25|$|One {{substitute}} for a swift is to have someone else hold the hank. This has several disadvantages however, first a willing second person has to be found, and secondly unless the other person has {{had a lot of}} practice holding <b>hanks,</b> the <b>yarn</b> winds off a swift much better. Yarn tends to catch on the hands and wristwatches of the person holding the hank, and a swift has neither hand nor watch to catch the yarn.|$|R
2500|$|Swifts {{are most}} {{commonly}} used to ball a <b>hank</b> of <b>yarn.</b> An increasing percentage of yarn is sold in hank form, especially hand dyed or hand spun yarns, which necessitates balling for [...] knitters and crocheters. Swifts are also sometimes used by weavers in preparing the warp: if the yarn for the warp comes in a hank, the warp can be wound directly onto the warping board from the swift. As weaving yarns generally come on cones though, this use isn't as prevalent.|$|R

There {{are several ways}} to obtain this gold: it may be offered by the moura encantada as a reward, it can be stolen or found. Frequently the gold is inside a vase, hidden inside buried pans, or other recipients, which has raised the {{question}} that this could be related to funerary urns. When there is a pot of gold there may also be together a pot of silver and a pot of plague.|$|R
25|$|A swift {{is a tool}} used to hold a <b>hank</b> of <b>yarn</b> {{while it}} is being wound off. It has an {{adjustable}} diameter {{so that it can}} hold hanks of many sizes, and rotates around a central rod. They are generally made out of wood or metal, however other materials may also be used. In the 18th and 19th centuries, swifts were sometimes made of whale ivory and they are now sought-after antiques. Swifts are not used very much in the textile industry, but are used more by knitters and crocheters who buy their <b>yarn</b> in <b>hank</b> form. The swift allows for easy balling, without the yarn getting tangled and knotted.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of yarn dyeing. Common forms are the package form and the <b>hanks</b> form. Cotton <b>yarns</b> are mostly dyed at package form, and acrylic or wool yarn are dyed at hank form. In the {{continuous}} filament industry, polyester or polyamide yarns are always dyed at package form, while viscose rayon yarns are partly dyed at hank form because of technology.|$|R
50|$|Worsted count (or {{spinning}} count) is {{an indirect}} {{measure of the}} fineness of the fiber in a worsted wool yarn expressed {{as the number of}} 560-yard (512 m) lengths (<b>hanks)</b> of worsted <b>yarn</b> that a pound (0.45 kg) of wool yields. The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count. It has been largely replaced by direct measures.|$|R

The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count.|$|R
40|$|Conventionally, {{measuring}} {{and thus}} reproducing yarn color is mainly {{done in an}} indirect way, involving the preparation of yarns in card or even fabric forms, which consumes both time and labor. A direct yarn color measurement and reproduction method based on a multispectral imaging system would be one solution to avoid this problem. In this research, 100 % raw cotton <b>yarn</b> <b>hanks</b> dyed using several reactive colorants, being different sample sets, were measured by both a spectrophotometer in yarn card form and a multispectral imaging system innovatively in yarn form itself, for back-prediction and fore-prediction matching comparisons. Experimental {{results showed that the}} multispectral imaging system can perform closed-loop color reproduction satisfactorily by yarn form color measurements, with color difference means all within industrial tolerance. This new method is capable of shortening the yarn specimen handling time and, more importantly, giving more accurate yarn color measurements without the influence of neighboring colors, so as to give improved coloration accuracy.

The insect resist treatment of wool carpet <b>yarn</b> <b>hanks</b> with permethrin based agents in a modified centrifugal hydroextractor is described. The distribution of insect resist agent adsorbed by the rotating load is {{discussed in terms of}} the influence of the emulsification system used to disperse permethrin into the aqueous treatment liquor. Macroemulsion based systems are shown to produce an unlevel treatment {{as a result of their}} preferential adsorption at the face of the yarn load, while microemulsion based systems are shown to result in an even distribution of permethrin throughout the load. The attainable effective yarn to liquor ratio and permethrin load in the spent liquor from the proposed system are shown to compare favourably with those obtainable in conventional and alternative low volume insect resist treatment systems...|$|R

She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she'd {{wrenched}} her arm a day or two ago, and didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said [...] "Ouch!" [...] it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one.
