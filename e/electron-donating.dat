5|$|Schrock carbenes; {{in which}} carbenes are {{tethered}} to a metal and an <b>electron-donating</b> group. The reactions that such carbenes participate in {{are very different}} from those in which organic carbenes participate.|$|E
25|$|When the α-silyl carbanion {{contains}} only alkyl, hydrogen, or <b>electron-donating</b> substituents, the stereochemical {{outcome of the}} Peterson olefination can be controlled,}} because at low temperature the elimination is slow and the intermediate β-hydroxysilane can be isolated.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considerably}} more reactive than benzene in electrophilic substitution reactions, {{due to the}} <b>electron-donating</b> effects of the oxygen heteroatom. Examination of the resonance contributors shows the increased electron density of the ring, leading to increased rates of electrophilic substitution.|$|E
25|$|Like phenols, aniline {{derivatives}} {{are highly}} susceptible to electrophilic substitution reactions. Its high reactivity reflects {{that it is}} an enamine, which enhances the <b>electron-donating</b> ability of the ring. For example, reaction of aniline with sulfuric acid at 180°C produces sulfanilic acid, H2NC6H4SO3H.|$|E
25|$|The second {{substitution}} reaction (on the right) is slower {{because the}} first nitro group is deactivating. Conversely, if an activating group (<b>electron-donating)</b> was introduced (e.g., alkyl), a second substitution reaction would occur more readily than {{the first and the}} disubstituted product might accumulate to a significant extent.|$|E
25|$|SN1 {{reactions}} {{are associated with}} the racemization of the compound, as the trigonal planar carbocation may be attacked from either face. They are favored mechanism for tertiary haloalkanes, due to the stabilization of the positive charge on the carbocation by three <b>electron-donating</b> alkyl groups. They are also preferred where the substituents are sterically bulky, hindering the SN2 mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Many electrophilic substitutions on {{pyridine}} {{either do}} not proceed or proceed only partially; however, the heteroaromatic character can be activated by <b>electron-donating</b> functionalization. Common alkylations and acylations, such as Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation, usually fail for pyridine because they lead {{only to the}} addition at the nitrogen atom. Substitutions usually occur at the 3-position, {{which is the most}} electron-rich carbon atom in the ring and is, therefore, more susceptible to an electrophilic addition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electron-donating</b> (n-type) dopants {{can also}} be used to create {{conductive}} polyacetylene. n-Type dopants for polyacetylene include lithium, sodium, and potassium. As with p-type dopants, charge-transfer complexes are created, where the polymer backbone is anionic and the donor is cationic. The increase in conductivity upon treatment with an n-type dopant is not as significant as those achieved upon treatment with a p-type dopant. Polyacetylene chains doped with n-type dopants are extremely sensitive to air and moisture.|$|E
25|$|The {{wavelengths}} {{at which}} azobenzene isomerization occurs {{depends on the}} particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the aminoazobenzenes, and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic absorption spectra. The compounds similar to the unsubstituted azobenzene exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with <b>electron-donating</b> groups (such as aminos), are classified as aminoazobenzenes, and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4' positions of the two azo rings with <b>electron-donating</b> and electron-withdrawing groups (that is, the two {{opposite ends of the}} aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this push-pull configuration results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the absorption spectra of the trans and the cis isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two isomeric states.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of an alkyl halide the carbanion can also undergo nucleophilic substitution with carbon-carbon bond formation. In substituted aromatic compounds an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as a carboxylic acid, stabilizes a carbanion and the least-substituted olefin is generated. With an <b>electron-donating</b> substituent the opposite effect is obtained. The reaction produces more of the less thermodynamically stable non-conjugated 1,4-addition product than the more stable conjugated 1,3-diene because the largest orbital coefficient of the HOMO of the conjugated pentadienyl anion intermediate is on the central carbon atom. Once formed, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene is unable to equilibrate to the thermodynamically more stable product; therefore, the observed kinetic product is produced. Experimental alkali metal alternatives that are safer to handle, such as the M-SG reducing agent, also exist.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the effect}} of varying substituents on the {{catalyst}} is rarely well understood. Small substituent changes can completely change reactivity or selectivity. An example of {{this was in the}} optimization studies of a bifunctional Strecker reaction catalyst, one of the first well-studied thiourea catalysts. Specifically, varying the X substituent on the salicylaldimine substituent, it was found that typical electron-withdrawing or <b>electron-donating</b> substituents had little effect on the rate, but ester substituents such as acetate or pivaloate seemed to cause noticeable rate acceleration. This observation is difficult to rationalize given that the X group is far from the reactive center {{during the course of the}} reaction and electronics do not seem to be the cause. In general, despite the relative ease of electronic tuning with organic catalysts, chemists have not yet reached a useful understanding of these modifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrons}} {{around a}} nucleus will circulate in {{a magnetic field}} and create a secondary induced magnetic field. This field opposes the applied field as stipulated by Lenz's law and atoms with higher induced fields (i.e., higher electron density) are therefore called shielded, relative to those with lower electron density. The chemical milieu of an atom can influence its electron density through the polar effect. <b>Electron-donating</b> alkyl groups, for example, lead to increased shielding while electron-withdrawing substituents such as nitro groups lead to deshielding of the nucleus. Not only substituents cause local induced fields. Bonding electrons {{can also lead to}} shielding and deshielding effects. A striking example of this are the pi bonds in benzene. Circular current through the hyperconjugated system causes a shielding effect at the molecule's center and a deshielding effect at its edges. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.|$|E
500|$|Lead(II) nitrate is {{associated}} with interesting supramolecular chemistry because of its coordination to nitrogen and oxygen <b>electron-donating</b> compounds. The interest is largely academic, but with several potential applications. For example, combining lead nitrate and pentaethylene glycol (EO5) in a solution of acetonitrile and methanol followed by slow evaporation produces a new crystalline material [...] In the crystal structure for this compound, the EO5 chain is wrapped around the lead ion in an equatorial plane {{similar to that of}} a crown ether. The two bidentate nitrate ligands are in trans configuration. The total coordination number is 10, with the lead ion in a bicapped square antiprism molecular geometry.|$|E
500|$|The oxazolidinone pharmacophore—the {{chemical}} [...] "template" [...] {{essential for}} antimicrobial activity—consists of a 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one moiety with an aryl group at position 3 and an S-methyl group, with another substituent attached to it, at position 5 (the R-enantiomers of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties). In {{addition to this}} essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An acetamide substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used {{in all of the}} more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an acetamide group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some isosteric groups are used. A fluorine atom at the 3′ position practically doubles in vitro and in vivo activity, and the <b>electron-donating</b> nitrogen atom in the morpholine ring helps maintain high antibiotic potency and an acceptable safety profile.|$|E
5000|$|Cationic {{polymerization}} of olefin monomers {{occurs with}} olefins that contain <b>electron-donating</b> substituents. These <b>electron-donating</b> groups make the olefin nucleophilic enough to attack electrophilic initiators or growing polymer chains. At the same time, these <b>electron-donating</b> groups {{attached to the}} monomer {{must be able to}} stabilize the resulting cationic charge for further polymerization. Some reactive olefin monomers are shown below in order of decreasing reactivity, with heteroatom groups being more reactive than alkyl or aryl groups. Note, however, that the reactivity of the carbenium ion formed is the opposite of the monomer reactivity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electron-donating</b> {{groups also}} inhibit the Chichibabin {{reaction}} {{because of their}} deactivating effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electron-donating</b> substituents on the epoxide are {{stabilizing}} and electron-withdrawing substituents are destabilizing.|$|E
5000|$|The carbon centre in methyl can {{bond with}} <b>electron-donating</b> {{molecules}} by reacting: ...|$|E
50|$|Cieplak also {{demonstrated}} this effect by introducing electron withdrawing substituents on C3, which decrease the <b>electron-donating</b> {{capability of the}} ring C-C bond and therefore disfavor equatorial attack, which is antiperiplanar to this bond. <b>Electron-donating</b> substituents at C3 subsequently favor equatorial approach, since increasing C-C electron density favors σC-C donation into σ*C-Nuc and thereby encourages equatorial approach.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to other}} 4+2 cycloadditions, <b>electron-donating</b> substituents on the dienophile and electron-withdrawing substituents on the diene {{accelerate}} the inverse-demand diels-alder. The diene, the tetrazine, {{by virtue of}} having the additional nitrogens, is a good diene for this reaction. The dienophile, the activated alkene, can often be attached to <b>electron-donating</b> alkyl groups on target molecules, thus making the dienophile more suitable for the reaction.|$|E
5000|$|The captodative {{effect is}} the {{stabilization}} of radicals by a synergistic effect of an electron-withdrawing substituent and an <b>electron-donating</b> substituent. The name originates as the electron-withdrawing group (EWG) {{is sometimes called}} the [...] "captor" [...] group, whilst the <b>electron-donating</b> group (EDG) is the [...] "dative" [...] substituent. Olefins with this substituent pattern are sometime described as captodative. Radical reactions play an integral role in several chemical reactions and are also important {{to the field of}} polymer science.|$|E
5000|$|Substitution of phenyl hydrogens with <b>electron-donating</b> groups ortho or para to the {{carbonyl}} group increases electron density at the migrating carbon, promotes 1,2-aryl migration, and accelerates oxidation. Substitution with <b>electron-donating</b> groups meta to the {{carbonyl group}} {{does not change}} electron density at the migrating carbon; because unsubstituted phenyl group migratory aptitude is low, hydrogen migration dominates. Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups ortho or para to the carbonyl decreases electron density at the migrating carbon (13c), inhibits 1,2-aryl migration, and favors hydrogen migration.|$|E
50|$|Benzynes undergo 2+2 cycloaddition with a {{wide range}} of olefins. Due to electrophilic nature of benzyne, olefins bearing <b>electron-donating</b> substituents work best for this reaction.|$|E
5000|$|After {{discovering}} that burimamide is largely inactive at physiological pH, {{due to the}} presence of its <b>electron-donating</b> side chain, the following steps were undertaken to stabilize burimamide: ...|$|E
50|$|Schrock carbenes; {{in which}} carbenes are {{tethered}} to a metal and an <b>electron-donating</b> group. The reactions that such carbenes participate in {{are very different}} from those in which organic carbenes participate.|$|E
5000|$|Aromatic azo {{compounds}} can be synthesized by azo coupling, which entails an electrophilic substitution reaction {{where an}} aryl diazonium cation is attacked by another aryl ring, especially those substituted with <b>electron-donating</b> groups: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{intermediate}} enamines are electronically {{related to}} push-pull olefins, having an electron-withdrawing nitro group conjugated to an <b>electron-donating</b> group. The extended conjugation means that these compounds are usually an intense red colour.|$|E
50|$|Schrock carbenes, {{in which}} the carbene is bonded to a metal that bears an <b>electron-donating</b> group. In such cases the carbenoid carbon is {{nucleophilic}} and resembles Wittig reagent (which are not considered carbene derivatives).|$|E
50|$|Ketones and {{aldehydes}} with electron-withdrawing substituents react {{more readily}} with diazoalkanes than those bearing <b>electron-donating</b> substituents (Table 2). In addition to accelerating the reaction, electron-withdrawing substituents typically {{increase the amount}} of epoxide produced (Table 2).|$|E
50|$|PPV is {{also used}} as an <b>electron-donating</b> {{material}} in organic solar cells. Although PPV-based devices suffer from poor absorption and photodegradation, PPV and PPV derivatives (especially MEH-PPV and MDMO-PPV) find frequent application in research cells.|$|E
50|$|When the α-silyl carbanion {{contains}} only alkyl, hydrogen, or <b>electron-donating</b> substituents, the stereochemical {{outcome of the}} Peterson olefination can be controlled, because at low temperature the elimination is slow and the intermediate β-hydroxysilane can be isolated.|$|E
50|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the reactions}} are slow with second order rate constants around 0.0020 M−1•s−1. Attempts to increase nucleophilic attack rates by adding <b>electron-donating</b> groups to the phosphines improved kinetics, but also increased {{the rate of}} air oxidation.|$|E
5000|$|Apart from vinyl boronic acids, aryl boronic {{acids and}} other heterocyclic {{derivatives}} {{can also be}} used in Petasis multicomponent coupling. Possible substrate scope includes thienyl, pyridyl, furyl, and benzofuranyl, 1-naphthyl, and aryl groups with either <b>electron-donating</b> or electron-withdrawing substituent.|$|E
50|$|In {{coordination}} chemistry carboranes {{can be used}} as unique bulky ligand scaffolds. It was recently demonstrated that the same carboranyl moiety can act either as strongly electron-withdrawing or <b>electron-donating</b> substituent, depending on the positional attachment of the cluster to the heteroatom.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{considerably}} more reactive than benzene in electrophilic substitution reactions, {{due to the}} <b>electron-donating</b> effects of the oxygen heteroatom.
