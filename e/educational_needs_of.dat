It helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking. In the mid 19th century, the historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> youth from the urban and commercial classes, as well as the upper class.

40|$|In {{a context}} of mass {{displacement}} and flows of asylum-seeking and refugee peoples across national borders, the need to respond and attend {{to the education of}} asylum-seeking and refugee children is urgent and pressing, though it is not without its challenges. This literature review focuses on the educational experiences of asylum seeking and refugee children, including those who are unaccompanied, with a particular focus on inclusion. It seeks to respond to the following three interconnected questions: 1. What does current educational literature tell us about the <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> and experiences <b>of</b> asylumseeking and refugee children as they relate to inclusion? 2. What does current educational literature tell us about the <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> and experiences <b>of</b> unaccompanied asylum-seeking and refugee children as they relate to inclusion? 3. What implications and recommendations can be drawn from existing literature? The review has a particular interest in the <b>needs</b> and experiences <b>of</b> unaccompanied asylum-seeking and refugee children, but recognises that though there is a developing literature specifically on unaccompanied asylum seeking and refugee children (see, for example, Stanley, 2001; Derluyn and Broekaert, 2008; Pastoor, 2015) such needs must be understood and positioned in relation to the wider <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> and experiences <b>of</b> asylum seeking and refugee children more generally. While other literature reviews on asylum-seeking and refugee children are available (see, for example, Hek, 2005; McBrien, 2005), the present review adds to existing work by: • including an explicit focus on the <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> and experiences <b>of</b> asylum-seeking and refugee children who are unaccompanied; • providing an up-to-date review of literature which analyses and reports the <b>educational</b> <b>needs</b> and experiences <b>of</b> asylum-seeking and refugee children. The review focuses in particular on post-migration experiences within school settings as they relate to asylum seeking and refugee children’s social inclusion...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to identify, which {{features}} of the pedagogical context in practical dance classes could be viewed as the basis for developing a suitable web-based ICT application.

Results showed there were similar patterns in applying reflection in terms of content, methods and frequency in choreography and technique classes. Reflection can therefore be considered as a widespread <b>educational</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> practical dance classes and used as the pedagogical basis for developing a suitable ICT tool for this type of education...|$|R
