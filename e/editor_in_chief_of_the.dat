2500|$|Jason Thompson was a manga {{editor for}} Viz Media in 2000 {{when he first}} began wanting to craft a manga encyclopedia. At the time, there was little {{interest}} in publishing it, so Thompson remained at Viz. [...] Thompson became the first <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's newly launched Shonen Jump manga anthology. The magazine was highly successful, but Thompson wanted {{to work on his}} own projects and stepped down after six issues when Viz declined his request to switch to part-time work. In 2005, Del Rey approached Thompson about his idea for a manga encyclopedia, reviving the project. It took two years to compile the book, and Thompson resigned from Viz to do so. The main difference between Thompson's original concept and the published version is that he originally intended the work to be organized by artist rather than title, and wanted to place more emphasis on manga's relationship to the more popular anime medium.|$|E
