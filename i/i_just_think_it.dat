5000|$|The reason I {{originally}} {{wrote it}} is obviously because I was bitter. The demos were almost all thematically interchangeable with one another.

When people call those demos an album, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a little ridiculous, because if I was to release that, I would be ashamed of myself. There is nothing to it - it's just one subject. I went through something with a girl, and like most immature artist people, you write about it and complain a lot...And that is why I didn't want anyone to hear those (songs from the demo)...I think I did what any writer does - they include themselves in their work to an extent as much as they can, since that is your only real link to humanity - what you experience.

[...] She detailed {{on the importance of}} the track by adding, [...] "Looking at the bigger picture, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was important for me to have my own voice - to show growth, to show that I can carry my own song." [...] While promoting the single, Azalea later elaborated in an interview the struggles she had faced in her life and career while working on the project. The song also symbolizes Azalea's comeback to music, claiming she had redefined her focus and relating its message to her life, [...] "That was always a criticism I had.

We did. We were as much of a music participant as anyone else. Most of the electronic music became more dance oriented, and techno and house industrial went towards that direction, and then more alternative music went back to a really traditional sort of almost rock or post-punk sort of vein. It felt like the synth pop songs that we were doing didn't feel like they had a place at that moment, in a strange way, even for us. You could feel the tide change. We could've continued going on if we wanted to, we just basically felt we had sort of done our thing at that point." ...|$|E

So hopefully God willing in the future when I’ve come to her age I will have earned that, but I don’t feel I have yet."

30|$|As {{indicated}} by Table  6, among the 24 PTs (one response missing), 11 of them (45.7  %) {{stated that they}} did not have any confusion, which was consistent with the results of the posttest I (mid-term). Four of them (16.7  %) suggested the need for further practice. Six PTs (25  %) admitted that they were uncertain about how to generate a number sentence that may refer back to the story situation, and three PTs (12.5  %) expressed frustration about the intended approach and refused to change their existing conceptions. For example, one PT stated, “I don’t understand why you have to know exactly what object it refers to. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would confuse kids if it confuses me and I would never teach this way” (see Table  6). After continuous instruction, PTs’ responses in prompt 2 uniformly suggested their improved understanding and more positive views. In particular, those PTs who initially had refused to change clearly acknowledged the role of word problem contexts, especially the role of diagrams in developing children’s understanding of fundamental mathematical ideas. For instance, one PT stated, “If you draw the word problem out it is much easier for students to understand the concept. The associative property is much easier to understand where you first draw out the picture.” Another PT wrote, “I’ve learned to first draw a picture to help them see the groups because some word problems can be tricky…. I think a picture also let them see how the two problems are equivalent and see the associative property of multiplication as more concrete.” In summary, PTs’ responses to the three diagnostic tests, along with their voice in the two prompts revealed progress with their remaining difficulties. The next section reports how the methods course instruction played a role in PTs’ learning.|$|E

In a 2011 {{interview with}} Cambridge-based webzine The Tab, he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, [...] "Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and we are a much heavier band, both live and on record.
