5|$|A late {{piece of}} Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, {{was an early}} example of a studio premiere: its first {{performance}} was in the Abbey Road studios. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books.|$|E
5|$|All Islanders were {{required}} to work 30 hours each week, and up until the 1960s no wages were paid <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work.</b> The catalyst for the strike was the attempted deportation of Indigenous inmate Albie Geia who committed the offence of disobeying the European overseer. The strike continued for five days and was broken with dawn raids to remove the families involved by boat to the mainland.|$|E

5|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be {{upgraded to}} a controlled-access highway by removing all existing at-grade intersections {{and improving the}} highway to 400-series standards. Planning <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> initially {{began in the early}} 1990s with the EA for the section north of the Speed River, which resulted {{in the construction of the}} Wellington Street interchange. The EA for the section south of the Speed River began in early 2007. The Laird Road interchange and associated closing of the Clair Road intersection were the first projects completed as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|At {{the rank}} of commander, Callaghan captained the {{destroyer}} USS Reuben James from June 1936 to March 1938, and subsequently joined {{the staff of the}} Chief of Naval Operations in 1939. Before the US entered World War II, he was stationed in London in a logistical role.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, retroviruses and reverse {{transcriptase}} were discovered, showing {{for the first}} time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco and Howard Temin were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} to several offices within the Buenos Aires Cabildo in the 1781-1794 period. On April 7, 1789, he helped a number of shoemakers to establish a guild. Although there were several in Spain, no guild constitution from Spain {{was used as a}} model. He promoted the pavement of the streets, and the improvement of the buildings. Supported by the viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo, he collected $8,000 and provided 500 cattle to mine rocks from the Martín García Island <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work.</b> He married his cousin Justa Rufina de Basavilbaso y Garfias on February 6, 1795.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Smallpeice began to work with Sir Edward Fielden, Captain of the Queen's Flight on {{arrangements}} to fly Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh {{and other members of}} the Royal Family overseas on BOAC aircraft. Smallpeice, who generally took personal responsibility for the organisation of these flights, was recognised <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> in 1961 when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of {{presence of a}} neutralizing substance in the blood that could counter infections came when Emil von Behring along with Kitasato Shibasaburō in 1890 developed effective serum against diphtheria. This they did by transferring serum produced from animals immunized against diphtheria to animals suffering from it. Transferring the serum thus could cure the infected animals. Behring was awarded the Nobel Prize <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> in 1901.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 10, 1910. The film was advertised in the June 11, 1910 edition of Billboard magazine. The film was advertised as late as 1911 in one Indiana theater and as far late as 1913 in a Texas theater. It is unknown if published reviews <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> exist, {{but there is an}} absence of a citation Bowers or the American Film Institute catalogs. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. His {{interest}} in mass spectroscopy led naturally to {{an interest in}} the relative abundance of isotopes. The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help. There was little interest in their work because research was being carried out elsewhere. In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by Edwin McMillan for use by the U. S. Army. It was packed up and carted off to Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Burnet was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E

5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> Day, known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François Guyot, a French type-founder known to have worked for Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first printed books ever to do so. In the same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E
5|$|He {{was awarded}} the Beit Memorial Fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator {{position}} and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be viruses. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> he received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1928 {{under the direction of}} Professor J. D. Ledingham and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the Medical Research Council's System of Bacteriology. He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the Royal Society of Medicine in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the Fabian Society functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur archaeology and cycling through continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{ownership}} {{was widespread}} by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords {{were involved in}} the harrowing of land for arable crops in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>work.</b> Horses and carts were increasingly used for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport such items in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all their farm work. The necessity for carting produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as an enterprise continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.|$|E
