40|$|Due to new {{building}} regulations in 1992 requirements for airborne sound insulation between dwellings have increased by 2 to 3 dB.

For a cavity wall this includes a cavity which ends 0. 5 m below floor level. This specific junction detail is not accepted by building constructors. They apply different ones with flexible layers between floor and foundation. The acoustical characteristics of these variant details often are not known. Therefore a laboratory test has been carried out to determine the junction transmission index of variants of the junction floor/foundation/cavity wall.

40|$|The {{measurement}} and prediction of radiation efficiency {{is important in}} many areas of acoustics. It has recently become an even more important topic, because the radiation efficiency needs to be known in order to predict the <b>flanking</b> sound <b>transmission</b> using EN 12354 when the frequency is below the critical frequency of {{one or more of the}} walls involved in the <b>flanking</b> sound <b>transmission</b> path. This prediction is more difficult for lightweight walls because they usually consist of a complex construction. This paper uses Maidanik 2 ̆ 019 s and Leppington 2 ̆ 019 s approximate formulae to predict the resonant radiation efficiency of a finite size panel and Davy 2 ̆ 019 s approximate formulae to predict the forced radiation efficiency when a finite size panel is excited by a diffuse sound field. The radiation efficiency of an infinite size panel excited by a point or line force is predicted using Heckl 2 ̆ 019 s approximate formulae. The damping loss factor of the panel is needed in order to calculate the magnitude of the resonant vibration of the panel relative to the point or line near field vibration of the panel or relative to the vibration of the panel forced by an incident diffuse sound field on one side of the panel. The theories used in this paper assume that the finite size panel is mounted in an infinite baffle and the predictions are for the power radiated on one side of the panel. This paper compares the theoretical predictions of radiation efficiency with experimental measurements made in sound insulation laboratories. The surface velocities of the panels were measured with a laser velocimeter or accelerometers. The sound power radiated on one side of the panel was determined using sound intensity measurements or reverberation room measurements of sound power that utilised sound pressure measurements and reverberation time measurements.

40|$|<b>Flanking</b> <b>transmission</b> {{exists in}} all buildings. The {{importance}} of <b>flanking</b> <b>transmission,</b> {{in determining the}} apparent sound insulation experienced by occupants of multi-family dwellings, is established {{by the quality of}} the acoustical design. This paper examines the hierarchy of airborne flanking paths that might be expected in lightweight wood framed row or terraced construction. From this review of flanking paths in constructions without acoustical treatments, it is evident that the apparent sound insulation is determined by {{a relatively small number of}} paths. The hierarchy of paths can be described in two conceptual levels. The first and highest level is that of the sum of paths involving a particular junction. (There are typically four flanking junctions 2 ̆ 013 one for each edge of the nominally separating wall or floor assembly.) The second is a lower level where individual paths are examined. With knowledge of the hierarchy, and hence the dominant path(s), it is possible to develop design strategies for attaining the desired level of airborne sound insulation. With additional information on the cost of various treatments design trade-offs can be evaluated which can lead to multi-family dwellings with high sound insulation that do not have increased cost.

Decoupled radiation isolated walls is another. There are though no working studies or mathematical models of the performance of these isolators. They are only treated as simple mass-springs systems that operate vertically. In this paper there is a first approach of an analysis of the structure borne sound isolating performance of elastomer isolators that are separating floors and walls. The performance dependence of structure type is also presented. An empirically based regression model of the insertion loss is derived. The model will be based on measurements of more than ten field installations. In this paper the first three are presented.

In this paper, an approximate analysis is presented for the case of a lined sheet metal duct located in a reverberant sound field. A Rayleigh-Ritz procedure is used to model the structural/acoustic modes propagating in the duct.

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of direct and indirect (<b>flanking)</b> sound <b>transmissions</b> is presented. It {{can be applied to}} geometries with extrusion symmetry. The structures are modelled with spectral finite elements. The acoustic domains are described by means of a modal expansion of the pressure field and must be cuboid-shaped. These reasonable simplifications in the geometry allow the use of more efficient numerical methods. Consequently the coupled vibroacoustic problem in structures such as junctions is efficiently solved. The vibration reduction index of T-junctions with acoustic excitation and with point force excitation is compared. The differences due to the excitation type obey quite general trends that could be taken into account by prediction formulas. However, they are smaller than other uncertainties not considered in practice. The model is also used to check if the sound transmissions of a fully vibroacoustic problem involving several flanking paths can be reproduced by superposition of independent paths. There exist some differences caused by the interaction between paths, which are more important at low frequencies. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

In this case, the floor treatment affects direct and all <b>flanking</b> sound <b>transmission</b> paths the same, for all path directions. A globally reacting floor treatment affects sound transmission in different paths differently, since it alters both the power injected, and the path itself.

The rebuild variations are sometimes in the same order of magnitude as the differences between different tested gear pairs, indicating that other factors besides the gears affect gear noise.
