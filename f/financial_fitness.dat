50|$|Low {{participation}} rates by employees could significantly limit {{the potential benefits}} of participating in workplace wellness programs, as could systematic differences between participants and non-participants. Research performed by Gallup indicated that out of the 60% of employees who were aware of their company offered a wellness program only 40% participated. A 2008 study from the University of Minnesota provided insight into the likelihood of employee participation in an exercise promotion program. Their findings illustrate barriers to program participation that may be applicable to other types of programs and workplace settings. Employees were offered a financial incentive to attend a designated set of fitness facilities at least 8 times per month during the study period, and researchers administered a survey to over 3,000 program participants and non-participants to better understand their decision to participate. The research team included survey questions to assess each employee's attitudes and practices related to fitness prior to the program being offered, their marginal utility related to the financial incentive offered, the marginal cost of exercising (based on the cost of time and the <b>financial</b> cost of <b>fitness</b> center membership), prior history of chronic disease, and demographic characteristics related to age, gender, race and ethnicity, income, and employment type within the university system. Based on these survey responses, researchers reported the marginal effects related to the probability of 1) signing up for the program and 2) meeting program participation criteria by exercising 8 times per month to receive the financial incentive.|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>fitness</b> {{education}} is a critical piece of community development, given today's socioeconomic climate consisting of the deregulation of government institutions and the increasing complexity of financial services. These changes are occurring when personal savings are low and bankruptcy rates are high, with 1. 35 million filings in 1997. [1] Twelve million households, one-half of which receive public assistance, do not have bank accounts. [2] Subsequently, in an ever more difficult financial system through which to navigate, there remains {{a significant number of}} novice consumers, who would benefit greatly from <b>financial</b> <b>fitness</b> education. The financial system is not only complex but also laden with institutional barriers and potential pitfalls. Over the years, access to legitimate financial institutions and credit in low-income neighborhoods has become increasingly limited, whereby local bank branches have been replaced by expensive fringe banking outlets, such as check-cashing stores, payday loan outlets and pawnshops. Moreover, some residents face cultural or language barriers that prevent them from fully accessing appropriate financial services. Other dangers include consumer scams and schemes, as well as predatory lending practices [...] high-cost loans targeted to people who cannot afford to repay them. <b>Financial</b> <b>fitness</b> education can help families become more aware of common pitfalls and thus avoid them while helping them to learn the financial management and planning skills needed {{to make the most of}} their income, savings and assets. Such {{education is}} vital for low- and moderate-income families who are fulfilling basic needs currently but are precariously positioned to overestimate the reach of their income, with little or no savings as a cushion. Recent changes in the national economy and public policy have led to a rise in the number of organizations developing and delivering <b>financial</b> <b>fitness</b> education. Approximately 20 formal curricula are in circulation around the country, being used by Cooperative Extension and education organizations; government agencies; consumer, nonprofit and community organizations; as well as private financial institutions and credit agencies. These organizations often share the objective of helping people to choose and use financial services successfully. Developing an effective <b>financial</b> <b>fitness</b> education program that will help local constituents move beyond fulfilling basic needs to accumulating savings [...] and even assets [...] while avoiding all of the perils along the way requires careful planning. Since each community has a unique target population, goals and resources, there cannot be a "one size fits all" program. Rather, an organization needs to develop a program that matches its goals along with the needs of the target population. This start-up guide is designed to help NeighborWorks organizations analyze the local need and their internal capacity for developing a <b>financial</b> <b>fitness</b> education program to increase consumers' money management skills, and in turn, to enable previously underserved markets to attain homeownership...|$|E

Respondents wanted to know "how they were doing " based on personal factors, such as their income and age, or in relation to other people with similar demographic characteristics. MONEY 2000 ™ was a five-year program, developed by the Cooperative Extension System of the U. S.
