500|$|No {{account or}} allusion to Philip's presumed {{conversion}} to Christianity survives. The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd, who argues {{in favor of}} Philip's Christianity in Rome and the Arabs, assumes {{that he had been}} a Christian before becoming emperor. He argues, therefore, that {{there is no need to}} explain the absence of evidence for Philip's conversion in contemporary Christian literature. Trachonitis, equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south, and sited on a road connecting the two, could have been Christianized from either direction. Even if he was not himself Christian, Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements. Hans Pohlsander, a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip's Christianity, allows that Philip [...] "may have been curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth. As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian, he may not have been so intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> on other religions." [...] He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip's childhood. For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley, however, the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited.|$|E

[...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind.</b> Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position.

40|$|Este estudo investigou possíveis relações entre as concepções sobre a natureza da ciência, de professores de Física, e suas práticas docentes, por meio de uma análise cruzada de três estudos de caso do tipo etnográfico. A observação etnográfica deu-se por imersão nas aulas de Física de três professores de Ensino Médio atuando em diferentes tipos de escolas: particular, pública e militar. Os resultados do cruzamento indicaram: que as práticas didáticas observadas não incluem aspectos sobre a natureza da ciência; que a Epistemologia e a História da Física ainda não se fazem presentes de forma explícita nas aulas de Física do Ensino Médio; que as relações entre as visões epistemológicas dos professores e suas práticas são frágeis e se manifestam de forma implícita. No entanto, foi possível vislumbrar algumas diferenças nas práticas daqueles professores que têm uma visão epistemológica mais contemporânea, pois tendem a manter um espírito mais aberto à inovação didática. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} possible relationships between the conceptions about the nature of science held by physics teachers and their classroom practices through a cross analysis of three ethnographical case studies. The ethnographical observation was carried out through immersion in the physics classes of three high school teachers acting in different types of schools: private, public and military. The findings indicated that the observed didactic practices do not include any aspects of the nature of science, and that Epistemology and History of Physics are not yet present in high school physics classes. This study suggests that the relationship between the epistemological views of teachers and their practices are fragile and are manifested implicitly. Nevertheless, it was possible to observe some differences in the practices of those teachers who have a more contemporary epistemological view, and who tend to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> more <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> to didactic innovation...|$|R

Picard invites Barclay to a bridge meeting to review the investigation, but slips up and accidentally calls him [...] "Broccoli", a nickname {{given to him by}} the crew. Barclay later returns to the holodeck to seek refuge in the simulated version of the bridge members. In talking to LaForge, Guinan suggests that Barclay is simply imaginative and that LaForge <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> more <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> towards him. On her advice, LaForge visits Barclay on the holodeck and discovers the exaggerated simulation of the bridge crew. LaForge suggests Barclay get counseling from Troi, whose counterpart on the holodeck displays clear signs of sexual attraction towards Barclay. Barclay attempts to undergo a real counseling session with Troi, but freaks out when she tries to relax him with the appearance of actions his holodeck version of her would do, and ends the counseling session to flee back to the holodeck. When Barclay cannot be located to attend a briefing with Riker, Riker storms into the holodeck with LaForge and Troi to locate him. They find comical versions of the senior staff, with bumbling versions of Picard and LaForge, a slothful idiot version of Wesley, and an extremely short, comical version of Riker. Riker attempts to stop the program in anger, but Troi stops him saying it might traumatize Barclay and exploring this world can help them understand Barclay better. However, when they come across the sexed up version of her, it's her turn to want to immediately stop the program, but Riker stops her, sarcastically throwing her own words in her face.
