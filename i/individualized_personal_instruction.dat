40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{efficiency}} of three 6 -week <b>individualized</b> <b>personal</b> training programs for three adult brothers who have autism. Using a single subject design, physical activity levels, basic fitness measures, and interviews were used to construct three individualized training programs to fit the subjects needs. Findings from this study can guide professionals in the adapted physical activity field who work with adults who have autism. <b>Individualized</b> <b>personal</b> training programs may provide an avenue for treatment or behavior modification for adults with autism. In conclusion, the benefits of <b>individualized</b> <b>personal</b> training programs for adults with autism are not well established. However, the results of this study indicated that providing adults with autism with an individualized training program can be beneficial for the individual in more ways than one way. All three subjects saw improvements upon starting the program...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{some debate}} about the {{intention}} of Papias' last sentence in the above quotation, [...] "For I {{did not think that}} information from the books would profit me as much as information from a living and surviving voice." [...] One side of the debate holds, with the longstanding opinion of 20th-century scholarship, that in Papias' day written statements were held at a lower value than oral statements. [...] The other side observes that [...] "living voice" [...] was a topos, an established phrase referring to <b>personal</b> <b>instruction</b> and apprenticeship, and thus Papias indicates his preference for <b>personal</b> <b>instruction</b> over isolated book learning.|$|R

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{improper}} technique with metered-dose inhalers decreases {{the efficacy of the}} bronchodilators being administered. There is evidently a need for patients to watch a demonstration. Twenty-nine adult asthmatic patients from an allergy clinic were divided into three groups, each receiving a different form of instruction: an information sheet, <b>personal</b> <b>instruction</b> or a videotape presentation. Subsequently each patient was tested for correct use of the inhaler. There was no difference in mean scores for inhalation technique between the groups instructed in person and by videotape, but both were significantly better than the mean score of the group given only an information sheet. There was also no significant change in the scores at a follow-up test in the groups who saw the technique demonstrated. These results indicate the need for and value of the demonstration of proper technique with pressurized inhalers. A pharmacy-generated education system using videotape equipment or <b>personal</b> <b>instruction</b> by a pharmacist could readily solve the problem...|$|R

40|$|Study Design: A {{prospective}} unblinded randomized clinical trial. Objectives: To {{compare the}} effectiveness of 2 types of home program <b>instruction,</b> videotape versus <b>personal</b> <b>instruction</b> by a physical therapist, on subjective outcomes and exercise compliance following arthroscopic repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Background: Advances in orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation have placed increased emphasis on home exercise programs. Therefore, assessing {{the effectiveness of}} different methods of home program instruction is important. Methods and Measures: Patients who consented to undergo surgical repair {{were randomly assigned to}} either a videotape or <b>personal</b> <b>instruction</b> group. A self-reported compliance log categorized subjects as fully compliant, partially compliant, or noncompliant. The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index and the University of Pennsylvania Shoulder Scale scores were obtained from subjects preoperatively and at 12, 24, and 52 weeks postoperatively. The null hypotheses that neither group would have better outcomes as measured by 2 shoulder outcome scales at any level of compliance over 4 levels of time, were assessed by 2 separate 2 × 3 × 4 multiple analyses of variances (MANOVAs), 1 for each outcome measure (= 0. 025) ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined and compared Australian and Chinese teachers' <b>personal</b> efficacy in <b>instruction,</b> discipline, guidance {{and beliefs about}} external influences.

Results of multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses indicated highly comparable factorial structures of teacher efficacy for the two groups, although personal guidance efficacy was more differentiated from <b>personal</b> <b>instruction</b> and discipline efficacy among Australian teachers.
