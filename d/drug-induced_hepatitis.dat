25|$|In this pattern, {{hepatocellular}} necrosis {{is associated with}} infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of <b>drug-induced</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis {{is very similar to}} autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically, and histologically.|$|E
25|$|Fever during {{treatment}} can {{be due to}} a number of causes. It can occur as a natural effect of tuberculosis (in which case it should resolve within three weeks of starting treatment). Fever can be a result of drug resistance (but in that case the organism must be resistant to two or more of the drugs). Fever may {{be due to a}} superadded infection or additional diagnosis (patients with TB are not exempt from getting influenza and other illnesses during the course of treatment). In a few patients, the fever is due to drug allergy. The clinician must also consider the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is wrong. If the patient has been on treatment for more than two weeks and if the fever had initially settled and then come back, it is reasonable to stop all TB medication for 72 hours. If the fever persists despite stopping all TB medication, then the fever is not due to the drugs. If the fever disappears off treatment, then the drugs need to be tested individually to determine the cause. The same scheme as is used for test dosing for <b>drug-induced</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (described below) may be used. The drug most frequently implicated as causing a drug fever is RMP: details are given in the entry on rifampicin.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a 51 -year-old man with recently diagnosed ulcerative colitis who developed fever and elevated liver enzymes as well as cholestasis a few weeks after starting treatment with mesalazine. As no obvious cause was found and fever persisted, liver biopsy was performed and revealed granulomatous hepatitis. The patient recovered completely after cessation of mesalazine, so that a <b>drug-induced</b> granulomatous <b>hepatitis</b> after exclusion of other differential diagnoses in an extensive work up was assumed. The present case demonstrates that even though drug-induced liver injury due to mesalazine is rare, it should be considered in unclear cases and lead to prompt discontinuation of mesalazine...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Nimesulide is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug with a semiselective preferential {{inhibition of}} cyclooxygenase- 2. We present a 57 year-old patient with jaundice and increased serum aminotransferases levels, who had been treated with nimesulide for the previous 10 days. Laboratory examinations excluded other causes of acute liver injury. Liver biopsy revealed lesions compatible with drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Bilirubin and liver enzymes returned to normal within three months of nimesulide disccutinuation. In conclusion, use of nimesulide should be included among the causes of acute hepatitis. An established drugassociated hepatotoxicity {{will result in the}} immediate withdrawal of the drug in case of liver injury and the avoidance of its future use in certain individuals.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical types and features of chronicity of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). MethodsThe {{patients who were}} diagnosed with DILI in Beijing You′An Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2011 to December 2013 were screened, and a retrospective analysis was performed for 84 patients with chronic DILI. The case report form was filled out for each patient, and the data were entered into a database, including demographic features, underlying diseases, types of drugs, cardinal symptoms and signs, and laboratory examinations. ResultsOf all patients, 63 (75. 0 %) were female. The chronicity of DILI could be divided into six clinical types according to disease progression and recovery of liver function; of all patients, 64 (76. 2 %) had a recurrent type, 4 (4. 8 %) had a delayed recovery type, 4 (4. 8 %) had a recurrent fluctuation type, 6 (7. 1 %) had a chronic cholestasis type, 5 (6. 0 %) had a type of rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, and 1 (1. 2 %) had a type of <b>drug-induced</b> autoimmune <b>hepatitis.</b> Among all the 84 patients, 56 (66. 7 %) had underlying diseases; 51 (60. 7 %) had DILI induced by a single drug, mainly traditional Chinese medicine (47. 0 %), antipyretics and analgesics (10. 6 %), and antitubercular agents (9. 1 %); as {{for the type of}} liver injury, 52 (61. 9 %) had hepatocyte injury, 8 (9. 5 %) had cholestasis, and 5 (6. 0 %) had a mixed type. Liver biochemistries showed abnormal results in 19 patients (22. 6 %). ConclusionThe chronicity of DILI can be divided into six clinical types, of which the most common type is the recurrent type, and the other clinical types include delayed recovery type, recurrent fluctuation type, chronic cholestasis type, rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, and <b>drug-induced</b> autoimmune <b>hepatitis...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe authors {{describe}} {{a case of}} <b>drug-induced</b> cytolytic <b>hepatitis</b> probably secondary to hypersensitivity to allopurinol which was prescribed incorrectly for secondary hyperuricaemia during treatment with pyrazinamide. The diagnosis was reviewed {{in view of the}} late occurrence of hepatitis in relation to the onset of the antituberculous treatment, the absence of a viral aetiology and the presence of clinical manifestations, biological and histological features which were compatible with hypersensitivity to allopurinol. The authors recalled that the type of uricaemia induced by pyrazinamide is most often asymptomatic and does not require any treatment with uric acid lowering drugs. Cessation of pyrazinamide is justified in cases of symptomatic hyperuricaemia but when the indications for pyrazinamide are imperative, treatment with an eliminator of uric acid is indicated. Allopurinol is contra-indicated in association with pyrazinamide on account of its inhibitory reaction to xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase decreases the level pyrazinoic acid, a metabolite of pyrazinamide, which is responsible for the inhibition of the tubular secretion of uric acid...|$|R

40|$|Part of the {{bile acid}} {{synthesis}} {{takes place in}} peroxisomes. An altered enterohepatic circulation of bile acids might influence peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes and peroxisomal morphology.

Peroxisomes were identified using catalase cytochemistry. They were regularly shaped and showed individual differences in electron density. A perinuclear distribution was observed in a variable number of hepatocytes in each sample. Morphometric analysis of peroxisomes revealed an increase in numerical density and surface density in all, and a decreased mean diameter in four liver samples. Based on previously obtained data in experimental animals, we hypothesize that the observed alterations in peroxisomal morphology indicate an enhanced metabolic activity of the enzymes in the peroxisomal matrix.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} is a necroinflammatory {{disorder of}} unknown etiology {{characterized by the}} presence of circulating antibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and response to immunosuppression. It has the histological features of chronic hepatitis. The onset is usually insidious, but in some patients the presentation may be acute and occasionally severe. Certain drugs can induce chronic hepatitis mimicking autoimmune hepatitis. Different autoantibodies have been associated with this process but they are not detectable after drug withdrawal and clinical resolution. Case presentation We describe a case of <b>drug-induced</b> acute <b>hepatitis</b> associated with antinuclear, antisoluble liver-pancreas and anti-smooth muscle autoantibodies in a 66 -year-old woman. Abnormal clinical and biochemical parameters resolved after drug withdrawal, but six months later anti-soluble liver-pancreas antibodies remained positive and liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis and septal fibrosis. Furthermore, our patient has a HLA genotype associated with autoimmune hepatitis. Conclusion Patient follow-up will disclose whether our patient suffers from an autoimmune disease and if the presence of anti-soluble liver antigens could precede the development of an autoimmune hepatitis, as the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies can precede primary biliary cirrhosis. </p...|$|R
25|$|Fulminant hepatitis, or massive hepatic cell death, is a {{rare and}} {{life-threatening}} complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to <b>drug-induced</b> and autoimmune <b>hepatitis.</b> The complication more frequently occurs in instances of hepatitis B and D co-infection {{at a rate of}} 2–20% and in pregnant women with hepatitis E at rate of 15–20% of cases. In addition to the signs of acute hepatitis, people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and encephalopathy (confusion, disorientation, and sleepiness). Mortality due to fulminant hepatitis is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure.|$|R

40|$|Yoshio Aizawa, Atsushi Hokari Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University Katsushika Medical Center, Katsushika-ku, Tokyo, Japan Abstract: Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} (AIH) is {{a chronic}} progressive liver disease characterized by {{high levels of}} aminotransferases and autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and interface hepatitis. AIH affects all races and all ages worldwide, regardless of sex, although a preponderance of females is a constant finding. The etiology of AIH has not been completely elucidated, but immunogenetic background and environmental parameters may contribute to its development. The most important genetic factor is human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), especially HLA-DR, whereas the role of environmental factors is not completely understood. Immunologically, disruption of the immune tolerance to autologous liver antigens may be a trigger of AIH. The diagnosis of classical AIH is fairly easy, though not without pitfalls. In contrast, the diagnosis of atypical AIH poses great challenges. There is confusion as {{to the definition of}} the disease entity and its boundaries in the diagnosis of overlap syndrome, <b>drug-induced</b> autoimmune <b>hepatitis,</b> and AIH with concomitant nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or chronic hepatitis C. Centrilobular zonal necrosis is now included in the histological spectrum of AIH. However, the definition and the significance of AIH presenting with centrilobular zonal necrosis have not been examined extensively. In ~ 20 % of AIH patients who are treated {{for the first time with}} standard therapy, remission is not achieved. The development of more effective and better tolerated novel therapies is an urgent need. In this review, we discuss the current challenges and the future prospects in relation to the diagnosis and treatment of AIH, which have been attracting considerable recent attention.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that cytochrome P 450 is expressed in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes isolated from human and rat. Cytochrome P 450 s expressed on the cell surface are potential targets for the immune response of <b>drug-induced</b> and autoimmune <b>hepatitis.</b> However, the mechanisms behind transport of cytochrome P 450 to the plasma membrane are obscure. The present investigation aimed at identifying cytochrome P 450 expressed in the Golgi apparatus. Golgi membrane fractions from rat liver were prepared and characterized: one enriched with cis-Golgi, one highly enriched with trans-Golgi, and one intermediate Golgi fraction representing medial-Golgi. In these three fractions, significant amounts of cytochrome P 450 and NADPH cytochrome P 450 reductase were present, which could not be accounted for by contamination with endoplasmic reticulum. A marked difference between the relative content of different cytochrome P 450 enzymes was found. CYP 4 A 1 was found at the highest concentration, CYP 2 E 1 at an intermediary level, and CYP 1 A 2 at low levels, whereas no Golgi-specific CYP 3 A 1 was detectable. It was also shown that the CYP 2 E 1 present in the Golgi fractions was catalytically active. It is suggested that various forms of hepatic cytochrome P 450 are transported to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus in an enzyme-specific manner...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the wide}} range of reports on hepatologicissues {{published}} in 1998, I address key re-search in the areas of viral <b>hepatitis,</b> <b>drug-induced</b> hepatotoxicity, and noninvasive diagnostic assess-ment using magnetic resonance cholangiography. Viral Hepatitis For practical purposes, the dominant forms of hepatitis in the United States are A, B, and C. The D (“delta”) hepatitis virus is becoming less preva-lent throughout the world. Hepatitis E remains a major problem in developing countries worldwide but is rare in this country. Other viruses—hepatitis G among them—have been described but are not clinically important. There is some question of whether they should even be classified as hepatitis viruses; they have not been convincingly connected with acute or chronic liver disease. The papers I have selected deal with hepatitis A, both in epi-demic form and as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. In addition, I discuss re-sults from a large multicenter trial that examined the value of adding ribavirin to interferon as initial treatment for chronic hepatitis C. An effective and safe vaccine that actively pre-vents hepatitis A has been available for some time, supplementing passive immunoglobulin treatment. The same is the case for hepatitis B. Although commonly viewed as a fairly benign disease, hepa-titis A can be severe, and its continued occurrence is especially regrettable given the efficacy of vacci-nation. From a purely public health perspective, I would opt for vaccinating the entire population, but this would not be cost-effective.
