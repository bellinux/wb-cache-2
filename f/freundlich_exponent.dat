However, sorption {{may be different}} when nanomaterials are buried in sediments. Here, we studied sorption of Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) to sediment and to sediment with 4 % multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), {{as a function of}} factors affecting PFOS sorption; aqueous concentration, pH and Ca 2 + concentration. Sorption to MWCNT in the sediment–MWCNT mixtures was assessed by subtracting the contribution of PFOS sorption to sediment-only from PFOS sorption to the total sediment–MWCNT mixture. PFOS Log KD values ranged 0. 52 – 1. 62 L kg- 1 for sediment and 1. 91 – 2. 90 L kg- 1 for MWCNT present in the sediment. The latter values are relatively low, which is attributed to fouling of MWCNT by sediment organic matter. PFOS sorption was near-linear for sediment (<b>Freundlich</b> <b>exponent</b> of 0. 92 ± 0. 063) but non-linear for MWCNT (<b>Freundlich</b> <b>exponent</b> of 0. 66 ± 0. 03). Consequently, the impact of MWCNT on sorption in the mixture was larger at low PFOS aqueous concentration. Effects of pH and Ca 2 + on PFOS sorption to MWCNT were statistically significant. We conclude that MWCNT fouling and PFOS concentration dependency are important factors affecting PFOS–MWCNT interactions in sediments...|$|E

The coefficient of linear correlation r is used to explain the correlation analysis process. Correlation is made for metal ions of Cu, Zn and Pb. The content of Cu, Zn and Pb in water varied depending on the location and seasons, but did not exceed the Maximum Allowable Concentration. Based on the analysis of metals in water and the analysis of metals in the sediment, the calibration curves for dependence of lnCw and lnCs (Cw metal concentration in water, Cs metal concentration in sediment) were constructed.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the effectiveness of}} a less expensive adsorbent, a discarded rubber tyre (DRT) in removing toluene from aqueous phase. Adsorption of toluene on a DRT has been studied by using batch system at 25 and 30 °C.

Using linearized forms of equilibrium models, namely Langmuir and Freundlich models, the maximum adsorptive capacities were determined. It was evident from the experimental data that, although both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models could describe the isotherm data, the adsorption of toluene on a DRT was described well by the Freundlich isotherm. For Freundlich K values, sorption capacities were 6. 6374 and 7. 7535 mg/l at 25 and 30 °C, respectively.

The analysis uses a model that separates the contribution of HOC sorption to AC by parameterzing the sorption contributions by amorphous organic matter and black carbon (BC). It appears that sorption to BC increased with LogKOW, whereas sorption to AC showed a relatively narrow range of affinity properties with a median Freundlich LogKF,AC value of 7. 2 (µg/kgAC) /(µg/L) n (IQR = 7. 0 – 7. 5) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 8. 6 (IQR = 8. 3 – 8. 8) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

40|$|Assessment of the Freundlich {{sorption}} {{parameters of}} pesticides {{is an important}} element of their environmental risk assessment (especially leaching to groundwater), and therefore these parameters must be accurately assessed. in this work, the effect of random and systematic errors on the accuracy of the Freundlich sorption parameters was assessed for pesticide-soil sorption studies using Monte carlo simulations and analytical approximations. this assessment was performed for the so-called indirect method, which assumes that the mass in the system {{at the end of the}} study is equal to the added mass. the errors in these parameters appeared to depend strongly on the percentage decrease in the concentration in the liquid phase. the effects of random errors on these parameters was shown to be limited if the recommendations of the current organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) guideline were followed. However, the effect of the systematic error resulting from the loss of substance during the study might lead to observed Freundlich sorption coefficients that are approximately two times too high and <b>Freundlich</b> <b>exponents</b> that are 10 % too high. therefore, it is recommended that the possible effect of loss on the Freundlich sorption parameters should be assessed. this effect can be relatively simply calculated by combining the observed percentage decrease in the liquid phase with an upper limit of the percentage loss during the study. it is further recommended that the highest possible solid/liquid ratio should be used in pesticide-soil sorption studies. these recommendations are especially relevant for pesticides with low sorption for which the leaching assessment is most critical. </p...|$|R

The effect of amendment with exogenous organic matter was also studied. Adsorption kinetic fits an hyperbolic model. MBT adsorption reached an apparent equilibrium within 2 h and followed a second-order reaction. The maximum adsorbed amounts for natural soils ranged from 32 to 145 mug g(- 1). Rate constants were considered relatively low (0. 27 - 1. 5 x 10 (- 4) [mug g(- 1) ](1 -n) (s- 1)); the slow process {{was attributed to}} a combined effect of diffussion and adsorption. MBT adsorption fits the Freundlich model with r values {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 998 at P less than or equal to 0. 001 significance levels.

Lineal regression analysis between K-f and organic matter content of nonallophanic soils gave a correlation coefficient of 0. 980 (P = 0. 02). Dispersion of K-d values together with close values of K-OM indicate that organic matter (OM) was the principal component responsible for MBT adsorption in unamended soils.

The analysis confirms the importance of normalizing the solute equilibrium concentration when analyzing the adsorption isotherms, and it is suggested that a parameter, KF 10, obtained by taking 10 %solubility as the reference point when applying the Freundlich equation, is probably the best comparative estimate of the relative adsorption capacity of the carbon for different phenolic compounds. In combination with the <b>Freundlich</b> <b>exponent,</b> nF, estimates of the adsorption capacity at any other reference point can then be obtained.

This approach was tested successfully using numerical case studies. One-dimensional numerical simulations with varying values of k, n and initial mass were run to verify the closed form analytical expressions for the large time behavior of temporal moments and the tailing pail of breakthrough Curves. Good agreement between the slope of the tailing part of log-log transformed BTCs and the predicted slope using asymptotic theory was found.

The model predicted that the concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil would be within regulatory guidelines in 16 to 17 years under natural attenuation. Additional remediation would be required for groundwater as the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons posed a risk to a down stream receptor (a small stream that was a tributary for a pond) in the future.

Here, PAH sorption is proposed as the sum of two mechanisms: absorption into a biogenic, organic carbon (OC) fraction and adsorption onto a combustion-derived, black carbon (BC) fraction. To study BC adsorption, a 375 ʻC thermal oxidation method was employed to remove OC and isolate the BC fraction. Test studies showed that nitrogen-containing macromolecules charred during this pretreatment causing a positive bias to the BC measurement. Meanwhile, the oxidation of relatively small BC particles underestimated the total BC content in non-charring samples.

The analysis of several individual LAS congeners in seawater and of one specific LAS congener at different dilutions of seawater was carried out after extraction by polyacrylate solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers. Sorption isotherms for the tested LAS congeners on marine sediment and at different ionic composition were all nonlinear with a constant <b>Freundlich</b> <b>exponent</b> (n(F)) of 0. 78 +/- 0. 05. Differences in LAS sorption {{of a number of}} congeners were similar to the differences among the linear partition coefficients (K(fw)) observed for the polyacrylate SPME fibers in seawater. The sorption of LAS to both the sediment and the SPME fiber significantly decreased in media with lower salinity. Dissolved calcium could fully account for the changed affinity of LAS for the SPME fiber, although the high sorption in seawater was also equaled by a corresponding dissolved concentration of NaCl only. Sediment sorption coefficients of a single LAS congener at varying ionic composition was not as strongly related to the K(fw) values as the relation observed for different LAS compounds in seawater, likely because sorption mechanisms are different in both phases.

We used the latest dual-porosity, transient mobile-immobile (MIM) version of HYDRUS- 1 D that includes water and solute transfers between mobile and immobile domains. We considered flat bare soils under atmospheric boundary conditions with identical initial pressure head profiles. We targeted instantaneous and mean annual pesticide concentration values at 1 -m depth as relevant output variables.

The removal efficiency of Pb 2 + by CPB was 100 % compared to 95 % and 57 % by CPA and CAC while 96 % of phenol was removed by CPB against 93 % and 83 % by CPA and CAC respectively. This better performance of CPB over CPA and CAC is not unconnected with its higher pH resulting from the removal of cyanide from the peels during the fermentation process. However, despite the high phenol removal efficiency by CPB, the concentration of phenol in the treated effluent does not meet the environmental guidelines for disposal. It is therefore, recommended that a two-stage CPB adsorption column arranged in series is necessary to treat refinery wastewater efficiently if it is desired to totally remove phenol from the effluent or reduce the concentration to 0. 005 mg/l allowed by the Federal environmental protection agency (FEPA).

Detailed {{information}} about structure, composition and sorption parameters of organic sorbents {{is required to}} understand the sorption behavior of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC). The molecular structure and composition of the organic material (OM) from different types of geosorbents was characterized by solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy and related to Freundlich sorption isotherms. The geosorbents included natural and combusted coals, peat and various mineral soils. Anthropogenic soils, containing carbonaceous OM, were of special interest. Equilibrium sorption isotherms were measured for five hydrophobic organic compounds (benzene, tetrachloroethylene, 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene, 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene and phenanthrene) and analyzed with the solubility normalized Freundlich sorption isotherm. The Freundlich sorption coefficients were normalized to the organic carbon content (KOC°-values). Structural parameters of the OM, i. e. aromaticity, fraction of alkyl carbon, and polarity, were determined by the VACP/MAS 13 C NMR technique. The aromaticity increased with a decreasing proportion of polar compounds. In particular some anthropogenic soils exhibited a low polarity but a high aromaticity. Within the coals and the anthropogenic soils increasing aromatic carbon was accompanied by decreasing alkyl carbon. The structural parameters allowed to differentiate between natural mineral and anthropogenic soils and to verify the presence of carbonaceous material in the anthropogenic soils. A distinct positive correlation between KOC°-values and aromaticity was found. The highest sorption capacities were observed for samples with {{a high proportion of}} carbonaceous material as detected by the VACP/MAS technique. A negative correlation between <b>Freundlich</b> <b>exponent</b> (1 /n) and aromaticity was obtained.

40|$|Leaching to {{groundwater}} is {{an important}} element of the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides in western countries. Including aged sorption in this assessment is relevant because there is ample evidence of this process and because it leads to a decrease in simulated leaching. This work assesses the likely magnitude of this decrease for four groundwater scenarios used for regulatory purpose in the EU (from the UK, Portugal, Austria and Greece) and for ranges of aged-sorption parameters and substance properties using the PEARL model. Three aged-sorption parameters sets were derived from literature, representing approximately 5 th, 50 th and 95 th percentile cases for the magnitude of the effect of aged sorption on leaching concentrations (called S, M and L, respectively). The selection of these percentile cases was based only on the f NE parameter (i. e. the ratio of the aged sorption and the equilibrium sorption coefficients) because leaching was much more affected by the uncertainty in this parameter than by the uncertainty in the desorption rate coefficient of these sites (k d). For the UK scenario, the annual flux concentration of pesticide leaching at 1 m depth decreased by typically a factor of 5, 30 and > 1000 for the S, M and L parameter sets, respectively. This decrease by a factor of 30 for the M parameter set appeared to be approximately valid also for the other three scenarios. Decreasing the <b>Freundlich</b> <b>exponent</b> N from 0. 9 into 0. 7 for the M parameter set, increased this factor of 30 into a factor of typically 1000, considering all four scenarios.
