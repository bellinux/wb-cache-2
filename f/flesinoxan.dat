5000|$|<b>Flesinoxan</b> (DU-29,373) is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} 5-HT1A receptor partial/near-full agonist of the phenylpiperazine class. Originally developed as a potential antihypertensive drug, <b>flesinoxan</b> was later found to possess antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animal tests. As a result, it was investigated in several small human pilot studies {{for the treatment of}} major depressive disorder, and was found to have robust effectiveness and very good tolerability. Unfortunately however, due to [...] "management decisions", the development of <b>flesinoxan</b> was stopped and it was not pursued any further.|$|E

5000|$|... 5-HT1A {{receptor}} agonists like buspirone and <b>flesinoxan</b> show efficacy in relieving {{anxiety and}} depression, and buspirone and tandospirone are currently approved for these indications {{in various parts}} of the world. Others such as gepirone, <b>flesinoxan,</b> flibanserin, and naluzotan have also been investigated, though none have been fully developed and approved yet. Some of the atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole are also partial agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor and are sometimes used in low doses as augmentations to standard antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
50|$|In the {{conflict}} procedure, eptapirone produced substantial increases in punished responding without affecting unpunished responding, which was suggestive of marked anxiolytic-like effects.

50|$|In {{producing}} 5-HT1A-mediated effects such as hypothermia {{and spontaneous}} tail flicks in rodents, S-14671 is active at doses {{as low as}} 5 Âµg subcutaneously, and is about 10-fold more potent than 8-OH-DPAT and 100-fold more potent than <b>flesinoxan</b> and buspirone.

In this assay, unlike the other drugs screened, buspirone actually increased the immobility time with a single administration, while repeated administration decreased it, an effect {{that may have been}} related to buspirone's relatively weak intrinsic activity (~30%) at the 5-HT1A receptor and/or its preferential activation of 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors over postsynaptic receptors.|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: <b>Flesinoxan</b> is {{a highly}} potent and {{selective}} 5 -HT(1 A) agonist {{and appears to be}} a potentially interesting neuroendocrine serotonergic probe. OBJECTIVES: We assessed hormonal (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin and growth hormone) and temperature responses to <b>flesinoxan</b> in normal volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, single doses of 0. 5 mg and 1 mg were injected over 10 min into 12 healthy male volunteers at 1 -week intervals. Temperature and hormonal responses were measured at times - 30, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. RESULTS: <b>Flesinoxan</b> induced a significant and dose-dependent increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH) and a decrease in body temperature. Tolerance to <b>flesinoxan</b> was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed the role of 5 -HT(1 A) mechanisms in the PRL, ACTH, cortisol, GH, and temperature responses to <b>flesinoxan.</b> In the present study, <b>flesinoxan</b> appears a very promising serotonergic neuroendocrine probe.

40|$|RATIONALE: <b>Flesinoxan</b> is {{a highly}} potent and {{selective}} 5 -HT 1 A agonist. In a recent study, in normal volunteers, <b>flesinoxan</b> induced a significant and dose-dependent increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH) {{and a decrease in}} body temperature. OBJECTIVES: In order to better define the role of 5 -HT receptor subtypes in response to <b>flesinoxan,</b> we assessed the influence of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 antagonists on hormonal and temperature responses to <b>flesinoxan.</b> METHODS: Hormonal and temperature responses were studied in 6 volunteers with or without pretreatment with pindolol (30 mg p. o.), a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist, or ritanserin (10 mg p. o.), a selective 5 -HT 2 antagonist, using a double-blind crossover design. RESULTS: Pindolol significantly antagonized ACTH, PRL, GH and temperature responses to <b>flesinoxan</b> and ritanserin exhibited similar activity on PRL and ACTH responses. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the role of 5 -HT 1 A mechanisms in the PRL, ACTH, GH, and temperature responses to <b>flesinoxan,</b> and the role of 5 -HT 2 mechanisms in PRL and ACTH responses.

40|$|SUMMARY The new phenylpiperazine {{derivative}} <b>flesinoxan,</b> {{a potent}} and selective serotonin 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) agonist, was examined under {{a procedure that}} {{has proved to be}} a reliable and sensitive method for detecting novel anxiolytic drugs believed to produce their effects at the 5 -HT 1 A receptor subtype. Key pecking by pigeons was maintained by the presentation of food following every 30 th response in the presence of a white keylight; during an alternate component, correlated with a red keylight, every 30 th response produced food and electric shock which suppressed responding (punishment). <b>Flesinoxan</b> doses from 0. 001 to 0. 3 mg/ kg, intramuscularly, produced significant increases in punished responding at doses that did not affect unpunished responding. Doses of <b>flesinoxan</b> between 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/kg also increased punished responding but produced decreases in responding that was not punished. In a second study <b>flesinoxan</b> substituted for the 5 -HT 1 A anxiolytic buspirone under a drug discrimination procedure, providing further evidence that the behavioural effects offlesinoxan are mediated by 5 -HT 1 A mechanisms. Based on these findings, it would appear that <b>flesinoxan</b> should be a useful compound in the clinical management of anxiety...|$|E
40|$|Evidence from {{preclinical}} {{and clinical}} studies {{has shown that}} 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists have anxiolytic actions. The anxiolytic actions of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists have been tested by our previous studies using fear conditioning. However, {{little is known about}} the brain regions of anxiolytic actions of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists in this paradigm. In the present study, we investigated the effects of bilateral microinjections of <b>flesinoxan,</b> a selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, into the hippocampus, amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex on the expression of contextual conditioned freezing and the defecation induced by conditioned fear stress in rats. These results reveal that both intrahippocampal and intraamygdala injections of <b>flesinoxan</b> decreased the expression of conditioned freezing, while injections into the medial prefrontal cortex did not. In addition, intraamygdala injection of <b>flesinoxan</b> attenuated the increased defecation induced by conditioned fear, but injections into the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex failed.

The sample included 21 inpatients with major depression. Dexamethasone nonsuppressors exhibited lower ACTH responses to <b>flesinoxan</b> as compared with dexamethasone suppressors. The results showed that a dysfunction in 5 -HT(1 A) receptor activity could be due to a hypersecretion of cortisol. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Midazolam, amphetamine, and <b>flesinoxan</b> {{were used}} in four rat {{experiments}} to examine the usefulness of a latent Pavlovian discrimination procedure to assess the discriminative-stimulus, or occasion-setting, properties of drugs.

Relative to saline, midazolam enhanced immobility, whereas <b>flesinoxan,</b> and especially amphetamine decreased it. In each of the Experiments 2 â 4, subjects received a limited number of training sessions during which they consistently received a footshock in a distinctive box after a drug but not after saline, or vice versa. Subsequently, non-reinforced test sessions were performed in the drug and saline states in both the conditioning box and a novel box. Relative to the saline state, rats previously shocked under midazolam were less mobile in the conditioning box under midazolam, whereas rats previously not shocked under amphetamine or <b>flesinoxan</b> were more mobile under the drug. The remaining animals did not show differential responding.

Changes in the emotional state of mice were evaluated in terms of changes in exploratory activity, i. e. total locomotor activity, number and duration of rearing and head-dipping behaviours, and latency to the first head-dipping, using an automatic hole-board apparatus. Treatment with the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists <b>flesinoxan</b> (1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, i. p.) and R(+) - 2 -di-n-propylamino- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (8 -OH-DPAT; 1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, i. p.) 24 [*]h prior to exposure to stress significantly suppressed the decrease in various exploratory behaviours that was observed immediately after the exposure to acute restraint stress (60 [*]min). The effects of <b>flesinoxan</b> (1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, i. p.) and 8 -OH-DPAT (1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, i. p.) were antagonized by co-injection with N-{ 2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY 100635; 1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, i. p.), a selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist. <b>Flesinoxan</b> (1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, i. p.) and 8 -OH-DPAT (1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1 i. p.) significantly increased the plasma corticosterone level, and these effects of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists were dose-dependently blocked by pretreatment with metyrapone (12. 5 and 25 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, s. c.). Metyrapone (25 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1, s. c.) alone did not modify the stress-induced changes in exploratory behaviours.

40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} {{describe}} in this thesis is to further clarify {{the role of the}} 5 - HT 1 A receptor in central cardiovascular regulation. The hypotensive action of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists is mainly due to differential sympatho-inhibition resulting in an increase in total peripheral vascular conductance (Wouters et al, 1988 b). The first part of the thesis deals with the effects of activating the 5 -HT 1 A receptor with the selective 5 - HT 1 A receptor agonists 8 - 0 H-f>PAT and. <b>flesinoxan</b> on the haemodynamic profile of anaesthetized cats and conscious rats.

Local infusion of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist <b>flesinoxan</b> (0. 3, 1, 3 muM) for 30 min into the amygdala maximally decreased 5 -HT to 50 % of basal level. Systemic administration of citalopram (10 mu mol/kg) increased 5 -HT to 175 % of basal revel. Local infusion of 1 muM of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY 100. 635 into the amygdala augmented the effect of citalopram to more than 500 % of basal 5 -HT level. 5 -HT 1 A receptor responsiveness after chronic citalopram treatment was determined in two ways. First, by local infusion of 1 muM <b>flesinoxan</b> for 30 min into the amygdala, which showed a significant 63 % reduction in response (area under the concentration-time curve; AUC) for the citalopram group compared to the saline group. Second, by systemic administration of citalopram (10 mu mol/kg), which increased 5 -HT to 350 % of basal level.

The study was conducted among 45 major depressive inpatients, and serotonergic activity was assessed by prolactin (PRL) response to <b>flesinoxan</b> (a 5 -HT 1 A agonist).

The patients were assessed after a drug-free period of at least 3 weeks. A subsample of 16 patients completed the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory {{as a measure of}} impulsive aggressive behavior. Mean delta cortisol responses to <b>flesinoxan</b> were significantly lower in the group of depressed patients with a history of suicide attempts than in the group without history of suicidal behavior: for the delta cortisol values 14. 5 +/- 16. 3 micrograms/l vs 101 +/- 94 micrograms/l (F = 8. 9, df = 5. 25, p = 0. 006). There was also a very significant difference between suicide attempters and nonattempters for the temperature (delta T degrees) responses to flesinoxan: 0. 20 +/- 0. 24 degrees C vs. 0. 60 +/- 0. 24 degrees C (F = 18. 1, df = 5. 25, p = 0. 0003).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} {{challenge}} {{studies have reported}} abnormalities of serotonergic function in borderline personality disorder (BPD). There are, however, problems with the pharmacological probes used in these studies since fenfluramine and m-CPP are not only serotonergic agents but also induce release of catecholamines, particularly dopamine. Therefore, we tested whether subjects with BPD showed a blunted prolactin (PRL) response to <b>flesinoxan,</b> a highly potent and selective 5 -HT 1 A agonist. METHODS: <b>Flesinoxan</b> challenge test {{was carried out in}} 20 BPD in-patients and 20 healthy controls matched for gender but not for age. Since 16 BPD in-patients exhibited major depressive co-morbidity, a group of 20 depressed in-patients matched for gender but not for age was also included. RESULTS: BPD in-patients exhibited blunted PRL responses as compared to controls, whereas depressed in-patients did not differ from controls. Moreover, PRL responses were lower among BPD in-patients than among depressed in-patients. Among the BPD in-patients, PRL responses to <b>flesinoxan</b> were lower in patients with past history of suicide attempts (N = 8) than in those with a negative history. CONCLUSIONS: The results show major involvement of serotonergic function in BPD and are consistent with previous studies linking lower serotonergic activity with impulsivity. More particularly, our data suggest that BPD is characterized by lower 5 -HT 1 A receptor sensitivity. Moreover, the data support the involvement of 5 -HT 1 A activity in suicidal behaviour. However, this conclusion is limited because other hormonal responses such as ACTH and cortisol were not assessed, and because BPD was assessed by a self-report questionnaire and not a structured clinical interview.

40|$|Accumulating {{data have}} been {{published}} emphasizing {{the important role of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) receptors in proximal stomach relaxation. However, a proper in vivo characterization of 5 -HT receptors mediating gastric relaxation is still missing. In the current study, we focus on the in vivo characterization of 5 -HT 1 A receptors mediating relaxation of the proximal stomach in conscious dogs. Beagle dogs were equipped with a gastric fistula. In the conscious state, volume changes within an intragastric bag were measured at constant pressure by means of a barostat. Results are presented as the maximum volume increase after treatment (meanÂ±s. e. m.). All drugs were injected intravenously. The 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist <b>flesinoxan</b> (10, 50, 100 and 150 Î¼g kgâ 1) induced a dose-dependent relaxation of the canine proximal stomach (50 Â± 10, 230 Â± 51, 290 Â± 38 and 275 Â± 33 ml, respectively; n= 9 â 11). The selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 dose-dependently inhibited the flesinoxan-induced relaxation. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester did not affect this relaxation, suggesting that nitrergic nerves are not involved. After supradiaphragmatic vagotomy, the baseline of the intragastric volume was larger compared to that before vagotomy (317 Â± 50 vs 142 Â± 28 ml, respectively; n= 5). Compensation for this by either reduction of the intraballoon pressure or infusion of a contractile dose of bethanechol did not establish a condition in which <b>flesinoxan</b> was able to relax the stomach.

In the present study, we investigated involvement of the "NO pathway" and possible involvement of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor subtype in 5 -HT-induced persistent vasodilator response. In 8 healthy volunteers, we infused 5 -HT (0. 1, 0. 3, and 1 ng/kg/min) and the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist <b>flesinoxan</b> (15, 45, and 150 ng/kg/min) intraarterially (i. a.) with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA 30 micrograms/kg/min) or saline.

Forearm vascular resistance (FVR) was derived from simultaneously recorded i. a. blood pressure (BP) and FBF. 5 -HT dose-dependently decreased FVR (p < 0. 001). The persistent vasodilator response to 5 -HT appears to be mediated by NO release, as suggested by its complete abolition by L-NMMA (p < 0. 001). <b>Flesinoxan</b> decreased FVR slightly, but only at high doses (p < 0. 05).

Systemic administration of <b>flesinoxan,</b> a selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, significantly reduced the extracellular levels of 5 -HT in the central nucleus of the amygdala. This effect could be completely antagonized by the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist N-(2 -(4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl) -N-(2 -pyridyl) cyclohexane carboxamine trihydrochloride (WAY 100635). Local administration of these compounds by reversed microdialysis into the raphe nuclei revealed that extracellular 5 -HT levels in the central nucleus of the amygdala can be regulated through 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the caudal linear raphe nucleus, {{but not in the}} dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Interestingly, administration of <b>flesinoxan</b> into the central nucleus of the amygdala also decreased dialysate 5 -HT levels both locally and in the caudal linear raphe nucleus. The former effect could be blocked by pretreatment with WAY 100635 when applied into the central nucleus of the amygdala, but not when applied into the caudal linear raphe nucleus.

40|$|Serotonin {{is one of}} the neurotransmitters {{implicated in}} normal {{personality}} Many psychobiological models of personality include,some dimensions related to serotonin. For instance, the harm avoidance dimension of the blosocial model developed by Cloninger is related to serotonergic activity Higher scores on the harm avoidance dimension should theoretically reflect increased serotonergic activity However, correlation studies related serotonin activity to harm avoidance dimension have not yielded consistent findings. These controversial results are probably related to the complexity of the neurotransmitter systems, and the different assessment techniques used in these studies. Finally, recent genetic studies have examined the association between personality dimensions and serotonergic receptor polymorphisms with mixed results. Serotonin is not only related to some dimensions of normal personality Several psychopathological disorders are associated with serotonergic dysfunction. More particularly, borderline personality disorder (BPD) can be defined by many of the symptoms associated with serotonergic dysregulation, including affective lability, suicidal behaviours, impulsivity and loss of impulse control. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of selective serotonin re-uptake drugs in treating the depressive and impulsive symptoms of patients with BPD.

RESULTS: Compared with nonattempters, suicide attempters exhibited significantly lower PRL (p =. 01), cortisol (p =. 014), and temperature (p =. 0002) responses. Prolactin (p =. 007), cortisol (p =. 04), and temperature (p =. 00003) responses were also decreased in suicide attempters compared with normal control subjects. In contrast, we did not observe any significant differences in hormonal or temperature responses to <b>flesinoxan</b> between depressed patients without a history of suicide attempt and normal control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The present study tends to confirm the role of 5 -HT and more specifically 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the biology of suicidal behavior in major depression. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the present study was the {{functional}} and pharmacological characterization of human 5 -HT(1 A) receptor regulation of ion channels in Xenopus oocytes. Activation of the heterologously expressed human 5 -HT(1 A) receptor induced two distinct currents in Xenopus oocytes, consisting of a smooth inward current (I(smooth)) and an oscillatory calcium-activated chloride current, I(Cl(Ca)). 5 -HT(1 A) receptor coupling to both ionic responses as well as to co-expressed inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels was pharmacologically characterized using 5 -HT(1 A) receptor agonists. The relative order of efficacy for activation of GIRK current was 5 -HT approximately F 13714 approximately L 694, 247 approximately LY 228, 729 >flesinoxan approximately (+/-) 8 -OH-DPAT. In contrast, <b>flesinoxan</b> and (+/-) 8 -OH-DPAT typically failed to activate I(Cl(Ca)). The other ligands behaved as full or partial agonists, exhibiting an efficacy rank order of 5 -HT approximately L 694, 247 >F 13714 approximately LY 228, 729. The pharmacological profile of I(smooth) activation was completely distinct: <b>flesinoxan</b> and F 13714 were inactive and rather exhibited an inhibition of this current. I(smooth) was activated by the other agonists with an efficacy order of L 694, 247 > 5 -HT approximately LY 228, 729 >(+/-) 8 -OH-DPAT. Moreover, activation of I(smooth) was not affected by application of pertussis toxin or the non-hydrolyzable GDP-analogue, guanosine- 5 '-O-(2 -thio) -diphosphate (GDP betaS), suggesting a GTP binding protein-independent pathway. Together, these results suggest the existence of distinct and agonist-specific signalling states of this receptor. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate and compare the properties of noradrenaline release in the locus coeruleus (LC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). For that aim the dual-probe microdialysis technique was applied for simultaneous detection of noradrenaline levels in the LC and PFC in conscious rats. Calcium omission in the LC decreased noradrenaline levels in the LC, but increased its levels in the PFC. Novelty increased noradrenaline levels in both structures. Infusion of the az-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine decreased extracellular noradrenaline in the LC {{as well as in}} the PFC. Infusion of the alpha (2 A) -adrenoceptor antagonist BRL 44408, or the alpha (1) -adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline into the LC or PFC caused a similar dose-dependent increase in both structures. When BRL 44408 or cirazoline were infused into the LC. few effects were seen in the PFC. Infusion of the 5 -HT 1 A-receptor agonist <b>flesinoxan</b> into the LC or the PFC decreased the release of noradrenaline in both structures. When <b>flesinoxan</b> was infused into the LC. no effects were seen in the PFC. When the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline was applied to the LC, noradrenaline increased in the LC {{as well as in the}} PFC. It is concluded that the release of noradrenaline from somatodendritic sites and nerve terminals responded in a similar manner to presynaptic receptor modulation. The possible existence of dendritic noradrenaline release is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The receptors {{mediating}} the contractile {{effect of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{on the human}} isolated saphenous vein, obtained from 42 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, have been further characterized using a number of 5 -HT-related drugs. The rank order of agonist potency was 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT) approximately 5 -HT greater than methysergide approximately sumatriptan approximately alpha-methyl- 5 -HT approximately 5 -methoxy- 3 -(1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridin- 4 -yl) - 1 H-indolesuccinate (RU 24969) approximately 1 -(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -iodophenyl) - 2 -aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI) greater than 2 -methyl- 5 -HT greater than 8 -hydroxy- 2 (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT). <b>Flesinoxan</b> was inactive as an agonist. Ketanserin (1 mumol/l) hardly affected sumatriptan-induced contractions but it caused a rightward shift of {{the upper part of}} the concentration-response curve of 5 -HT and 5 -CT. The same concentration of ketanserin caused a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curves of alpha-methyl- 5 -HT and DOI with pKB values of 7. 1 and 7. 1, respectively. The responses to sumatriptan were antagonized by methiothepin (0. 1 mumol/l), metergoline (0. 1 and 1 mumol/l), rauwolscine (1 mumol/l) and cyanopindolol (1 mumol/l); the calculated pKB values were 7. 3, 6. 9, 7. 3, 6. 7 and 6. 5, respectively. Contractions to 5 -HT were antagonized by methysergide (1 mumol/l), methiothepin (0. 1 mumol/l; pKB = 7. 1), ICS 205 - 930 (1 mumol/l; pKB = 5. 9) and <b>flesinoxan</b> (30 mumol/l; pKB = 5. 3). Remarkably, the contractions elicited by 2 -methyl- 5 -HT were not attenuated by ICS 205 - 930, but were antagonized by methiothepin (0. 1 mumol/l) and, more markedly, by ketanserin (1 mumol/l).

40|$|The {{possible}} role of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT) and 5 HT-receptors in hypertension, already {{suggested by}} Page in 1954, has {{been subject to}} a renaissance of interest owing {{to the development of}} antihypertensive drugs which interact with 5 HT-receptors. These drugs, like ketanserin, urapidil and <b>flesinoxan</b> are used as tools to study the role of 5 HT and its receptors in hypertension. Some arguments would plead in favour of a certain role of 5 HT and 5 HT-receptors in the pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension: hyperresponsiveness of blood vessels from hypertensive patients and animals to 5 HT-induced constriction; the antihypertensive/vasodilator activity of the 5 HT 2 -receptor antagonist ketanserin; enhanced sensitivity of platelets from hypertensives to 5 HT. However, there are also several arguments which do not support a causal role of 5 HT in hypertensive disease: 5 HT is not a generally accepted pressor agent, whereas its concentration in the circulating blood is subthreshold; the 5 HT 2 -receptor antagonist ketanserin is the only agent of this type which lowers blood pressure, other 5 HT 2 -receptor blockers (ritanserin; LY 53587) being inactive. The various data and arguments available do not unequivocally support a relevant role of peripheral 5 HT and its receptors in hypertensive disease. 5 HT 2 -receptor blockade may, however, have a favourable effect on the microcirculation under pathological conditions. The stimulation of central 5 HT 1 A-receptors by drugs like urapidil, 8 -OH-DPAT or <b>flesinoxan,</b> has been demonstrated to induce peripheral sympathoinhibition and a fall in blood pressure. This mechanism appears to be a novel target for centrally acting antihypertensives, clearly different from that of clonidine and related drugs, which are centrally acting alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus was investigated by means of dual-probe microdialysis in conscious rats. The release of noradrenaline and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) after inhibition or stimulation of locus cocruleus and dorsal raphe activity was sampled in both nuclei and analysed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The inhibition of locus coeruleus activity by the infusion of the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (100 muM) decreased the release of noradrenaline to 20 % in the locus coeruleus and 30 % in the dorsal raphe, whilst the release of 5 -HT decreased to 80 % of control in the two brain areas, The excitation of locus coeruleus activity by the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (100 muM) led {{to an increase in}} the release of noradrenaline to 240 % and 220 % of control in the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe, respectively, The release of 5 -HT in both nuclei did not respond to the carbachol infusion into the locus coeruleus. Infusion of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist <b>flesinoxan</b> into the dorsal raphe (1 muM) significantly decreased the release of 5 -HT in the dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus to 45 % and 65 % of control, respectively. The release of noradrenaline was decreased in the dorsal raphe to 45 % by <b>flesinoxan,</b> whereas no changes were seen in the release of noradrenaline in the locus coeruleus. In conclusion, the innervation of the dorsal raphe by the locus coeruleus has a slight excitatory effect on the release of 5 -HT in the dorsal raphe. The dorsal raphe does not exert a direct inhibitory influence on the release of noradrenaline in the locus cocruleus. Finally, the release of noradrenaline in the dorsal raphe may be locally regulated by 5 -HT 1 A receptors. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) {{correlations}} of seven prototypical 5 -HT 1 A agonists were analyzed {{on the basis}} of a recently proposed semi-mechanistic PK-PD model for the effect on body temperature.

The values obtained in this manner were compared with estimates of the affinity (pKi) and intrinsic efficacy (log[agonist ratio]) in a receptor-binding as-say.

40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} {{reported that the}} investigational multimodal antidepressant, vortioxetine, reversed 5 -HT depletion-induced memory deficits while escitalopram and duloxetine did not. The present report studied the effects of vortioxetine and {{the potential impact of}} its 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist and 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist properties on 5 -HT depletion-induced memory deficits. Recognition and spatial working memory were assessed in the object recognition (OR) and Y-maze spontaneous alternation (SA) tests, respectively. 5 -HT depletion was induced in female Long-Evans rats using 4 -cholro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester HCl (PCPA) and receptor occupancies were determined by ex vivo autoradiography. Rats were acutely dosed with vortioxetine, ondansetron (5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist) or <b>flesinoxan</b> (5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist). The effects of chronic vortioxetine administration on 5 -HT depletion-induced memory deficits were also assessed. 5 -HT depletion reliably impaired memory performance in both the tests. Vortioxetine reversed PCPA-induced memory deficits dose-dependently with a minimal effective dose (MED) â¤ 0. 1 mg/kg (â¼ 80 % 5 -HT 3 receptor occupancy; OR) and â¤ 3. 0 mg/kg (5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 1 B, 5 -HT 3 receptor occupancy: â¼ 15 %, 60 %, 95 %) in SA. Ondansetron exhibited a MED â¤ 3. 0 Î¼g/kg (â¼ 25 % 5 -HT 3 receptor occupancy; OR), but was inactive in the SA test. <b>Flesinoxan</b> had a MED â¤ 1. 0 mg/kg (â¼ 25 % 5 -HT 1 A receptor occupancy; SA); only 1. 0 mg/kg ameliorated deficits in the NOR. Chronic p. o. vortioxetine administration significantly improved memory performance in OR and occupied 95 %, 66 %, and 9. 5 % of 5 -HT 3, 5 -HT 1 B, and 5 -HT 1 A receptors, respectively. Vortioxetineâ²s effects on SA performance may involve 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonism, but not 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonism, whereas the effects on OR performance may involve 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonism and 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonism...|$|E
40|$|In decerebrated, spinalized and paralyzed rabbits, {{intravenous}} {{administration of the}} 5 -HT 1 A-receptor agonists (Â±) - 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT, 3 â 300 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1, cumulative) and <b>flesinoxan</b> (22 â 2200 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1, cumulative) significantly increased the short latency reflex evoked in gastrocnemius medialis motoneurones by electrical stimulation of all myelinated afferents (AÎ² and AÎ´ fibres) of the sural nerve. Reflexes increased to median values of 198 % (inter-quartile range (IQR) 148 â 473 %) and 296 % (IQR 254 â 522 %) of pre-drug values with the highest doses of 8 -OH-DPAT and <b>flesinoxan,</b> respectively. The enhancement of reflexes induced by 5 -HT 1 A-receptor agonists was not reversed by the selective 5 -HT 1 A-receptor antagonist (S) WAY- 100135 (2. 05 [*]Î¼mol[*]kgâ 1). The effects of 8 -OH-DPAT were tested after pretreatment with (S) WAY- 100135 (2. 05 [*]Î¼mol[*]kgâ 1), its more potent analogue WAY- 100635 (185 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1), and the 5 -HT 2 / 5 -HT 1 D-/ 5 -HT 7 -receptor ligand ritanserin (1. 67 [*]Î¼mol[*]kgâ 1). 8 -OH-DPAT (300 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1 single dose) significantly increased gastrocnemius reflex responses {{in the presence of}} (S) WAY- 100135 and WAY- 100635, to median values of 260 % (IQR 171 â 295 %) and 165 % (IQR 136 â 170 %) of pre-drug levels, respectively. These values were not significantly different from each other, or from the effects of 8 -OH-DPAT given alone. When 8 -OH-DPAT was given after ritanserin, reflexes were a median of 102 % (IQR 76 â 148 %) of pre-drug values: i. e. there was no significant increase in responses. Neither WAY- 100635 nor ritanserin had any effects on reflexes per se. WAY- 100635 (185 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1) and ritanserin (1. 67 [*]Î¼mol[*]kgâ 1) were given after 8 -OH-DPAT (300 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1). The agonist increased reflexes to a median value of 184 % (IQR 135 â 289 %), after which WAY- 100635 significantly reduced responses to 165 % (IQR 130 â 254 %) and ritanserin further decreased reflexes to a median of 107 % (IQR 100 â 154 %) of pre-drug levels, i. e. not significantly different from controls. Previous studies have shown that reflexes evoked by large myelinated axons tend to be suppressed, rather than enhanced, by 5 -HT 1 A-receptor agonists. When tested against reflexes evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve at strengths between 1. 5 and 2. 5 times threshold, 8 -OH-DPAT (3 â 300 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1, cumulative) and <b>flesinoxan</b> (22 â 2200 [*]nmol[*]kgâ 1, cumulative) significantly reduced gastrocnemius responses to median values of 36 % (IQR 15 â 75 %) and 17 % (IQR 12 â 38 %) of pre-drug levels, respectively. This inhibition was fully reversed by (S) WAY- 100135 (2. 05 [*]Î¼mol[*]kgâ 1). These data show that drugs that are agonists at 5 -HT 1 A-receptors increase polysynaptic spinal reflexes evoked by moderate to high stimulus intensities and depress responses to very low intensity stimuli. The inhibitory effects of these drugs were mediated through 5 -HT 1 A-receptors as they were abolished by a selective antagonist for these sites. However, the facilitatory effects of 8 -OH-DPAT could be completely blocked only by a combination of ritanserin, which has no significant affinity for 5 -HT 1 A-receptors, with WAY- 100635. It appears that the enhancement of reflexes by 8 -OH-DPAT arises from a combined action at 5 -HT 1 A-receptors and other, ritanserin-sensitive, sites which could be 5 -HT 1 D- or 5 -HT 7 -receptors...|$|E
40|$|Major {{depression}} {{is the most}} common form of mental illness, and is treated with antidepressant compounds that increase serotonin (5 -HT) neurotransmission. Increased 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor levels in the raphe nuclei act as a âbrakeâ to inhibit the 5 -HT system, leading to depression and resistance to antidepressants. Several 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists (buspirone, <b>flesinoxan,</b> ipsapirone) that preferentially desensitize 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors have been tested for augmentation of antidepressant drugs with mixed results. One explanation could be the presence of the C(- 1019) G 5 -HT 1 A promoter polymorphism that prevents gene repression of the 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor. Furthermore, down-regulation of 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor expression, not simply desensitization of receptor signaling, appears to be required to enhance and accelerate antidepressant action.
