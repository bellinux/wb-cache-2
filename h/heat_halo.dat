Upcoming climate benchmark missions call for measurement uncertainties better than 0. 1 K (k= 3) in radiance temperature for the detection of spectral climate signatures. Blackbody cavities impart the most accurate calibration for spaceborne infrared sensors, provided that their temperature and emissivity is traceably determined on-orbit. The On-Orbit Absolute Radiance Standard (OARS) has been developed at the University of Wisconsin to meet the stringent requirements of the next generation of infrared remote sensing instruments. It provides on-orbit determination of both traceable temperature and emissivity for calibration blackbodies. The <b>Heated</b> <b>Halo</b> is the component of the OARS that provides a robust and compact method to measure the spectral emissivity of a blackbody in situ.

Using the model constructed in Tinker & Chen (2008), we parameterize the conditional probability of an absorber of equivalent width Wr being produced by a halo of mass Mh at a given redshift, P(Wr|Mh,z). We constrain the free parameters of the model by matching the observed statistics of Mg II absorbers: the frequency function f (Wr), the redshift evolution n(z), and the clustering bias bW. The redshift evolution of Wr ≥ 1 absorbers increases from z = 0. 4 to z = 2, while the total halo cross section decreases monotonically with redshift. This discrepancy can only be explained if the gaseous halos evolve with respect to their host halos. We make predictions for the clustering bias of absorbers {{as a function of}} redshift under different evolutionary scenarios, eg, the gas cross section per halo evolves or the halo mass scale of absorbers changes. We demonstrate that the relative contribution of these scenarios may be constrained by measurements of absorber clustering at z � 1 and z ∼ 0. 1. If we further assume a redshift-independent mass scale for efficient shock <b>heating</b> of <b>halo</b> gas of Mcrit = 10 11. 5 h − 1 M⊙, absorber evolution is predominantly caused by a changing halo mass scale of absorbers.

We find that the cold gas disks formed using the moving mesh approach have systematically larger disk scale lengths and higher specific angular momenta than their GADGET counterparts across a wide range in halo masses. For low mass galaxies differences between the properties of the simulated galaxy disks are caused by an insufficient number of resolution elements which lead to the artificial angular momentum transfer in our SPH calculation. We however find that galactic disks formed in massive halos, resolved with 10 ^ 6 particles/cells, are still systematically smaller in the GADGET run by a factor of ~ 2.

This ideal frozen-in property of the magnetic field is broken in small volumes if field gradients with different field polarity appear, in which localized dissipative effects, e. g. anomalous resistivity, become important.

On microscopic scales, dark matter particles are expected to annihilate amongst themselves into different products, with some fraction of the energy being transferred to the baryonic component. It is the aim of the present work to show that, in the innermost regions of dark matter <b>halos,</b> <b>heating</b> by dark matter annihilation may be comparable to the cooling rate of the gas. We use analytical models of the dark matter and gas distributions in order to estimate the heating and cooling rates, as well as the energy available from supernova explosions. Depending on the model parameters and the precise nature of dark matter particles, the injected energy may be enough to balance radiative cooling in the cores of galaxy clusters. On galactic scales, it would inhibit star formation more efficiently than supernova feedback. Our results suggest that dark matter annihilation prevents gas cooling and star formation within at least $ 0. 01 - 1 $ per cent of the virial radius.

40|$|Spiral {{galaxies are}} {{surrounded}} by a widely distributed hot coronal gas and seem to be fed by infalling clouds of neutral hydrogen gas with low metallicity and high velocities. We numerically study plasma waves produced by the collisions of these high-velocity clouds (HVCs) with the hot halo gas and with the gaseous disk. In particular, we tackle two problems numerically: 1) collisions of HVCs with the galactic halo gas and 2) the dispersion relations to obtain the phase and group velocities of plasma waves from the equations of plasma motion as well as further important physical characteristics such as magnetic tension force, gas pressure, etc. The obtained results allow us {{to understand the nature}} of MHD waves produced during the collisions in galactic media and lead to the suggestion that these waves can <b>heat</b> the ambient <b>halo</b> gas. These calculations are aiming at leading to a better understanding of dynamics and interaction of HVCs with the galactic halo and of the importance of MHD waves as a heating process of the halo gas.

40|$|Injection {{of massive}} {{quantities}} of gas is a promising technique for fast shutdown of ITER {{for the purpose}} of avoiding divertor and first wall damage from disruptions. Previous experiments using massive gas injection (MGI) to terminate discharges in the DIII-D tokamak have demonstrated rapid shutdown with reduced wall <b>heating</b> and <b>halo</b> currents (relative to natural disruptions) and with very small runaway electron (RE) generation [1]. Figure 1 shows time traces which give an overview of shutdown time scales. Typically, of order 5 x 10 {sup 22 } Ar neutrals are fired over a pulse of 25 ms duration into stationary (non-disrupting) discharges. The observed results are consistent with the following scenario: within several ms of the jet trigger, sufficient Ar neutrals are delivered to the plasma to cause the edge temperature to collapse, initiating the inward propagation of a cold front. The exit flow of the jet [Fig. 1 (a) ] has a {approx} 9 ms rise time; so the quantity of neutrals which initiates the edge collapse is small ( 90 %) of the plasma thermal energy is lost via impurity radiation during this thermal quench (TQ) phase. Conducted heat loads to the wall are low because of the cold edge temperature. After the TQ, the plasma is very cold (of order several eV), so conducted wall (halo) currents are low, even if the current channel contacts the wall. The plasma current profile broadens and begins decaying resistively. The decaying current generates a toroidal electric field which can accelerate REs; however, RE beam formation appears to be limited in MGI shutdowns. Presently, it is thought that the conducted <b>heat</b> flux and <b>halo</b> current mitigation qualities of the MGI shutdown technique will scale well to a reactor-sized tokamak. However, because of the larger RE gain from avalanching and the presence of a RE seed population due to Compton-scattered fast electrons, it is possible that a RE beam can be formed well into the CQ, after the flux surfaces initially destroyed by the TQ MHD have had time to heal. Crucial MGI issues to be studied in present devices are therefore the formation, amplification, and transport of RE and the transport of impurities into the core plasma (important because the presence of impurities can, via collisional drag, help suppress RE amplification). In the study of impurity transport, both neutral delivery (directly driven into the core by the jet pressure) and ion delivery (mixed into the core by MHD) are of interest, as both contribute to RE drag. Here, three new results relevant to RE suppression from MGI are presented: (1) evidence is presented that neutral jet propagation is stopped by toroidal magnetic field pressure, (2) MGI appears to cause the CQ to begin before sufficient impurities have been injected for complete collisional suppression of RE, and (3) flux surface destruction over the region q {le} 2 occurs during the TQ. The first result suggests that neutrals cannot be delivered to the core of large tokamak discharges by MGI, even during the CQ. The second result indicates that (at least for argon MGI in DIII-D), insufficient impurities (either neutral or ion) are delivered for collisional suppression of RE {{at the start of the}} CQ. The last result suggests that the destruction of good field lines resulting from MGI is quite extensive and should be sufficient to prevent RE formation, at least at the start of the CQ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} and evolution of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. We find analytical, fully cosmological similarity solutions taking account of the collisional interaction of SIDM particles. This interaction results in a thermal conductivity that <b>heats</b> the <b>halo</b> core and flattens its density profile. These similarity solutions are relevant to galactic and cluster halo formation in the CDM model. We assume an initial mass profile dM/M M^-eps, as in the familiar secondary infall model. If eps= 1 / 6, SIDM halos will evolve self-similarly, with a cold, supersonic infall terminated by a strong accretion shock. Different solutions arise for different values of the collisionality parameter, Q= sigma rho_b r_s, where sigma is the scattering cross section, rho_b is the cosmic mean density, and r_s is the shock radius. For all these solutions, a flat-density, isothermal core is present which grows in size as a fixed fraction of r_s. We find two different regimes for these solutions: 1) for Q ≤ Q_th, the core density decreases and core size increases as Q increases; 2) for Q ≥ Q_th, the core density increases and core size decreases as Q increases. Our similarity solutions are in agreement with previous N-body simulations of SIDM halos, which correspond to the low-Q regime, if Q=[8. 4 e- 4 - 4. 9 e- 2]Q_th (low-Q), or sigma=[0. 56 - 5. 6]cm^ 2 /g. As Q=∞, our similarity solution aquires a central density cusp, in agreement with some simulation results which used an ordinary collisional fluid to approximate the effects of SIDM collisionality. When Q=[18. 6 - 231]Q_th or sigma=[1. 2 e 4 - 2. 71 e 4]cm^ 2 /g, for which we find flat-density cores {{comparable to those of}} the observationally acceptable low-Q solutions, has not previously been identified. Further study of this regime is warranted.

40|$|We {{measure the}} far-infrared {{emission}} {{of the general}} quasar (QSO) population using Planck observations of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey QSO sample. By applying multi-component matched multi-filters to the seven highest Planck frequencies, we extract the amplitudes of dust, synchrotron and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signals for nearly 300, 000 QSOs over the redshift range 0. 1 <z< 5. We bin these individually low signal-to-noise measurements to obtain the mean emission properties of the QSO population {{as a function of}} redshift. The emission is dominated by dust at all redshifts, with a peak at z ∼ 2, the same location as the peak in the general cosmic star formation rate. Restricting analysis to radio-loud QSOs, we find synchrotron emission with a monochromatic luminosity at 100 GHz (rest-frame) rising from L_ synch= 0 to 0. 2 L_ Hz^- 1 between z= 0 and 3. The radio-quiet subsample does not show any synchrotron emission, but we detect thermal SZ between z= 2. 5 and 4; no significant SZ emission is seen at lower redshifts. Depending on the supposed mass for the halos hosting the QSOs, this may or may not leave room for <b>heating</b> of the <b>halo</b> gas by feedback from the QSO.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{magnetic}} reconnection {{could be an}} important heating process in cosmic gases. In any volume where magnetized plasmas collide, the dissipation of magnetic energy via reconnection seems to be unavoidable. Since most cosmic plasmas are highly conductive, the magnetic field lines are transported with the gas and no dissipation occurs {{for the most part}} of the volume. This ideal frozen-in property of the magnetic field is broken in small volumes if field gradients with different field polarity appear, in which localized dissipative effects, e. g. anomalous resistivity, become important. On the base of X-ray measurements exhibiting a clear connection of infalling high-velocity clouds (HVC) with ROSAT "hotspots" we perform resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the capabilities of magnetic dissipation as a major heating process in the interaction zone of the cloud with the halo. The main result is that in the physical environment of a galactic <b>halo</b> <b>heating</b> by externally driven magnetic reconnection cannot be suppressed by thermal conduction and/or radiative cooling. Thus, the gas reaches the maximum temperature given by the magnetic field pressure in the interaction zone of the HVC with the galactic halo. Comment: 13 pages (Latex), 11 figures (bitmapped ps).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of galaxies in a large volume (50 h − 1 Mpc, 2 × 288 3 particles) cosmological simulation, evolved using the entropy and energy conserving smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET- 2. Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired through filamentary “cold mode ” accretion of gas that was never shock <b>heated</b> to its <b>halo</b> virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results obtained with a different SPH code (Kereˇs et al. 2005). Atmospheres of hot, virialized gas develop in halos above 2 − 3 × 10 11 M⊙, a transition mass that is nearly constant from z = 3 to z = 0. Cold accretion persists in halos above the transition mass, especially at z ≥ 2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low mass halos at all times, {{and it is the}} main driver of the cosmic star formation history. Our results suggest that the cooling of shock-heated, virialized gas, which {{has been the focus of}} many analytic models of galaxy growth spanning more than three decades, might be a relatively minor element of galaxy formation.

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{primordial}} magnetic fields on the HI absorption from the Epoch of Reionization. The presence of these fields result in two distinct effects: (a) the <b>heating</b> of the <b>haloes</b> from the decay of magnetic fields owing to ambipolar diffusion, and (b) {{an increase in the}} number of haloes owing to additional matter fluctuations induced by magnetic fields. We analyse both these effects and show that the latter is potentially observable because the number of haloes along of line of sight can increase by many orders of magnitude. While this effect is not strongly dependent on the magnetic field strength in the range 0. 3 [...] 0. 6 nG, it is extremely sensitive to the magnetic field power spectral index for the near scale-free models. Therefore the detection of such absorption features could be a sensitive probe of the primordial magnetic field and its power spectrum. We discuss the detectability of these features with the ongoing and future radio interferometers. In particular, we show that LOFAR might be able to detect these absorption features at z ≃ 10 in less than 10 hrs of integration if the flux of the background source is 400 mJy.
