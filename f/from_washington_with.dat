2500|$|There {{had never}} been an attack by highwaymen upon a {{paymaster}} within Arizona Territory prior to May 1889. [...] Despite this, there were several factors favoring such an attack. [...] The territory was remote and had only a small scattered population. [...] Many residents of Arizona Territory held the U.S. Federal government in low regard, feeling it ruled the territory <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> {{little interest in the}} territorial residents' well being. [...] Compounding this was the fact that most white residents of Arizona had been either Confederates or Confederate sympathizers. [...] Decades of hostilities between Washington and the Church of Latter-day Saints left hard feelings among the territory's Mormon population. [...] Recent efforts to enforce the Edmunds Act, which made polygamy a felony, had increased anger among this group. [...] Finally, strong racial biases were held by the white population against the black soldiers were exacerbated by Mormon teachings that placed blacks on a lower rung of society. [...] This led to a situation where some area residents could have easily rationalized that the payroll would have been better spent supporting the local communities instead of in the hands of black soldiers who were seen as likely to spend it on immoral pursuits.|$|E
