40|$|Person-environment (PE) <b>fit</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most pervasive concepts in psychology. This study presents an integrative investigation of three levels of PE fit: person-vocation (PV) <b>fit,</b> person-organization (PO) <b>fit,</b> and person-job (PJ) <b>fit,</b> using multiple conceptualizations (e. g., value congruence, needs-supplies <b>fit)</b> of each <b>fit</b> level. While a trend in the PE <b>fit</b> literature has been the inclusion of only one <b>fit</b> level with a single conceptualization, researchers call for the addition of multiple conceptualizations of multiple <b>fit</b> levels in a single study. Traditionally, PO <b>fit</b> has been conceptualized as value congruence, whereas PV <b>fit</b> has remained untouched in the literature investigating the direct measurement of <b>fit</b> perceptions. Therefore, new <b>fit</b> perceptions scales assessing PO <b>fit</b> using a needs-supplies <b>fit</b> conceptualization and PV <b>fit</b> using a variety of conceptualizations were introduced. To address the limitation of employing direct measures, common method variance was modeled with a positive affect factor. The study accomplished two objectives. First, a previously supported three-factor model of <b>fit</b> perceptions consisting of PO value congruence (PO-VC), PJ needs-supplies (PJ-NS), and PJ demands-abilities (PJ-DA) <b>fit</b> was strongly replicated. Second, this model was expanded by examining additional conceptualizations (needs-supplies, demands-abilities <b>fit,</b> value, personality, and interest congruence) of <b>fit</b> levels (PV, PO, and PJ <b>fit).</b> Results suggested that professionals make distinctions based on both the <b>fit</b> level and <b>fit</b> conceptualization and these <b>fit</b> perceptions uniquely influence their attitudes and behaviors. A six-factor model (PO-VC, PJ-NS, PJ-DA, PO needs-supplies <b>fit</b> [PO-NS], PV demands-abilities <b>fit</b> [PV-DA], and general PV <b>fit)</b> best <b>fit</b> the data. Providing ample evidence of construct validity, PO <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-VC and PO-NS <b>fit)</b> were related to the organization-focused outcome of organizational identification, whereas the profession-focused outcome of occupational commitment was exclusively predicted by PV <b>fit</b> perceptions (PV-DA and general PV <b>fit).</b> As expected, both needs-supplies <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-NS and PJ-NS <b>fit)</b> predicted intentions to quit and job satisfaction.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was to {{illuminate}} the concept of <b>fit</b> in cause-related marketing (CRM) by proposing and testing a valenced model for CRM <b>fit.</b> The model was created based on an integration of extant CRM <b>fit</b> literature and theoretical frameworks. It distinguishes three general <b>fit</b> types (positive, neutral, negative) along the two dimensions of commonality and valence.

40|$|Although most humanitarians {{advocate}} {{more international}} intervention in Darfur, some analysts urge the opposite {{on grounds that}} intervention has backfired due {{to the problem of}} moral hazard.

This article tests the moral- hazard hypothesis against four other potential explanations for why Darfur’s mili- tants launched and perpetuated their rebellion despite being unable to protect their civilians from genocidal retaliation. The evidence indicates that moral hazard— the expectation of humanitarian intervention—increased both the magnitude and duration of Darfur’s rebellion, and therefore the retaliation it provoked against civilians.

The comparison does show some small mean biases between satellites and SAOZ, as well as between satellites, depending on the satellites observing periods. But most significant is the amplitude of the seasonal variations of the satellite-SAOZ difference varying with the satellite data used varying for example at northern mid-latitude from 2 % amplitude with the GODFIT GOME, SCIA and GOME 2 data, 3 % with SBUV and 4 % with IASI. Although the seasonal cycle of stratospheric temperature contributes partly in the case of SBUV measurements in the UV, the largest identified cause of seasonal variation of the satellite-SAOZ difference appears related to a Sun Zenith Angle dependence affecting possibly both satellites and/or ground-based measurements. The origin of this SZA dependence is further explored by looking at the satellite-SAOZ differences at various NDACC stations distributed in latitude...|$|E
40|$|Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE) {{surveys have}} {{successfully}} used the excess in a narrow-band filter {{compared to a}} nearby broad-band image to find candidates. However, the odd spectral energy distribution (SED) of LAEs combined with the instrumental profile have important effects on {{the properties of the}} candidate samples extracted from these surveys. We investigate the effect of the bandpass width and the transmission profile of the narrow-band filters used for extracting LAE candidates at redshifts z ~ 6. 5 through Monte Carlo simulations, and we present pilot observations to test the performance of tunable filters to find LAEs and other emission-line candidates. We compare the samples obtained using a narrow ideal-rectangular-filter, the Subaru NB 921 narrow-band filter, and sweeping across a wavelength range using the ultra-narrow-band tunable filters of the instrument OSIRIS, installed at the 10. 4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We use this instrument for extracting LAE candidates from a small set of real observations. Broad-band data from the Subaru, HST and Spitzer databases were used for <b>fiting</b> SEDs to calculate photometric redshifts and to identify interlopers. Narrow-band surveys are very efficient to find LAEs in large sky areas, but the samples obtained are not evenly distributed in redshift along the filter bandpass, and the number of LAEs with equivalent widths < 60 angstroms can be underestimated. These biased results do not appear in samples obtained using ultra-narrow-band tunable filters. However, the field size of tunable filters is restricted because of the variation of the effective wavelength across the image. Thus narrow-band and ultra-narrow-band surveys are complementary strategies to investigate high-redshift LAEs. Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of experimental research on the nonlinear refraction in InSb and the experimental demonstration of two nonlinear etalon devices using InSb as the active material. The first portion of the dissertation considers the Dynamic Burstein-Moss Shift model for nonlinearities in narrow-gap semiconductors. The physics and the equations are reviewed, and limitations in describing intensity dependent refraction in a semiconductor are considered. These limitations arise from the nonlinear dependence of charge carrier density upon irradiance. The second portion of the dissertation presents experimental measurements made on the nonlinear refraction of InSb at temperatures between 80 K and 182 K, for wavelengths from 5. 75 μm to 6. 10 μm, where the photon energy lay in the band tail below 100 cm⁻¹. Measurements of the linear absorption were first made with an infrared spectrometer for temperatures from 80 K to 300 K. The nonlinearity was measured by analyzing the transmission through InSb etalons. Nonlinear transmission curves were digitized and stored with an IBM PC-XT, then a curve fit was performed using the nonlinear refractive index as a <b>fiting</b> parameter. Observations are reported of increasing absorption, due in part to a thermal shift of the absorption edge. The second portion of the work presents the theory and demonstration of a bistable etalon using an edge-injected control beam. Plane-wave nonlinear etalon theory is used to describe the operation of such a device, illustrating the way in which switching and logic gate operation can be obtained. Two devices based on this concept are demonstrated: the 3 -port device using a single control beam, and the 2 SON gate using two control beams to perform two-input logic operation. The extension of the 2 SON gate to an array of pixels, and some considerations for optimizing array performance, are considered.

Survey work on the dairy industry was carried out to reveal its current status. The collected data of different genotypes (Pabna cattle, Australian-Friesian-Sahiwal Pabna, Holstein Pabna, Jersey Pabna, and Sahiwal Pabna) from 1999 to 2001, and in two seasons, were used to predict model parameters, fit-statistics and total lactation yields, by fitting ten lactation curve models. Best fitting model(s) were chosen {{on the basis of}} fit-statistics. The input parameters from best <b>fiting</b> model(s) were used for: developing a deterministic model; estimating the profitability of individual cows; estimating whole farm profitability; and for developing a profit function to estimate the economic values of traits in breeding objectives. The individual cow performances for different traits were stochastically simulated in respect of additive genetic, permanent and temporary error, herd and age effects, and mendelian sampling under progeny and parent-average testing breeding schemes based on three selection objectives applied over on 20 year period. Genetic gains in different traits were calculated from the regression of trait values on the selection index. The estimated lactation curves model parameters, and predicted lactation milk yield were significantly different between breeds, years and seasons. From four fit-statistics values, the CCC value was considered superior, and this value indicated that the Nelder model best represented the test day records. The net annual income for Holstein Pabna cattle was the highest (US$ 229) and was lowest (US$ 115) for Pabna cattle, while all other genotypes were intermediate. The economic values (EVs) of milk yield for all genotypes were similar (US$ 0. 32), and due to payment for milk volume only, the EVs of fat and protein were negative. EVs of liveweight, calving intervals and calving rate were negative, but survivability was positive in all genotypes. The parent-average testing selection scheme showed higher genetic gains than progeny testing. The highest (US$ 15. 80) genetic gain was obtained for milk yield when selection was for milk merit only. The study will assist in undertaking a genetic improvement programme for the increase of milk production in Bangladesh and thereby enhance food security.

According to these comparisons, the IASI A-B ozone columns are systematically overestimated by 2 - 6 %, depending on the station and the satellite, and the difference between all of them is showingmore or less seasonality of amplitude depending also on the satellite and the station. Mean biases are attributed to smaller ozone absorption cross-sections in the IR compared to the UVand visible and also to longitudinal ozone profiles variations ignored in most satellite retrievals. When corrected for mean biases, the seasonality of the differences between IASI, SAOZ and mostothers is generally smaller than ± 1 % that is of the order of magnitude of the dispersion and thusrandom uncertainty of the measurements, except in a few specific cases:a) the presence of a larger 2 - 3 % peak IASI-Sat difference in the monthly mean in May at OHP onboth IASI A and B suggesting a retrieval error on all IASI data on that month but of totallyunknown origin;b) a larger seasonality of the 4 CCI GOFDIT processed satellites compared to IASI and otherssuggesting a slight systematic error related to the use of zonal mean O 3 profiles climatologiesignoring longitudinal variations;c) larger dispersion, seasonality and moreover opposite seasonality phase of NPP at southern midlatitudesindicative of an error in those data files in the southern hemisphere;d) and, finally, an overestimation of IASI ozone in Reunion Island in coincidence with hurricanes,suggesting that high altitude clouds are not properly removed in the IASI data sets.

40|$|Both {{the present}} theory of {{international}} conflicts and recent development {{in international relations}} {{in the sphere of}} procedures and bases for pacific solution of international disputes call for an urgent re-examination of a number of relevant problems involved. There are three such problems the examination of which is essential to meet the necessity of a new approach to international disputes and their solution by pacific means. First of all it seems to be of primary importance to propose a new and more adequate systematization of international disputes using such criteria as they appeared to have played in practice decisive role in the originating (sources) of particular disputes their stages and possible mutations. The author proposes five such criteria which give an opportunity to systematize all disputes and show them in the light of variety of characteristic features. These criteria are as follows: a) substance of the dispute (the subject matter may be territorial or personal), b) persons meaning parties to a dispute (there may by bilateral or multilateral disputes; disputes between states, states and an organization, or between organizations etc.), c) the factor of time which may have and material significance or plays a formal and procedural role, d) the factor of the locus in the meaning of the character of circumstances (local, regional or universal) which bear upon sources of a particular dispute, and e) the factor of forum which shows whether and under what conditions a particular dispute may be discussed on the international plane or falls within the exclusive national jurisdiction. The visible decline of using existing devices and means of pacific solution of international disputes as listed in the article 33 of the Charter tends to expose the international peace to a real danger. There is therefore a further need of thorough research of present practices spontaneously and often informally developing. The author gives a number of such instances which together with some other propositions may be used as a helpful indication by drafting new devices and institutions of pacific solution of international disputes. Finally there is another problem which consists in an hypothesis that there is an intimate relation between particular types of international disputes and means best calculated to bring such disputes to an desirable end. In other words the problem put forward by the author lies in an answer to the question whether there may be found a guiding rule or set of rules which would facilitate the proper choice of particular procedure best <b>fiting</b> in with requirements and nature of a given dispute.

The project provided a two-man mission, consisting of a Range M anagement Consultant and the Civil Engineer of project TCP/SOM/ 5757, `Improvement of Villa ge Water Ponds', who was resident in SomaliaAs the mission found important natural tug water-spreading areas nor th of Garbaharey, as well as on or near the Shabelle flood plain, the cost of construc ting and maintaining new diversions, and of related soil conservation measures, was diffi cult to justify. Only two sites, Fanwen (maximum of 7 ha) and Halgen (maximum of 500 ha), were identified where diversion works might be justified in terms of local needs and potential economic benefits; however, they are widely separated and do not justify a sepa rate project with the attendant heavy overhead costs of equipment and technical manpower. No netheless, there are opportunities at other sites to increase the areas of water spreading by applying simple water harvesting methods; Bakool has a specific need for additional live stock watering points and for the rehabilitation of existing ponds and reservoirsAlthough the mission identified only two sites as being potentially suitable for tug diversion works, {{it might be possible to}} locate additional suitable sites by surveying other regions. Therefore, it was recommended that the soil and range conservation pro ject proposed for Nugal and Bari be revised to include a limited tug diversion compon ent, as well as provisions for training and extension in rangeland water harvesting technique s. The National Range Agency should carry out a limited programme of tug diversion, but only after full investigations have been made of each potential site and advice has been ob tained from the experts in operational projectsIn order to ameliorate the situation in Bakool, it was recommended t hat external funding be sought for a one-year project for the rehabilitation and repair of em bankments, desilting of ponds and improvement of run-off channels and distribution systemsFurther, it was recommended that an inventory be made of high-potent ial valley and flood plain grasslands in the Gedo Hiraan, Nugal, Bari, Sool, Sanaag and Tog dheer regions and that, in key areas, management plans be prepared and executed for th e long-term conservation, improvement and strategic use of these grasslands.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{presented}} study concerns the preparation of new polymeric material for the inactivation of mycotoxins. The binding of mycotoxins is achieved through adsorption phenomena. It was also studied the adsorption of the widely used antibiotics in veterinary, oxytetracycline and chlortetracycine on activated charcoal. The dissertation is divided into four sections. In the first section the adsorption of oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline on activated charcoal is studied. Tetracyclines are antibiotics with a wide antimicrobial spectrum which make them useful in veterinary. Their use is not only concerns diseases but they are used and as chemoprophylactic agents. They are also used as a growth factor {{and in some cases}} as an antifungal factor. Activated charcoal has been experimentally studied as an antifungal agents against mycotoxicoses. It is a material used -not very extensively- alone or in combination with vitamins, antibiotics in case of mycotoxicoses. The simultaneous use of these agents -tetracycline and activated charcoal can be justified as inappropriate according to the results of the in vitro experiments presented. The kinetics and the isothermal adsorption were studied. The adsorption was studied in vitro in conditions where the stomach pH (2. 35) is simulated and experimental temperature was at room temperature. The kinetics showed that adsorption equilibrium was reached in one (1) hour. The use of a second order equation and its extremely good fitting shows that the rate of adsorption is high. In the same conclusions we reach using exponential equations with two terms. The quantity of the adsorbed antibiotics to the initial quantity of antibiotics is very high {{at the start of the}} adsorption (~ 60 % is adsorbed in less that a minute) in comparison the rest time (35 % in 50 minutes approximately). Experiments of isothermal adsorption showed that great quantities of the antibiotics adsorbed per gram of activated charcoal, (oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline 402 mg/g and 397 mg/g respectively. For the calculation of the absorption capacities Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were used, while the second showed a better <b>fiting.</b> The resulted chemical constants showed a strong binding (Koxytetracycline = 150. 5 Kg/L, Kchlortetracylcine= 125. 3 Kg/L). Same results were resulted when Freundlich isotherm is used. The similar values that calculated for parameters qads/m and K were expected due to similarities in terms of chemical structrure and molecular geometry. The procedure of the polymeric deactivators' synthesis is presented in the second section. The synthesized copolymers belong to the cross linked cryogels of PVP with methylene-bisacrylamide as a crosslinker. They were synthesized at temperatures ranging from - 12 οC to - 20 oC, using varous catalysts (TEMED, K 2 S 2 O 8 and (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8). The cryogels differed at the %content of methylene-bisacrylamide molecules, the quanity of the used catalysts and the polymerization time interval. The produced structures exhibit great hydration capacities. The hydration capacity of the produced polymers was studied and it gave high values (400 %- 1400 % at time interval of 2 h). No relation between the synthesis parameters and the hydration or asdorption capacities of the polymers was obtained. That suggested that the adsorption capacities should be studied in relation to the structure of the produced cryogels. (active surface area, number and distribution of the pores etc). The porous structure of the cryogels may be attributed to the water crystals formed at these extremely low temperatures. The effect of the produced cryogels on the mycotoxins ochratoxin-A, zearalenone and T- 2 toxin is studied in the third section. The conditions of the in vitro experiments resembled these of the intestinal environment (pH= 7. 3 and temperature T = 37 οC). The experiments of this section aimed to access the adsorption capacity of polymers and compare this to the adsorption capacity of other adsorptive polymers, such as crosslinked PVP (Polyplasdone), bentonite and activated charcoal. The study was conducted using a set quantity of each toxin and of each adsorptive material. The stability of the mycotoxins in solution and at various temperatures was also studied. Zearalenone and ochratoxin A where stable under the used experimental conditions while T- 2 toxin was not. Activated charcoal exhibited the greatest adsorption capacity. It reduced the quantity of the mycotoxins to below levels of detection of the liquid chromatography method used. Polyplasdone gave adsorption values around 483 μg/g for zearalenone and 200 μg/g for ochratoxin. The polymeric cryogels gave adroption values ranging from 345 - 490 μg/g for zearalenone and from 170 to 316 μg/g for ochratoxin Α. One cryogel gave adroption values of 1266 μg/g for zearalenone and 1184 μg/g for ochratoxin Α. Zearalenone was adsrbed to a greater extend than ochratoxin Α by most cryogels and this was indicated by the statistically significant differences observed. The estimation of the kinetics and the isothermal adsorption on selected forms of cryogels was conducted in the fourth section. Kinetics of adsorption was studied for the CPVP 11 cryogels on various mycotoxins, using exponential growth equations and a second order equation, while the last showed the better results. Independently to the kinetic model it is resulted that the adsorption process has high rates. It is claimed that the best fitting of the second order model shows that adsorption process has two stages. It was supposed that the first stage -which was the quicker- the substances are adsorbed on the cryogels' surface, in the second stage substanes were diffused through the inner surface. Isothermal studies caried using various quantities of adsorptive materials, as well as various concentrations of mycotoxins. The equations Langmuir and Freundlich were utilised for the fitting of the results. The second one gave better results in the cases of ochratoxin adsorption while the first gave the best results in the systems of zearalenone-cryogels systems. The better fitting of the Freundlich equation indicates that the surface area of the polymers is heterogenious with more than one-attachment groups. The Langmuir isotherm gave better results at higher concentrations of polymers, maybe due to the incomplete coverage of the attachment groups. Cryogel CPVP 11 exhibited better adsorption capacity for ochratoxin A k= 5038 μg/g and n= 0. 877. The calculated constants k in the cryogel-ochratoxin A systems ranged from 98 - 141 μg/g. The Langmuir isotherm calculated the adsorption capacities of cryogels CPVP 1 and CPVP 2 as 1212 and 1089 μg/g respectively. The values given by the Freundlich isotherm for the same systems were 579 and 743 μg/g respectively. Chemical kinetic studies conducted for mycotoxin solutions with polymer CPVP 11, using 1 st order kinetic with one and two terms. In both cases we satisfactory fittings were obtained. (R 2 > 0. 990). Irrespective of the model used, we can say that adsorption takes place at a very fast pace. As indicated by the better fitting of the model with two parameters, the adsorption processes happen at two steps. We may assume that in the first step, which is the fastest one the substance gets attached to the surface of the cryogel, while in the second step the molecules of the substance diffuse in the porous material of the polymer. To summarise the results of the in vitro experiments indicate that the synthesised cryogels may be used satisfactorily in order to combat the problem of mycotoxins. Ο κύριος στόχος της εργασίας που παρουσιάζεται αφορά τη δημιουργία πολυμερικών υλικών για την δέσμευση μυκοτοξινών Η δέσμευση των ουσιών επιτυγχάνεται μέσω προσροφητικών φαινομένων. Επίσης μελετήθηκε η σύνδεση των ευρέως χρησιμοποιουμένων στην κτηνοτροφία, αντιβιοτικών οξυτετρακυκλίνη και χλωροτετρακυκλίνη σε ενεργό άνθρακα. Η διατριβή μπορεί να χωρισθεί σε τέσσερεις ενότητες. Στην πρώτη ενότητα μελετάται η δέσμευση των αντιβιοτικών οξυτετρακυκλίνη και χλωροτετρακυκλίνη από σκεύασμα ενεργού άνθρακα. Οι τετρακυκλίνες είναι αντιβιοτικά με ευρύ αντιμικροβιακό φάσμα που χρησιμοποιούνται στην Κτηνιατρική. Η αντιβιοτική του χρήση αφορά όχι μόνο την αντιμετώπιση ασθενειών αλλά και την χημειοπροφύλαξη. Χρησιμοποιείται ως αυξητικός παράγοντας στα ζώα και σε μερικές περιπτώσεις ως αντιμυκοτοξικός. Ο ενεργός άνθρακας έχει ελεχθεί πειραματικά ως προς τις προσροφητικές του ικανότητες σε μυκοτοξίνες. Αποτελεί υλικό που χρησιμοποιείται -όχι εκτεταμένα- μόνο του ή σε συνδυασμό με βιταμίνες, αντιβιοτικά, σε περιπτώσεις μυκοτοξικώσεων. Η ταυτόχρονη χρήση των δύο παραγόντων τετρακυκλινών και ενεργού άνθρακα μπορεί να κριθεί ως μη κατάλληλη με βάση τα αποτελέσματα από τα in vitro πειράματα. Τα πειράματα αφορούσαν την κινητική και την ισόθερμη προσρόφηση. Η δέσμευση μελετήθηκε in vitro σε συνθήκες που προσομοιώνουν περιβάλλον στόμαχου pΗ= 2. 35 και θερμοκρασία δωματίου. H κινητική της προσρόφησης έδειξε ότι ισορροπία μεταξύ της ελεύθερης και της προσροφόμενης συγκέντρωσης επιτυγχάνεται μέσα σε μία (1) ώρα. Η χρήση κινητικής εξίσωσης δεύτερης τάξης και η εξαιρετικά καλή προσαρμογή της δείχνει υψηλούς ρυθμούς προσρόφησης τετρακυκλινών σε ενεργό άνθρακα. Σε όμοια συμπεράσματα φθάνουμε με εκθετικές εξισώσεις δύο όρων. Η ποσότητα προσροφώμενης ουσία προς την συνολική προσροφάται πολύ γρήγορα στην αρχή του φαινομένου (~ 60 % προσρόφηση της ουσίας στα σε λιγώτερο από ένα λετπό) σε σχέση με την συνέχεια (35 % σε 50 περίπου λεπτά). Η ισόθερμη προσρόφηση έδειξε υψηλές σχετικά δεσμεύσεις ανά gr ενεργού άνθρακα, των αντιβιοτικών οξυτετρακυκλίνη και χλωροτετρακυκλίνη 402 mg/g και 397 mg/g αντίστοιχα. Για τον υπολογισμό των προσροφητικής ικανότητας (ΠΙ) χρησιμοποιήθηκαν οι ισόθερμες Freundlich και Langmuir, με την δεύτερη να δίνει καλύτερη προσέγγιση. Οι υπολογιζόμενες σταθερές σύνδεσης έδειξαν ισχυρή σύνδεση (Κ οξυτετρακυκλίνης = 150. 5 Kg/L, ενώ Kχλωροτετρακυκλίνης= 125. 3 Kg/L). Παρόμοια αποτελέσματα λάβαμε με την προσαρμογή των δεδομένων με χρήση της ισόθερμου Freundlich. Οι σχετικά όμοιες τιμές που λάβαμε για τις παραμέτρους qads/m και K είναι αναμενόμενες λόγω της ομοιότητας που παρουσιάζουν οι δυό χημικές δομές καθώς και των γεωμετρικών παραμέτρων των μορίων. Στη δεύτερη ενότητα παρουσιάζεται η διαδικασία παρασκευής των πολυμερικών αδρανοποιητών. Τα συμπολυμερή που παρασκευάστηκαν ανήκουν στην κατηγορία των διασταυρουμένων κρυογελών της βινυλοπυρρολιδόνης με μεθυλέν-δισακρυλαμίδιο. Παρασκεάστηκαν σε θερμοκρασίες - 12 οC και - 20 oC με διάφορους εκκινητές TEMED, K 2 S 2 O 8 και (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8. Οι κρυογέλες διαφοροποιήθηκαν στην %περιεκτικότητα των μορίων μεθυλεν-δισακρυλαμιδίου, στην ποσότητα των εκκινητών και στις ώρες πολυμερισμού. Οι δομές που παράχθηκαν παρουσιάζουν υψηλή διόγκωση σε υδατικά διαλύματα. Μελετήθηκε η ικανότητα ενυδάτωσης των πολυμερών όπου υψηλά ποσοστά μετρήθηκαν από 400 %- 1400 % σε χρονικό διάστημα 2 ωρών. Δεν προέκυψε κάποια συσχέτιση μεταξύ των μεταβλητών που χρησιμοποιήθηκαν κατά την σύνθεση με τις ενυδατικές και προσροφητικές ικανότητες των πολυμερών κάτι που δείχνει ότι οι προσροφητικές ικανότητες θα πρέπει να μελετηθούν με βάση χαρακτηριστικά δομής των κρυογελών (ενεργό εμβαδόν επιφάνειας, αριθμός και κατανομή πόρων κλπ). Ο ρόλος των κρυστάλλων νερού που παράγονται από τις εξαιρετικά χαμηλές θερμοκρασίες φαίνεται να δημιουργεί την πορώδη δομή των κρυογελών. Στην τρίτη ενότητα μελετάται η επίδραση των παρασκευασμένων κρυογελών στις μυκοτοξίνες οχρατοξίνη Α, ζεαραλενόνη και Τ- 2 τοξίνη. Οι συνθήκες των in vitro πειραμάτων που έγιναν προσομοιώθηκαν με συνθήκες εντερικού περιβάλλοντος (pH= 7. 3 και θερμοκρασία 37 οC). Τα πειράματα της ενότητας αποτελούν πρωταρχικά στάδια εκτίμησης της προσροφητικής ικανότητας των πολυμερών μεταξύ τους αλλά και σε σχέση με άλλα προσροφητικά υλικά όπως η διασταυρούμενη πολυβινυλλοπυρολιδόνη (Polyplasdone), ο βεντονίτης και ο ενεργός άνθρακας. Η μελέτη έγινε με σταθερή ποσότητα από κάθε τοξίνη καθώς και με σταθερή ποσότητα από κάθε προσροφητικό υλικό. Μελετήθηκε επίσης η σταθερότητα των μυκοτοξινών στην θερμοκρασία και στα διαλύματα. Οι μυκοτοξίνες ζεαραλενόνη και η οχρατοξίνη Α έδειξαν σταθερότητα στις πειραματικές συνθήκες ενώ η T- 2 τοξίνη όχι. Την υψηλότερη ικανότητα έδειξε ο ενεργός άνθρακας ο οποίος μείωσε την ποσότητα των μυκοτοξινών κάτω από τα επίπεδα ανίχνευσης της μεθόδου υγρής χρωματογραφίας που χρησιμοποιήθηκε. Το Polyplasdone παρουσίασε τιμές προσρόφησης στην περιοχή των 483 μg/g για την ζεαραλενόνη ενώ και 200 μg/g για την οχρατοξίνη. Οι πολυμερικές κρυογέλες έδειξαν προσροφητική ικανότητα στην περιοχή των 345 - 490 mg/g για την ζεαραλενόνη και από 170 έως 316 mg/g για την οχρατοξίνη Α. Εξαίρεση παρουσίασε μία μορφή κρυογέλης με προσροφητική ικανότητα 1266 mg/g για την ζεαραλενόνη και 1184 mg/g για την οχρατοξίνη Α. Η ζεαραλενόνη προσροφήθηκε σε υψηλότερα ποσοστά από ότι η οχρατοξίνη Α στις περισσότερες κρυογέλες κάτι που δείχνουν οι στατιστικά σημαντικές διαφορές που παρατηρήθηκαν. Στην τέταρτη ενότητα γίνεται εκτίμηση της κινητικής και της ισόθερμης προσρόφησης σε επιλεγμένες μορφές κρυογελών. Η μελέτη της χημικής κινητικής έγινε σε διαλύματα μυκοτοξινών για το πολυμερές ΚΠΒΠ 11, με χρήση εκθετικά αυξανόμενων 1 ης τάξης με ένα και δύο όρους και δεύτερης τάξης με την τελευταία να δίνει τα καλύτερα αποτελέσματα. Ανεξάρτητα από το μοντέλο παραδοχής προκύπτει ότι η προσρόφηση γίνεται με εξαιρετικά γρήγορο ρυθμό. Υποστηρίζεται από την καλύτερη προσαρμογή του μοντέλου δεύτερης τάξης ότι οι προσροφητικές διαδικασίες ακολουθούν δύο στάδια. Πιθανολογούμε ότι στο πρώτο στάδιο -και πιο ταχύ- η ουσία συνδέεται στην επιφάνεια της κρυογέλης ενώ στο δεύτερο τα μόρια διαπερνούν την επιφάνεια και διαχέονται στους πορώδες υλικό του πολυμερούς. Ως σύνοψη, οι ενδείξεις των in vitro πειραμάτων δείχνουν επάρκεια των παρασκευαζόμενων κρυογελών στην αντιμετώπιση του προβλήματος των μυκοτοξινών. Για τα πειράματα ισόθερμης προσρόφησης χρησιμοποιήθηκαν ποικίλες συγκεντρώσεις και προσροφητικά. Οι εξισώσεις Langmuir και Freundlich χρησιμοποιήθηκαν για την προσαρμογή των αποτελεσμάτων με την δεύτερη να δίνει τα καλύτερα αποτελέσματα στα συστήματα οχρατοξίνης-κρυογέλης ΚΠΒΠ 11, ενώ η πρώτη έδωσε καλύτερα αποτελέσματα στα συστήματα ζεαραλενόνης-κρυογελών. Η καλύτερη προσέγγιση της Freundlich υποδεικνύει ότι η επιφάνεια των προσροφητικών είναι ετερογενής με περισσότερες από μία περιοχές πρόσδεσης. Η ισόθερμος Langmuir δίνει καλύτερα αποτελέσματα στις μεγαλύτερες ποσότητες πολυμερούς πιθανόν λόγω της μη πλήρους κάλυψης των περιοχών προσρόφησης. Η κρυογέλη ΚΠΒΠ 11 έδειξε την καλύτερη προσροφητική ικανότητα στην οχρατοξίνη k= 5038 μg/g και n= 0. 877. Οι υπολογιζόμενες σταθερές k στα συστήματα κρυογελών - οχρατοξίνης Α κυμάνθηκαν από 98 - 141 μg/g. Η ισόθερμος Langmuir εκτίμησε τις προσροφητικές ικανότητες των κρυογελών ΚΠΒΠ 1 και ΚΠΒΠ 2 1212 και 1089 μg/g ενώ οι τιμές της ισόθερμου Freundlich στα ίδια συστήματα έδειξαν τιμές 579 και 743 μg/g αντίστοιχα.
