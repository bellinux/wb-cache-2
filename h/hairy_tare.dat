5000|$|Vicia hirsuta (<b>hairy</b> <b>tare,</b> hairy vetch, tiny vetch) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant from the large genus Vicia.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinct}} {{habitat is}} provided by the interface between saltmarsh and dune and supports reflexed saltmarsh grass (Puccinellia distans), hard-grass (Parapholis strigosa) and sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima). The dune ridge supports marram (Ammophila arenaria), and lesser meadow-rue (Thalictrum minus) with bloody crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum) and hound's-tongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is found on the lower landward slopes. The site extends to areas of shorter turf, which supports cowslip (Primula veris), early-purple orchid (Orchis mascula), violets (Viola spp.), and yarrow (Achillea millefolium), with widespread early forget-me-not (Myosotis ramosissima), common cornsalad (Valerianella locusta), <b>hairy</b> <b>tare</b> (Vicia hirsuta), and crosswort (Galium cruciata).|$|E
40|$|Seed {{production}} of <b>hairy</b> <b>tare</b> was reduced by harrowing. Harrowing {{can be performed}} until ear emergence without severe damage of winter wheat. Efficacy of late and repeated harrowing was increased if combined with early harrowing (BBCH 32 - 33). The removal of V. hirsuta reduced winter wheat grain yield losses and enhanced thousand grain weight...|$|E
