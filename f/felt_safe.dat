5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> in his old neighborhood. In the 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E
25|$|The {{case had}} a strong impact on the neighbourhood, {{the city and the}} entire nation. Teenagers {{reported}} that they no longer <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> in their communities. Polls showed that over half the country's parents were more afraid for their children than before. In addition, an increased number of women said they felt unsafe being outside after dark.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the fort}} was built, a {{rectilinear}} street pattern {{was laid out}} so the town could be constructed within the walls, as had been originally planned by Tigné. However, the plots were not purchased and the town never developed, mainly because the threat from the Ottoman Empire or the Barbary pirates had subsided, so Gozitans <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> living in rural areas.|$|E
60|$|The {{dirt and}} brush sliding past him, he <b>felt</b> <b>safer,</b> {{although}} his position {{was still an}} extremely perilous one.|$|R
50|$|An impact {{evaluation}} done in May 2014 found that citizens in Mindanao <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> due to Nonviolent Peaceforce’s presence {{and their role}} {{as part of the}} CPC for IMT.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{report in}} March 2004 {{stated that the}} prison was still facing [...] "major challenges". However the report also noted that prisoners <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> at Eastwood Park than in women's prisons generally.|$|R
25|$|Hearing of Sulla's {{death in}} 78 BC, Caesar <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> enough {{to return to}} Rome. He lacked means since his {{inheritance}} was confiscated, but he acquired a modest house in Subura, a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome. He turned to legal advocacy and became known for his exceptional oratory accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for extortion and corruption.|$|E
25|$|Collectively, {{these attacks}} served to spread fear {{throughout}} the region, especially in northeastern Illinois {{around the area}} of the Indian Creek massacre where a wave of terror gripped the region. Into the lead mining region around Galena, Illinois anxiety spread as attacks occurred and news of the movements of the elusive Black Hawk poured in. After the death of Adam Payne no white settlers in the area really <b>felt</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E
25|$|The few Jews in Poland were {{augmented}} by returnees from the Soviet Union and survivors from camps in Germany. However, {{a resurgence of}} antisemitism in Poland, in such incidents as the Kraków pogrom on August 11, 1945, and the Kielce pogrom on July 4, 1946, led to the exodus of {{a large part of}} the Jewish population, which no longer <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> in Poland. Anti-Jewish riots also broke out in several other Polish cities where many Jews were killed.|$|E
30|$|Medical {{termination}} of pregnancy was not attempted {{because of the}} uncertainty about {{the formation of a}} false passage during an earlier procedure, and it was <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> to explore the cervical canal hysteroscopically before dilating the cervix.|$|R
6000|$|... "So the infernal scoundrels held out--did they? Very good; I'll {{make them}} sweat for it," [...] and he eyed the scowling men with unwonted intrepidity. The truth was, he <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> now, than when outside the reef.|$|R
60|$|Thuvia of Ptarth drew {{quite close}} to him. She <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> with the feel of his arm against hers, and with the contact of her the man took a new grip upon himself. With his old-time smile he turned toward her.|$|R
25|$|The {{last time}} Stanford was a number 1 seed, they became to only top {{seed in the}} men's or women's tournament to lose to a sixteen seed. Earlier in the day, the top seeded men's team, Kansas, lost to Northern Iowa, so no one <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> in the opening match against UC Riverside. Stanford jumped out to an 8–0 lead, and behind Ogwumike's double-double (19 points, 11 rebounds) won easily over the Big West {{champion}} 79–47.|$|E
25|$|Chrétien <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> in {{appointing}} Dion to Cabinet because Dion was {{slated to}} run in Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, the second-safest Liberal riding in Quebec. In the 25 March by-election, he was easily elected. This was not without precedent; in 1941, Mackenzie King had appointed Louis St. Laurent to Cabinet after nominating him {{to run in}} a safe Quebec riding. Dion would hold the riding in general election of 1997, and was reelected again in the 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2015 elections.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} On the Road brought Kerouac instant fame. His celebrity status brought {{publishers}} desiring unwanted manuscripts {{that were previously}} rejected before its publication. After nine months, he no longer <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> in public. He was badly beaten by three men outside the San Remo Cafe at 189 Bleecker Street in New York City one night. Neal Cassady, possibly {{as a result of}} his new notoriety as the central character of the book, was set up and arrested for selling marijuana.|$|E
50|$|Dunfermline {{would remain}} {{as the capital}} of Scotland until the brutal murder of James I at Perth in 1437. The royal family <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> in Edinburgh Castle, as burghs such as Dunfermline and Stirling could not provide {{protection}} {{in defense of the}} nobles.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{successor}} was inaugurated, Batista left Cuba for the United States. [...] "I just <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> there," [...] he said. He divorced his wife, Elisa, and married Marta Fernández Batista in 1945. Two of {{their four children}} {{were born in the}} United States.|$|R
60|$|With {{the pistol}} loaded {{once more the}} boomer <b>felt</b> <b>safer.</b> He listened intently for some {{movement}} upon {{the part of his}} enemy, but none came. The Indian is a great hand at playing a waiting game and Yellow Elk was no exception to this rule.|$|R
25|$|Smoke {{is still}} rising from units 2 and 3, but is less visible, and is theorized to be steam {{following}} operations to spray water onto the buildings. Repair work resumes, {{after having been}} halted because of concerns over the smoke; it is <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> because no significant changes in radiation levels have occurred. Work continues to restore electricity, and a supply cable is connected to unit 4. Injection of seawater into units 1–3 continues. External power cables are reported {{to be connected to}} all six units and lighting is back on again in the control room of unit 3.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{began to}} {{gradually}} restrict {{the activities of}} the Dutch Jews and in early 1942 required them to wear yellow stars. At first Pais <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> because his former university status exempted him from being sent to a labor camp. In early 1943, however, the Dutch secretary general of internal affairs, Frederiks, made arrangements for the university Jews to report to Barneveld for their own safety, where they would be housed in a chateau. Pais did not trust that and instead went into hiding. Those who reported to Barneveld were later sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp where most of them did survive.|$|E
25|$|During the Hundred Years' War {{security}} {{increased with}} {{the strengthening of}} the fortifications {{and the construction of}} ditches to 1361-1362. At that time, the chapter of Mende had a castle on the heights of the city, Chastel-Nouvel. In 1370 many locals <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> from the ramparts of the city, despite threats from the routiers. Also, few of them took refuge in Chastel-Nouvel. But the walls were insufficient, and could not prevent the pillages. This period isolated Mende from its neighbours, including Le Puy-en-Velay, and waited the arrival of the Constable of France, Bertrand du Guesclin, then the intervention of Charles VI and the liberation of the region so that the roads reopened around 1452.|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{reports of}} severe {{hemorrhage}} from failure of surgical clips on renal artery stumps in live donor nephrectomies were investigated with {{a survey of}} all 893 ASTS members. Transfixion techniques were <b>felt</b> <b>safest</b> by respondents, and were associated with lower risk than non-transfixion methods, especially locking and standard clips...|$|R
60|$|To prevent Billy doing {{damage to}} the wagon by {{twisting}} in the shafts or by kicking, Matt unharnessed him and pushed the wagon back a few feet into a somewhat open space. Here the rain came down heavier, but he <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> than {{in close proximity to}} the tree.|$|R
50|$|In women's {{everyday}} lives, fear {{of crime}} can have negative effects, such as reducing their environmental mobility. Studies have shown that women tend to avoid certain behaviors, such as walking alone at night, because they are fearful of crime, and would feel more comfortable with these behaviors if they <b>felt</b> <b>safer.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following {{victory over}} the Italians at Custoza in late July, the court <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> to return to Vienna, and Franz Joseph {{travelled}} with them. But {{within a few months}} Vienna again appeared unsafe, and in September the court left again, this time for Olomouc (Olmütz) in Moravia. By now, Prince Alfred I of Windisch-Grätz, the influential military commander in Bohemia, was determined to see the young Archduke soon put on the throne. It was thought that a new ruler would not be bound by the oaths to respect constitutional government to which Ferdinand had been forced to agree, and that it was necessary to find a young, energetic emperor to replace the kindly, but mentally unfit Ferdinand.|$|E
25|$|In 710 BC Sargon <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> {{enough in}} his rule {{to move against}} his Babylonian arch-enemy Marduk-apla-iddina II. One army moved against Elam and its new king Shutur-Nahhunte II {{to prevent them from}} {{supplying}} aid to Marduk-apla-iddina; the other, under Sargon himself, proceeded against Babylon. Sargon first moved against Dūr-Athara which he renamed Dūr-Nabû and made the capital of the new province of Gambalu. He then laid siege to Babylon, and Marduk-apla-iddina II fled. Sargon claimed that he entered Babylon {{at the request of the}} priests and civil servants. Babylon yielded to Sargon and he was proclaimed king of Babylonia in 710, thus restoring the dual monarchy of Babylonia and Assyria. He remained in Babylon for three years; in 709 BC, he led the new-year procession as king of Babylon.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to England, DeaneDrummond was posted to the newlyformed 1st Airborne Division, and saw service in Operation Market Garden as secondincommand of the divisional signals. He became {{separated}} from his unit whilst trying to link up with 1st Parachute Brigade, who were surrounded {{at the north end}} of Arnhem Bridge, and along with three other soldiers spent three days trapped in a small room at the back of a Germanoccupied house. On managing to leave this building, they split up to cross the river; DeaneDrummond successfully swam to the south bank of the Rhine, but was almost immediately taken prisoner. The next day, he managed to escape from a group who were being escorted out of Arnhem, and spent the next eleven days hiding inside a large cupboard until he <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> to move.|$|E
50|$|The monarchy {{had to get}} {{the consent}} of Parliament in all issues, but with the threat of war looming from Spain, Parliament showed great loyalty toward Queen Elizabeth, who was a strong leader. However, after the Spanish Armada was {{defeated}} in 1588, Parliament <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> and thus it decreased its loyalty to the monarchy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take a paddle, Amos, and I'll take one," [...] said Captain Savage, {{stripping}} off his monk's gown. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>safer</b> in this on {{the deck}} of yon ship, but it don't help in a boat. I believe we might have fastened the hatches and taken her, brass guns and all, had we been so minded." ...|$|R

25|$|In Blackest Night #1, Garth {{returns to}} Atlantis and tells Orin's wife Mera {{that he is}} angry {{at the notion of}} Aquaman's body being buried on land. Mera relays to Tempest that Orin <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> on land and that it is indeed what he wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen {{entering}} Orin's grave, bidding him to rise. Aquaman's corpse rises, along with those of Tula and Dolphin as revenant members of the Black Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black Lantern Ring helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected his hand is restored as well.|$|E
25|$|One such {{therapy is}} trauma-focused therapy. This therapy {{involves}} bringing {{the most disturbing}} elements of a traumatic memory to mind and using therapist-guided cognitive restructuring {{to change the way}} the memories are thought about. The change in evaluation usually involves highlighting that the feelings of certain death, extreme danger, hopelessness and helplessness within a traumatic memory do not apply to the person now, as they survived the event. The therapy also focuses on extending the memory so it is recalled beyond the most traumatic parts. Extending them to a point where the person <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> again, so they remember the event in a more complete way with less focus on the negative aspects. As an example, a traumatic memory of wartime combat might be extended to after a battle, to when the person was no longer in immediate danger. In processing the memory in these ways it becomes less likely to intrude into their thoughts as an unwanted flashback.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April 1930, {{two days}} after Ras Gugsa Welle was killed in battle, Empress Zewditu died. It is known today that Zewditu {{suffered}} from diabetes, and was seriously ill with typhoid, {{but it is not}} universally agreed that this was the cause of her death. According to some popular histories, Zewditu died of shock and grief at hearing of her husband's death, but other accounts contradict this, claiming that Zewditu was not informed of the battle's outcome before her sudden death. Some diplomatic sources in Addis Ababa reported {{at the time that the}} fever-stricken Empress was immersed in a large container of frigidly cold holy water to cure her of her illness, but that her body went into shock and she died shortly thereafter. The timing of her death immediately after news of the outcome of the battle reached Addis Ababa has caused considerable speculation as to her cause of death. Some, particularly conservative critics of her successor, Emperor Haile Selassie, allege that once the rebellion had been decisively defeated, he or his supporters <b>felt</b> <b>safe</b> in poisoning Zewditu. Speculation as to the cause of Zewditu's death continues today.|$|E
50|$|Burns was {{afterwards}} {{the subject}} of a booby-trap bomb placed on his car at the house of his girlfriend's mother. While Burns was uninjured, his pregnant girlfriend received a leg injury. About that time, the couple moved to from residing in B&Bs and hostels (they were on an emergency housing list) to Ballynahinch, where they <b>felt</b> <b>safer,</b> though Burns continued to visit his family in Castlewellan.|$|R
50|$|On 19 October 2009 a Western Cape High Court judge granted {{an order}} for the {{eviction}} of 103 families to Blikkiesdorp. The majority of residents reluctantly moved off Symphony Way (where they <b>felt</b> <b>safer)</b> and into Blikkiesdorp (which is notorious for crime) in November 2009. In Blikkiesdorp, they have continued to organise {{under the banner of}} Symphony Way and have continued their struggle for land and housing.|$|R
25|$|By 1881, {{with local}} Tennessee {{authorities}} growing suspicious, the brothers returned to Missouri, where they <b>felt</b> <b>safer.</b> James {{moved his family}} to St. Joseph, Missouri in November 1881, {{not far from where}} he had been born and reared. Frank, however, decided to move to safer territory and headed east to settle in Virginia. They intended to give up crime. The James gang had been reduced to the two of them.|$|R
