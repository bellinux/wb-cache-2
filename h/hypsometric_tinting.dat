50|$|Hypsometric tints are colors used to {{indicate}} elevation, usually together with contour lines. They {{can be used}} to depict ranges of elevation as bands of color, usually in a graduated scheme, or as a color ramp applied to contour lines themselves. A typical scheme progresses from dark greens for lower elevations up through yellows/browns, and on to grays and white at the highest elevations. <b>Hypsometric</b> <b>tinting</b> of maps and globes is often accompanied by a similar method of bathymetric tinting to convey depth of oceans; lighter shades of blue represent shallower water such as the continental shelf and darker shades deeper regions.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to provide an {{overview}} of recent developments in the fields of small-scale and multiscale relief mapping. <b>Hypsometric</b> <b>tinting,</b> relief shading, continuous color shading, plan oblique relief and other techniques are widely used for maps covering large territories at small scales. The main difference between these techniques and large-scale terrain cartography is that the representations become highly abstract at the observational scale and thus require a high level of generalization. At very small scales, the terrain is stylized to convey distinctive geographic and morphological features. The positional accuracy of valleys and mountain chains becomes less important, and terrain features are depicted as abstracted symbols at the smallest scales. Thus, two main topics are of interest in this chapter: the automation of representation techniques and the generalization of digital elevation models. We focus on both small-scale and multi-scale mapping, which are interrelated because related generalization techniques are specific to the representation techniques. The following sections first discuss general requirements for digital terrain generalization at small scales, then discuss terrain visualization with (a) traditional relief shading and plan oblique relief, (b) continuous color shading and (c) <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tinting...</b>|$|E

This paper {{presents the results of}} a study comparing cross-blended <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> with conventional <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints.</b> Over 200 respondents in the United States, Switzerland, and Germany were asked to interpret the meaning of color on both types of hypsometric maps. The study revealed significant differences between map readers in the United States and the two European countries, and a general difficulty in correctly interpreting hypsometric colors.

40|$|In terrain mapping, {{there are}} so many ways to measure and {{estimate}} the terrain measurements like contouring, vertical profiling, hill shading, <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tinting,</b> perspective view, etc. Here in this paper we are using the contouring techniques to generate the contours for the different digital elevation data like DEM, HGT, IMG etc. The elevation data is captured in dem, hgt and img formats of the same projected area and the contour is generated using the existing techniques and applications. The exact differences, errors of elevation (contour) intervals, slopes and heights are analyzed and recovered. Comment: 07 Pages, 10 Figure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tinting</b> for small-scale maps. The method generalises digital elevation models by removing small unnecessary details and accentuating major valleys and ridgelines. The elevation data are filtered with lower and upper quartile filters that are combined using a drainage network. The lower quartile filter is applied in valleys, delimited by the drainage network, the upper quartile filter is used elsewhere. The level of generalisation is adjusted by simplifying the drainage network with an algorithm that removes the shortest streams. The resulting hypsometric layers match the quality standards of manually generalised reference layers and {{are appropriate for}} small-scale mapping...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> {{have been}} a favored mapping {{technique}} for over 150 years. By the mid-twentieth century, <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> {{based on the work}} of JohnBartholomew, Jr., Eduard Imhof, and Karl Peucker became the de facto standardfor physical reference maps at small scales. More recently, the role and design ofhypsometric tints have come under scrutiny. One reason for this is the concern thatpeople misread elevation colors as climate or vegetation information. Cross-blendedhypsometric tints, introduced in 2009, are a partial solution to this problem. Theyuse variable lowland colors customized to match the differing natural environmentsof world regions, which merge into one another. In the short time since theirintroduction, cross-blended <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> have proved to be a popular choiceamong professional mapmakers. Most maps made with cross-blended hypsometrictints also contain shaded relief (terrain represented with modulated light andshadows) ...|$|R
