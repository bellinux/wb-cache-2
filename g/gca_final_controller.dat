40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} the {{synthesis}} of a robust controller for uncertain discrete systems. The synthesis method of such a robust controller is the generalization of the Loop Shaping Design Procedure (LSDP) approach of McFarlane and Glover in the discrete case {{based on the work}} of Gu et al. We exploit the bilinear transform known as Tustinâs method in order to formulate the discrete loop shaping technique. A discrete weighting filter and a shaped discrete plant result from this technique. By taking into account the coprime factor uncertainty representation for the resulting shaped plant and by applying the small gain theorem, we define the concept of the robust stabilization of the discrete LSDP approach. This concept is based on the resolution of an optimization problem characterized by the maximum stability margin for {{the synthesis of}} the robust controller. To calculate the robust controller we transform this problem to a standard robust Formula controller design based on the resolution of the Riccati equations. Also, we present the gap metric theory to characterize the controllerâs robustness.

Four conditions will be investigated and compared to today's technique of controlling traffic with tactical vectoring: 1. FMS arrivals and approach transitions are available for controllers to issue to equipped aircraft - traffic permitting; 2.
