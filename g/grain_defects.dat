Complex geometries, which are driven by the need for higher fuel mass flow rates, makes casting fuel grains for hybrid rockets expensive and time consuming {{due in part to}} equipment costs. On a larger scale, cast grains must be supported by internal webbing, so that large chunks of fuel do not impact or even potentially block the nozzle. <b>Grain</b> <b>defects</b> are also an issue in larger grains.

40|$|When {{single crystal}} (SC) {{castings}} are adopted for industrial gas turbine’s (IGT’s) components, {{some degree of}} <b>grain</b> <b>defects</b> {{should be permitted to}} increase casting yield and reduce cost of the castings. In this paper, a new SC superalloy YH 61 is proposed {{to solve the problem of}} <b>grain</b> <b>defects</b> which are present in SC buckets or vanes of IGTs. First, the effects of solution heat treatment on various properties of the SC with and without <b>grain</b> <b>defects</b> were evaluated. Increasing the solution-heat-treated area was found to have a positive effect on the strength of a defect-free SC but harmful for the strength across a grain boundary. The solution heat treatment condition for YH 61 was determined after considering compatibility for properties of both the defect-free SC and the SC with <b>grain</b> <b>defects.</b> The solution heat treatment was also found to improve hot corrosion resistance of the alloy. Secondly, more detailed creep and hot corrosion tests were performed for YH 61 solution-heat-treated by one of the above-examined conditions. YH 61 showed higher creep strength than that of a second-generation directionally solidified (DS) superalloy although Re content of YH 61 is about half as much as that of second-generation DS superalloys. Hot corrosion resistance of YH 61 was superior to that of a second-generation DS superalloy under the whole experimental temperature range and to that of a 14 % chromium containing conventional cast (CC) superalloy, which is currently used in some IGTs, when the test temperature was 1000 OC.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of <b>grain</b> <b>defect</b> traits is assuming greater importance in wheat germplasm selection. Late maturity a-amylase {{is one such}} characteristic that renders wheat unsuitable for high value end products, even though the grain may appear sound. Phenotyping defect traits typically involves a multi-phase process, where genetic material for assay has been affected by non-genetic sources of variation {{in one or more}} previous linked stages of experimentation or preparation. The adoption of appropriate statistical design and analysis methods in these situations is, however, not widespread. Substantial sources of non-genetic variation were identified in the analysis of a designed experiment to measure late maturity a-amylase expression, indicating the potential for improved selection decisions. A simulation study based on these results suggests that significant gains over current methods in the accuracy of phenotyping this <b>grain</b> <b>defect</b> can be achieved with sound multi-phase statistical design and analysis techniques.

To improve the tolerance to <b>grain</b> boundary <b>defects,</b> <b>grain</b> boundary strengthening is still necessary. Rolls-Royce experimental superalloy RR 2086 bicrystals (BXs) have been modified with the minor additions of grain boundary strengtheners C, B and Hf. Creep tests have been carried out at 950 °C and 120 MPa, using BXs of 18 ° boundary. It was found that the rupture life of a modified BX (589 hours) was remarkably longer than that of a base BX (2. 4 hours). Electron microscopy observation showed that MC carbides were dominant precipitates at grain boundaries in the modified BXs before exposure. During exposure, modified BXs achieved a reasonable amount of M 23 C 6 carbides and a γ layer (ductile and creep-resistant) along their grain boundaries. No cellular carbides appeared during static exposure and creep testing. Since carbide precipitates (including MC and M 23 C 6) can effectively inhibit the grain boundary sliding, which is a main mechanism of creep rupture of superalloys, it is concluded that the observed structure is responsible for the significantly improved creep performance of the modified BXs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{macroscopic}} analog for a {{two dimensional}} hexagonal crystal, we perform an experimental {{investigation of the}} self-healing properties of circular <b>grain</b> <b>defects</b> {{with an emphasis on}} defect orientation. A circular grain defect is introduced into a nearly perfect hexagonal array of millimeter-sized spherical brass particles enclosed in a square tray. The array is oscillated uniaxially, causing the particles to vibrate randomly with respect to each other, which in turn induces the curved grain boundary around the misoriented defect region to migrate toward its center of curvature. Images of the healing crystal are acquired and analyzed to determine particle locations and quantify the size of the defect at prescribed time intervals. This procedure was repeated ninety-four times in order to collect data on a range of misorientations. In some cases, the misorientation angle varied significantly during healing so both initial misorientation and time averaged misorientation angle were considered as possible driving variables for healing rate. Healing times were fit to an exponential curve dependent on misorientation angle but there was a high degree of scatter from this correlation. Despite this variation in path shape, there was some correlation between healing time and misorientation, though there was significant scatter. In an effort to identify the source of this scatter by differentiating between defects with different healing times but nearly the same misorientation angle, the time dependence of healing rate was investigated. This more detailed examination of the time evolution of defect size revealed substantial variation in time dependence type. Both linear and nonlinear time dependence of defect area size was observed among the healing samples. The nonlinear time dependence of defect size was not common among defects with low healing times. However, degree of linearity did not effectively distinguish between defects with similar misorientation and widely different healing times nor did it correlate meaningfully with misorientation. Though the self-healing behavior of <b>grain</b> <b>defects</b> has not yet been fully characterized, there is evidence that geometric parameters influence overall healing time. by Marie C. Rice.

In the past the resulting poly crystalline silicon layers fabricated using the solid phase crystallization SPC method suffered from a number of shortcomings such as small grains and a high defect concentration which limited the achievable open circuit voltage to values below 500 mV.

30|$|Different seismic {{techniques}} {{are used to}} probe subduction zones (see Unsworth and Rondenay 2013). Among the different seismic observables, a reduction in seismic velocities and quality factor Q {{can be used to}} infer fluid-bearing regions at depth and define fluid pathways (e.g., Syracuse et al. 2008; Rychert et al. 2008). In particular, seismic wave attenuation (Q− 1) and Poisson's ratio (Vp/Vs) are sensitive to the presence of fluid and high temperature (Takei 2002), and some models showed that seismic velocities can be related to the fluid content within the mantle wedge (e.g., Carlson and Miller 2003). Estimates of volume fraction of fluids have been proposed based on these seismic parameters, and further work is needed to place stronger quantitative constraints (Aizawa et al. 2008). Low seismic velocity zones are commonly detected at shallow depths in relatively warm subduction contexts (Hirose et al. 2008) and at higher depths in the mantle wedge of cold subduction environments (Tsuji et al. 2008). Seismic attenuation can be caused by mechanisms that are not all related to the presence of fluid, such as <b>grain</b> <b>defect</b> microdynamics, viscosity, and scattering (e.g., Johnston et al. 1979; Karato and Spetzler 1990). Therefore, the interpretation of seismic attenuation in terms of fluid requires its coupling with other fluid-dependent geophysical parameters.|$|R

The size of the pith deviations (radial distance from centreline) remained constant up the stem despite a decline in internode length.

40|$|Casting is {{an ancient}} art {{that has been a}} {{trial-and-error}} process for more than 4000 years. To predict the size, shape, and quality of a cast product, casting manufacturers typically cast full-size prototypes. If one part of the process is done incorrectly, the entire process is repeated until an acceptable product is achieved. One way to reduce the time, cost, and waste associated with casting is to use computer modeling to predict not only the quality of a product on the macro- scale, such as distortion and part shape, but also on the micro-scale such as <b>grain</b> <b>defects.</b> Modeling of solidification is becoming increasingly feasible with the advent of parallel computers. There are essentially two approaches to solidification modeling. The first is that of macro-modeling where heat transfer codes model latent heat release during solidification as a constant and based solely on the local temperature. This approach is useful in predicting large scale distortion and final part shape. The second approach, micro-modeling, is more fundamental. The micro-models estimate the latent heat release during solidification using nucleation and grain growth kinetics. Micro-models give insight into cast grain morphology and show promise in the future to predict engineering properties such as tensile strength. The micro-model solidification kinetics can be evaluated using first principles or they can be evaluated using experiments.

However, the mechanisms that give rise to this type of emission are not well understood. For the first time, we present spatially resolved measurements of electron emission, obtained as a range materials are worn. These are obtained from scratch tests, carried out under vacuum conditions (10 − 5 Torr), in which microchannel plates coupled to a phosphor screen are used to image electron emission. The results show that electron emission occurs at specific locations on the worn surface and, depending on the conductivity of the material, these sites remain active and decay with a time constant of up to several seconds. SEM images of the worn surface at these sites reveal that either surface fractures or <b>grain</b> <b>defects</b> are present. This suggests that fractoemission mechanisms are at least partially responsible for triboemission (however, the possible contribution of tribocharging mechanisms are also discussed). Specifically, this provides evidence to support the theory that triboemission results from the imbalance of charge on opposing faces of wear cracks and that this generates an electric field sufficient to accelerate molecular fracture products, which then bombard the surface leading to secondary emission. The strong geometric correlation between damage topography and electron emission distributions shows the potential of using this technique to monitoring wear and crack formation in real time and under high (30 x) magnification...|$|E

Although gas phase models of the chemistry of interstellar clouds have been successful in explaining the abundances of some gas phase molecules, it has long been established that they cannot account for the large abundance of molecular hydrogen. The general consen- sus of the astronomical community is that carbonaceous interstellar dust grains assume a catalytic role in the formation of H 2 molecules within interstellar clouds. First-principles calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) have been performed in order to scrutinise the hydrogen-graphite interaction, with emphasis placed on how surface relaxation and <b>grain</b> <b>defects</b> modulate the H atom sticking and subsequent associative des- orption processes. It has been found that the adsorption of one hydrogen atom occurs only if a carbon atom of the graphite flake puckers from the surface by ∼ 0. 35 A. This process has an associated activation barrier of ∼ 2400 K, which is essentially insurmountable under interstellar conditions. This chemisorption barrier is notably reduced upon the introduction of surface defects and allowing for a more dynamic graphite surface.

The most widely known of these models is the Gabor model, since the Gabor patterns closely resemble the receptive filters in the human eye. The work of this thesis examines the use of Symlets to represent the HVS, since Symlets provide the benefit of orthogonality. One major problem with Symlets is that the energy is not stable in respective Symlet channels when the image patterns are translated spatially. This thesis addresses this problem by up sampling Symlets instead of down sampling, and thus creating shift invariant Symlets. This thesis then compares the representation of Gabor versus Symlet approach in predicting the response of the HVS to detecting print defect patterns such as banding and graining. In summary we noticed that Symlet prediction outperforms the Gabor prediction thus Symlets would be a good choice for HVS response prediction. We also concluded that for banding defect periodicity and size are important factors that affect the response of the HVS to the patterns. For <b>graining</b> <b>defects</b> we noticed that size does not greatly affect the response of the HVS to the defect patterns. We introduced our result...|$|R
