5|$|Another {{earthquake}} hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, {{described the}} city as partly in ruins. For many years after {{the disappearance of the}} cult of Eshmun, the sanctuary site was used as a quarry: Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, for example, used <b>its</b> <b>massive</b> blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to {{understand}} the strange light pattern, Tabetha S. Boyajian put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an exoplanet transiting (eclipsing) <b>its</b> <b>massive</b> star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 to 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out any kind of an orbit for one celestial object.|$|E
5|$|Badajoz is the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz. Prior to {{the merger}} of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz, Badajoz was the see of the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric's {{inception}} in 1255. The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by {{the ruins of a}} Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the Badajoz Cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with <b>its</b> <b>massive</b> walls. Badajoz is home to the CD Badajoz and AD Cerro de Reyes football clubs and the AB Pacense basketball club. It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{accommodation}} {{and other}} facilities are {{on the south side}} of the castle. On the ground floor, the entrance to the castle leads through to a courtyard, linked to four barrel-vaulted rooms in the south-west corner, originally 17th-century lodgings for the garrison. Two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and the fittings of one of these still remains in place. In the south-east corner is the Master Gunner's House, comprising a parlour, hall and kitchen on the ground floor, and a chamber and attic on the floors above. The parlour and hall would have originally been separated by a screen; the chamber would also have been subdivided. On the first floor is a small chamber, supported on arches above the courtyard, which was used as a lodging. On the second floor, the Long Room runs on top of the barrel-vaulted chambers, <b>its</b> <b>massive,</b> original roof still intact.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. Omaha was a {{stopping}} point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or via the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha {{on its way}} to the goldfields in 1865. <b>Its</b> <b>massive</b> collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. The Union Pacific Railroad was authorized by the U.S. Congress to begin building westward railways in 1862; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.|$|E
5|$|Between 1960 and 1970, Soviet {{agriculture}} output {{increased by}} 3% annually. Industry also improved; during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1966–1970), {{the output of}} factories and mines increased by 138%, compared to 1960. While the Politburo became aggressively anti-reformist, Kosygin was able to convince both Brezhnev and the politburo to leave the reformist communist leader János Kádár of the People's Republic of Hungary alone because of an economic reform entitled New Economic Mechanism (NEM), which granted limited permission {{for the establishment of}} retail markets. In the People's Republic of Poland, another approach was taken in 1970 under the leadership of Edward Gierek; he believed that the government needed Western loans to facilitate the rapid growth of heavy industry. The Soviet leadership gave its approval for this, as the Soviet Union could not afford to maintain <b>its</b> <b>massive</b> subsidy for the Eastern Bloc in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. The Soviet Union did not accept all kinds of reforms, an example being the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 in response to Alexander Dubček's reforms. Under Brezhnev, the Politburo abandoned Khrushchev's decentralisation experiments. By 1966, two years after taking power, Brezhnev abolished the Regional Economic Councils, which were organized to manage the regional economies of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 June Cornwallis {{returned}} to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on {{the morning of}} 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard. Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship HMS Mars, until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect Mars, Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship HMS Royal Sovereign between the British squadron and the French force, <b>its</b> <b>massive</b> broadsides driving the French back. At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate HMS Phaeton to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as Cornwallis's Retreat.|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion is {{unexpectedly}} attacked {{soon after}} by Intelligent Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with {{weapons of mass}} destruction. Dr. Caulder, leader of the IDS, had taken advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers to bloom from infected individuals, {{for the sole purpose of}} studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and <b>its</b> <b>massive</b> bomber, the Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the village of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict, begins to flourish in the new-found peace. The sun is seen rising above the nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving hope of a brighter future.|$|E
5|$|The plan of Salisbury Cathedral is {{that most}} often {{reproduced}} in architectural histories {{for the purpose of}} comparing English Gothic architecture with that of France, Italy and other countries. It has many features that, on paper at least, are typical. The plan of Worcester Cathedral, for example, closely resembles that of Salisbury. Both have two transepts, a large central tower, a large porch to {{the north side of the}} nave, a cloister to the south, off which opens a polygonal chapter house. Internally, there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts. But the histories of the two buildings are very different. Salisbury Cathedral took 160 years to complete, from its foundations in 1220 to the top of <b>its</b> <b>massive</b> spire in 1380. Worcester took 420 years from its Norman crypt of 1084 to its chapel in memory of Prince Arthur in 1504. The history of Worcester is much more representative of the history of most of England’s medieval cathedrals than is that of Salisbury.|$|E

50|$|The {{individual}} {{gangs of}} the NF alliance had the added {{advantage of being}} less notorious than Cutolo's NCO. The NF were initially less affected by police crackdowns and investigations and were therefore able to carry the attack to the NCO, although the NF had suffered <b>its</b> own <b>massive</b> crackdown in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Mussolini {{separately}} {{involved the}} Army in planning and, {{over the next}} two years, the Army developed <b>its</b> own <b>massive</b> campaign which would involve five to six times the number of troops required by De Bono. In 1934, Mussolini pulled the uncoordinated plans together into one that emphasized the military's idea of full-scale war.|$|R
