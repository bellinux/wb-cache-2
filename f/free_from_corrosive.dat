40|$|Nano {{minerals}} {{are widely}} used in diversified sectors including agriculture, animal, and food systems. Hence, their multiple uses provoke the production of nanomaterials at the laboratory level, which can be achieved through physical, chemical or biological methods. Every method is having its own merits and demerits. But keeping all in mind, chemical methods are more beneficial, as uniform nano-sized particles can be produced, {{but the use of}} corrosive chemicals is the main demerits. When it comes to environmental issues, biological methods are better as these are <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>corrosive</b> chemicals, but maintaining the culture media is the disadvantage. For animal feeding, chemical methods are mostly followed to produce nano minerals as it is cheap and less time consuming. These nano minerals also showed their significant effects even at lower doses of recommendations than the conventional mineral sources. These nano minerals have significant growth promoting, immuno-modulatory, antibacterial effects than the conventional counterparts. They also alter the rumen fermentation pattern on supplementation in the animal feeds. Apart from these, nano minerals are reported to enhance the reproduction in the livestock and poultry...|$|E

30|$|Recently {{polymers}} {{have attracted}} considerable attention as corrosion inhibitors, and their inhibiting power is related structurally to the cyclic rings and hetero-atom (O, N and S) {{that are the}} major active centers of adsorption. A blanketing and protecting of the metal surface <b>from</b> <b>corrosive</b> agents present in the solution occurs via their functional groups which form complexes with metal ions [15].|$|R

30|$|Several {{researches}} {{have indicated}} that some polymers {{can be used as}} corrosion inhibitors because, through their functional groups, they form complexes with metal ions and on the metal surfaces. These complexes occupy a large surface area, thereby blanketing the surface and protecting the metals <b>from</b> <b>corrosive</b> agents present in the solution [17]. The inhibitive power of these polymers is related structurally to the cyclic rings, heteroatom (oxygen and nitrogen), that are the major active centers of adsorption.|$|R

50|$|After a {{flow path}} is made, acids and {{fracturing}} fluids may be {{pumped into the}} well to fracture, clean, or otherwise prepare and stimulate the reservoir rock to optimally produce hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Finally, the area above the reservoir section of the well is packed off inside the casing, and connected to the surface via a smaller diameter pipe called tubing. This arrangement provides a redundant barrier to leaks of hydrocarbons as well as allowing damaged sections to be replaced. Also, the smaller cross-sectional area of the tubing produces reservoir fluids at an increased velocity {{in order to minimize}} liquid fallback that would create additional back pressure, and shields the casing <b>from</b> <b>corrosive</b> well fluids.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:The {{external}} anticorrosive coating is {{the shelter}} for preventing buried steel pipelines <b>from</b> <b>corrosive</b> damage. Many pipelines face severe corrosive problems {{because of the}} performance decrease of the coating, especially during long-term services. This situation usually causes safety accidents. Periodic inspection to the coating is an important way to ensure running safety. Aimed at the detecting technology, the methods for locating the pipelines and the means of on-line defects detecting with no excavation for the coating were studied and introduced. The ways for direction detecting, depth measuring and location coordinates detecting were pointed out. The basic principles of data analysis were also outlined. The various influences coming from external environment factors to the detecting results were analyzed...|$|R
