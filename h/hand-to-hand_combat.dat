50|$|Martial arts {{film is a}} film genre. A subgenre of {{the action}} film, martial arts films contain {{numerous}} martial arts fights between characters. They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and often are a method of storytelling and character expression and development.

Martial arts films commonly include other types of action, such as <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combats,</b> stuntwork, chases, and gunfights.|$|R
50|$|Diego himself {{served in}} his youth {{in the war of}} Granada. His strength, daring and {{activity}} fitted him to shine in operations largely composed of night marches, escalades, surprises and <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combats.</b> The main scene of his achievements was in Italy, and he betook himself to it—on his own showing—not in search of glory, but because he had killed a relation of his own, Ruy Sanchez de Vargas, in a street fight arising out of a quarrel about a horse. He fled to Rome, then under the rule of the Borgias.|$|R

This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, and al-Qaeda planners may have considered another operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, to replace him if he backed out.|$|E
5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges of {{missiles}} began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim {{was not to}} sink ships, but to deplete {{the ranks of the}} enemy crews before the boarding actions, which decided the outcome.

The WSPU responded by establishing a thirty-member, all-woman protection unit referred to as [...] "the Bodyguard", the [...] "Jiujitsuffragettes" [...] and the [...] "Amazons", to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-arrest. Edith Garrud became the trainer of the Bodyguard and taught them jujutsu {{and the use of}} Indian clubs as defensive weapons.

5|$|Fighting {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combat,</b> but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are further}} {{encouraged}} to customize their characters through nano-augmentations—cybernetic devices that grant characters superhuman powers. While the game contains eighteen different nano-augmentations, the player can install {{a maximum of}} nine, as each must be used on a certain part of the body: one in the arms, legs, eyes, and head; two underneath the skin; and three in the torso. This forces the player to choose carefully between the benefits offered by each augmentation. For example, the arm augmentation requires the player to decide between boosting their character's skill in <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combat</b> or his ability to lift heavy objects.|$|E

All was confusion. Peter was unhorsed by the shock of a French hussar, but Tom shot the trooper before he could cut Peter down. Free for a moment, he looked round, and saw a French lancer charging, lance at rest, at Lord Beresford. [...] "Look out, sir!" [...] he shouted, and the general, turning round, swept aside the lance thrust with his arm; and as the lancer, carried on by the impetus of his charge, dashed against him, he seized him by the throat and waist, lifted him bodily from his saddle, and hurled him insensible to the ground. Just at this moment General Lumley arrived with some Portuguese cavalry, and the French lancers galloped off.|$|R
5|$|The English {{hoped to}} avoid sinking their {{opponent}} {{and to prevent}} her from running aground. The damage on Madre de Deus's defences was becoming serious.

5|$|The mace or club {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} types of weapons. The {{popularity}} of the weapons with Vishnu worshippers may have led to its depiction with the deity. The gada – a symbol of strength – was a common weapon for <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combat</b> and was regarded as the strongest of weapons. Vishnu's attributes originate from his avatars, Rama and Krishna, the heroes of the ancient Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata (existing in the 5th to 4th century BCE) respectively. Both the epics narrate various characters – gods, men and demons alike – using the gada.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combat,</b> is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E
60|$|Now there {{followed}} on {{the decks}} of that sloop {{one of the}} most fearful <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combats</b> known to naval history. Pirates had often attacked vessels where they met with strong resistance, but never had a gang of sea-robbers fallen in with such bold and skilled antagonists as those who now confronted Blackbeard and his crew. At it they went,--cut, fire, slash, bang, howl, and shout. Steel clashed, pistols blazed, smoke went up, and blood ran down, and it was hard in the confusion for a man to tell friend from foe. Blackbeard was everywhere, bounding from side to side, as he swung his cutlass high and low, and though many a shot was fired at him, and many a rush made in his direction, every now and then a sailor went down beneath his whirling blade.|$|R

They held off the Japanese troops for two days amid heavy enemy shelling from artillery guns and tanks and chronic shortages of food, medical supplies and ammunition (on {{the last day of}} the battle, Adnan and his men were only left with a few hand grenades and had to fight off the Japanese soldiers with their bayonets and through brutal <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combat.</b> Adnan was shot but carried on fighting.|$|E
5|$|After fierce <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combat,</b> {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August 1916, the {{division}} was deployed to the Ypres Salient where it remained {{for the next ten}} months seeing no major action.

In November, elements of the 14th Welsh launched a large raid on a German position known as High Command Redoubt, a fortified position on a slight rise that overlooked the British lines. From this redoubt, the Germans had been able to direct artillery fire and snipe the British positions. The 14th Welsh raided the position, killing 50 defenders in <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combat</b> and taking 20 more as prisoners.|$|E

5000|$|Martial arts - A subgenre of {{the action}} film, martial arts films contain {{numerous}} <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>combats</b> between characters. They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value and are often the method of storytelling, character expression, and development. Martial arts films contain many characters who are martial artists. These roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists. If not, actors usually fervently train in preparation for their roles. Another method of going around this issue is that the action director may rely more on stylized action or filmmaking tricks. Martial films include The Karate Kid, Police Story, Kung Fu Hustle, Fearless, Ninja Assassin, Ong-Bak, Shanghai Noon, Kill Bill, Fist of Legend, Iron Monkey, Drunken Master, Enter the Dragon, Mortal Kombat, The Raid: Redemption, Flash Point, Champion of Death, Karate Bearfighter, Doberman Cop, Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon, Shaolin Soccer, Big Trouble in Little China, Charlie's Angels, and The Street Fighter series. A variant of the genre is Wuxia, a stylized action fantasy period genre typically set in Ancient Asia where skill in the martial arts can enable fantastic abilities like flying and magic like abilities.|$|R
