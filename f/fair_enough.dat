[...] Currie argues that section 14's somewhat broad reading of the word [...] "Securities" [...] is <b>fair</b> <b>enough.</b> Currie suggests that [...] "othing was said of counterfeiting coins" [...] because the United States Mint {{had not yet been}} established.|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{was unable}} to avoid a {{recurrence}} of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same [...] "stress related illness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released {{a statement to the}} media stating [...] "Marcus admitted {{a couple of days ago}} that he wasn't 100% so that's <b>fair</b> <b>enough.</b> I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness. I think over the next two or three years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket." [...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E

500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is <b>fair</b> <b>enough,</b> but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Bawer sharply criticised the Church for {{publishing}} the document. Bawer {{acknowledged that the}} report was [...] "a <b>fair</b> <b>enough</b> representation of the Christian understanding of the New Testament" [...] but argued that [...] "as a statement about Israel and Jews in the twenty-first century, it's beyond offensive", describing it as [...] "a supercilious application of Christian theology to a contemporary Jewish situation." ...|$|E

A fortnight previously, Fayed had stated that [...] "People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. <b>Fair</b> <b>enough.</b> But I put two fingers up to them. It is not for sale. This is not Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{contemporary}} Christian {{leaders and}} scholars from mainstream churches, such as Anglicans and Lutherans, consider {{that there is}} no conflict between the spiritual meaning of creation and the science of evolution. According to the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, [...] "...for most of the history of Christianity, and I think this is <b>fair</b> <b>enough,</b> most {{of the history of the}} Christianity there's been an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 13 March 2011 that Church had terminated her US$3 million deal with Power Amp Music over promotional disputes. Her spokesperson released the following statement: [...] "All I can really say, {{because of the}} confidentiality issues, {{is that it was}} in Charlotte's financial interests to do so before the agreement entered the second year of its term. This is typical for these type of deals, which are investment deals rather than record deals. I can also say that the decision to terminate the term early, which suited both parties, was made well before the commercial release of the album". A spokesperson from the record label also released a statement saying [...] "It didn't work out with Charlotte and that's <b>fair</b> <b>enough.</b> There was no falling out. It was a mutual decision. They decided to exit the deal".|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Max Harris {{and other}} Angry Penguins writers {{represent}} an Australian outcrop {{of a literary}} fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be intellectuals and Bohemians, both here and abroad, as great poetry. [...] However, {{it was possible that}} we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, <b>fair</b> <b>enough.</b> If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.|$|E

6000|$|The gist {{of what he}} said (upon art) was condemnatory of the Pre-Raphaelite modern {{school of}} painters, of whom he seemed to spare none, and of their works nothing; though he allowed that the old Pre-Raphaelites had some {{exquisite}} merits, which the moderns entirely omit in their imitations. In his own art, he said the aim should be to find out the principles on which the Greek sculptors wrought, and to do the work of this day on those principles and in their spirit; a <b>fair</b> doctrine <b>enough,</b> I should think, but which Mr. Gibson can scarcely be said to practise. [...] . The difference between the Pre-Raphaelites and himself is deep and genuine, they being literalists and realists, in a certain sense, and he a pagan idealist.
