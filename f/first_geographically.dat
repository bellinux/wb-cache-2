These mechanisms have scrambled long distance co-linearity between even the most closely related of these phylogenetic groups, underlining the pace of genome-wide evolution in P. syringae pathovars. We focus on the impact of these events on the effector complement of the four main groupings of Psa strains in particular.

In previous studies, diagnosis was made by morphological identification only. This is the <b>first</b> <b>geographically</b> stratified cross-sectional study in India to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of canine filarial species of veterinary and public health importance, {{using a combination of}} conventional and molecular diagnostic techniques. Results A total of 139 from 525 dogs (26. 5 %; 95 % CI 22. 7, 30. 3) were positive for microfilariae. The most common species of canine filaria identified in this study was A. reconditum (9. 3 %) followed by D. repens (6. 7 %) and D. immitis (1. 5 %). Three out of 525 dogs were found to have mixed infections on PCR. The morphological and molecular evidence on the sequence of the 18 S gene and phylogenetic analysis of the ITS- 2 region provided strong evidence that the canine microfilariae discovered in the Himalayan city of Ladakh belong to a novel species of Acanthocheilonema. Two dogs in Ladakh were also found to have mixed infections of the novel species described above and a unique microfilaria which morphologically resembled Microfilaria auquieri Foley, 1921. Conclusions At least six species of filarial nematode are now known to infect dogs in India, two of which were reported {{for the first time in}} this study. The study also confirms and extends the geographical distribution of canine heartworm (D. immitis) which overlaps with D. repens, emphasising the importance for veterinary clinicians and diagnostic laboratories to utilise immunodiagnostic tests that will not cross-react between those two filarial species.

Despite recent advances in the control and management of hepatocellular carcinoma within China, this disease remains a major health care issue. The global HCC BRIDGE study, designed to assess patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma therapy use and associated outcomes across real-world clinical practice, has recently been expanded as a national study in China, allowing a detailed analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma in this important country. Methods/Design The global HCC BRIDGE study is a multiregional longitudinal cohort trial including patients newly diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2011, who are receiving treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma via sites in the Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. The HCC BRIDGE China national study comprises the portion of the global HCC BRIDGE study conducted within mainland China. Patients will be followed from time of diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (post-January 1, 2005) to time of death or December 31, 2011, whichever comes first. Data will be collected on demographic/clinical characteristics, relevant laboratory values, hepatocellular carcinoma/underlying liver disease treatment, tumor response, adverse events, hospitalizations, and overall survival. The primary study end point is overall survival; secondary end points are disease progression, treatment-limiting adverse events, and treatment failure. Results At the time of writing, 15 sites have selected for participation across all 7 traditional regions of China (North, North-East, East, South, South-West, North-West, and Central).

We have used similar methods in studying a different segment of chromosome 3, that spanned by Est- 6 (3 – 36. 8) and Pgm (3 – 43. 4), with the aim of determining whether the results of Clegg and his colleagues could be reproduced when a different region was studied.

Despite the attention social exclusion has been given, particular population groups are often overlooked – particularly young people. A growing interest in the power of geographic data and the prevalence of social exclusion, has lead the authors to develop the <b>first</b> nation-wide <b>geographically</b> disaggregated index of youth social exclusion for Australia. A number of domains and indicators deemed important to youth wellbeing were identified and constructed to develop a comprehensive index of youth social exclusion for young people aged 15 - 19 years.

Particular attention is paid to ‘youth’ as an important stage of life in its own right and the implications of the delayed transition into adulthood that is now seen in many developed nations.

In this work, emphasis is also placed on the way the local people tried to accept or reject electricity. Since it was a very poor region, after the industry, we are dealing with the problem of depopulation of the region. These issues are also engaged. Furthermore, I am concerned with other economic activities so that people in this area, a minimum interest of investors able to sustain a culturally developed. All of these things and many more can be found on the following pages...|$|R
40|$|Air-dried flower {{heads of}} 20 Finnish tansy genotypes were {{extracted}} with petroleum ether and analyzed using GC¯MS. A total of 55 volatile compounds were detected, and 53 were identified. Of the tansy genotypes studied, 15 were well defined and five were mixed chemotypes. Complete linkage analysis differentiated the populations into six clusters. The most frequently found monoterpene was camphor {{with or without}} several satellite compounds such as camphene, 1, 8 -cineole, pinocamphone, chrysanthenyl acetate, bornyl acetate and isobornyl acetate. In 13 genotypes, camphor concentration exceeded 18. 5 % and in seven genotypes, camphor was less than 7. 2 %. Other chemotypes rich in trans thujone, artemisia ketone, 1, 8 -cineole, or davadone-D were also identified. Davadone-D and a mixed chemotype, containing tricyclene and myrcene, were identified from a Finnish tansy for the <b>first</b> time. <b>Geographically,</b> most chemotypes containing camphor originated from Central Finland, whereas chemotypes without camphor such as artemisia ketone, davadone D and myrcene¯tricyclene originated from South or Southwest Finland. Morphologically, the 20 tansy chemotypes based on the groups formed from complete linkage cluster analysis, were compared. The group containing the highest concentration of camphor chemotypes had the tallest shoots. The groups consisting from chemotypes containing davadone-D or artemisia ketone, which originated from Southwest Finland, produced {{the highest number of}} flower heads, had the tallest corymb, and were last to flower. Also, the group consisting from chemotypes with a high concentration of camphor and originated from South Finland started to flower late. The correlation between the genetic distance matrices based on RAPD patterns reported previously (Keskitalo et al., 1998. Theo. Appl. Genet. 96, 1141 ¯ 1150.) and the chemical distance matrices of the present study of the same tansy genotypes was highly significant (0. 41, P< 0. 0001). VokKV...|$|R
40|$|State {{of the art}} {{data mining}} and image {{retrieval}} in community photo collections typically focus on popular subsets, e. g. images containing landmarks or associated to Wikipedia articles. We propose an image clustering scheme that, seen as vector quantization compresses a large corpus of images by grouping visually consistent ones while providing a guaranteed distortion bound. This allows us, for instance, to represent the visual content of all thousands of images depicting the Parthenon {{in just a few}} dozens of scene maps and still be able to retrieve any single, isolated, non-landmark image like a house or graffiti on a wall. Starting from a geo-tagged dataset, we <b>first</b> group images <b>geographically</b> and then visually, where each visual cluster is assumed to depict different views of the the same scene. We align all views to one reference image and construct a 2 D scene map by preserving details from all images while discarding repeating visual features. Our indexing, retrieval and spatial matching scheme then operates directly on scene maps. We evaluate the precision of the proposed method on a challenging one-million urban image dataset. © 2010 ACM...|$|R
