5|$|In November 1861, the self-appointed {{members of}} the Confederate state {{sovereignty}} convention in Russellville, Kentucky appointed Hawes state auditor of the Commonwealth's Confederate government, but he declined {{in order to continue}} his military service. However, he wrote President Davis on January 25, 1862 to inform him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> to Bowling Green, Kentucky at Confederate Governor George W. Johnson's request in order to assist Johnson in administering the state government. He resigned his military commission two days later, but his departure for Bowling Green was delayed when he was stricken with typhoid fever.|$|E

He was inspecting the Luftwaffe units in the Crimea when he was ordered to Berlin to attend the state funeral of Ernst Udet, a Luftwaffe general and World War I flying ace. On the flight to Berlin, the aircraft in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> as a passenger attempted an emergency landing due to an engine failure.

5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden {{relied on a}} trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E

5|$|Around 1843, Kogălniceanu's {{enthusiasm for}} change was {{making him a}} suspect to the Moldavian authorities, and his lectures on History were {{suspended}} in 1844. His passport was revoked while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> to Vienna as the secret representative of the Moldavian political opposition (attempting to approach Metternich and discuss Sturdza's ouster). Briefly imprisoned after returning to Iași, he soon after became involved in political agitation in Wallachia, assisting his friend Ion Ghica: in February, during a Romantic nationalist celebration, he traveled to Bucharest, where he met members of the secretive Frăția organization and of its legal front, Soțietatea Literară (including Ghica, Nicolae Bălcescu, August Treboniu Laurian, Alexandru G. Golescu, and C. A. Rosetti).|$|E
5|$|Casey had {{intended}} to come ashore {{on the first day}} of the landing at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific. For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.|$|E
5|$|In New Orleans, Desha {{assumed the}} name John Parker. Meeting an Ohio native named Thomas Early, {{he learned the}} man was {{carrying}} {{a substantial amount of}} money and {{was on his way to}} Texas to purchase some horses and mules. Desha joined Early, traveling with him on a schooner dubbed the Rights of Man across the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay. In April 1828, Desha and Early disembarked at Rightors Point (now Morgan's Point, Texas), and from there, they traveled to San Felipe de Austin, arriving in early May. After a brief stay, the two set out on horseback toward San Antonio. By the time Desha reached Gonzales, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> alone.|$|E

5|$|A {{month before}} his capture, U.S. {{authorities}} had been passing down information to {{their counterparts in}} Mexico that Treviño Morales was making frequent visits to the Nuevo Laredo border area to see his newborn baby. They got this intelligence from wiretaps, conversations, and informants' tips. Treviño Morales was apprehended by the Mexican Marines in Anáhuac, Nuevo León, near the border of Tamaulipas state, at around 3:45 a.m. on 15 July 2013 without a single shot fired. The truck <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> in was intercepted on the road by a Black Hawk helicopter from the Navy; when the Marines got off the helicopter and tried to apprehend him, the capo attempted to escape by running through some bushes but was later caught. He was in possession of US$2 million ($25,316,100 MXN) in cash, eight weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition; two other men were arrested with him and taken into custody. Rumors of Treviño Morales's arrest and a mugshot of him in custody began to circulate through Twitter and other social media outlets around noon that day, but the Mexican government did not confirm the arrest, nor did the U.S. authorities receive a formal confirmation until hours later.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the new popes, Gelasius II and Calixtus II, championed Thurstan's case, and on 19 October 1119 he was consecrated by Calixtus at Reims. Calixtus had earlier promised Henry {{that he would not}} consecrate Thurstan without the king's permission, which had still not been granted. Enraged at this, the king refused to allow the newly consecrated {{archbishop}} to enter England, and Thurstan remained for some time on the continent in the company of the pope. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> with the pope, he also visited Adela of Blois, King Henry's sister, who was also Thurstan's spiritual daughter. At about this same time, Calixtus issued two bulls in Thurstan's favor: one released York from Canterbury's supremacy forever, and the other demanded the king allow Thurstan to return to York. The pope threatened an interdict on England as a punishment if the papal bull was not obeyed. At length, Thurstan's friends, including Adela, succeeded in reconciling him with Henry, and he rejoined the king in Normandy. At Easter 1120, he escorted Adela to the monastery of Marcigny, where she retired from active secular affairs. He was recalled to England in early 1121.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>traveling</b> back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E
