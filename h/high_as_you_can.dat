He summarised his visit by saying that [...] "If {{you are interested in}} the pursuit of excellence, then a table at the Oak Room is as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go in this country, and close to as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go in the world." [...] He recommended the starters of red mullet soup, the ballotine of salmon, and the chicken oyster served with a celeriac remoulade. He called his main course [...] "utterly simple and completely perfect"; it consisted of roast partridge with choucroute garnie. He called the interior of the dining room [...] "soft and thick and luxurious", adding that a painting by Mark Gertler and three bronzes by Rembrandt Bugatti were [...] "worth the entrance fee alone".|$|E

30|$|The hill slope makes {{difficult}} {{to build the}} drainage systems for the runoffs. In fact, the rainwater drills accumulates waste and deepen gradually as it rains that we fail to remove the waste. Because of the <b>high</b> altitude, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, waste from the top is accumulated here. That {{may be one of}} the reasons we experience diarrhoea during rainy season.|$|R

40|$|Asscrack  Bandit  leads  the  player  through  a  city  that  is  being  invaded  by  demonic  entities.   The player  acts  as  the  Bandit  who  before  the  invasion  had  decided  to  toss  coins  at  people�s  exposed asscracks  out  of  annoyance.   Over  the  course  of  the  game  the  Bandit  wanders  through different  areas  of  the  city  in  search  of  answers  as  to  what  is  happening  and  why.   All  of  the  while the  Bandit  practices  their  coin  shooting  skills  on  frightened  bystanders�  asscracks  and  uses  coins to  fight  off  the  enemies  they  encounter. The {{game is a}} maze style turn-based {{game that}} is set up on a grid system and {{requires}} some strategy to avoid excessively fighting enemies. Fighting enemies consists of something similar to a mini game. The goal is to achieve <b>as</b> <b>high</b> a score <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> losing to an enemy in the Battle Room results in your score being reset. The game uses the arrow keys {{to move through the}} levels. It also uses the space bar to charge for attacks and the B button to attack. To {{move on to the next}} level the player must �collect� all of the station targets (people with their asses exposed) and then reach the checkered flag in each level. ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then I'll {{tell you}} why they were taken first: because the mist, when we came through it, only rose five or six feet above the stream, {{and we were in}} it, while you on board were above it. And those that were taken on board this morning, every one of them, slept on the main-deck, and every one of them, too, was in fear of the fever, whereby I judge two things,--Keep as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and fear nothing but God, and we're all safe yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Stand by {{the side}} of the tree, Joyce. Now I will put this rope round you and round the tree, leaving a certain amount of slack in the loop. Now you get a grip of the tree with your knees. Then with your hands you shift the loop up as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and lean against it. Get a sort of purchase, and so shift your knees a bit higher. No doubt you will feel it awkward at first, but after a little {{practice}} you will find no difficulty whatever in going up at a fair rate of speed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Climbing.--Climbing trees.--Colonel Jackson, in his book, 'How to Observe,' {{gives the}} {{following}} directions for climbing palms and other trees that have very rough barks:--"Take {{a strip of}} linen, or two towels or strong handkerchiefs tied together, and form a loop at each end, for the feet to pass tightly into without going through; or, for want of such material, make a rope of grass or straw in the same way. The length should embrace {{a little more than}} half of the diameter of the trunk to be climbed. Now, being at the foot of the tree, fix the feet well into the loops, and opening the legs a little, embrace the tree <b>as</b> <b>high</b> up <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Raise your legs, and pressing the cord against the tree with your feet, stand, as it were, in your stirrups, and raise your body and arms higher; hold fast again by the arms, open the legs, and raise them a stage higher, and so on to the top. The descent is effected in the same way, reversing, of course, the order of the movements. The ruggedness of the bark, and the weight of the body pressing diagonally across the trunk of the tree, prevent the rope from slipping. Anything, provided it be strong enough, is better than a round rope, which does not hold so fast." [...] A loop or hoop embracing the body of the climber and the tree, is a helpful addition. Large nails carried in a bag slung round the waist, to be driven into the bare trunk of the tree, will facilitate its ascent. Gimlets may be used for the same purpose. High walls can be climbed by help of this description; a weight attached to one end of a rope, being first thrown over the wall, and the climber assisting himself by holding on to the other end. Trees of soft wood are climbed by cutting notches two feet apart on alternate sides. Also by driving in bamboo pegs, sloping alternately to left or to right; these pegs correspond to the [...] "rungs" [...] of a ladder.|$|R

The music video for the song, however, titles it <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> do that.|$|R

60|$|That is the can-can. The {{idea of it}} is {{to dance}} as wildly, as noisily, as furiously as you can; expose {{yourself}} {{as much as possible}} if you are a woman; and kick as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> no matter which sex you belong to. There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid, respectable, aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that statement. There were a good many such people present. I suppose French morality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked at trifles.|$|E
6000|$|I can fancy your losing {{patience}} with me altogether just now. [...] "We asked this fellow down {{to tell our}} workmen how to make shawls, and he is only trying {{to teach them how}} to caricature." [...] But have a little {{patience with}} me, and examine, after I have done, a little for yourselves into the history of ornamental art, and you will discover why I do this. You will discover, I repeat, that all great ornamental art whatever is founded on the effort of the workman to draw the figure, and, in the best schools, to draw all that he saw about him in living nature. The best art of pottery is acknowledged to be that of Greece, and all the power of design exhibited in it, down to the merest zigzag, arises primarily from the workman having been forced to outline nymphs and knights; from those helmed and draped figures he holds his power. Of Egyptian ornament I have just spoken. You have everything given there that the workman saw; people of his nation employed in hunting, fighting, fishing, visiting, making love, building, cooking--everything they did is drawn, magnificently or familiarly, as was needed. In Byzantine ornament, saints, or animals which are types of various spiritual power, are the main subjects; and from the church down to the piece of enamelled metal, figure,--figure,--figure, always principal. In Norman and Gothic work you have, with all their quiet saints, also other much disquieted persons, hunting, feasting, fighting, and so on; or whole hordes of animals racing after each other. In the Bayeux tapestry, Queen Matilda gave, as well as she could,--in many respects graphically enough,--the whole history of the conquest of England. Thence, as you increase in power of art, you have more and more finished figures, up to the solemn sculptures of Wells Cathedral, or the cherubic enrichments of the Venetian Madonna dei Miracoli. Therefore, I will tell you fearlessly, for I know it is true, you must raise your workman up to life, or you will never get from him one line of well-imagined conventionalism. We have at present no good ornamental design. We can't have it yet, and we must be patient if we want to have it. Do not hope to feel the effect of your schools at once, but raise the men as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and then let them stoop as low as you need; no great man ever minds stooping. Encourage the students, in sketching accurately and continually from nature anything that comes in their way--still life, flowers, animals; but, above all, figures; and so far as you allow of any difference between an artist's training and theirs, let it be, not in what they draw, but in the degree of conventionalism you require in the sketch.|$|E

40|$|Have {{you ever}} {{noticed that the}} {{physical}} world works in certain ways? Skateboarders use force and motion to perform tricks. If you jump up as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> you'll quickly fall back to the ground. Baseball players use gravity to bring the ball back down when they throw it. When you flip a switch, electricity powers your toaster. Rock bands use electricity {{to put on a}} show. The fascinating science of physics helps you understand why forces, motion, gravity, electricity, light, and sound work in predictable ways. Combining inquiry-based activities with physics topics, Physics: Investigate the Forces of Nature features graphic novel illustrations, fascinating sidebars, youtube links, and a glossary of important vocabulary to illuminate the complex world of physics and bring it to life. Projects include designing a skateboard park that maps the forces at work on the skateboarder and the skateboard, and creating a stage design for a rock band that places electric current where it is needed. Additional materials include a timeline, a list of current reference works, and Internet resources.
