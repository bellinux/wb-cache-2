Certain other details of Travis are based on Suda, including the sound of a key ring <b>jingling</b> in his pocket and his love of cats.

In an interview with Nintendo Power, Suda stated that he wanted Travis to become a huge star, stating that {{this was one of the}} reasons he wanted to make Desperate Struggle as interesting as possible. Nintendo Power editors told Joystiq that Suda considers Travis his favorite character. Suda states that No More Heroes 2 will be Travis' last appearance in the series, as his story will be completely finished. The Californian setting of No More Heroes is partially based on Travis, who Suda stated had a variety of frustrations and emotions that helped him fit in with that setting.|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were <b>jingling</b> in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E

2500|$|In Burma, in {{the upper}} reaches of the Ayeyarwady River, Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} drive fish towards fishers using cast nets in response to acoustic signals from them. The fishermen attempt to grasp the attention of the dolphins through various efforts such as using a cone-shaped wood stick to drum the side of their canoe, striking their paddles to the surface of the water, <b>jingling</b> their nets, or making calls that sound turkey-like. A herd of dolphins, who agree to work alongside the fisherman, will entrap a school of fish in a semi-circle, guiding them towards the boat. In return, the dolphins are rewarded with some of the fishers' bycatch. Historically, Irrawaddy River fishers claimed particular dolphins were associated with individual fishing villages and chased fish into their nets. An 1879 report indicated legal claims were frequently brought into native courts by fishers to recover a share of the fish from the nets of a rival fisher which the plaintiff's dolphin was claimed to have helped fill.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans learned hoop {{driving from}} the Greeks and {{generally}} held {{the sport in}} high regard.

[...] The stick was known as a clavis [...] or radius, had the shape of a key, and was made of metal with a wooden handle. Roman hoops were fitted with metal rings that slid freely along the rim. According to Martial, this was done so that the tinkling of the rings would warn passers by of the hoop's approach: [...] "Why do these <b>jingling</b> rings move about upon the rolling wheel? In order that the passers-by may {{get out of the way}} of the hoop."(14. CLXIX) He also indicates that the metal tires of wooden cart wheels could be used as hoops: [...] "A wheel must be protected. You make me a useful present. It will be a hoop to children, but to me a tyre for my wheel."(14. CLXVIII) Martial also mentions the sport was practised by Sarmatian boys, who rolled their hoops on the frozen Danube river.

2500|$|A Celtic {{belief is}} that at the full moon any silver coins on one's person should be jingled or turned over to prevent bad luck, also the silver coins would {{increase}} as the moon grew in size. A wish to a new moon could also be made, but not as seen through glass, <b>jingling</b> coins at the same time. American silver [...] "Mercury" [...] dimes, especially with a leap year date, are especially lucky. Gamblers' charms are often these dimes, Mercury being the Roman god who ruled the crossroads, games of chance, etc. Although these dimes actually figure the head of Liberty, people commonly mistake it for Mercury. A silver dime worn at the throat will supposedly turn black if someone tries to poison your food or drink. American [...] "Indian Head" [...] cents are worn as amulets to ward off evil or negative spirits. In Spain a bride places a silver coin from her father in one shoe and a gold coin from her mother in the other. This will ensure that she will never want for anything. Silver coins were placed in Christmas puddings and birthday cakes to bring good luck and wealth. A variation on this custom was that in some families each member added a coin to the pudding bowl, making a wish as they did so. If their coin turned up in their bowl it's said their wish was sure to come true. In Greece, a coin is added to vasilopita, a bread baked in honor of the feast day of St. Basil the Great. At midnight {{the sign of the cross}} is etched with a knife across the cake, to bless the house and bring good luck for the new year. A piece is sliced for each member of the family and any visitors present at the time, and the person who gets the slice with the coin will receive good luck, and often a gift.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Brad Delson {{experimented with}} an EBow when {{the band was}} piecing {{together}} [...] "The Little Things Give You Away". The band decided {{not to use the}} effect for the solo in that song and instead ended up creating [...] "No More Sorrow" [...] out of the effect. In [...] "Given Up", he jingles the keys that are heard while several clap sounds are overlaid in the intro of the song (as mentioned in the lyric book: Brad added the sounds on the intro song: multiple tracks of claps - and keys <b>jingling.).</b> Shinoda and Delson teamed up with David Campbell to add string elements to six songs; [...] "Leave Out All the Rest", [...] "Shadow of the Day", [...] "Hands Held High", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", as well as the two b-sides [...] "No Roads Left" [...] and [...] "Blackbirds" [...] (which was instead later used in the iPhone game 8-Bit Rebellion! as well as being included as a bonus track for A Thousand Suns), respectively. All scratching elements by Joe Hahn that existed in the previous two studio albums are largely absent because of the low mixing, except on the songs [...] "What I've Done", [...] "Wake", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] and [...] "In Pieces". Hahn contributes more with programming, electronics, and other elements to many of the songs. The church organ and military drumbeat on [...] "Hands Held High" [...] were originally to be used as the backdrop to melodic vocals, but Rubin recommended that the band try the opposite approach according to the album booklet. For the album, the band recorded fifty to sixty songs in August 2006. Their previous albums took only about three to six months to complete, while this one took 14 months. They spent over six months writing the songs. In previous albums, they composed an average of 40 songs, but they made over 100 this time. [...] "Shadow of the Day" [...] is one of two songs (the other being [...] "No Roads Left") to have Bennington playing the guitar. During live performances, Shinoda is generally playing the keyboard for [...] "Shadow of the Day", while Bennington plays rhythm guitar. Shinoda stated in an interview: [...] "We were looking back at the things that we had done in the past... and I think we just figured that we had exhausted that sound.
