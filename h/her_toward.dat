25|$|Alternatively, {{people may}} {{themselves}} conclude {{that a given}} self-view is dysfunctional or obsolete and take steps to change it. Consider, for example, a woman who decides that her negative self-views have led her to tolerate abusive relationship partners. When she realizes that such partners are making her miserable, she may seek therapy. In {{the hands of a}} skilled therapist, she may develop more favorable self-views which, in turn, steer <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> more positive relationship partners with whom she may cultivate healthier relationships. Alternatively, when a woman who is uncertain about her negative self-concept enters a relationship with a partner who is certain that she deserves to view herself more positively, that woman will tend to improve the self-concept.|$|E

When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E

Henry met <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> {{the end of}} World War II when they were working as medical {{personnel}} {{near one of the}} Nazi concentration camps. Over the years, she worked as a nurse {{in addition to being a}} housewife. The latest time period in which Abigail has been shown is 1982, when she was still married to Henry but looked a generation older than him (Janet Zarish); in 1984, she vanished without a trace despite Henry's best efforts to find her. Henry has acknowledged that the end of his relationship with Abigail caused him a lot of pain that prevents him from dating anyone for whom he has real feelings. In the episode [...] "The Night in Question", Henry learns from Adam that Abigail killed herself after a car crash to prevent Adam from finding Henry. [...] Abigail appears in ten episodes.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News {{wrote that}} [...] "Sorry" [...] is the [...] "album's strongest track" [...] {{and that it}} is a [...] "Pet Shop Boys-esque" [...] song. Vineyard {{went on to say that}} it [...] "...wistfully evokes the sounds of the '80s-era dance clubs that first lofted <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> stardom." [...] According to a review in the BBC's Collective, [...] "New single 'Sorry' states Queen Madge's unapologetic stance, and though the song is wrapped up in {{relationship}} sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics: 'there are more important things than hearing you speak'." [...] Alan Braidwood from BBC Music called the song [...] "lethally catchy". Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons' 1980 song [...] "Can You Feel It". The song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of 2006. In a review of [...] "Sorry" [...] from Virgin Media, it wrote that the song's musicscape features an [...] "infectious combo of pumping, filtered synths and disco beats". Keith Caulfield from Billboard commented that, [...] " [...] should keep fans hung up on Madonna's ability to create instant radio and club classics." [...] He also called the song [...] "springy" [...] while reviewing the album.|$|E

500|$|Brian Lowry for Variety, however, {{criticized the}} episode. He wrote that Lynch's {{performance}} was [...] "fitfully funny but usually just plain annoying", calling the pregnancy subplot [...] "credulity-straining". Lowry praised Colfer and Michele, however {{stated that the}} show's talent was squandered by its [...] "jokey, cartoonish, wildly uneven tone". He deemed the show a [...] "one-hit wonder", writing that: [...] "the musical numbersgenerally less infectious and buoyant than the first time outcan’t compensate for overly broad characterizations and absurdly soapy situations." [...] Robert Bianco for USA Today gave a mixed review, commenting: [...] "It {{would be better if}} Glee had more control and fewer abrupt tonal shifts, but that's not the Glee we're getting — and maybe it wouldn't be Glee at all. It's not perfect, but in a sea of procedural conformity, Glee is its own weird, often enchanting little island escape." [...] While Hank Stuever for The Washington Post praised the show's inclusion of adult storylines alongside teenage drama, Robert Lloyd for the Los Angeles Times felt that the adult characters [...] "tend more to caricature than character", writing of Sue that: [...] "the writing flattens <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> a single note. She's funny from line to line, but there is little to her besides tin-pot contrariness." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan commented similarly: [...] "there's one big flaw in Glee [...] and it may be a harbinger of bad things to come. Will's wife, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), manages to drain all the fun out of Glee every time she appears." [...] Ryan received the younger cast more positively, stating that there were [...] "no weak links", and praising Colfer and Michele in particular.|$|E

He had left her but one way out of the difficulty, and it was dangerous; but gauging the quality of her {{antagonist}} she was content to take the risks.

2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted {{daughter}} of a rich Bohemian-born noble. Having learned in August 1835 that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant {{that she would have}} no dowry, and fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a [...] "day-labourer", Schumann made a complete break with <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays; he summarily forbade them further meetings and ordered all correspondence between them burnt.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the singer}} {{was not always}} sweet and {{friendly}} towards women. When Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of Joan Crawford, visited Presley, they were watching Bonanza in the TV room. [...] "Elvis had been puffing on a cigar ... as Christina tickled him and kidded around, apparently seeking more direct attention." [...] Suddenly, as Buzz Cason relates, [...] "she slung the contents of her cocktail glass right into Elvis's face. ... The cigar went 'phhhtttt' and he jumped up. ... He grabbed her by the hair. 'Get this bitch out of here!' he screamed, leading <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> the front door as she struggled {{to keep up with}} the rather quick pace as he was pulling her locks. Turmoil ensued as the 'boys' scrambled to assist trying to prevent too big of a scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 8, 1731, Edwards preached in Boston the [...] "Public Lecture" [...] {{afterwards}} published {{under the}} title [...] "God Glorified in the Work of Redemption, by the Greatness of Man's Dependence upon Him, in the Whole of It," [...] which was his first public attack on Arminianism. The emphasis of the lecture was on God's absolute sovereignty {{in the work of}} salvation: that while it behooved God to create man pure and without sin, it was of his [...] "good pleasure" [...] and [...] "mere and arbitrary grace" [...] for him to grant any person the faith necessary to incline him or <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> holiness, and that God might deny this grace without any disparagement to any of his character. In 1733, a Protestant revival began in Northampton and reached an intensity in the winter of 1734 and the following spring, that it threatened the business of the town. In 6 months, nearly 300 of 1100 youths were admitted to the church.|$|E
