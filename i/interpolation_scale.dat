A corresponding result, in restricted generality, is shown if the left hand side (X 0, X 1) is reduced to a single space.

40|$|A multiresolution {{analysis}} is a nested chain of related approximation spaces. This nesting in turn implies relationships among interpolation {{bases in the}} approximation spaces and their derived wavelet spaces. Using these relationships, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for existence of interpolation wavelets, via analysis of the corresponding scaling functions. It is also shown that any interpolation function for an approximation space {{plays the role of}} a special type of <b>scaling</b> function (an <b>interpolation</b> <b>scaling</b> function) when the corresponding family of approximation spaces forms a multiresolution analysis. Based on these <b>interpolation</b> <b>scaling</b> functions, a new algorithm is proposed for constructing corresponding interpolation wavelets (when they exist in a multiresolution analysis). In simulations, our theorems are tested for several typical wavelet spaces, demonstrating our theorems for existence of interpolation wavelets and for constructing them in a general multiresolution analysis...|$|R

40|$|In this Thesis, {{we study}} the real {{interpolation}} of Sobolev spaces and its applications. It {{is composed of}} two parts. In the first part, we prove in the first chapter that the non homogenous (resp. homogeneous) Sobolev spaces W^ 1 _p defined on a complete Riemannian manifold satisfying the doubling property and admitting a Poincare inequality, form a real <b>interpolation</b> <b>scale</b> on an interval of values of p. We extend this result to other geometric frame. In a second chapter, we compare different Sobolev spaces defined on the euclidean cone {{and see how they}} behave with repect to the interpolation. With this example, we show tha Poincaré inequality is not a necessary condition to interpolate sobolev spaces. In the last chapter of this part, we define the non homogeneous (resp. homogeneous) Sobolev spaces W^ 1 _p,V associated to positif potential V on a Riemmanian manifold. We prove that if the manifold satisfies the doubling property and admits a Poincaré inequality and if V belongs to a Reverse Holder class, these Sobolev spaces form a real <b>interpolation</b> <b>scale</b> on an interval of values of p. We also extend this result to the case of Lie groups. In the second part, in the first chapter in collaboration with E.

Previous {{research has shown}} that good enhancement is most easily achieved when there are a large number of data points contained within the radius of gyration of the system point spread function.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{contains}} sharp {{estimates for}} the small-time behaviour of a natural class of one-parameter semigroups in free probability theory. We prove that the free Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup Ut, when restricted to the free Segal-Bargmann (holomorphic) space H 0 introduced in [K] and [Bi 1], is ultracontractive with optimal bound ‖Ut: H 2 0 → H ∞ 0 ‖ ∼ t − 1.

If {{we focus on the}} case of Hilbert spaces obtained from the <b>interpolation</b> <b>scale</b> of ℓ_p spaces, then Z^(2) becomes the well-known Kalton-Peck Z_ 2 space; we then show that Z^(n) is (or embeds in, or is a quotient of) a twisted Hilbert space only if n= 1, 2, which solves a problem posed by David Yost; and that it does not contain ℓ_ 2 complemented unless n= 1.

This paper provides an overview of interpolation of Banach and Hilbert spaces, with a focus on establishing when equivalence of norms is in fact equality of norms in the key results of the theory.

We also prove that if S ⊂ Lp is a subspace, every regular operator u: S → Lp admits a regular extension ũ: Lp → Lp with the same regular norm. This extends a result due to Mireille Lévy in the case p = 1. Finally, we apply these ideas to the Hardy space Hp viewed as a subspace of Lp on the circle. We show that the space of regular operators from Hp to Lp possesses a similar interpolation property as the spaces Rp defined above...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Interpolative {{reasoning}} {{does not}} only help reduce the complexity of fuzzy models but also makes inference in sparse rule-based systems possible. This paper presents an interpolative reasoning method by means of scale and move transformations. It {{can be used to}} interpolate fuzzy rules involving complex polygon, Gaussian or other bell-shaped fuzzy membership functions. The method works by first constructing a new inference rule via manipulating two given adjacent rules, and then by using scale and move transformations to convert the intermediate inference results into the final derived conclusions. This method has three advantages thanks to the proposed transformations: 1) it can handle interpolation of multiple antecedent variables with simple computation; 2) it guarantees the uniqueness as well as normality and convexity of the resulting interpolated fuzzy sets; and 3) it suggests a variety of definitions for representative values, providing a degree of freedom to meet different requirements. Comparative experimental studies are provided to demonstrate the potential of this method.

40|$|The paper {{makes the}} first steps into the study of {{extensions}} ("twisted sums") of noncommutative L^p-spaces regarded as Banach modules over the underlying von Neumann algebra M. Our approach combines Kalton's description of extensions by centralizers (these are certain maps which are, in general, neither linear nor bounded) with a general principle, due to Rochberg and Weiss saying that whenever one finds a given Banach space Y as an intermediate space in a (complex) <b>interpolation</b> <b>scale,</b> one automatically gets a self-extension 0 ⟶ Y⟶ X⟶ Y ⟶ 0. For semifinite algebras, considering L^p=L^p(M,τ) as an interpolation space between M and its predual M_* one arrives at a certain self-extension of L^p that {{is a kind of}} noncommutative Kalton-Peck space and carries a natural bimodule structure. Some interesting properties of these spaces are presented. For general algebras, including those of type III, the interpolation mechanism produces two (rather than one) extensions of one sided modules, one of left-modules and the other of right-modules. Whether or not one can find (nontrivial) self-extensions of bimodules in all cases is left open...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 72) Two {{laboratory experiments}} {{were conducted to}} estimate the strength of effect of eight independent variables, and some two-way interactions, on the speed and accuracy of reading moving-pointer, fixed-scale dials. Additional objectives were {{to determine if the}} black-white relationship of the scale markers and dial background affects dial-reading performance or subject preferences, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} screening designs in meeting the first objective. Eight subjects were assigned to each of two screening designs in each of the two experiments. Each screening design tested 16 out of a possible 256 conditions. Slides of dials with black scales, pointer, and other symbols against a white background were used in Experiment I. White-on-black dials were used in Experiment II. The results were very similar across screening designs and experiments. Scales which progressed in increments of 10 or 20 were read faster and more accurately than scales with progressions of 8 or 16. Also, dials were easier to read if no interpolation was required, but the effect of numerical progression was far stronger. There was a tendency for scales with scale unit lengths twice that of the recommended minimum to be easier to read than those of minimum recommended length. Scale orientation, marker width, pointer design, clutter, and scale number location had weak to trivial effects. Two-way interactions could not be isolated with confidence. It was concluded that the same factors affect the reading of black-on-white and white-on-black dials to about the same extent, and that the factors with the strongest effects (numerical progression, <b>interpolation,</b> <b>scale</b> unit length) should be included in a follow-on experiment. Also, screening designs like the ones used in these experiments can be used to estimate the strength of main effects but may not be as useful for isolating two-way interactions...|$|E

An LCD has to scale up a smaller image {{to fit into the}} area of the native resolution. This is the same principle as taking a smaller image in an image editing program and enlarging it; the smaller image loses its sharpness when it is expanded. This is especially problematic as most resolutions are in a 4:3 aspect ratio (640×480, 800×600, 1024×768, 1280×960, 1600×1200) but there are odd resolutions that are not, notably 1280×1024. If a user were to map 1024×768 to a 1280×1024 screen there would be distortion as well as some image errors, as there is not a one-to-one mapping with regard to pixels.

40|$|Abstract. Streamline {{methods have}} {{shown to be}} {{effective}} for reservoir simulation. For a regular grid, {{it is common to}} use the semi-analytical Pollock’s method to obtain streamlines and time-of-flight coordinates (TOF). The usual way of handling irregular grids is by trilinear transformation of each grid cell to a unit cube together with a linear flux <b>interpolation</b> <b>scaled</b> by the Jacobian. The flux interpolation allows for fast integration of streamlines, but is inaccurate even for uniform flow. To improve the tracing accuracy, we introduce a new interpolation method, which we call corner velocity interpolation. Instead of interpolating the velocity field based on discrete fluxes at cell edges, the new method interpolates directly from reconstructed point velocities given at the corner points in the grid. This allows for reproduction of uniform flow, and eliminates the influence of cell geometries on the velocity field. Using several numerical examples, we demonstrate that the new method is more accurate than the standard tracing methods. 1...|$|R

Borland Delphi 6. 0 is used for the programming language. The software testing results show that a cross stitch pattern with the comparison ratio of the pattern size and the original picture size is more or equal to 100 %, will look like the original picture even though the variation color is low. But if the comparison size ratio is less than 100 %, then the similarity between the cross stitch pattern and the original picture depends on the color variation of the pattern. If there are many colors used on the pattern, the pattern will look more like the original picture.
