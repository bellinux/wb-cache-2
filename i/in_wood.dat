5|$|All the {{stations}} {{along the line}} were designed by Paul Armin Due, with all but the terminal station built <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> Flekkefjord Station was built as a three-story brick building in Art Nouveau. In addition, there was construction a depot and a wharf at Flekkefjord. Passengers could transfer to steam ship services that operated eastwards along the south coast towards Oslo.|$|E
5|$|By the 1870s, Chicago {{had become}} the main {{financial}} center for the West, but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed {{the majority of the}} wooden structures within city. The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new grid network and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{involved}} {{the demolition of}} a number of buildings, primarily the existing National Stadium (Cardiff Arms Park), Wales Empire Pool (swimming pool) <b>in</b> <b>Wood</b> Street, Cardiff Empire Telephone Exchange building (owned by BT) in Park Street, the newly built Territorial Auxiliary & Volunteer Reserve building in Park Street, and the Social Security offices in Westgate Street.|$|E

5|$|Mutinus elegans is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down dead or dying organic matter. It is {{commonly found in}} gardens and farm areas enriched with manure, near well-decayed stumps and logs, and <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> chips. A Japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in Takatsuki and Osaka-fu, where it fruited in November and December on the ground along paths or in open spaces, under or near bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) and hardwoods such as the Sawtooth Oak, the Japanese Zelkova, and the Camphor tree.|$|E

40|$|Inter-tracheid and cross-filed pit {{specifications}} <b>in</b> compression <b>wood</b> {{and opposite}} wood of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were determined. Fewer pits of a smaller size {{and a smaller}} aperture diameter were observed <b>in</b> compression <b>wood.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the uniseriate arrangement of bordered pit pairs <b>in</b> compression <b>wood,</b> both uniseriate and biseriate pits were observed <b>in</b> opposite <b>wood.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the circular view of the pit aperture <b>in</b> opposite <b>wood,</b> a slit-like pit aperture was often observed <b>in</b> compression <b>wood.</b> SEM images showed a number of helical fissures on the tracheid walls and bordered pits of compression wood along the microfibril angle in the S 2 layer. The cross-field pits <b>in</b> compression <b>wood</b> were dominantly piceoid but sometimes cupressoid and occasionally taxodioid, whereas they were mostly piceoid and occasionally cupressoid <b>in</b> opposite <b>wood.</b> Overall, some {{significant differences in the}} inter-tracheid and cross-field pitting between the compression wood and opposite wood can give some explanations for their different air permeability and drying kinetics found in the previous studies...|$|R

5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is typically}} inoffensive towards humans, but if disturbed, can inflict a severe bite. Across {{much of its}} range, it is a frequent catch (intentional or not) in bottom trawls and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets; the meat is eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> finishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves <b>in</b> <b>Wood</b> River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack <b>in</b> <b>Wood</b> River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of the pack.|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{tests were}} {{performed}} in the main directions at 300 kHz in poplar and spruce reaction wood and normal wood. The experiments were conducted on 2 x 2 x 10 cm 3 specimens selected from the pith to the bark. The same phase velocity values were measured <b>in</b> poplar tension <b>wood</b> and normal <b>wood.</b> <b>In</b> compression <b>wood,</b> the phase velocity was lower in the longitudinal direction and higher in the transverse direction. The group velocity measured in the longitudinal direction <b>in</b> tension <b>wood</b> was greater than <b>in</b> normal <b>wood,</b> but lower values were obtained <b>in</b> compression <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> comparison to those obtained <b>in</b> normal <b>wood.</b> The results showed that wave attenuation cannot be significantly affected by the structural properties of reaction wood. A better wave energy transfer pathway (RMS voltage) was found in poplar and spruce reaction <b>wood</b> than <b>in</b> normal <b>wood.</b> Acoustic radiation <b>in</b> reaction <b>wood</b> of both species was lower than levels obtained <b>in</b> normal <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> all anisotropic directions. The results obtained when comparing reaction wood and normal wood of both species indicated that sound velocity decreased as moisture content increased, but the attenuation coefficients increased slightly.

5|$|The {{station was}} opened on 10 June 1908, {{along with the}} rest of the central portion of the Bergen Line. The station {{building}} was of the Mountain Station Variant 1 type, designed by Paul Due. This made it identical to Mjølfjell Station, and with only slight variations to Haugastøl Station, Finse Station and Myrdal Station. During construction, NSB built several buildings for their staff. Two of the houses and an assembly building have been preserved. They were built in 1900 and represent an example of buildings from the construction time. One is partially built in stone, partially <b>in</b> <b>wood,</b> while the other two are entirely <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> All are now used as cabins. The sick ward for the navvys was bought by Kari Maristuen in 1909 converted to a hotel, named Fjellstova.|$|E
5|$|Across the German Empire nagelfiguren, war {{memorials}} {{made from}} iron nails embedded <b>in</b> <b>wood,</b> became popular, particularly in Austria. These took various forms, including knights, shields, eagles and crosses, {{as well as}} submarines. This practice had medieval origins, and the memorials were reinforced by the promotion of burgfrieden during the war, a medieval pact in which disparate German communities would put aside their differences during a conflict. In some cases, relatives of the deceased were encouraged to hammer memorial nails in {{as part of the}} ceremonies, while children might be encouraged to read out poems in a medieval style. At some nagelfiguren a charge was made for each nail used, with the revenues donated to charities supporting soldiers, orphans and others affected by the conflict.|$|E

Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E
5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E
