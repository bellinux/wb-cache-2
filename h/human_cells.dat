Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E

5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} proteasome was identified in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> that lack the α3 core subunit. These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. Interestingly, these alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> and nearly 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In <b>human</b> <b>cells,</b> telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus infects <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as}} the {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E

5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide {{differences were found}} between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into <b>human</b> <b>cells,</b> the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E
5|$|In <b>human</b> <b>cells,</b> and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

40|$|Summary Resource data {{across the}} 76 cell types from FANTOM 5 {{analysed}} in our paper titled "Transcriptional decomposition reveals active chromatin architectures and cell specific regulatory interactions". Project abstract Gene transcription {{is influenced by}} favourable chromosome positioning and chromatin architectures bringing regulatory elements in close proximity. However, it is unclear to what extent transcription is attributable to topological organisation or to gene-specific regulatory programs. Here, we develop a strategy to transcriptionally decompose expression data into two main components reflecting the positional relationship of neighbouring transcriptional units and effects independent from their positioning. We demonstrate that the positionally dependent component is highly informative of topological domain activity and organisation, revealing boundaries and chromatin compartments. Furthermore, features derived from transcriptional components can accurately predict individual chromatin interactions. We systematically investigate regulatory interactions and observe different transcriptional attributes governing long- and short-range interactions. Finally, we assess differences in regulatory organisations across 76 <b>human</b> <b>cell</b> types. In all, we demonstrate a close relationship between transcription and topological chromatin architecture and provide an unprecedented resource for investigations of regulatory organisations across cell types.
