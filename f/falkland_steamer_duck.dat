50|$|The <b>Falkland</b> <b>steamer</b> <b>duck</b> (Tachyeres brachypterus) is a steamer duck {{native to}} the Falkland Islands in the {{southern}} Atlantic Ocean. It {{is one of only}} two bird species to be endemic to the Falkland Islands, the other being Cobb's wren.|$|E
5000|$|The Falkland steamer duck's {{wings are}} very short (hence the {{scientific}} name: brachy = [...] "short", and pteron = [...] "wing"), {{and it is}} incapable of flight. The plumage of the <b>Falkland</b> <b>steamer</b> <b>duck</b> is mostly dark grey, but with a white stripe behind the eye. It {{is very difficult to}} distinguish from the flying steamer duck in the field since they occupy the same habitat and, although the flying steamer duck can fly, it rarely does.|$|E
50|$|Bird include Darwin's rhea (Rhea pennata), Patagonian tinamou (Tinamotis ingoufi), {{black-chested buzzard-eagle}} (Geranoaetus melanoleucus), {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), band-winged nightjar (Systellura longirostris), Patagonian mockingbird (Mimus patagonicus) and Patagonian yellow finch (Sicalis lebruni).Endemic birds found {{north of the}} strait include hooded grebe (Podiceps gallardoi), Magellanic plover (Pluvianellus socialis), chocolate-vented tyrant (Neoxolmis rufiventris), white-bridled finch (Melanodera melanodera), short-billed miner (Geositta antarctica), ruddy-headed goose (Chloephaga rubidiceps) and striated caracara (Phalcoboenus australis).The striated caracara (Phalcoboenus australis) and blackish cinclodes (Cinclodes antarcticus) are found in Tierra del Fuego. Endemic birds in the Falklands are the <b>Falkland</b> <b>steamer</b> <b>duck</b> (Tachyeres brachypterus) and Cobb's wren (Troglodytes cobbi). The Falklands are also important for seabirds such as gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua).|$|E

50|$|The {{total number}} of species {{recorded}} on Bird Island in November 1998 was 27, of which 25 bred or were probably breeding. Macaroni penguin, ruddy-headed goose, canary-winged finch, black-throated finch and <b>Falkland</b> <b>steamer</b> <b>duck</b> are present but their status is uncertain or populations {{are too small to}} qualify. The congregation of seabirds on this island exceeds 10,000 breeding pairs, making the site classifiable under the A4iii criterion. Bird Island {{is one of the most}} important breeding sites for the striated caracara and it is considered that the population here is at least as dense as on any offshore island around the Falklands, possibly due to the very large population of thin-billed prions, an important prey species.|$|E

40|$|Flying <b>Steamer</b> <b>Duck</b> Magellanic Flightless <b>Steamer</b> <b>Duck</b> <b>Falkland</b> Flightless <b>Steamer</b> <b>Duck</b> The South American <b>steamer</b> <b>ducks</b> have {{at times}} been {{included}} with the shelducks, but differ enough from them in structure and behavior {{to be regarded as}} a separate but closely related tribe. There are three species very similar in appearance; two are essentially flightless. All are found off the coasts of southern South America and the Falkland Islands, where they feed on mollusks and other marine invertebrates. The males differ slightly from females in their plumage and vocalizations, but in both sexes iridescent coloration is totally lacking and only a simple white speculum is present on the wings. Like the shelducks, however, they are highly aggressive during social display activities. The downy young to some extent resemble those of shelducks, but have less spotting and less contrasting coloration...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>steamer</b> <b>ducks</b> are a genus (Tachyeres) {{of ducks}} {{in the family}} Anatidae. All of the four species occur at the {{southern}} cone of South America in Chile and Argentina, and all except the flying <b>steamer</b> <b>duck</b> are flightless; even this one species capable of flight rarely takes to the air. The genus name Tachyeres, [...] "having fast oars" [...] or [...] "fast rower", comes from Ancient Greek ταχυ- [...] "fast" [...] + ἐρέσσω [...] "I row (as with oars)". The common name [...] "steamer ducks" [...] arose because, when swimming fast, they flap their wings into the water as well as using their feet, creating an effect like a paddle steamer. They can be aggressive and are capable of chasing off predators like petrels.|$|R
