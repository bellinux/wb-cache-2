5000|$|Blu and Exile {{first met}} in the mid-2000s while Blu was serving as a hype man for various hip hop groups {{including}} Slum Village, Platinum Pied Pipers, and Exile's own group, Emanon.

[...] Tulisa responded by telling Barlow to [...] "lay off the red wine because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> really <b>smell</b> that as well."

5000|$|In a Rolling Stone article, Jim James {{described}} the song as the [...] "essence of love.

50|$|He also {{linked the}} idea of a {{leadership}} structure directly to abuse of power. His September 2007 keynote speech took up this theme:what is power? You can't touch it or taste it. Sometimes <b>I</b> think you <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> it, like wealth or sewage, and if it is piled up in one place it stinks like rotten cod. For it to smell sweet, we need to spread it around. For power to be creative, we need to spread it around.Collecting power in one place is like collecting money in a mega billion bank account, the work of a miser, a misery, a self obsessed fanatic. Green politics is about giving everyone power.|$|R

30|$|Where {{this book}} shines {{is in the}} well-wrought ethnographic {{accounts}} and the descriptions of the landscape, where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> almost <b>smell</b> the dust, mesquite and Tecatea mingled with horse dander and machismo. Please, Dr. Perramond, next time lose the ‘hegemonic’, ‘Foucauldian’ and ‘neo-liberal’ language; focus on the lovely and deep data that you collected so painstakingly; and {{make the most of}} it with your story-telling. The points you hoped to make would be clearer and penetrate deeper if they were more solidly grounded in the evidence and ethnographic narrative, and less tethered to the jargon du jure of your field. I am still pining to know the depth of substance of those years of interviews and observations, especially the local knowledge that was alluded to but never quite revealed. As it is, this book is an important reference for scholars of pastoralism and ranching in the region, especially anthropologists and geographers (the stated audience), but does not hold much for ranchers, or wayward range scientists like me.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Classic Rock Presents AOR, released in December 2010, Perry revealed that he had written many new songs and was contemplating his first solo project since 1994. [...] "A {{little over a year}} and a half ago, I felt I could maybe come back to it, I have been writing. I have about 50 songs in a little over a year. I never thought I would do it again, but I decided to open up that room and see what I could find. It's been interesting. Some of it sounds familiar, some of it sounds contemporary, some of it you can't put a label on—and I've never been big on labels anyway." [...] Perry is reluctant however to put a timescale on his return. [...] "I'll be honest, I don't really know how to do that, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> definitely <b>smell</b> a solo project on the horizon. I will be recording some music." ...|$|R
