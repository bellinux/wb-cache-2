500|$|Jack Matlock, US {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a [...] "clear commitment" [...] not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the oral impression by diplomats like Hans-Dietrich Genscher and James Baker that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland. In 1996, Gorbachev wrote in his Memoirs, that [...] "during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east," [...] and repeated this view {{in an interview in}} 2008. However, in 2014, <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>said</b> [...] "The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all , and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either." [...] Eduard Shevardnadze, foreign minister of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991, has always maintained that [...] "NATO’s expansion beyond German borders never came up for negotiation." [...] According to Robert Zoellick, a State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made.|$|E
500|$|General Secretary <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>said</b> of {{his former}} rival's Cold War role: [...] " [...] {{a man who was}} {{instrumental}} in bringing {{about the end of the}} Cold War," [...] and deemed him [...] "a great president." [...] Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric. Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, [...] "he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform." [...] She later said, [...] "Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired." [...] Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada: [...] "He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [...]" [...] Former President Lech Wałęsa of Poland acknowledged, [...] "Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse." [...] That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power. President Harry S. Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the USSR, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.|$|E

2500|$|While he {{may have}} been the de jure leader of Afghanistan, Soviet {{advisers}} still did the majority of work when Najibullah took power. As Gorbachev remarked [...] "We're still doing everything ourselves [...] That's all our people know how to do. They've tied Najibullah hand and foot." [...] Fikryat Tabeev, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, was accused of acting like a governor general by Gorbachev. Tabeev was recalled from Afghanistan in July 1986, but while Gorbachev called for the end of Soviet management of Afghanistan, he could not help but to do some managing himself. At a Soviet Politburo meeting, <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>said</b> [...] "It's difficult to build a new building out of old material [...] I hope to God that we haven't made a mistake with Najibullah." [...] As time would prove, the problem was that Najibullah's aim were the opposite of the Soviet Union's; Najibullah was opposed to a Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union wanted a Soviet withdrawal. This was logical, considering the fact that the Afghan military was on the brink of dissolution. The only means of survival seemed to Najibullah was to retain the Soviet presence. In July 1986 six regiments, which consisted up to 15,000 troops, were withdrawn from Afghanistan. The aim of this early withdrawal was, according to Gorbachev, to show the world that the Soviet leadership was serious about leaving Afghanistan. The Soviets told the United States Government that they were planning to withdraw, but the United States Government didn't believe it. When Gorbachev met with Ronald Reagan during his visit the United States, Reagan called, bizarrely, for the dissolution of the Afghan army.|$|E

Reagan argued that his proposed SDI research was allowed by any reasonable interpretation of the ABM treaty, {{and that he could}} not forget the pledge he made to Americans to investigate whether SDI was viable.

5000|$|The Political Bureau (Politburo), {{known as}} the Presidium from 1952 to 1966, was the highest party organ when the Congress and the Central Committee were not in session. Until the 19th Conference in 1988, the Politburo {{alongside}} the Secretariat controlled appointments and dismissals nationwide. In the post-Stalin period, the Politburo controlled the Central Committee apparatus through two channels; the General Department distributed the Politburo's orders to the Central Committee departments and through the personnel overlap which existed within the Politburo and the Secretariat. This personnel overlap gave the CPSU General Secretary a way of strengthening his position within the Politburo through the Secretariat. Kirill Mazurov, Politburo member from 1965 to 1978, accused Brezhnev of turning the Politburo into a [...] "second echelon" [...] of power. He accomplished this by discussing policies before Politburo meetings with Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, Fyodor Kulakov and Dmitriy Ustinov among others, who held seats both in the Politburo and the Secretariat. Mazurov's claim was later verified by Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers under <b>Gorbachev.</b> Ryzhkov <b>said</b> that Politburo meetings lasted only 15 minutes because the people close to Brezhnev had already decided {{what was to be}} approved.|$|R

In 1985, Tennison knocked on {{the doors of the}} Ministry of Health of the USSR to try to get permission to bring the AA philosophy to the Soviet Union. Eventually, the request was taken to the USSR's new Party General Secretary, Mikhail <b>Gorbachev.</b> He reportedly <b>said,</b> [...] "Our problem is so great that we must try anything the west has to offer." [...] On April 10, 1986, the first ever AA meeting was held in Kiev, Ukraine by 20 southern California recovering alcoholics, and within three days the second AA meeting was held in Moscow. The starting of AA was a bit rocky in the beginning, but they celebrated AA's twentieth anniversary in Russia in 2006.|$|R
500|$|At the 23rd Party Congress in 1966, Brezhnev {{told the}} delegates that the Soviet {{military}} {{had reached a}} level fully sufficient to defend the country. The Soviet Union reached ICBM parity with the United States that year. In early 1977, Brezhnev told {{the world that the}} Soviet Union did not seek to become superior to the United States in nuclear weapons, nor to be militarily superior in any sense of the word. In the later years of Brezhnev's reign, it became official defense policy to only invest enough to maintain military deterrence, and by the 1980s, Soviet defense officials were told again that investment would not exceed the level to retain national security. In his last meeting with Soviet military leaders in October 1982, Brezhnev stressed the importance of not over-investing in the Soviet military sector. This policy was retained during the rules of Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Mikhail <b>Gorbachev.</b> He also <b>said</b> that the time was opportune to increase the readiness of the armed forces even further. At the anniversary of the 1917 Revolution a few weeks later (Brezhnev's final public appearance), Western observers noted that the annual military parade featured only two new weapons and most of the equipment displayed was obsolete. Two days before his death, Brezhnev stated that any aggression against the Soviet Union [...] "would result in a crushing retaliatory blow".|$|R

5000|$|In September 1986 the National Compromise Commission (NCC) was {{established}} on {{the orders of}} Najibullah. The NCC's goal was to contact counter-revolutionaries [...] "in order to complete the Saur Revolution in its new phase." [...] An estimated 40,000 rebels were contacted by the government. At the end of 1986, Najibullah called for a six-month ceasefire and talks between the various opposition forces, {{as part of his}} policy of National Reconciliation. The discussions, if fruitful, would have led to the establishment of a coalition government and {{be the end of the}} PDPA's monopoly on power. The programme failed, but the government was able to recruit disillusioned mujahideen fighters as government militias. The National Reconciliation did lead an increasing number of urban dwellers to support his rule, and to the stabilisation of the Afghan defence forces.While Najibullah may have been the de jure leader of Afghanistan, Soviet advisers still did most of the work after Najibullah took power.

Gorbachev later confided to Anatoly Chernyaev, a personal advisor to Gorbachev, that the Soviet withdrawal would be criticised for creating a bloodbath which could have been averted if the Soviets stayed. During a Politburo meeting Eduard Shevardnadze said [...] "We will leave the country in a deplorable situation", and further talked about the economic collapse, and the need to keep at least 10 to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. In this Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, supported him. This stance, if implemented, would be a betrayal of the Geneva Accords just signed. During {{the second phase of the}} Soviet withdrawal, in 1989, Najibullah told Valentin Varennikov openly that he would do everything to slow down the Soviet departure. Varennikov in turn replied that such a move would not help, and would only lead to an international outcry against the war. Najibullah would repeat his position later that year, to a group of senior Soviet representatives in Kabul. This time Najibullah stated that Ahmad Shah Massoud was the main problem, and that he needed to be killed. In this, the Soviets agreed, but repeated that such a move would be a breach of the Geneva Accords; to hunt for Massoud so early on would disrupt the withdrawal, and would mean that the Soviet Union would fail to meet its deadline for withdrawal.|$|E
