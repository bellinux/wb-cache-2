5000|$|Coastal {{resource}} managers need {{an inventory}} of habitats and associated biota that are threatened by increasing development and encroachment along coastal areas, {{as well as the}} indirect effects of human activities. Coastal mapping efforts, such as ShoreZone, to a large extent fulfil these needs by providing physical and biological characterizations of the shoreline. The ShoreZone imagery and maps were originally intended as an oil spill response tool, and notably the data have been used in several emergency situations including the grounding in 2012 of the <b>drilling</b> <b>barge</b> Kulluk near Kodiak, Alaska. [...] Although the majority of users access only the imagery, the regional scale habitat attribute data have been used for ecological modelling and marine conservation planning. More recently the data are benefiting NOAA climate resilience studies. Recent improvements in quantifying habitat attributes allow for analytical studies such as estimating potential Blue Carbon resources of salt marshes. The imagery also has aesthetic appeal and is used for art exhibits, exploring, books, and story maps.|$|E

40|$|Documenting {{direct and}} {{indirect}} effects of environmental stressors on benthic marine communities requires incorporation of baseline and historical data. For instance, hydrocarbons from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon well explosion is impacting coastal areas long affected by natural hydrocarbon seeps, petroleum exploration and development, and other anthropogenic effects. In Louisiana, exploration in coastal areas {{that began in the}} 1920 s, expanded greatly with the development of the first mobile <b>drilling</b> <b>barge</b> in 1933. In total nearly 50, 000 wells are reported to have been drilled in the Gulf of Mexico region. Given this historical context, we are assessing pathways and rates at which hydrocarbons from the 2010 spill are incorporated into northern Gulf of Mexico coastal food webs using sclerochronological techniques to unlock the high-resolution records preserved within molluscan shells. We are using specimens collected from the early 20 th century through August 2010. We are examining changes in live history traits (growth rate, recruitment, mortality, reproduction) of a variety of primary consumer species, including the commercially important oyster Crassostrea virginica. The species range from epifaunal, sessile, filter feeders; to infaunal, mobile, deposit feeders; to epifaunal, mobile, omnivorous grazers. In this way, multiple pathways into coastal food webs are monitored. Because environmental perturbations are recorded on multiple scales by the accretionary growth of mollusk shells, we are monitoring the incorporation of crude oil components into shells, e. g., the trace metals V and Ni, and simultaneously measuring changes in growth rate, survivorship, and post-spill larval recruitment. Life-history parameters are calculated from ontogenetic δ 13 C and δ 18 O profiles of the mollusks 2 ̆ 7 shells. In this way, we will track secondary impacts (not related to fouling by direct contact) of hydrocarbons through trophic levels of the coastal ecosystem...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Wreck of the Kulluk" [...] is Deca's fourth story, {{written by}} McKenzie Funk, {{published}} in January, 2015. An excerpt {{of the book}} {{was published in the}} New York Times Magazine on December 30, 2014. The book is an account of the wreck of the Kulluk, a <b>drill</b> <b>barge</b> that was used for oil exploration in Arctic waters by the Royal Dutch Shell oil company. As easily accessible sources of oil become few and far between, Shell has invested $6 billion to push into more remote and dangerous places in pursuit of oil, sparking debate about unnecessary environmental and human risks. The story draws from dozens of interviews in Alaska and hundreds of pages of Coast Guard reports and oil industry documents. With a detailed account of the events leading up to the wreck and how the disaster unfolded, it explores the new frontier of energy everywhere from the cockpits of rescue helicopters in the Arctic to Washington D.C. to oil company boardrooms.

40|$|Building {{upon the}} successes of {{previous}} scientific ocean drilling programmes, the IODP offers scientists worldwide unprecedented opportunities to address {{a vast array of}} scientific problems in all submarine settings. The scientific advisory structure of the proposal-driven IODP recently planned the inaugural drilling expeditions, targeting critical scientific problems in the eastern Pacific, central Arctic, and north Atlantic Oceans in 2004 and 2005 (Figure 1, Table 1). Co-led by Japan and the United States, with initial significant contributions from the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD), the IODP is guided by an initial science plan, Earth, Oceans, and Life (www. iodp. org/isp. html), developed with broad input from the international geoscientific community. For the first time, scientists will have permanent riser and non-riser drilling vessels and mission- specific capabilities such as <b>drilling</b> <b>barges</b> and jack-up rigs for shallow water and Arctic drilling at their disposal. Japan is providing the new riser vessel, Chikyu, to the IODP beginning in 2006; the United States is supplying the non-riser drilling vessel, currently JOIDES Resolution, beginning in 2004; and ECORD is furnishing mission-specific platforms beginning in 2004. The planned IODP expeditions for 2004 and 2005 directly address principal themes of Earth, Oceans, and Life. ?

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{offshore}} petroleum activity and the likelihood that both the tortfeasor and the claimant of a potential incident participate in the petroleum activity results {{in one of the}} most characteristic features of the petroleum contract, namely contractual regulation of liability. The allocation of liability is often based on the knock-for-knock principle which basically means that the parties assume responsibility for any loss or damage incurred to their own property as well as for liability to certain third parties. Liability for loss is assumed regardless of how the loss is caused. Through regulations providing for distribution of liability in the contract the parties avoid the application of tort law as a basis for liability. This makes it easier for the parties in the activity to calculate risks and avoid costly lawsuits. As regards insurance, by using the knock-for-knock principle the parties avoid the risk being covered under two insurances, i. e. the claimant’s property insurance and the wrongdoer’s liability insurance. However, for the allocation of liability to be effective the assured’s contracting party must obtain specific rights under the insurance, e. g. protection against subrogation. This is because the insurer has a right of subrogation against the wrongdoer upon payment of compensation to the assured for a casualty covered by the insurance. The wrongdoer still needs liability cover of the risk if the claimant’s property insurer may pursue a tort claim against such a party. This thesis is a comparative study of the rights of third parties under the hull insurance of drilling vessels effected on chapter 18 of the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan 1996 (version 2010) and the London Standard <b>Drilling</b> <b>Barge</b> Form (All Risks). Moreover, it examines to what extent the insurance provisions arrange for a clear allocation of liability between the parties involved in the offshore drilling activity...|$|E
40|$|Documenting {{the effects}} of modern {{stressors}} on coastal benthic marine communities requires a combination of baseline historical data and modern dynamic data. E. g., landfall of hydrocarbons from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig and well explosion in the Gulf of Mexico is impacting coastal areas long affected by natural seepage, as well as petroleum exploration and development. In Louisiana, exploration in coastal areas {{that began in the}} 1920 s expanded greatly with the development of the first mobile <b>drilling</b> <b>barge</b> in 1933. In total nearly 50, 000 wells have been drilled in the Gulf of Mexico since the 1930 s. Given this historical context, we are assessing pathways and rates at which crude oil components from the 2010 spill are incorporated into northern Gulf of Mexico coastal food webs. Sclerochronological techniques are being used to unlock the high-resolution physical and chemical records preserved within mollusc shells. We are analyzing historical specimens collected from the late 19 th through late 20 th centuries, baseline specimens collected in May 2010 in Louisiana and Alabama before visible hydrocarbons were present, and specimens collected in August 2010 after hydrocarbons made landfall. We are examining changes in life history traits (growth rate, recruitment, mortality, reproduction) of the commercial oyster Crassostrea virginica, and other common, co-occurring molluscs that are primary and secondary consumers in Gulf of Mexico coastal food webs. The taxa include the marsh-dwelling gastropod Littoraria irrorata and mussel Geukensia demissa, and open-water species including the bivalves Ischadium recurvum and Tellina alternata. These consumers range from epifaunal, sessile, filter feeders; to infaunal, mobile, deposit feeders; to epifaunal, mobile, omnivorous grazers. In this way, multiple potential pathways into coastal food webs are being monitored. Because environmental perturbations of many scales are recorded by the accretionary growth of mollusc shells, we can monitor the sub-monthly incorporation of hydrocarbon components into shells, such as trace metals (e. g., V, Ni, Cu and Cr), while simultaneously measuring changes in shell growth rate. We will also measure concentrations of metals in soft tissues from specimens collected since May 2010. Trace metal concentrations will be determined using ICPMS. Annual and sub-annual growth rates will be calculated from δ 13 C and δ 18 O profiles derived from ontogentic sampling of the molluscs 2 ̆ 7 shells. The comparisons between historic, baseline and post-landfall specimens will allow us to assess the changing conditions of these species and their food webs as drilling expanded in the Gulf during the 20 th century, and therefore distinguish the immediate impact of the Deepwater Horizon spill from these background factors. In this way, we will also trace secondary impacts (not related to fouling by direct contact) of hydrocarbons through trophic levels of the coastal ecosystem...|$|E
