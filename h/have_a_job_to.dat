They excel at {{many types of}} sporting competitions, such as agility, dock diving and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, drive to work, and small size, make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance and a love for water.|$|E

[...] "I won't let this distract me from my duties as a congresswoman," [...] Schmidt told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon McEwen's announcement. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do. I can't worry about this." [...] Anti-pornography activist Phil Burress told the Associated Press that a race between Schmidt and McEwen would be tough. [...] "They are two totally different types of personalities. Bob is a statesman, and I love that. Jean will get in your face in a heartbeat, and I like that too," [...] said Burress. Also running were Deborah A. Kraus, who worked for the West Clermont school district's computer services department, and James E. Constable, who ran to protest the care his disabled son received from a state hospital.|$|E
500|$|Accordingly, the Germans cut theatrics {{from their}} goal celebrations; arms were raised {{but there was}} no jumping or {{screaming}} after scoring. Coach Joachim Löw stated his team had [...] "a clear, persistent game-plan", and as they realised Brazil were [...] "cracking up", they took advantage as in contrast to the Brazilians' nervousness the German players were [...] "extremely cool". Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in [...] "no game of the Cup, [...] played their best", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: [...] "we took all the balls, and scored the goals". Löw also declared the team had [...] "no euphoria" [...] during or after the game, as they knew that the 7–1 win meant nothing for the upcoming final, saying [...] "We didn't celebrate. We were happy, but we still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do".|$|E

50|$|These curs were bred to work, and if {{deprived}} {{of the opportunity to}} hunt, guard, or work around a farm they will grow anxious and bored. When they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do, these dogs are generally happy and obedient, and are able to get along well with children and other pets.|$|E

50|$|They {{are very}} social hunting dogs that prefer an outdoor environment, and need {{plenty of space}} to run free and get lots of exercise. In addition, they {{need a lot of}} mental and {{physical}} stimulation, as this breed is used <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do. These traits tend to prevent the breed from becoming popular companion dogs.|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Bass {{retired in}} 1943, and the {{institution}} {{went through a}} series of superintendents while the facility continued to expand.

2500|$|Irish Setters enjoy <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do. Lack of {{activity}} {{will lead to}} a bored, destructive, or even hyperactive dog.

Irish Setters respond swiftly to positive training and are highly intelligent.|$|R

5000|$|Fisher {{said of his}} movie, [...] "Inserts {{are above}} all instrumental. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do, and they do it; and they do little, if anything, else. Sometimes inserts are remarkably beautiful, but this beauty is usually hard to see because {{the only thing that}} {{registers}} is the news, the expository information, that the insert conveys... By chance, I learned that the root of 'parenthesis' is a Greek word that means the act of inserting. And so I was given the title of the film." ...|$|E

50|$|May {{brought the}} hotel workers' strike to its most rousing numbers, but it quickly began to dwindle in June. Since workers {{of color and}} local college {{students}} were hired as strikebreakers, many workers feared they would not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> return to {{and went back to}} the hotels, despite the poor working conditions. On June 11, 1912, the Bureau called a meeting between the Hotel Men's Association and the Hotel Workers' International Union to negotiate terms to end the strike, but the Hotel Men's Association ultimately refused to acknowledge them as a union.|$|E
5000|$|... "Phantasmagoria" [...] is a {{narrative}} discussion written in seven cantos between a ghost (a Phantom) {{and a man}} named Tibbets. Carroll portrays the ghost as {{not so different from}} human beings: although ghosts may jibber and jangle their chains, they, like us, simply <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do and that job is to haunt. Just as in our society, in ghost society there is a hierarchy, and ghosts are answerable to the King (who must be addressed as “Your Royal Whiteness”) if they disregard the [...] "Maxims of Behaviour”.|$|E

5000|$|Blackthorne was {{established}} in 1985 by husband-and-wife team Steve Schanes and Ann Fera, formerly associated with Pacific Comics (which {{had gone out of}} business in 1984).

Since I could not locate enough work where I was living, I decided to start up another company, so I borrowed on my credit cards and started Blackthorne." [...] Schanes and Fera raised $16,000 to start Blackthorne (naming the company after the street on which they lived), mostly using their credit cards.|$|E

[...] It was later stated by Newcastle chairman Christopher Mort that Redknapp [...] "was interviewed for the job but he was only {{one of a number of}} people we were speaking to at that time", and at the time of Redknapp's interview the club had already been in secret talks with the eventual appointee, Kevin Keegan, for a week.|$|E
5000|$|This breed's {{standard}} temperament is {{best described}} as a [...] "Gentleman by Nature". However, {{it can also be}} strong-willed and mischievous, especially if coming from working/field breeding lines. English Setters are energetic, people-oriented dogs, that are well suited to families who can give them attention and activity, or to working with a hunter, where they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do. They are active dogs that need plenty of exercise and up to two hours a day of exercise is recommended. Inside they tend to be lower energy and love to be couch potatoes and lap dogs; the breed is described as [...] "intensely friendly," [...] "good natured," [...] and [...] "adores visitors and is particularly happy with children." ...|$|E
