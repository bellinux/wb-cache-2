According to the obtained results the hydroxy <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> isomers locating in the middle and close to the middle of the chain showed higher antielastase, antiurease and antioxidant activities rather than that of the other isomers.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with mammalian cells, {{little is known}} about the control of Ca 2 + entry into primitive protozoans. Here we report that Ca 2 + influx in pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei can be regulated by phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) and the subsequent release of arachidonic acid (AA). Several PLA 2 inhibitors blocked Ca 2 + entry; 3 -(4 -octadecyl) -benzoylacrylic acid (OBAA; IC 50 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 microM) was the most potent. We identified in live trypanosomes PLA 2 activity that was sensitive to OBAA and could be stimulated by Ca 2 +, suggesting the presence of positive feedback control. The cell-associated PLA 2 activity was able to release [14 C]AA from labelled phospholipid substrates. Exogenous AA (5 - 50 microM) also initiated Ca 2 + entry in a manner that was inhibited by the Ca 2 + antagonist La 3 + (100 microM). Ca 2 + entry did not depend on AA metabolism or protein kinase activation. The cell response was specific for AA, and fatty acids with greater saturation than tetraeicosanoic acid (AA) or with chain lengths less than C 20 exhibited greatly diminished ability to initiate Ca 2 + influx. Myristate and palmitate inhibited PLA 2 activity and also inhibited Ca 2 + influx. Overall, these results demonstrate that Ca 2 + entry into T. brucei can result from phospholipid hydrolysis and the release of <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} and dynamics of a biological model bilayer are reported with atomic-scale resolution by using ultrafast electron crystallography. The bilayer was deposited as a Langmuir-Blodgett structure of arachidic (<b>eicosanoic)</b> fatty <b>acids</b> {{with the two}} chains containing 40 carbon atoms (≈ 50 Å), on a hydrophobic substrate, the hydrogen terminated silicon(111) surface.

For structural dynamics, the diffraction frames were taken every 1 picosecond after a femtosecond temperature jump. The observed motions, with sub-Å resolution and monolayer sensitivity, clearly indicate the coherent anisotropic expansion of the bilayer solely along the aliphatic chains, followed by nonequilibrium contraction and restructuring at longer times. This motion is indicative of a nonlinear behavior among the anharmonically coupled bonds on the ultrashort time scale and energy redistribution and diffusion on the longer time scale. The ability to observe such atomic motions of complex structures and at interfaces is a significant leap forward for the determination of macromolecular dynamical structures by using ultrafast electron crystallography...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mutations play a {{major role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} and development of several chronic degenerative diseases including cancer. It follows, therefore that antimutagenic compound may inhibit the pathological process resulting from exposure to mutagens. Investigation of the antimutagenic potential of traditional medicinal plants and compounds isolated from plant extracts provides one of the tools that can be used to identify compounds with potential cancer chemopreventive properties. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterise the compounds responsible for the antimutagenic activity of Combretum microphyllum. Methods The methanol leaf extract of C. microphyllum was evaluated for antimutagenicity in the Ames/microsome assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98. TA 100 and TA 102. Solvent-solvent fractionation was used to partition the extracts and by using bioassay-guided fractionation, three compounds were isolated. The antimutagenic activity of the three compounds were determined in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102. The antioxidant activity of the three compounds were determined by the quantitative 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) -free radical scavenging method. The cytotoxicity was determined in the MTT assay using human hepatocytes. Results A bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extracts for antimutagenic activity led to the isolation of three compounds; n-tetracosanol, <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and arjunolic acid. Arjunolic acid was the most active in all three tested strains with a antimutagenicity of 42  ±  9. 6 %, 36  ±  1. 5 % and 44  ±  0. 18 % in S. typhimurium TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 respectively at the highest concentration (500  μg/ml) tested, followed by <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and n-tetracosanol. The antioxidant activity of the compounds were determined using the quantitative 2, 2 diphenyl- 1 -picryhydrazyl (DPPH) -free radical scavenging method. Only arjunolic acid had pronounced antioxidant activity (measured as DPPH-free scavenging activity) with an EC 50 value of 0. 51  μg/ml. The cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds were determined in the MTT assay using human hepatocytes. The compounds had low cytotoxicity at the highest concentration tested with LC 50 values > 200  μg/ml for n-tetracosanol and <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and 106. 39  μg/ml for arjunolic acid. Conclusions Based on findings from this study, compounds in leaf extracts of C. microphyllum protected against 4 -NQO and MMC induced mutations as evident in the Ames test. The antimutagenic activity of arjunolic acid may, at least in part, be attributed to its antioxidant activity resulting in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species produced during mutagenesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of moderating {{the response of}} cells to a particular mutagen by phytomedicines opens new horizons in cancer prevention. On this basis, the search for antimutagens presents many possibilities for the discovery of new anticarcinogenic compounds. Determination of the antimutagenic potential of plant extracts {{is an important step}} in the discovery of new effective cancer chemopreventive agents. The main aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and characterize antimutagenic compounds active against 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO), mitomycin-C (MMC) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in vitro. Antioxidant compounds play a preventive role against mutation related diseases and thus may have potential antimutagenic activity. It was for this reason that methanol leaf extracts of 120 plant species from the existing plant material collection of tree leaves in the Phytomedicine Programme of the University of Pretoria were assayed for qualitative antioxidant activity. Almost 98 % of the extracts (117) had well defined antioxidant compounds. From these 117 species, 31 were selected for investigation of qualitative antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, mutagenic and antimutagenic activity. Methanol extracts of the selected 31 species effectively reduced the DPPH free radical with EC 50 values ranging from 1. 20 ± 0. 22 to 19. 07 ± 1. 50 μg/ml and total phenolic content measured in gallic acid equivalents (GAE) ranged from 5. 17 ± 0. 97 to 18. 65 ± 3. 86 mgGAE/mg extract. In some instances, the plant extracts had better antioxidant activity than the positive control, L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with EC 50 value of 2. 28 ± 0. 02 μg/ml. Only one plant (Halleria liucida) extract was mutagenic in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. Upon investigating antimutagenicity, the percentage inhibition of 4 -NQO in the Ames test ranged from 8. 8 ± 2. 4 to 76. 7 ± 4. 7 % in S. typhimurium TA 98 and from 0. 8 ± 6. 9 to 99. 00 ± 2. 9 % in TA 100. There was a direct correlation between the presence of antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity of the plant extracts confirming the initial hypothesis of the study. Some of the plant extracts had a comutagenic effect as they potentiated the mutagenic effects of 4 -NQO. From the 31 plant species investigated, 4 species (2 antimutagenic and 2 comutagenic) were selected for in-depth genotoxicity (mutagenicity and antimutagenicity) studies using the Ames test, cytokinesis block micronucleus/cytome assay and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis/comet assay. These species were: Combretum microphyllum Klotzsch (Combretaceae), Leucospermum erubescens Rourke (Proteaceae), Kirkia wilmsii Engl (Simaroubaceae) and Thespisia acutiloba (Baker f) Exell & Mendonça (Malvaceae). No plant extract was mutagenic in the Ames test and micronucleus/cytome assay. However, some extracts were slightly mutagenic in the comet assay and this may be attributed to cytotoxicity rather than genotoxic effects. The extracts of C. microphyllum and L. erubescens inhibited the mutagenic effects of 4 -NQO (S. typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100) and MMC (S. typhimurium TA 102) with values from 10 % to more than 30 % in the Ames test. However, extracts of K. wilmsii and T. acutiloba enhanced the mutagenic effects of 4 -NQO and MMC in all tester strains. Extracts of C. microphyllum and L. erubescens prevented micronuclei induction by up to 65. 9 %, chromosomal rearrangements by 51. 9 % and gene amplification by 86. 1 % in the micronucleus/cytome assay. In the comet assay, there was a clear dose dependent decrease in comet tail length. Based on the preliminary screening results, in depth genotoxicity investigation results and availability of plant material, C. microphyllum was selected for the isolation of antimutagenic compounds. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude methanol leaf extract, using the Ames test (S. typhimurium TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102) as an indicator of antimutagenicity was used for the isolation of antimutagenic compounds. To simplify the isolation of the antimutagenic compounds, the methanol leaf extract of C. microphyllum was first separated into four fractions based on polarity using a solvent-solvent fractionation procedure. The solvents used were: hexane, ethyl acetate, water and butanol. The fractions were subjected to antimutagenicity testing in the Ames test. The ethyl acetate fraction was the most active in all three tester strains i. e. S. typhimurium TA 98, 100 and 102 with percentage antimutagenicity of up to 32. 7 ± 2. 1, 30. 6 ± 3. 8 % and 21. 4 ± 3. 1 % respectively at the highest concentration (5 mg/ml) assayed. The activity was dose dependent. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate fraction by open column chromatography led to the isolation of three compounds. The structures of the compounds were determined using NMR and were identified as n-tetracosanol (C 1), <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 2) and olean- 12 -ene- 28 -oic acid (arjunolic acid) (C 3). The antimutagenic activity in the Ames test using S. typhimurium TA 98, 100 and 102, and the cytotoxicity on C 3 A human hepatocarcinoma cell line of the isolated compounds were determined. In the Ames test, the compounds were assayed at concentrations 10 times lower than the concentrations used for the crude extract and fraction. Arjunolic acid was more active in all three tester strains with percentage antimutagenicity of up to 41. 9 ± 9. 6 %, 35. 8 ± 1. 5 % and 43. 8 ± 0. 18 % in S. typhimurium TA 98, 100 and 102 respectively, followed by <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and lastly n-tetracosanol. Overall, the compounds had much higher antimutagenic activity than the crude extract and the fractions. The quantities of the isolated compounds were not sufficient to allow testing in the micronucleus/cytome assay and comet assay. The compounds were not cytotoxic at the highest concentration tested i. e. 200 μg/ml. n-Tetracosanol and <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> had LC 50 values > 200 μg/ml (with percentage cell viability of 59. 7 ± 7. 2 and 50. 1 ± 6. 2 % at the highest concentration respectively) and arjunolic acid had LC 50 value of 106. 4 ± 5. 1 μg/ml. Arjunolic acid was the only compound with pronounced antioxidant activity with an EC 50 value of 6. 3 ± 0. 3 μg/ml. This was moderate antioxidant activity compared to that of vitamin C. n-Tetracosanol and <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> did not have antioxidant activity. The antimutagenic activity of arjunolic acid at least in part may be attributed to its antioxidant activity resulting in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species produced during mutagenesis, but other mechanisms were probably involved with the other compounds. These results also show that it would not have worked by just isolating antioxidant compounds and testing these for genotoxicity. Combretum microphyllum has potential antimutagenic activity and protective effects against cancer since the crude extract of this plant species effectively inhibits the genotoxic end-points induced by 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO), mitomycin-C (MMC) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in vitro. This conclusion is supported by the fact that chromosomal biomarkers of genomic instability are relevant to cancer and that genotoxicity involving gene mutations, chromosomal aberrations and rearrangements and DNA strand breakages play a major role in cancer initiation. Pure compounds isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of this extract had antimutagenic effects in the Ames test using S. typhimurium TA 98, 100 and 102. The compounds had better activity compared to the crude extract and fractions at concentrations 10 times lower. The compounds were not cytotoxic against C 3 A human hepatocarcinoma cells at the highest concentration tested of 200 μg/ml. Overall, these types of studies on plant extracts may provide leads to the discovery of chemopreventive agents that can be used to develop pharmacologically active agents for prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. The compounds isolated in this study have been previously isolated from other plant species and are known to possess numerous biological activities, including amongst others: antioxidant activity, antimicrobial activity, antitumor effects and anticholinesterase activity. Even when new chemical structures are not found in medicinal plant research studies and drug discovery, known compounds with new biological activities can provide important drug leads Some of the extracts, fractions or compounds may be used as elements in nutraceuticals, functional foods and other applications as antimutagens to limit the {{possibility of}} mutations. Antimutagens and anticarcinogens play a major role in the primary prevention of mutations and cancer development by lowering the frequency or rate of mutations. This is the first report of the isolation of n-tetracosanol, <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and arjunolic acid from C. microphyllum.

Among those {{natural products}}, several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites have been isolated. This prompted us {{to develop an}} efficient synthesis of analogs of the two PUFA marine natural products mycalazol 5 and mycalazal 2 starting from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (EA). The biological studies revealed that all synthesized analogs displayed potent cytotoxic effect against several human cancer cell lines.

The analogs with a polyunsaturated alkyl chain exhibited more potent effects than the analogs possessing a saturated alkyl chain. Bosseopentaenoic acid (BPA) and its methyl ester have been isolated from different algae. This PUFA contains a (Z,E,E,Z) -conjugated polyene moiety with five double bonds in total. An efficient stereocontrolled synthesis of this natural product has been achieved. During the work towards the total synthesis of BPA, a Z-stereoselective Boland reduction reaction was needed. The Boland reduction procedure was modified by the addition of TMSCl, which resulted in shorter reaction times. This procedure was applied for the preparation of several Z-alkenes. As a continuation of the synthetic work towards BPA, the synthesis of α-parinaric acid was also investigated. As in the case with BPA, this naturally occurring PUFA also contains a Z,E,E,Z-conjugated polyene moiety, that we attempted to prepare via iterative palladiumcatalyzed cross coupling reactions...|$|E
40|$|Stearic acid or <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{mixed with}} di- or {{oligomeric}} amines in specific molar ratios form stable gels in water. The formation of such hydrogels {{depends on the}} hydro-phobicity of the fatty acid, and also {{on the type of}} amine used. The gelation properties of these two-component systems were investigated using electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, $^ 1 H$ NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and both single-crystal and cast-film X-ray diffraction. Results of FTIR spectral analysis suggest salt formation during gelation. $^ 1 H$ NMR analysis of the gels indicates that the fatty acid chains are immobilized in the get state and when the gel melts, these chains regain their mobility. Analysis of DSC data indicates that increase in the spacer length in the di-/oligomeric amine lowers the gel-melting temperature. Two of these gelator salts developed into crystals and structural details of such systems could be secured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structural information of the salts thus obtained was compared with the XRD data of the self-supporting films of those gels. Such analyses provided pertinent structural insight into the supramolecular interactions that prevail within these gelator assemblies. Analysis of the crystal structure confirmed that multilayered lamellar aggregates exist in the gel and it also showed that the three-dimensional ordering observed in the crystalline phase is retained in only one direction in the gel state. Finally, the hydrogel was used as a medium for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

40|$|Fatty acid {{biosynthesis}} is {{a primary}} metabolic pathway that occurs in plastids, whereas the formation of glycerolipid molecules {{for the majority of}} cellular membrane systems and the deposition of storage lipid in seeds takes place in the cytosolic compartment. In this report, we present a study of an Arabidopsis mutant, ar 21, with a novel seed fatty acid phenotype showing a higher content of <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (20 : 1) and oleic acid (18 : 1) and a reduced level of 3 ̆b 1 -linolenic acid (18 : 3). A combination of map-based cloning and whole genome sequencing identified the genetic basis underlying the fatty acid phenotype as a lesion in the plant-specific eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIFiso 4 G 1. Transcriptome analysis on developing seeds revealed a reduced level of plastid-encoded genes. Specifically, decreases in both transcript and protein levels of an enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis, the 3 ̆b 2 -subunit of the plastidic heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (htACCase) encoded by accD, were evident in the mutant. Biochemical assays showed that the developing seeds of the mutant possessed a decreased htACCase activity in the plastid but an elevated activity of homomeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (hmACCase). These results suggested that the increased 20 : 1 was attributable at least in part to the enhanced cytosolic hmACCase activity. We also detected a significant repression of FATTY ACID DESATURASE 3 (FAD 3) during seed development, which correlated with a decreased 18 : 3 level in seed oil. Together, our study on a mutant of eIFiso 4 G 1 uncovered multifaceted interactions between the cytosolic and plastidic compartments in seed lipid biosynthesis that impact major seed oil traits.

These macromolecules serve as model systems for biomembranes and allow for systematic studies under controlled conditions. The systems investigated are arachidic (<b>eicosanoic)</b> <b>acid</b> and dimyristoyl phosphatidic acid (DMPA), deposited on a substrate by the Langmuir−Blodgett technique. We studied these systems in monolayer, bilayer, and multilayer structures, and under different conditions (pH, pressure, and temperature) and on different substrates (hydrophobic and hydrophilic). The subunit cell −CH_ 2 −CH_ 2 −CH_ 2 − distances were determined for all structures. For fatty acid samples, the structure is orthorhombic, and a_ 0 and b_ 0 have the values, depending on conditions, of 4. 7 − 4. 9 Å and 8. 0 − 8. 9 Å, respectively. The c_ 0 value is 2. 54 Å and for a given sample the accuracy is milliangstrom. Structural dynamics, after an ultrafast temperature jump in the underlying substrate, were studied by observing changes of the diffraction patterns:[*] Bragg spot position, intensity, width, and the rocking curves. All structures exhibit a coherent anisotropic nonequilibrium expansion along the aliphatic chains, accompanied by transient structural ordering on the ultrafast time-scale. This wave-type, not diffusive, motion is followed by contraction and restructuring at longer times due to energy redistribution and diffusion. The transient behavior is entirely different from that reported here at equilibrium temperatures, {{in the range of}} 100 − 380 K.

40|$|The {{seed oil}} of meadowfoam (Limnanthes alba) and other Limnanthes spp. is enriched in the unusual fatty acid Δ 5 -eicosenoic acid (20 : 1 Δ 5). This fatty acid has {{physical}} and chemical properties that make the seed oil of these plants useful for a number of industrial applications. An expressed sequence tag approach was used to identify cDNAs for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 20 : 1 Δ 5). By random sequencing of a library prepared from developing Limnanthes douglasii seeds, a class of cDNAs was identified that encode a homolog of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturases found in animals, fungi, and cyanobacteria. Expression of a cDNA for the L. douglasii acyl-CoA desaturase homolog in somatic soybean (Glycine max) embryos behind a strong seed-specific promoter resulted in the accumulation of Δ 5 -hexadecenoic acid to amounts of 2 % to 3 % (w/w) of the total fatty acids of single embryos. Δ 5 -Octadecenoic acid and 20 : 1 Δ 5 also composed < 1 % (w/w) each of the total fatty acids of these embryos. In addition, cDNAs were identified from the L. douglasii expressed sequence tags that encode a homolog of fatty acid elongase 1 (FAE 1), a β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase that catalyzes the initial step of very long-chain fatty acid synthesis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial activity and the cytotoxicity of the ethanol crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds from the twigs of Eriosema robustum, a plant used for the treatment of coughs and skin diseases. METHODS: Column chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques were used to isolate and identify eight compounds, robusflavones A (1) and B (2), orostachyscerebroside A (3), stigmasterol (4), 1 -O-heptatriacontanoyl glycerol (5), <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (6), 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside of sitosterol (7) and 6 -prenylpinocembrin (8), from E. robustum. A two-fold serial microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against fungi and bacteria, and the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazolyl- 2) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Fraction B had significant antimicrobial activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptoccocus neoformans (MIC 0. 08 mg/ml), whilst the crude extract and fraction A had moderate activity against A. fumigatus and Candida albicans (MIC 0. 16 mg/ml). Fraction A however had excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 0. 02 mg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (MIC 0. 04 mg/ml). The crude extract had significant activity against S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli. Fraction B had good activity against E. faecalis and E. coli (MIC 0. 08 mg/ml). All the isolated compounds had a relatively weak antimicrobial activity. An MIC of 65 μg/ml was obtained with robusflavones A (1) and B (2) against C. albicans and A. fumigatus, orostachyscerebroside A (3) against A. fumigatus, and robusflavone B (2) against C. neoformans. Compound 8 had the best activity against bacteria (average MIC 55 μg/ml). The 3 fractions and isolated compounds had LC 50 values between 13. 20 to > 100 μg/ml against Vero cells yielding selectivity indices between 0. 01 and 1. 58. CONCLUSION: The isolated compounds generally had a much lower activity than expected based on the activity of the fractions from which they were isolated. This may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or fractions. The results support the traditional use of E. robustum to treat infections. The crude extract had a good activity and low preparation cost, and may be useful in topical applications to combat microbial infections.

The �gPart A�h gives details of the phytochemical studies on two indigenous medicinal plants; Artemisi legantissima Pamp and Artemisia incisa Pamp (Asteraceae). The selected species of Artemisia have been investigated {{for the first time}} for their phytochemical constituents. Four new (artemglycerol (1), artemceramide-A (2) santolynilol- 3 -acetate (3) and artemceramide-B (4)) and thirty three known compounds (5, 7, 8, 3 ', 4 '-pentahydroxy- 6 - methoxyflavone (5), bonanzin (6), 3 �Œ, 4 �Œ-dihydroxybonanzin (7), apigenin (8), (S) dihydroluteolin (9), scoparol (10), nepetin (11), bis-dracunculin (12), dracunculin (13), scopoletin (14), allograciolone acetate (15), betulinic acid (16), triacontanoic acid (17), nonacosanol (18), (Z) -p-hydroxycinnamic acid (19), stigmasterol (20), ƒÀ-sitosterol (21), ƒÀ-sitosterol- 3 -O-ƒÀ-D-glucopyranoside (22), cis-dehydromatricaria ester (23), <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (24), octacosanoic acid (25), eupatorin (26), santolinylol (27), trans-ethyl caffeate (28), scoparone (29), isoscopoletin (30), esculetin (31), isofraxidin (32), ethyl-(E) -phydroxy cinnamate (33), taraxerol (34), taraxerol acetate (35), benzoic acid (36) and linoleic acid (37)) have been isolated for the first time from these species. The two new compounds; artemglycerol (1) and artemceramide-A (2) were isolated from A. elegantissima while two new compounds; santolynilol- 3 -acetate (3) and artemceramide-B (4) were isolated from A. incisa. The flavonoid (5, 7, 8, 3 ', 4 'pentahydroxy- 6 -methoxyflavone) has been presented with full spectral data and physicochemical constant for the first time. The structural characterizations of the compounds have been achieved by using spectroscopic techniques (EI-MS, ESI-MS, UVVis, IR, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, DEPTq, DEPT- 135, HMBC, HSQC, NOESY and COSY). In �gPart B�h of the dissertation, anticancer, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antitrypanosomal, nematicidal and sphingokinase inhibition studies of the fractions and the compounds isolated from A. elegantissima and A. incisa have been discussed. The preliminary results obtained from the anticancer screening of apigenin (8), scopoletin (14), trans-ethyl caffeate (28) and taraxerol acetate (35) performed against the three cancer cell lines (Human colon carcinoma cell line; HCT 116, Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells; A 549 and Michigan cancer foundation- 7; MCF 7) in the MTT assay have produced no good results. The antidiabetic screening was performed against Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) at a conc. of 100 ƒÊg/ml. The two compounds bonanzin (6) and 3 �Œ, 4 �Œ-dihdroxy bonanzin (7) were highly active which showed inhibition of 22 and 18 % of the control respectively. While bis-dracunculin (12), dracunculin (13), scopoletin (14), nepetin (11), scoparol (10) and apigenin (8) also showed good inhibition (33, 35, 32, 30, 26, and 29 %of the control respectively). Antibacterial activities were carried out against four microbial strains i. e. Mycobacteriummarinum, sporadic methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SMRSA) and endemic methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA) while antitrypanosomal activities were performed against Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. b. brucei). In the antibacterial screening at a conc. of 200 ƒÊg/ml, 3 �Œ, 4 �Œ-dihydroxybonanzin (7) was the most active compound against both SMRSA and EMRSA which showed - 2. 7 and - 10. 8 % D control respectively while scoparol (10) and apigenin (8) also showed good activities against EMRSA (- 3. 2 and - 1. 2 % D control respectively). At a conc. of 100 ƒÊg/ml, bisdracunculin (12) (- 1. 2 % of D control) showed selective inhibition of M. marinum. In the antitrypanosomal screening, scopoletin (14) was found to be the most active compound (MIC: < 0. 19 ƒÊg/ml) followed by 3 �Œ, 4 �Œ-dihydroxy bonanzin (7) (MIC: 6. 25 ƒÊg/ml). These results can help in directing the rational design of 3 �Œ, 4 �Œ-dihydroxy bonanzin (7) and scopoletin (14) as other similar secondary metabolites or synthetic analogs as potent and effective antiprotozoal agents against T. b. brucei. In the nematicidal screening performed against root knot nematodes (% eggs hatching of Meloidogyne javanica), esculetin (31) (LC 50 : 57. 6 ƒÊg ml- 1), dracuculin (13) (LC 50 : 63. 5 ƒÊg ml- 1) and linoleic acid (37) (LC 50 : 82. 6 ƒÊg ml- 1) showed good activities while against stage two juvenile (J 2 s) of M. javanica (% mortality), esculetin (31) showed high activity (LC 50 : 90. 4 ƒÊg ml- 1) followed by isofraxidin (32) (LC 50 93. 0 ƒÊg ml- 1) and trans-ethyl caffeate (28) (LC 50 : 99. 5 ƒÊg ml- 1).

40|$|The present thesis {{entitled}} “Design and Synthesis of Novel Soft Composites from Physical Gels and Nanomaterials” {{deals with}} soft materials derived from {{low molecular weight}} gels and nanomaterials. Chapter 1 gives a general introduction and overview of the low molecular weight gel (LMOG) which forms {{the basis of the}} work. It delves with the history of research in physical gel field, design of different types of gelator molecules, their interesting self-assembly patterns, potential applications of these gelator molecules as well as challenges to design new gelator molecules. It also encompasses the relatively recent area of two component gel system to conveniently bypass the cumbersome synthetic protocol. The aspect of liquid crystallinity in the gel phase is also discussed to throw light on the pattern of assembly and potential uses of these materials. Towards the end there is a comprehensive discussion on the smart nanocomposites derived from LMOGs and nanomaterials. The design, synthesis and numerous applications of inorganic-organic hybrid composites are discussed. Chapter 2 A describes the synthesis and characterization of a variety of fatty acid amides of different naturally occurring L-amino acids whose molecular structures are shown in Chart 2 A. 1. Some of them were found to form gels with various hydrocarbons. The gelation properties of these compounds were studied by a number of physical methods including FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry, rheology and it was found that gelation was critically dependent on the fatty acid chain length and nature of the amino acid. Among them, L-alanine based gelators were found to be the most efficient and versatile as they self-assemble into a layered structure to form the gel network. Mechanisms for the assembly and formation of gels from these molecules are discussed. (Structural formula) Chart 2 A. 1. Molecular structures of various fatty acid amides of different amino acids. Chapter 2 B describes efficient gelation of both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents by a fatty acid amide, n-lauroyl-L-alanine (Chapter 2 B. 1). In addition, this compound was found to gelate the binary solvent mixtures comprised of aromatic hydrocarbon e. g. toluene and aliphatic hydrocarbon e. g. n-heptane. SEM and AFM showed that the fiber thickness of the gel assembly increases progressively in the binary mixture of n-heptane and toluene with increasing percentage of toluene. The self- Chart 2 B. 1. Molecular structure of the gelator. assembly patterns of the gels in individual solvents, n-heptane and toluene are however, different. The toluene gel consists of predominantly one type of morphological species while n-heptane gel has more than one species leading to polymorphic nature of the gel. The n-heptane gel is thermally more stable than the toluene gel as evident from the measurement using differential scanning calorimetry. The thermal stability of the gels prepared in the binary mixture of n-heptane and toluene is dependent on the composition of solvent mixture. Rheology of the gels shows that they are shear-thinning material and show characteristic behavior of soft viscoelastic solids. For the gels prepared from binary solvent mixture of toluene and n-heptane, with incorporation of more toluene in the binary mixture, the gel becomes a more viscoelastic solid. The time sweep rheology experiment demonstrates that the gel made in n-heptane has faster gel formation kinetics than that prepared in toluene. Chapter 2 C describes lyotropic mesophase formation by organogels of different fatty acid amides of L-alanine in aromatic solvents. The helical assembly, characteristic of the cholesteric mesophase was found to exhibit reflection bands in circular dichroism spectra. The reflection bands corresponded to the pitch of the helical arrangement of the gelator molecules in the aromatic solvent. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed presence of twist in the gel fibres. Polarising optical microscopy of the organogel exhibited weak birefringence confirming lyotropic nature of the assembly. Chapter 3 deals with synthesis and characterization of a new class of molecules with molecular structures shown in Chart 3. 1. Among a variety of amino acid based molecules only alanine and serine based molecules were found to form translucent gels in aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n-heptane. TEM showed presence of fiber like structures for alanine whereas serine based gelator produces unique network like structures. SEM of the dried gels exhibited presence of three dimensional fibrous networks to spongy globular cauliflower like structures depending on the molecular structure of the gelators. Rheological studies of the organogels showed that they behave like typical LMOG gels. The oscillatory rheological studies demonstrated that the L-serine based gelator, 5 formed more viscoelastic solid like gel than that of L-alanine based gelator, 1 in n-heptane. Chart 3. 1. Molecular structures of different amino acid derivatives from 3, 4, 5 -tri-dodecyloxybenzoic acid scaffold. Chapter 4 A presents design and properties of new nanocomposites from LMOG and metal nanoparticles (Chart 4 A. 1). The profound influence of nanoparticle (NP) incorporation into physical gels was evident from various microscopic and bulk properties. The interaction of nanoparticles with the gelator assembly was found to depend critically on the capping agent coating the nanoparticles. TEM showed long range Chart 4 A. 1. Molecular structures of the gelator and various AuNPs synthesized. directional assembly of the certain AuNPs along the gel fibers. SEM of the dried gels and nanocomposites indicated that the morphological transformation in the composite microstructures depended profoundly on the capping agent of the nanoparticle. Differential Scanning Calorimetry showed that gel formation from sol postponed to lower temperature with incorporation of AuNPs having capping agents which were able to interact with the gel fibers. Rheological studies indicated that the gel-nanoparticle composites exhibit greater rigidity as compared to the naked gel only when the capping agents were able to interdigitate into the gelator assembly. Also, very low percentage of the AuNPs incorporation could switch the cholesteric mesophase of gel assembly, as evident from circular dichroism. We have been able to define a relationship between materials and molecular properties via manipulation of the molecular structures of NP capping agents. Chapter 4 B discusses the design and preparation of novel organogel-carbon nanotube composites by incorporation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) into physical gels formed by an L-alanine based Low Molecular Mass Organogelator (Chart 4 B. 1). The gelation process and the properties of the resulting nanocomposites were found to depend on the kind of SWNTs incorporated in the gels. With pristine SWNTs, only a limited amount could be dispersed in the organogels. Attempted incorporation of higher amounts of pristine SWNTs led to precipitation from the gel. To improve their solubility in the gel matrix, a variety of SWNTs functionalized with different aliphatic and aromatic chains were synthesized (Chart 4 B. 1). Scanning electron microscope images of the nanocomposites showed that the texture and organization of the gel aggregates were altered upon incorporation of SWNTs. The microstructures of nanocomposites were found to depend on the kind of SWNTs used. Incorporation of functionalized SWNTs into the organogels depressed the sol to gel transition temperature, with the n-hexadecyl chain functionalized SWNTs being more effective than the n-dodecyl chain functionalized counterpart. Rheological investigations of pristine SWNT containing gels indicated that the flow of nanocomposites became resistant to applied stress at a very low wt-% of SWNT incorporation. Again, more effective control of flow behavior was achieved with functionalized SWNTs possessing longer hydrocarbon chains. This happens presumably via effective interdigitation of the pendant chains with the fatty acid amides of L-alanine in the gel assembly. Also, the helical cholesteric mesophase formed by the toluene gel could be switched to a layer stacked assembly by doping functional SWNT. Remarkably, by using a near IR laser irradiation at 1064 nm for a short duration (1 min) at room temperature, it was possible to selectively induce a gel-to-sol phase transition of the nanocomposites, while prolonged irradiation (30 min) of the organogel under identical conditions did not cause gel melting. Chart 4 B. 1. Molecular structures of the gelator and different functionalized SWNT synthesized. Chapter 5 A presents design of two component hydrogels and their potential utilization as a template for metal nanoparticle synthesis. Among a variety of acids and amines (Chart 5 A. 1) only stearic acid or <b>eicosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> when mixed with di- or oligomeric amines in specific molar ratios form stable gels in water. The formation of such hydrogels depends on the hydrophobicity of the fatty acid, and also on the type of amine used. The gelation properties of these two component systems were investigated using electron microscopy, FTIR, 1 H NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and both single crystal and cast film X-ray diffraction. FTIR spectral analysis suggests salt formation during gelation. 1 H NMR of the gels indicates that the fatty acid chains are immobilized in the gel state and when the gel is melted, these chains regain their mobility. Analysis of DSC data indicates that increase in spacer length in the di-/oligomeric amine lowers the gel melting temperature. Two of these gelator salts developed into crystals and structural details of such systems could be secured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structural information of the salts thus obtained was compared with the XRD data of the self-supporting films of those gels. Such analyses provided pertinent structural insight on the supramolecular interactions that prevail within these gelator assemblies. From the crystal structure it is confirmed that the multilayered lamellar aggregates exist in the gel and it also showed that only one plane of symmetry is present in the gel state. Finally, the hydrogel was used as a medium for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were found to position themselves on the fibers and produce a long ordered assembly of gel-nanoparticle composite (Figure 5 A. 1). Chart 5 A. 1.

(a) Ag-NP synthesized in hydrogel of SA-IBPA (1 : 3. 5), (b) Magnified images of Ag-NP preferentially residing on gel fibers. Chapter 5 B demonstrates the aptitude of supramolecular hydrogel formation using simple bile acids e. g. lithocholic acid (LCA) in aqueous solution containing di- or oligomeric amines (Chart 5 B. 1). By variation of the choice of the amines in such mixture the hydrogelation properties could be modulated. However, replacement of LCA by cholic acid or deoxycholic acid resulted in no hydrogelation. FT-IR studies show that the carboxylate and ammonium residues of the two components are primarily involved in salt formation. This promotes further assembly of the components reinforced by continuous Chart 5 B. 1. Structures and abbreviations of different bile acids and amines checked for gelation. hydrogen bonded network leading to gelation. Electron microscopy shows that the morphology of the gels of two component systems which also depends strongly on the amine part. Variation of amine component from the simple ethanediamine (EDA) to oligomeric amine with lithocholic acid changes the morphology of the assembly from long one dimensional nanotubes to three dimensional complex structures. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis with one of the amine-LCA complexes suggested the motif of fiber formation where the amines participate with the carboxylate and hydroxyl moiety through H-bonding and electrostatic forces. The rheological properties of this class of two component system provide clear evidence that this system is a shear-sensitive hydrogel and the flow behavior can be modulated varying the acid-amine ratio. From small angle neutron scattering study, it becomes clear that loose gel from LCA-EDA shows scattering oscillation due to the presence of non interacting nanotubules while for gels of LCA with oligomeric amine the individual fibers come together to form complex three dimensional structures of higher length scale.
