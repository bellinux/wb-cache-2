5000|$|Darryl Dawkins of the Philadelphia 76ers was {{notorious for}} two glass-shattering dunks in 1979 {{resulting}} in the league threatening to fine him and eventually installing breakaway rims. Twice in his rookie season (...) during games, center Shaquille O'Neal dunked so hard that he broke the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>support</b> of one goal standard (against the Phoenix Suns) and broke the welds holding up another goal standard, causing the basket to break off and {{fall to the floor}} (against the New Jersey Nets), although in neither case did the glass break. This resulted in reinforced backboard supports as well. During that same season, New Jersey's Chris Morris shattered a backboard in a game against the Chicago Bulls (the most recent shattered-backboard incident in the NBA to date). The NBA has made shattering the backboard a technical foul, although it will not count towards a player's count of seven that can draw a suspension, or two towards ejection from a game, and it counts towards a player's count of six personal fouls. This has assisted in deterring this action, as it can cost the team points.|$|E

In this paper, the engineering mechanical characteristics of superhigh-water content material concretion (SCMC) were studied for two types of backfilling technologies in longwall mining—open-type and pocket-type backfilling. The mechanical properties and responses of the SCMC were assessed under different cementation states, varying loading conditions and at different scales. The results indicate that: (1) the compressive and tensile strengths of SCMC specimens in different cementation states increase as the curing time increases—the SCMC formed by a mixture of SCM and gangues has higher strength than that of pure SCM; (2) the SCMC is under different loading and confinement conditions when different backfilling technologies is applied; however the strength of SCMC increases with curing time and decreases with water volume percentage; and (3) large-size specimens of pure SCMC enter into an accelerated creep state at a leveled load of 1. 4 MPa.
