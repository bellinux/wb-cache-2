5|$|Rutherford gave Chadwick a {{part-time}} teaching position at Manchester, {{allowing him to}} continue research. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found {{that this was the}} same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{retained}} the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. Ian Johnson was retained despite taking match figures of 1/85, as was Bill Brown, the opener who was batting {{out of position}} in the middle-order. Brown had scored 25, 26 and 17 in his three innings in the middle-order during the tour. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite Brown's unbeaten double century in his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey had better claims to selection. Following his groin injury at Trent Bridge, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Before the toss, Bradman had spent an unusually long time inspecting the wicket, and after correctly predicting {{the side of the}} coin, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface for another period before announcing Australia's decision to bat. The all-rounder Keith Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.|$|E
25|$|From March 2011, he hosted They Write the Songs, a 10-part {{documentary}} series for BBC Radio 2 in which <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{life and work}} of popular composers.|$|E

25|$|Robertson wrote three {{important}} {{papers on the}} mathematics of quantum mechanics. In the first, written in German, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coordinate system required for the Schrödinger equation to be solvable. The second {{examined the relationship between}} the commutative property and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The third extended the second to the case of m observables. In 1931 he published a translation of Weyl's The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 and in 1948 he {{was awarded}} a Leverhulme Fellowship which allowed him to travel across much of Northern and Central Europe. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{technologies}} and techniques of rural and fishing communities in much of Scandinavia, displaying {{his interest in the}} relationship between folk culture and ecology. He expanded the length of the Proceedings in the years following the war, now aided by Piggott and Kenneth Oakley as his editorial assistants.|$|E
25|$|The writer's life allowed Maugham {{to travel}} and to live {{in places such as}} Spain and Capri for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of Liza. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play Lady Frederick. By the next year, he had four plays running {{simultaneously}} in London, and Punch published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> billboards.|$|E

25|$|Klein {{showed that}} the modular group moves the {{fundamental}} region of the complex plane so as to tessellate that plane. In 1879, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> action of PSL(2,7), thought of as {{an image of the}} modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface today called the Klein quartic. He showed that that surface was a curve in projective space, that its equation was x3y+y3z+z3x=0, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics.|$|E
500|$|The album's title {{comes from}} a lyric on the album's final song, [...] "Home". Grohl stated that as he {{struggled}} to think of a title given the musical variety of the album, even considering the title [...] "The One With That Song On It", <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> song lyrics and after reading the ones from [...] "Home" [...] Grohl [...] "thought it was nice because it's open to interpretation and it's a beautiful title and I think the album is beautiful in its diversity and its melody and its musicality – it goes from delicate acoustic moments to the heaviest shit we’ve ever done." ...|$|E
500|$|After Germany's defeat, Salinger {{signed up}} for a six-month period of [...] "Denazification" [...] duty in Germany for the Counterintelligence Corps. He lived in Weissenburg and, soon after, married Sylvia Welter. He brought her to the United States in April 1946, but the {{marriage}} fell apart after eight months and Sylvia returned to Germany. In 1972, Salinger's daughter Margaret was with him when he received a letter from Sylvia. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> envelope, and without reading it, tore it apart.

[...] After their {{victory at the}} Siege of Odawara Castle in 1590, Ieyasu agreed to relinquish all of his domains to Hideyoshi {{in exchange for the}} Kantō region to the east. [...] Hideyoshi died in 1598. By 1603, Ieyasu had recovered Sunpu Castle and completed his unification of Japan, and had been named shogun by the Emperor. [...] The following year, he had Ryūsen-ji moved from Yunoki to Kōyamachi near Sunpu Castle and attended Buddhist funeral rites conducted in honor of the late Lady Saigō on the anniversary of her death. [...] To mark the occasion, Ieyasu presented the temple priests with the katana he inherited from his father, and a portrait of himself as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. [...] These items can still be viewed at the temple in Shizuoka city.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' overdubs and {{production}} were recorded between February and March 1994 in Sussex, England, at McCartney's home studio. It {{ends with a}} slight coda including a strummed ukulele by Harrison (an instrument {{he was known to}} have played often) and the voice of John Lennon played backwards. The message, when played in reverse, is [...] "Turned out nice again", which was the catchphrase of George Formby. The final result sounds like [...] "made by John Lennon", which, according to McCartney, was unintentional and was only discovered after the surviving Beatles reviewed the final mix. When Starr heard McCartney and Harrison singing the harmonies, and later the finished song, he said that it sounded just like them [...] He explained his comment by saying that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> project as [...] "an outsider". Lynne fully expected the finished track to sound like the Beatles, as that was his premise for the project, but Harrison added: [...] "It's gonna sound like them if it is them... It sounds like them now." ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{took place}} on August 16, at 10:10 CST. Before the race, Milorad Čavić made {{headlines}} by saying {{in an interview that}} it would be better for swimming if he beat Phelps. Phelps' coach Bob Bowman used the quote to provide motivation to his protégé. In an interview, Phelps said that doubters like Čavić [...] "fires me up more than anything, I always welcome comments. It definitely motivates me even more." [...] Almost immediately after the race started, Čavić took the lead with Phelps getting off to a slow start. At the turn, Čavić was first, followed by Ian Crocker, while Phelps made the split in seventh place, just 0.62 seconds behind Čavić. As the two approached the finish, Čavić tried to coast to the wall on one last stroke, while Phelps, who had misjudged the end, took an extra half-stroke, causing both competitors to touch the wall at almost exactly the same time. It turned out that Phelps had actually finished one one-hundredth of a second ahead of Čavić, with a time of 50.58 seconds. Phelps even admitted that, at first, he thought the extra stroke he took had cost him the gold medal, until <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard displaying the results. Andrew Lauterstein won the bronze medal, also beating Crocker by one one-hundredth of a second.|$|E

500|$|Much of Barrymore's {{early life}} was unsettled. In October 1882, the family toured in the US {{for a season}} with Polish actress Helena Modjeska. The {{following}} year his parents toured again with Modjeska but left the children behind. Modjeska was influential in the family, and she insisted that all three children be baptized into the Catholic Church. In 1884 the family traveled to London as part of Augustin Daly's theatrical company, returning to the US two years later. As a child, Barrymore was sometimes badly behaved, and he was sent away to schools {{in an attempt to}} instill discipline. The strategy was not always successful, and he attended elementary schools in four states. He was sent first to the boys' annex of the Convent of Notre Dame in Philadelphia. One punishment that he received there was being made to read a copy of Dante's Inferno; he later recounted that, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> illustrations by Gustave Doré, [...] "my interest was aroused, and a new urge was born within me. I wanted to be an artist". He was expelled from the school in 1891 and was sent to Seton Hall Preparatory School in New Jersey, where Lionel was already studying. Barrymore was unhappy at Seton and was soon withdrawn, after which he attended several public schools in New York, including the Mount Pleasant Military Academy.|$|E
500|$|... 1948 {{also saw}} the {{publication}} of Lethbridge's first major book, Merlin's Island: Essays on Britain in the Dark Ages, a collection of six essays on various elements of Early Medieval Britain. Representing Lethbridge's unorthodox and eclectic approach, it was aimed at a popular rather than academic audience, and although some academic reviewers were critical, it received much qualified praise. This was followed in 1950 by Herdsman and Hermits: Celtic Seafarers in the Northern Sea, in which {{he returned to his}} interest in seafaring and boats. Containing a foreword by Kendrick, it was published by Bowes and Bowes. In 1952, Lethbridge published Coast Wise Craft, which again looked at boat building but was aimed at a general rather than specialist readership. That same year, Thames and Hudson published Lethbridge's Boats and Boatmen as part of their [...] "The Past in the Present" [...] series edited by archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes. In 1954, Andrew Melrose published Lethbridge's The Painted Men, a book about the Picts of Northern Britain. It was deemed to be his last conventional book within the archaeological and academic community. As part of his increasing public profile, the BBC invited him to give the third talk in their second series of Myth or Legend?, which he devoted {{to the question of whether}} Europeans had arrived in the Americas prior to Christopher Columbus; in particular <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> claims that St. Brendan and Thorfinn Karlsefni had made the journey across the Atlantic. Over several seasons he also carried out excavations of wheelhouses at South Uist, and on one occasion was visited at the site by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.|$|E

2500|$|Within the post-processual movement, Ian Hodder became [...] "the leading {{exponent}} of a structuralist approach". In a 1984 article, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{similarities between}} the houses and the tombs of Neolithic Europe, and used a structuralist approach {{as a basis for}} his ideas on their symbolism. He then went on, in his seminal book The Domestication of Europe (1990), to use structuralist ideas to come up with his theory that within Neolithic Europe, there was a dichotomy between field (agrios) and house (domus), with this duality being mediated by a boundary (foris).|$|E
