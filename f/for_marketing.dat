5|$|Schumacher and Lloyd Webber {{restarted}} {{development for}} The Phantom of the Opera in December 2002. It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. {{in an attempt}} to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently. As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 million of his own money. The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $55 million budget. A further $15 million was used <b>for</b> <b>marketing,</b> bringing the final budget to $70 million. Warner Bros. was given a first look deal for distribution; the studio did not sign on until June 2003, when the principal cast was chosen.|$|E

5|$|The {{frequent}} crashes of {{the retail}} Windows versions infuriated many reviewers; Game Revolution censured Interplay for focusing on censoring the game <b>for</b> <b>marketing</b> purposes instead of testing for and fixing the software bugs before release. Several reviewers could not connect to multiplayer games due to failed connections or bugs. The reviewers who managed to play online, commented the games were fun, although they were occasionally disconnected or lagged. GamesFirst lamented the lack of dedicated low ping servers, and several reviewers declared that the computer versions of the game was flawed for not implementing an in-game save feature.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate {{released}} {{the game for}} the ZX Spectrum at an above-average price to combat piracy. Its premium product packaging became a company standard. The developers had finished Sabre Wulf sequels in advance of its release but—in keeping with their penchant for secrecy—chose to withhold them <b>for</b> <b>marketing</b> purposes. The sequels were swiftly released later that year. Ultimate hired outside developers to port Sabre Wulf to other computing platforms: the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. The game was later featured in compilations including the 2015 retrospective of games by Ultimate and its successor, Rare.|$|E

Sony designed and manufactured the PowerBook100 {{in collaboration with the}} Apple Industrial Design Group, Apple's internal design team. It was discontinued on September 3, 1992, and superseded by the PowerBook 145 and PowerBook Duo series. Since then, it has been praised several times for its design; PC World named the PowerBook100 the tenth-greatest PC of all time in 2006, and US magazine Mobile PC chose the PowerBook100 as the greatest gadget of all time in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the venue cost NOK230 million, which was almost entirely financed through state grants. Hamar Municipality contributed by building a co-located fire station for NOK21 million. Local businesses also contributed with NOK8 million. Moelven Industrier and Fireguard both contributed in exchange {{for being able to}} use the venues <b>for</b> <b>marketing</b> large wooden structures. To finance the operating deficit after the Olympics, Hamar Municipality received a capital grant of NOK30 million, with the interest going to pay for running Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Operating costs were estimated at NOK7 million per year; the venue will receive income of NOK1 million from larger events, NOK1 million will come from free work from the fire department, and NOK1 million from advertisements. Similar to Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Hall and Vikingskipet. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise.|$|E
5|$|The series, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, currently consists of seven games across multiple platforms. Final Fantasy XIII, designed as the series' flagship title, {{was released in}} 2009. The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles, including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama. The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima. The first games announced for the series were Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV (as Versus XIII), and Final Fantasy Type-0 (as Agito XIII). All three games went through delays. After XIII and Type-0s releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. Final Fantasy XV was distanced from the series brand <b>for</b> <b>marketing</b> purposes despite retaining thematic connections.|$|E

5|$|Warner Bros. {{devoted a}} large amount of secrecy for Batman Returns. The art {{department}} was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's fake working title Dictel to go anywhere near the sets. Kevin Costner was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a private investigator to track down the accomplice. $65 million was spent during the production of Batman Returns, while $15 million was used <b>for</b> <b>marketing,</b> coming to a total cost of $80 million. The final shot of Catwoman looking at the Bat-Signal was completed during post-production and {{was not part of the}} shooting script. After Batman Returns was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a body double was chosen.|$|E
5|$|Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's {{best player}} {{against the best}} team, the final was {{a repeat of the}} 1990 final {{featuring}} Diego Maradona. Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular {{at the start of the}} second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup. At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition. However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen <b>for</b> <b>marketing</b> purposes.|$|E
