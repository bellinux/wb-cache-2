50|$|As a {{first step}} Zulfer {{approached}} his fellows in the local ICT space and explored the possibility of developing the technology.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{development}} involves {{a significant change}} in the economic activities over different regions along with a change {{in the structure of the}} economy. The socioeconomic change does not take place uniformly in different areas and it is also different in rural and urban areas of same region. Regional disparities are caused by a number of factors that lead to misallocation, under utilization of resource, etc. Therefore, when development over different regions occurs unequally, it becomes politically imperative to resort to corrective policy measured. Regional disparities lead numerous economic, social, cultural problems. Regional balances leads to the under utilization or even for non-utilization of economic resource. In the present paper analyses has been made to study the imbalances in the level of development with spatial emphases on the regional dimension. To analyze the regional disparities of fifteen blocks of the district, thirty-eight variables have been selected. The identification of regional disparities and extend of <b>interblocks</b> disparities in seven service different sectors and overall has been measured by using the Development Index (Deprivation Method). In the analysis it has been observed that the blocks of English Bazar and Bamangola attained the top position in the every sector while the blocks like Harishchandrapur-II and Kaliachak-III attained low level of development. Viewing the existing wide regional imbalances, planner and decision-makers should make comprehensive policies to reduce the gap in the level of development...|$|R

40|$|Estudou-se, no presente trabalho, a eficiência das seguintes alternativas de análise de experimentos realizados em látice quanto à precisão na estimação de componentes de variância, através da simulação computacional de dados: i) análise intrablocos do látice com tratamentos ajustados (primeira análise); ii) análise do látice em blocos casualizados completos (segunda análise); iii) análise intrablocos do látice com tratamentos não-ajustados (terceira análise); iv) análise do látice como blocos casualizados completos, utilizando as médias ajustadas dos tratamentos, obtidas a partir da análise com recuperação da informação interblocos, tendo como quadrado médio do resíduo a variância efetiva média dessa análise do látice (quarta análise). Os resultados obtidos mostram que se deve utilizar o modelo de análise intrablocos de experimentos em látice para se estimarem componentes de variância sempre que a eficiência relativa do delineamento em látice, em relação ao delineamento em Blocos Completos Casualizados, for {{superior}} a 100 % e, em caso contrário, deve-se optar pelo modelo de análise em Blocos Casualizados Completos. A quarta alternativa de análise não deve ser recomendada em qualquer das duas situações.

The {{results showed that the}} intrablock model, must be used with adjusted treatments in lattice experiments to estimate variance components every time that the relative efficiency of the lattice design, relatively to the randomized complete blocks design be upper to 100 %, and in the opposite case the randomized complete blocks design model must be used.
