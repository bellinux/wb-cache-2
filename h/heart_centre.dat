2500|$|Out of {{the eight}} general {{hospitals}} overseen by Singapore's Ministry of Health, only Singapore General Hospital has signages in the four official languages. Along Hospital Drive (where Singapore General Hospital is located) and various national medical centres, road directories are entirely in English. Within the hospital itself, signs for individual blocks, wards, Accident and Emergency department, Specialist Outpatient Clinics, National <b>Heart</b> <b>Centre</b> and National Cancer Centre have signs written in the four official languages. The English titles are still expressed with the largest font first, followed by Malay, Chinese and Tamil in smaller but equally-sized fonts, which is in accordance with order given by Singapore's constitution. Surprisingly, the Health Promotion Board, National Eye and Dental Centres, which {{are also in the}} same region, have English signs only. All of the other seven public hospitals have their [...] "Accident and Emergency" [...] sign in English only, with some highlighted in a red background.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess patient-relevant {{outcomes}} of delivered cardiovascular care by focusing on disease management as determined by a multidisciplinary Heart Team, to establish and share best practices by comparing outcomes and to embed value-based decision-making to improve quality and efficiency in Dutch <b>heart</b> <b>centres.</b> In 2014, 12 Dutch <b>heart</b> <b>centres</b> pooled patient-relevant outcome data, which resulted in transparent publication of the outcomes, including long-term follow-up up to 5 years, of approximately 86 000 heart patients. This study presents the results of both disease- and treatment patient-relevant outcome measures for coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease. The patients included were presented to a Heart Team and underwent invasive or operative treatment. In-hospital and out-of-hospital patient-relevant outcome measures were collected as well as initial conditions. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form (SF) - 36 or SF- 12 health survey. In the Netherlands, patient-relevant and risk-adjusted outcomes of cardiovascular care in participating <b>heart</b> <b>centres</b> are published annually. Data were sufficiently reliable to enable comparisons and to subtract best practices. The statistically lower risk-adjusted mortality rate after coronary artery bypass grafting resulted in a voluntary roll-out of a perioperative safety check. The in-depth analysis of outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention resulted in process improvements in several <b>heart</b> <b>centres,</b> such as pre-hydration for patients with renal insufficiency and the need of target vessel revascularizations within a year. Annual data collection on follow-up of patient-relevant outcomes of cardiovascular care, initiated and organized by physicians, appears feasible. Transparent publication of outcomes drives the improvement of quality within <b>heart</b> <b>centres.</b> The system of using a limited set of patient-relevant outcome measures enables reliable comparisons and exposes the quality of decision-making and the operational process. Transparent communication on outcomes is feasible, safe and cost-effective, and stimulates professional decision-making and disease managemen...|$|R
