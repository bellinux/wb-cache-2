5|$|Michael takes relish {{in being}} able to freely {{proclaim}} his relationship with Jan to his bosses, making Jan uncomfortable. She eventually pulls him aside and tries to get him to have sex with her in the bathroom. Michael refuses and she becomes angry. As they drive home together, Jan hypothesizes that she only enjoyed being with Michael because their relationship was undisclosed and therefore unethical, and that disclosing it was a mistake. Michael is hurt and upset at this, and Jan takes back her comments to keep him <b>from</b> <b>crying.</b>|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{sentencing}} of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between {{the reading of the}} sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl (Karoline Herfurth) selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her <b>from</b> <b>crying</b> out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{is set in}} three {{different}} locations: a hotel lobby, a bedroom, and on the beach. Although it was originally reported that both winners would appear in the video, only one was finally chosen to star. The others {{can be seen in}} minor roles as guests and workers in the lobby. The video chronicles the romance and conflict between the singer and his love interest, while making heavy use of visual art, with each scene presented as a watercolour painting, while in the intervals close-ups of Rouvas singing in front of a black background are shown. Additional artwork is shown of the surrounding environment, including buildings, the night sky, and birds flying across the sky. Throughout the video a live action/animation effect called rotoscoping is utilized, a first in Greek cinematography. It begins with Rouvas asleep and moves to him and his love interest sitting in a hotel lobby while the assistant brings over their luggage. They appear to be in a conflict, facing different directions. They then appear on the beach on better terms, while advertisements for the song's sponsor, Trident, are shown when the two characters each take a stick of gum. Snippets of love scenes are also played, while in some parts they are each shown separately and close-up shots show the woman's make-up smeared <b>from</b> <b>crying,</b> while animated tears also run down her face. During the bridge the two finally face each other in the lobby scene and as they lean in to kiss the rotoscoping animation momentarily smooths out. This is followed by another love scene and ends with the two walking out of the room.|$|E
40|$|Interactions {{among the}} three {{structural}} domains of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry 1 toxins were investigated by functional analysis of chimeric proteins. Hybrid genes were prepared by exchanging the regions coding for either domain I or domain III among Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 C, and Cry 1 E. The activity of the purified trypsin-activated chimeric toxins was evaluated by testing their effects on the viability and plasma membrane permeability of Sf 9 cells. Among the parental toxins, only Cry 1 C was active against these cells and only chimeras possessing domain II <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C were functional. Combination of domain I <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 E with domains II and III <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C, however, resulted in an inactive toxin, indicating that domain II from an active toxin is necessary, but not sufficient, for activity. Pores formed by chimeric toxins in which domain I was <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac were slightly smaller than those formed by toxins in which domain I was <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C. The properties of the pores formed by the chimeras are therefore likely to result from an interaction between domain I and domain II or III. Domain III appears to modulate {{the activity of the}} chimeric toxins: combination of domain III <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab with domains I and II of Cry 1 C gave a protein which was more strongly active than Cry 1 C.

500|$|Michael {{had shown}} the office a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{cut of the}} film years ago, but the {{employees}} all mistook it for a comedy, and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening. Everyone is very eager to see Michael's film, albeit only because they all appear in it, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) warns everyone {{to be mindful of}} how sensitive Michael is and not laugh. However, Pam is unable to keep herself <b>from</b> <b>crying</b> out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers the rest of the office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching. They sit down and laugh {{with the rest of the}} office through the film's conclusion.|$|E

I went away because I saw that she refrained <b>from</b> <b>crying</b> out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E

Although Ciara never confirmed who the song was about, she assured it wasn't about ex-boyfriend Amar'e Stoudemire. It was later confirmed that the song was indeed referring to her bad break-up with rapper 50 Cent, and then followed an apology dedicated to Ciara via Twitter from himself.|$|E

2500|$|The two briefly become {{best friends}} while he suffers a {{concussion}} in [...] "The Injury". In the season 6 episode [...] "The Delivery", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he {{is sent to}} the Halperts' house to retrieve Pam's iPod, while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen, after discovering mold. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, <b>from</b> <b>crying,</b> during [...] "Viewing Party", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in [...] "Doomsday". At this point, Pam is {{the only one in the}} office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.|$|E
2500|$|Gilles' bodyservant Étienne Corrillaut, {{known as}} Poitou, was an {{accomplice}} {{in many of}} the crimes and testified that his master stripped the child naked and hung him with ropes from a hook to prevent him <b>from</b> <b>crying</b> out, then masturbated upon the child's belly or thighs. If the victim was a boy he would touch his genitals (particularly testicles) and buttocks. Taking the victim down, Rais comforted the child and assured him he only wanted to play with him. Gilles then either killed the child himself or had the child killed by his cousin Gilles de Sillé, Poitou or another bodyservant called Henriet. The victims were killed by decapitation, cutting of their throats, dismemberment, or breaking of their necks with a stick. A short, thick, double-edged sword called a braquemard was kept at hand for the murders. Poitou further testified that Rais sometimes abused the victims (whether boys or girls) before wounding them and at other times after the victim had been slashed in the throat or decapitated. According to Poitou, Rais disdained the victim's sexual organs, and took [...] "infinitely more pleasure in debauching himself in this manner... than in using their natural orifice, in the normal manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Green came up {{with the}} idea for the game when Joel was four. He and Amy, both devout Christians, felt that the added years they had with Joel from the {{original}} diagnosis were a miracle. Prior to the idea, Green had written some smaller games that were meant to be more emotional, such as Giga Wife, which demonstrated how one's interactions with a spouse could be negatively compared to a Tamagotchi-like game. While at church, Ryan {{came up with}} the idea for That Dragon, Cancer during their reflection on the past few years, specifically recalling one night at the hospital where he was trying to stop Joel <b>from</b> <b>crying</b> but anything he did seemed to make his crying worse; only after he sat down and prayed to God did Joel stop crying; Ryan recalled how that reminded him of a video game with subverted game mechanics. He wanted to relay his experiences of raising Joel to a larger audience, and felt that an interactive video game would be a better medium to express a message of grace. Ryan stated that with video games [...] "you can create this world and ask the player to live in it and love what you have created". The name of the game is taken from a story that the Greens had told their other sons about Joel's illness through an allegory about how Joel was a brave knight fighting a dragon named Cancer.|$|E

40|$|The toxic {{fragment}} of Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins {{consists of three}} distinct structural domains. There is evidence that domain I is involved in pore formation and that domain II is involved in receptor binding and specificity. It has been found that, in some cases, domain III is also important in determining specificity. Furthermore, involvement of domain III in binding has also been reported recently. To investigate the role of toxin domains in the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), we used hybrid toxins with domain III substitutions among Cry 1 C, Cry 1 E, and Cry 1 Ab. Neither Cry 1 E nor G 27 (a hybrid with domains I and II <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 E and domain III <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C) was toxic, whereas Cry 1 C and F 26 (the reciprocal hybrid) were equally toxic. H 04 (a hybrid with domains I and II <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab and domain III <b>from</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C) showed toxicity that was of a similar level as that of Cry 1 Ab and significantly {{higher than that of}} Cry 1 C. Binding assays with 125 I-Cry 1 C showed that Cry 1 C and F 26 competed for the same binding sites on midgut membrane vesicles, whereas Cry 1 E, G 27, and H 04 did not bind to these sites. Our results show that, in contrast to findings in other insects for the toxins and hybrids used here, toxin specificity as well as specificity of binding to membrane vesicles in the diamondback moth is mediated by domain II (and/or I) and not by domain III...|$|R
