5|$|The Jordan Park {{founded in}} 1889 by Dr Henryk Jordan, {{was the first}} public park {{of its kind in}} Europe. The park built {{on the banks of the}} Rudawa river was {{equipped}} with running and exercise tracks, playgrounds, the swimming pool, amphitheatre, pavilions, and a pond for boat rowing and water bicycles. It is located on the grounds of a larger Kraków’s Błonia Park. The less prominent Park Krakowski was founded in 1885 by Stanisław Rehman but has since been greatly reduced in size because of rapid real estate development. It was a popular <b>destination</b> <b>point</b> with many Cracovians at the end of the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{traveling}} salesman {{problem is}} {{what is called a}} conventional optimization problem. That is, all the facts (distances between each <b>destination</b> <b>point)</b> needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices {{to come up with the}} one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.|$|E

Cleveland emerged in the early 20th Century as an important American manufacturing center, which included automotive companies such as Peerless, People's, Jordan, Chandler, and Winton, maker of the first car driven across the U.S. Other manufacturers located in Cleveland produced steam-powered cars, which included White and Gaeth, as well as the electric car company Baker.

60|$|With {{regard to}} the estates possessed by bishops and canons and commendatory abbots, I cannot find out for what reason some landed estates may not be held {{otherwise}} than by inheritance. Can any philosophic spoiler undertake to demonstrate the positive or the comparative evil of having a certain, and that, too, a large, portion of landed property passing in succession through persons whose title to it is, always in theory and often in fact, an eminent degree of piety, morals, and learning; a property which by its destination, in their turn, and on the score of merit, gives to the noblest families renovation and support, to the lowest the means of dignity and elevation; a property, the tenure {{of which is the}} performance of some duty, (whatever value you may choose to set upon that duty,) and the character of whose proprietors demands at least an exterior decorum and gravity of manners,--who are to exercise a generous, but temperate hospitality,--part of whose income they are to consider as a trust for charity,--and who, even when they fail in their trust, when they slide from their character, and degenerate into a mere common secular nobleman or gentleman, are in no respect worse than those who may succeed them in their forfeited possessions? Is it better that estates should be held by those who have no duty than by those who have one? by those whose character and <b>destination</b> <b>point</b> to virtues than by those who have no rule and direction in the expenditure of their estates but their own will and appetite? Nor are these estates held altogether in the character or with the evils supposed inherent in mortmain. They pass from hand to hand with a more rapid circulation than any other. No excess is good, and therefore too great a proportion of landed property may be held officially for life; but {{it does not seem to}} me of material injury to any common wealth that there should exist some estates that have a chance of being acquired by other means than the previous acquisition of money.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} the {{following}} motion coordination problem: given n mobile agents and n sourcedestination pairs in the plane, {{what is the}} minimum time needed to transfer each agent from its source to its destination, avoiding conflicts with other agents? The environment is free of obstacles and a conflict occurs when the distance between any two agents is smaller than a velocity-dependent safety distance. In the “best ” {{case in which the}} source and <b>destination</b> <b>points</b> can be chosen arbitrarily to maximize the transfer efficiency, we show that the transfer takes Θ (¯ L √ n) time to complete, where ¯ L is the average distance between the source and <b>destination</b> <b>points.</b> We show that there exist a “worst ” case distribution of the source and <b>destination</b> <b>points</b> for which the transfer of agents takes at least Ω(n) time. We also analyze the case in which source and <b>destination</b> <b>points</b> are generated randomly according to a uniform distribution, and present an algorithm providing a constructive upper bound on the time needed to transfer agents from sources to their corresponding destinations, proving that the transfer takes Θ (√ n) time, with high probability, thus recovering the best case performance.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{following}} motion coordination problem: given n mobile vehicles and n source-destination pairs in the plane, {{what is the}} minimum time needed to transfer each vehicle from its source to its destination, avoiding conflicts with other vehicles? In our model, vehicles do not explicitly communicate their intentions, and only have sensory information about the current position and velocity of their neighbors to ensure no conflicts. The environment is free of obstacles and a conflict occurs when the distance between any two vehicles is smaller than a velocity-dependent safety distance. We analyze the situation when the vehicle size is such that at least a constant fraction of the n vehicles can be fit inside the environment simultaneously. In the “best ” {{case in which the}} source and <b>destination</b> <b>points</b> can be chosen ideally to maximize the transfer efficiency, we show that the transfer takes Θ (¯ L √ n) time to complete, where ¯ L is the average distance between the source and <b>destination</b> <b>points.</b> We show that there exist a “worst ” case distribution of the source and <b>destination</b> <b>points</b> for which the transfer of vehicles takes at least Ω(n) time.
