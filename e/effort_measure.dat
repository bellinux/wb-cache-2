40|$|Software {{complexity}} {{measures are}} essential aspects of software engineering. Relatively {{few studies have}} been conducted to compare the performance of different complexity metrics. This paper describes an experimental investigation, which compares the performance of three different software complexity metrics; McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, Halstead's complexity measures and Douce's spatial complexity, by using data from an Open Source project Eclipse JDT. The results of this investigation indicate that in different situation these complexity metrics show different performance. However, Halstead's <b>effort</b> <b>measure</b> and Douce's spatial complexity are highly correlated, showing bigger correlation coefficient values. This leads us to suggest that because Halstead's complexity measure is more mature and has better supporting tools, it may {{be a good idea to}} replace Douce's spatial complexity metric with Halstead's <b>effort</b> <b>measure</b> in practice...|$|E

In Experiment 2, both the possibility to differentiate {{and the presence of}} a group goal were manipulated orthogonally.

40|$|In {{software}} development, human {{effort is}} {{the measure of the}} process capacity. To understand the demand, relocation is the most used practice, which makes it one of the potential causes of process variability. For Six Sigma, to know a process capacity is a pre-requirement for eliminating its variability and, for this, it suggests the employment of the Cp and Cpk capacity indexes. The first measures the capacity in meeting a specification, whereas the other also takes a certain goal into consideration. This work analyzes the results of using these indexes for directing the resource relocation and base the opportunity cost assessment used in the negotiations with client-users.

Although the psychological mechanisms behind human prosociality have extensively been studied, the specific neural systems bridging group belongingness and altruistic motivation remain to be identified.

We designed an <b>effort</b> <b>measure</b> based on handgrip strength to assess the motivation to earn money (i) for oneself, (ii) for anonymous ingroup fans, or (iii) for a neutral group of anonymous non-fans. While overlapping valuation signals in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) were observed for the three conditions, the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) exhibited increased functional connectivity with the mOFC as well as stronger hemodynamic responses for ingroup versus outgroup decisions. These findings indicate a key role for the SCC, a region previously implicated in altruistic decisions and group affiliation, in dovetailing altruistic motivations with neural valuation systems in real-life ingroup behaviour...|$|E

We investigated the relationship of foraging performance with age in female little penguins at Phillip Island, Australia, during the guard phase of the 2005 breeding season. Foraging parameters were recorded with accelerometers for birds grouped into three age-classes: (1) young, (2) middle age and (3) old females. We found the diving behaviour of middleaged birds differed from young and old birds. The dive duration of middle age females was shorter than that of young and old birds while their dive <b>effort</b> (<b>measure</b> for dive and post-dive duration relation) was lower than that of young ones, suggesting middle-aged birds were in better physical condition than other ones. There was no difference in prey pursuit frequency or duration between age classes, but in the hunting tactic. Females pursued more prey around and after reaching the maximum depth of dives the more experienced they were (old. middle age. young), an energy saving hunting tactic by probably taking advantage of up-thrust momentum. We suggest middle age penguins forage better than young or old ones because good physical condition and foraging experience could act simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part {{considers}} and develops some of the statistics used in genetic programming (GP) while the second uses those statistics to study and develop a form of incremental evolution and an early termination heuristic for GP. The first part looks in detail at success proportion, Koza's minimum computational effort, and a measure we rename "success effort". We describe and develop methods to produce confidence intervals for these measures as well as confidence intervals for the difference and ratio of these measures. The second part studies Jackson's fitness-based incremental evolution. If the number of fitness evaluations are considered (rather than the number of generations) then we find some potential benefit through reduction in the effort required to find a solution. We then automate the incremental evolution method and show a statistically significant improvement compared to GP with automatically defined functions (ADFs). The success <b>effort</b> <b>measure</b> is shown to have the critical advantage over Koza's measure as it has the ability to include a decreasing cost of failure. We capitalise on this advantage by demonstrating an early termination heuristic that again offers a statistically significant advantage...|$|E
40|$|These study {{analysed}} {{gender specificity}} in coping behaviours by {{taking into account}} the types of problem faced by Spanish adolescents attending school. It was focused on the ten problems most frequently reported by participants (828 adolescents, 355 boys, and 473 girls; Mage = 14. 07, SD = 1. 34), which were classified using a multi-axial classification system. Coping was examined as a two separate measures of approach and avoidance coping, and as a combined measure indicating the predominant use of coping, and total coping effort. A MANCOVA and subsequent univariate tests were conducted to analyse the specificity of coping according to problem and gender, controlled by age. The results showed that the percentage of types of problems reported by adolescents differed according to gender. The influence of gender on coping was scarcely relevant when the type of problem was controlled for. There were no gender differences when the predominant type of coping was considered, but when a total coping <b>effort</b> <b>measure</b> was analysed girls showed more coping efforts than boys to face interpersonal relationship problems and personal illness.

40|$|Purpose: Marras et al. {{developed}} {{a technique to}} evaluate sincerity of effort during dynamic trunk motion performance. The validity and reliability of the technique have not been evaluated. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to first determine whether or not a sincerity of <b>effort</b> <b>measure</b> correctly identified those giving a sincere effort in a blinded randomized control trial and second to quantify inter – rater and test – retest reliability. Methods: This article reports the findings of a two phase study. In phase one, the blinded evaluation, participants were randomly assigned to either a sincere or insincere performance condition. An examiner tested participants without knowledge of the participant’s group membership. In the second phase, two examiners evaluated each participant twice to quantify inter – rater and test – retest reliability. Results: In the blinded phase the specificity was 100 % and sensitivity was 90 % for identifying sincere and insincere effort, respectively. Phase two results showed no significant difference in probability of sincere effort between raters or between testing sessions. Conclusion: A performance criterion that accurately identifies sincere vs insincere group membership during functional evaluations was identified. There were no significant differ-ences between raters or between testing sessions.

40|$|More than 80 % of obese {{adolescents}} {{will become}} obese adults, {{and it is}} therefore important to enhance insight into characteristics that underlie the development and maintenance of overweight and obesity at a young age. The current study {{is the first to}} focus on attentional biases towards rewarding and punishing cues as potentially important factors. Participants were young adolescents (N = 607) who were followed from the age of 13 until the age of 19, and completed a motivational game indexing the attentional bias to general cues of reward and punishment. Additionally, self-reported reward and punishment sensitivity was measured. This study showed that attentional biases to cues that signal reward or punishment and self-reported reward and punishment sensitivity were not related to body mass index or the change in body mass index over six years in adolescents. Thus, attentional bias to cues of reward and cues of punishment, and self-reported reward and punishment sensitivity, {{do not seem to be}} crucial factors in the development and maintenance of overweight and obesity in adolescents. Exploratory analyses of the current study suggest that the amount of effort to gain reward and to avoid punishment may play a role in the development and maintenance of overweight and obesity.

40|$|Addressing the {{uncertainties}} in fishing activities, the CEDER project examines {{the use of}} observer reports, landings, e-logbooks, VMS and GPS tracks, and fishery-specific information. Such information was assessed {{in order to provide}} more accurate and timelier data on effort, catches, discards, and/or landings. This document contains CEDER¿s Project Implementation Plan for policy makers, as well as expected benefits for government, industry, and science. The CEDER consortium advocates the use of GPS data at 15 minute intervals for scientific purposes. Among these are improved spatial planning and a new fishing <b>effort</b> <b>measure,</b> the actual effort while fishing, which can be inferred from vessel behaviour. The correlation between catch and effort can be used as an indicator for inspectors, but one cannot reliably guess catches from effort. VMS and logbook data can be matched using rule-bases systems, leading to higher data quality and better use of quota. Furthermore, if fishing mortality were known in near real time, then the integration of current year fishing mortality into management plans would yield benefits for stock recovery. The full realisation of such benefits requires a re-appraisal of the 15 % TAC revision rule. The CEDER consortium insists that any roll-out of the ERS e-logbook must be properly enforced, and that the e-logbook cannot by itself replace observer reports. Finally, estimating discards may be feasible in selected fisheries, but additional means such as gear sensors may be required in order to get more reliable data in the general case. JRC.
