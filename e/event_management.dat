500|$|Congress leader Hussain Dalwai said, [...] "It's a sad {{commentary}} on the administration which {{has come to a}} stage where it requires the high court intervention". He put the onus of his party's coalition partner, saying, [...] "Whether it is MNS violence in the signboard or dalit killing at Khairlanji it shows an insensitive administration. The NCP president Sharad Pawar should seriously reflect on the working of the state home department." [...] Even NCP leaders including Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal have told RR Patil and Deshmukh, in the cabinet meet to [...] "either act or shut up". Suggesting that the Maharashtra government was not keen on taking strong action against MNS chief Raj Thackeray, the NDA on Thursday described as [...] "stage-managed show" [...] the arrest and bail for him in cases of violence against north Indians in the state. BJP MP Shahnawaz Hussain said, [...] "Congress is Raj Thackeray's <b>event</b> <b>management</b> company and it is trying to project Raj's arrest as an event instead of making any serious effort to check the violent campaign of MNS against north Indians. There is match-fixing between Raj and the Maharashtra government. The state government deliberately books him under small sections and he gets bail." [...] Talking on the attacks on North Indian candidates at the All-India Railway Recruitment examinations in Mumbai, Rajya Sabha MP and JD-U national general secretary Shivananda Tiwari also attacked Congress for [...] "promoting" [...] the MNS chief and comparing him with slain Punjab separatist leader Bhindarwale. [...] "Congress party has a mastery in creating 'bhasmasurs' (self destructing demons). Earlier they created Bhindranwale in Punjab, which killed a Congress Prime Minister. Even this Raj Thackeray is ultimately going to damage Congress," [...] Tiwari claimed. He also alleged that Maharashtra government arrested Raj to carry out a [...] "formality" [...] and as mild charges were pressed, he got bail soon.|$|E

2500|$|The Coyle E. [...] Moore Athletic Center {{is located}} {{on the north side of}} the University Center and is the center of Florida State Athletics and it's 400-plus student-athletes. It is home to the Athletics Administration and support staff and houses the Executive Staff, Business Office, Computer Information Services, Coaches' Video, Seminole Productions, College of Communication faculty offices and student edit rooms, Academic Support, Student Services, Compliance, Sports Information, Digital Media, Marketing and Promotions, Facilities and <b>Event</b> <b>Management,</b> classrooms, a dining {{facility}} with a full service kitchen, and a mailroom. Initially built in the 1950s as a football field house, the original infrastructure of the athletic center plumbing, sewage, and air-conditioning had become inadequate to the demands placed upon it by far more student-athletes and staff than it was designed for. In 2004, the Moore Building underwent an overhaul makeover to match the appearance of the rest of the University Center with a more efficient floor plan to allow for more room for growth. The new facility caters to the student athlete's needs by housing a dining hall, a 15,000 square foot training and rehab facility, and a more than 8,000 square foot tutorial and study hall space. A multi-purpose theater for team meetings, press conferences, and symposiums is also located on the first floor of the Moore Athletic Center. The main level showcases Florida State's talented student-athletes with wall-to-wall vibrant memories of historic Seminole seasons and athletic achievements, including the 1993 and 1999 football national championships. In an effort to enhance the studies of Florida State students, there is also a designated space for athletic-training curriculum and a studio provided for the College of Communication students to gain hands on experience producing work for Seminole athletics.|$|E
