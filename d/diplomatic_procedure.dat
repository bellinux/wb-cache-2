40|$|Disputes between States {{belong to}} the realm of Public International Law. These {{disputes}} are often resolved by two basic techniques of conflict management: <b>diplomatic</b> <b>procedures</b> and adjudication. For this purpose Public International Law discusses matters as the law of international organisations, the law of treaties, human rights, humanitarian law, international courts, etc. However, where the State exercises a commercial function, either by itself or through a State entity and enters into a business relationship with a private party, any disputes which arise are likely to be referred either to the courts of the State concerned or to international commercial arbitration. Almost invariably, the private party to such a contract will prefer arbitration as it is a ‘neutral’ process...|$|R

40|$|In our {{contemporary}} disillusionment {{it is again}} becoming the fashion to minimize both the role that law presently plays in the world power process and the role that, with more effective organization, it {{could be made to}} play in maintaining the values of a free, peaceful, and abundant world society.

40|$|Amos Shartle Hershey {{was born}} on July 11, 1867 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. He earned his A. B from Harvard in 1892, his Ph. D. from Heidelberg in 1894, and he studied in Paris as a Harvard fellow in 1895. In 1895, he joined the faculty of Indiana University, Bloomington with an initial {{appointment}} as assistant professor of political science. In 1900, {{he was promoted to}} associate professor of European history and politics, in 1905 junior professor of political science, and in 1907 professor of political science and international law. In 1914, the Indiana University Board of Trustees created a separate Department of Political Science with Dr. Hershey as the chair. Dr. Hershey’s expertise and knowledge of international law was such that President Woodrow Wilson had him accompany the U. S. delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference after World War I as a technical advisor. Prior to the war, he had traveled extensively in Europe and the Orient on the Kahn fellowship. After his service at Versailles, he taught at Harvard, and then in 1923, he took a seven-month leave to travel in the Near East and Mediterranean. In 1928, he took another leave of absence he traveled throughout Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. He continued to teach at Indiana University until his retirement in 1932, and he was still working on a book right up to his death. Dr. Amos Hershey died on June 12, 1933 in Madison, Indiana. Upon his death, the tributes poured in from newspapers around Indiana. The Indianapolis Star eulogized Dr. Hershey, saying, “The state lost one of its most eminent scholars and authorities in the field of international law and diplomacy in the death of Dr. Amos S. Hershey. … He was the type of faculty member who confers distinction on the institution he represents. His eminence in political science was recognized throughout the educational and diplomatic world. ” The Bloomington Evening World said, “The passing of Amos S. Hershey removes from the campus a personage who brought fame and international honor to Indiana University. His brilliant mind and his power of analysis of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>procedure</b> made him invaluable to the United State government, and the recognition given him by President Wilson in the all-important treaty negotiations in Paris after the World War bespeaks the confidence which the great war president had in him. Those students who sat at his feet during the many years he was a part of Indiana University will always revere the memory of Dr. Hershey. He has gone to take his place with the Wylies, the Maxwells, the Jordans, and the Eigenmanns, for he earned the right to be among Indiana’s great. ”[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Relying on {{thorough}} examination of relevant documents {{housed in the}} archives in Vienna, Paris, London, Berlin and Munich, this thesis analyzes the attitude {{of one of the}} most important personalities of the 19 th century, Austrian Chancellor Metternich, towards the Ottoman Empire and his behaviour in the complicated evolution of the Eastern Question from 1829 to 1841, in other words from the signature of the Treaty of Adrianople to the conclusion of the second London Treaty regarding the Straits. Attention is paid particularly to the final phase of the Greeks' struggle for independence and the relating Russian-Ottoman war, the French expedition to Algeria, the two Ottoman-Egyptian crises, the Rhine crisis caused by the complications in the Levant, the Russian-British rivalry in the East and the difficult situation of the Christians in Syria in the spring of 1841. A further reason for writing this thesis is to point out some of Metternich's hitherto unknown characteristics and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>procedures</b> transpiring from his Near Eastern policy. In the whole period covered by this research, Metternich pursued the policy of conservation: he tried to preserve the declining Ottoman Empire and avoid serious complications in the Levant caused by the attitudes of other European Powers or the internal disorder of the [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|After its {{founding}} in 1949, West Germany {{did not have a}} national anthem for official events for some years, despite the growing need for the purpose of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>procedures.</b> In lieu of an official national anthem, popular German songs such as the Trizonesien-Song, a carnival song mocking the occupying Allied powers, were used at some sporting events. Different musical compositions were discussed or used, such as the fourth movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which is a musical setting of Friedrich von Schiller's poem [...] "An die Freude" [...] ("Ode To Joy"). Though the black, red and gold colours of the national flag had been incorporated into Article 22 of the (West) German constitution, a national anthem was not specified. On 29 April 1952, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer asked President Theodor Heuss in a letter to accept [...] "" [...] as the national anthem, with only the third stanza being sung on official occasions. President Heuss agreed to this on 2 May 1952. This exchange of letters was published in the Bulletin of the Federal Government.

[...] "Australia {{would not tolerate}} acts of terrorism, wherever they occurred", he said.

40|$|One of {{the great}} paradoxes of post-medieval Europe, is why instead of {{bringing}} peace to a disorganised and violent world, modernity instead produced a seemingly endless string of conflicts and social upheavals. Why was it that the foundation and institutionalisation of secured peace {{and the rule of}} law seemed to go hand-in-hand with the proliferation of war and the violation of individual and collective rights? In order to try to better understand such profound questions, this volume explores the history and theories of political thought of international relations in the seventeenth century, a period in which many of the defining features and boundaries of modern Europe where fixed and codified. With the discovery of the New World, and the fundamental impact of the Reformation, the complexity of international relations increased considerably. Reactions to these upheavals resulted in a range of responses intended to address the contradictions and conflicts of the anarchical society of states. Alongside the emergence of "modern" international law, the equation of international relations with the state of nature, and the development of the "balance of power", <b>diplomatic</b> <b>procedures</b> and commercial customs arose which shaped the emerging (and current) international system of states. Employing a multidisciplinary approach to address these issues, this volume brings together political scientists, philosophers, historians of political thought, jurists and scholars of international relations. What emerges is a certain tension between the different strands of research which allows for a fruitful new synthesis. In this respect the assembled essays in this volume offer a sophisticated and fresh account of the interactions of law, conflict and the nation state in an early-modern European context...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{depicts the}} UNESCO World Heritage Convention (1972), an {{international}} {{law for the}} protection of natural and cultural heritage sites, {{as an example of the}} multiple practices within international policy making. By analysing its transnational constitution, I show how the Convention is constructed in and between locales through bureaucratic and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>procedures</b> characterised by intersecting political and economic interests. Using neo-institutional theory, I argue that organisations such as UNESCO frame problems as global, provide solutions, and organise the actions of states, organizations, and individuals; furthermore, my research not only illustrates how this occurs but also explores the preconditions of international policy making. While adhering to its officially proclaimed aspirations, states, organisations, and individuals also use the Convention for other purposes such as international prestige, career advancement, publicity, identity, development, tourism – even war. Such contending interests raise the question of explaining the success of the Convention and thereby the preconditions of policy making at the international level. A conclusion reached by this study shows that growing interest in the Convention can be regarded to result only partially from the general acceptance of its global rhetoric and morally vested perspective or the need for states to gain legitimacy by engaging in international relations. My thesis proposes that rather than by its official aims and formal procedures, the Convention is constituted primarily through complex informal relations, concurring contexts, and external structures. Data for this ethnographic study consists of field notes from participant observations during UNESCO meetings in France, Morocco, Australia, and at the Convention’s secretariat. A case study of the Agricultural Landscape of Southern Öland, a Swedish World Heritage site, is also included, along with interviews, documents, and media...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of regional trading agreements {{around the world}} has changed the landscape of international trade law from a multi-polar system anchored in the nationstate to one where there are groups of closely-knit sovereign nations. They are usually drawn along geographical lines and are conducting trade with one another in a myriad of ways. This craze for trade deals is sure to give rise to disputes that are an inescapable outcome of the bilateral, regional and international agreements that contain the will of these nations to engage in greater co-operation with one another. As such, it has become necessary to design reliable dispute settlement mechanisms for the settlement of trade related disputes for the effective functioning of the trading agreements. Dispute settlement systems have progressed from being unsophisticated and diplomacy oriented as typified by that of the GATT to the highly legalized adjudication based mechanism that is the crowning glory of the WTO. This trend has been followed by other trading organizations that have modified their dispute settlement mechanisms to become more legalistic. CARICOM is a reborn regional trading bloc in the Caribbean and in lock step with the trend of other trading clubs has augmented its dispute settlement mechanism with a long awaited regional court and other non-binding alternative dispute resolution methods to avert legal clashes. This thesis examines the progress of the CARICOM dispute settlement mechanism from its originally <b>diplomatic</b> <b>procedures</b> to its enhanced legalistic system. A standing judicial institution in CARICOM is a coming of age for this region and its jurisprudence now referred to as CARICOM law. These significant legal advances raise many normative questions about the adequacy of the dispute settlement institutions and whether the rules and processes are clearly defined to enable nascent CARICOM law to be the primary tool by which there can be effective regulation of CARICOM integration. In order to answer these questions this thesis reviews the dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO and the EU as the natural ‘parents’ of the CARICOM dispute settlement system.

40|$|Analysing {{disputes}} between the US and the EU under GATT and the WTO respectively, the paper {{demonstrates that the}} judicialization (or legalization) of international dispute settlement procedures can contribute to states’ compliance with these dispute settlement mechanisms. The paper compares four sets of pairwise similar disputes with US had with the EU: the socalled Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) case (which arose under GATT) and the Foreign Sales Corporations case (which was settled through WTO procedures), the Steel case (GATT) and the Patents case (WTO), the two Hormones cases under GATT and the WTO respectively, and the Citrus case (GATT) and the Bananas case (WTO). In {{each of the four}} comparisons the US acted more in accordance with the judicial WTO dispute settlement procedures than with the <b>diplomatic</b> GATT <b>procedures.</b> We can therefore say that contrary to realist assumptions, the judicialization of dispute settlement procedures can contribute to their effectiveness. However, contrary to idealist assumptions the effectiveness of international dispute settlement procedures does not automatically follow from their judicialization. Yet, as assumed by institutionalists, judicialized dispute settlement procedures are better than diplomatic dispute settlement mechanisms in sustaining states’ compliance with these procedures precisely because of their normative and strategic effects...|$|R

Važan segment obavještajne mreže bili su tajni dubrovački pouzdanici u europskim političkim središtima, Dubrovčani u stranoj službi te brojni dubrovački trgovci i pomorci. U ovom radu uz okolnosti koje su dovele do austrijsko-turskog rata (1737. - 1739.) analizira se ustroj i djelovanje dubrovačke obavještajne službe, a kao prilog donosi se dio korespondencije Senata s glavnim dubrovačkim obavještajcima tijekom rata, Petrom Bianchijem u Beču i Nikolom Đivovićem u Ugarskoj.

The information reports which the Senate received from its agents were often of essential value for the security and well-being of the Republic.
