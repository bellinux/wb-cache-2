40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis was to {{evaluate}} radiation doses {{to patients with}} lung skigrafii. The impetus {{for the treatment of}} this topic was that even though the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (Věštník MZ ČR 9 / 2011) recommends the use of classic hard skigrafii lung imaging technique, a number of radiodiagnostic workplaces still uses the technique of low voltage, although the patient is exposed to a higher dose. Skigrafie lung examination is among the low-dose exposure, but it is the most commonly performed tests. Since the risks of radiation from various sources of radiation during their lives constantly in the body are added, it is necessary to try to make at least a medical exposures are minimized as much as possible. In the theoretical part I tried to arrange the all important information on x-rays, skiagrafii, lung anatomy, imaging techniques, radiation protection and legislative framework that deals radiodiagnostika. Department of Radiology in the Czech Republic have at their disposal guidelines and recommendations for proper X-ray examinations, called. National Radiological standards that ensure optimum image quality while minimizing the radiation dose for the patient. For physicians who indicate radiodiagnostic examinations is crucial document "Indication criteria for imaging", which sets criteria so that all examinations imaging methods were <b>duly</b> <b>substantiated,</b> and their indications regulated. Practical work is focused on comparing the radiation burden of two imaging techniques for the examination of the lungs, namely imaging technique compared with low (ie. Soft) and high (ie. Hard) exposure voltage. The main part is based on the processing of results and input values falling surface kerma, which were measured for X-ray work by a water phantom ionization chamber using two exposure techniques. Based oriented values and using tabulated values I calculated the dose for each imaging technique. The effective dose for soft imaging technique was almost three times higher than the technique hard. Also interesting is the result of secondary radiation, the soft technique is almost five times exceeds the emerging secondary radiation hard imaging technique. Another important part of this work was to compare the effective doses for the two groups of selected patients with radiographic examination of the lungs, were divided according to the used imaging technique. The first group of patients who were imaged {{in the first quarter of}} 2014 equipment with voltage 125 kV, in the second group were patients from the first quarter of 2011 the average radiography exposure voltage 57. 2 kV. From both groups were selected only patients with a weight of 60 - 80 kg, which approximates the patient's usual layout, with whom works legislation Ministry of Health. The effective dose for hard imaging technique for the examination is 0. 0085 mSv, for a soft technique is effective dose equal to 0. 0304 mSv. It follows that the effective dose for hard skigrafické imaging technique for examination of the lungs during soft imaging technique is 3. 5 times higher than in the technique hard. In terms of radiation protection is also interesting, as shown in the calculation of benefits program PCXMC that the dose to the gonads when skigrafické examination of the lungs almost zero, therefore the use of protective equipment in the genitals during the examination pointless and rather plays a psychological role. The aim of this thesis was to demonstrate that the advised the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic on the transition from soft to hard imaging technique technique is justified. On the basis of unmeasured values and progressive processing of results I could confirm my hypothesis: Using hard imaging technique at skigrafii lungs is reduced patient radiation dose...|$|E
