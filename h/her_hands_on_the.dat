5|$|In March, Melina {{was placed}} in an angle where she became jealous of SmackDown! Diva Ashley Massaro, who was {{receiving}} attention because of her appearance in Playboy. The angle had Melina claim in her blogs that no Playboy cover models were capable of fighting her. This resulted in scheduled matches against former Playboy cover girls Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle, with both women losing to Melina. The storyline {{came to an end}} at WrestleMania 23, where Melina pinned Ashley in a Lumberjill match to retain her Women's Championship. After WrestleMania, Melina organized a photo op with the Women's Championship belt in the ring, but was interrupted by Mickie James, resulting in another storyline feud between the two Divas. On April 24, at a house show in Paris, France, Melina lost the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match to James when James pinned Victoria, but on the orders of Jonathan Coachman, she was entitled to a rematch on the same night, where she pinned James by putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes to regain the title and become a two-time WWE Women's Champion.|$|E
25|$|Sculptures of Epona {{fall into}} five types, as {{distinguished}} by Benoît: riding, standing or seated before a horse, standing or seated between two horses, a tamer of {{horses in the}} manner of potnia theron and the symbolic mare and foal. In the Equestrian type, common in Gaul, she is depicted sitting side-saddle on a horse or (rarely) lying on one; in the Imperial type (more common outside Gaul) she sits on a throne flanked by two or more horses or foals. In distant Dacia, she is represented on a stela (now at the Szépmüvézeti Museum, Budapest) in the format of Cybele, seated frontally on a throne with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> necks of her paired animals: her horses are substitutions for Cybele's lions.|$|E
500|$|William had {{crushed the}} Irish Jacobites by 1692, but he {{continued}} with campaigns abroad to wage war against France in the Netherlands. When her husband was away, Mary acted on her own if his advice was not available; whilst he was in England, Mary completely refrained from interfering in political matters, as had been agreed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights, and as she preferred. She proved a firm ruler, ordering the arrest of her own uncle, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, for plotting to restore James II to the throne. In January 1692, the influential John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough, was dismissed on similar charges; the dismissal somewhat diminished her popularity and further harmed {{her relationship with her}} sister Anne (who was strongly influenced by Churchill's wife, Sarah). Anne appeared at court with Sarah, obviously supporting the disgraced Churchill, which led to Mary angrily demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah and vacate her lodgings. Mary fell ill with a fever in April, and missed Sunday church service {{for the first time in}} 12 years. She also failed to visit Anne, who was suffering a difficult labour. After Mary's recovery and the death of Anne's baby soon after it was born, Mary did visit her sister, but chose the opportunity to berate Anne for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Marlborough was arrested and imprisoned, but then released after his accuser was revealed to be an impostor. Mary recorded in her journal that the breach between the sisters was a punishment from God for the [...] "irregularity" [...] of the Revolution. She was extremely devout, and attended prayers at least twice a day. Many of her proclamations focus on combating licentiousness, insobriety and vice. She often participated in the affairs of the Church—all matters of ecclesiastical patronage passed through <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> death of Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson in December 1694, Mary was keen to appoint Bishop of Worcester Edward Stillingfleet to the vacancy, but William over-ruled her and the post went to Bishop of Lincoln Thomas Tenison.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|The Blickensderfer typewriter, {{designed}} by George Canfield Blickensderfer in 1892, {{was known for}} its novel keyboard layout, its interchangeable font, and its suitability for travel. [...] The Blickensderfer keyboard had three banks (rows of keys), with special characters being entered using a separate Shift key; the home row was, uniquely, the bottom one (i.e. the typist kept <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom row). [...] A computer or standard typewriter keyboard, on the other hand, has four banks of keys, with home row being second from bottom.|$|E
2500|$|A season {{one episode}} of MTV's Fear, a paranormal reality {{television}} show, featured a completely fictionalized {{account of the}} Princess Doe murder. In the episode, airing in 2000, Princess Doe was portrayed as {{the victim of a}} cult sacrifice. [...] Viewers were told that Princess Doe was found decapitated and missing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds of [...] "Camp Spirit Lake", a fictionalized version of Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, which is located in Hardwick Township, New Jersey. Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco is notable for having been the filming location of the first Friday the 13th film, which Lt. Eric Kranz appeared in two years before the discovery of Princess Doe's body.|$|E

2500|$|In the post-Star Trek Nemesis novels, the Borg Queen {{is not a}} single, irreplaceable entity, but {{the product}} of a program called [...] "the Royal Protocol" [...] that shares its name with a Starfleet {{document}} outlining requirements when dealing with foreign royalty. This program is used to create a Borg Queen from any female Borg (though Borg drones supposedly have no gender), commanding the technology within her to alter and adapt to the protocol's specifications. In the relaunch novels, {{one of the leaders of}} Starfleet Intelligence gets <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Royal Protocol, and with the use of an emergency medical hologram, turns herself into a new kind of Borg Queen who cares about and loves her drones.|$|E
2500|$|Ciara {{became the}} face of Jay-Z's Rocawear {{clothing}} line and spokesperson for the women campaign entitled [...] "I Will Not Lose", which debuted {{in the summer of}} 2007. In the October issue of Vibe Magazine, she appeared, apparently nude, on the magazine cover but claimed Vibe had airbrushed her clothes off. She told MTV News that she was hurt by the photos and was quite shocked when she finally got <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> month's issue. She later confirmed that she was in fact clothed. In September 2008, Ciara contributed to the song [...] "Just Stand Up!" [...] with fifteen other female artists, who shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008 during the [...] "Stand Up to Cancer" [...] television special. The proceeds from the single were given to the fundraiser. The television special helped raise $100million for cancer research.|$|E
