Central to many schemes designed to genetically modify plants is the availability of an efficient host <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> system. Ideally the <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> should provide an easy and reproducible system for the introduction of isolated genes—or groups of genes—into the genome of plant cells.

However the information of the class distinction provided by such genes may overlap intensively, since their gene expression patterns are similar. The redundancy of including many genes with similar gene expression patterns results in highly complex classifiers.

However, arterial reobstruction after stenting, in-stent restenosis, remains an important problem. Gene therapy to treat in-stent restenosis by using <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> delivery from the metallic stent surfaces has never been demonstrated. The present studies investigated the hypothesis that metal–bisphosphonate binding can enable site-specific <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> delivery from metal surfaces. Polyallylamine bisphosphonate (PAA-BP) was synthesized by using Michael addition methodology. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PAA-BP resulted {{in the formation of}} a monomolecular bisphosphonate layer on metal alloy surfaces (steel, nitinol, and cobalt–chromium), as demonstrated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface-bound PAA-BP enabled adenoviral (Ad) tethering due to covalent thiol-binding of either anti-Ad antibody or a recombinant Ad-receptor protein, D 1. In arterial smooth muscle cell cultures, alloy samples configured with surface-tethered Ad were demonstrated to achieve site-specific transduction with a reporter gene, (GFP). Rat carotid stent angioplasties using metal stents exposed to aqueous PAA-BP and derivatized with anti-knob antibody or D 1 resulted in extensive localized Ad-GFP expression in the arterial wall. In a separate study with a model therapeutic vector, Ad-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) attached to the bisphosphonate-treated metal stent surface via D 1, significant inhibition of restenosis was demonstrated (neointimal/media ratio 1. 68 ± 0. 27 and 3. 4 ± 0. 35; Ad-iNOS vs. control, P < 0. 01).

Therefore, we have infused adenovirus vectors expressing either a therapeutic tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene or a lacZ reporter gene into striatum in a rat model of PD. The experimental procedures were tested using the Ad lacZ vector in order to optimize concentrations, volumes, infusion speeds and transfection times. The expression of Ad lacZ vector was lower and declined earlier in the lesioned than unlesioned striatum suggesting that the lesion affects on the transfection efficiency and outcome of gene transfection. The effect of three diffe rent approaches of Ad TH vector transfection was com pared: 1) the delivery of Ad TH <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> alone into one single site of striatum, 2) the delivery of Ad TH <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> alone into multiple sites of striatum, and 3) the delivery of Ad TH <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> into one site of striatum followed by a continuous infusion of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) cofactor with a mini pump. There was a small and transient unsignificant decrease in the turning behavior when the Ad TH vector was delivered into one site of the striatum. Simultaneous infusion into several sites or together with BH 4 cofactor did not improve more the effect of gene delivery. Thus, although the effects were unsignificant, the Ad TH transfection seemed to decrease the turning behavior in the rat model of PD and the optimal effect was seen at some specific doses and time points.

40|$|Heightened {{interest}} {{in the field of}} gene therapy has {{led to the development of}} multitudes of <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> candidates. Most, if not all, modern vector designs have focused on improving cell binding and entry in an effort to boost therapeutic potency. Cellular uptake is a critical first step to produce a viable gene therapy, but the numerous intracellular trafficking checkpoints [...] - including arguably the most important process of gene delivery, nuclear localization [...] - have been largely ignored. Engineering gene vectors that can more effectively navigate to the nucleus will lead to unequivocally better products with higher therapeutic efficacy, but it has remained challenging to control the intracellular processes affecting endocytosed vectors. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a leading <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> that enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and escapes endosomes using a viral phospholipase motif. The natural AAV capsid has evolved to infiltrate a broad spectrum of cell types, but AAV's trajectory into the nucleus is significantly hampered by perinuclear sequestration. This situates AAV as a <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> that is good at penetrating the cell endosomal membrane, but poor at penetrating the cell nuclei. The negative implications of this are three-fold: First, because AAV cannot effectively enter the nucleus, a high dose is required for only a small fraction of viruses to ultimately deliver a therapeutic transgene. Second, because AAV has a broad tropism the high dose requirement may lead to more viruses entering off-target tissues. Third, dose-dependent immune response can become a safety concern when more virus is needed. Thus, vectors engineered to overcome the nuclear uptake barrier may yield more effective and safer gene therapies. Furthermore, if this nuclear entry step can be made user-controllable, then the overall gene delivery process could be rendered more predictable both in space and time. To reach this goal, gene vectors can be built to be responsive to environmental cues. A variety of stimulus-responsive gene vectors, capable of sensing and responding to an environmental stimulus, have been developed, but mostly to address the problem of cellular uptake. Designing vectors capable of responding to a stimulus at a later step in intracellular trafficking, such as nuclear localization, may provide an extra degree of control over vector trajectory. However, it has proven challenging to develop a <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> capable of improving nuclear localization in response to a stimulus in a dose-dependent and location specific-manner. Exogenous light stimulation could render gene delivery more quantitatively controllable both in space and time. Illumination of most wavelengths is relatively orthogonal to cell physiology and can be controlled in three dimensions: space, time, and brightness. By combining approaches from gene therapy with those from synthetic biology, a <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> could be made light-responsive. For instance, by coupling an optogenetic sensor with an intracellular functional domain, such as a nuclear localization sequence, light could be harnessed to control the nuclear translocation of gene delivery vectors, leading to tunable gene expression. This thesis serves first to review the many barriers to gene delivery and the vectors designed to circumvent such barriers. I next make my case for using light as a stimulus to improve both nuclear localization and target cell specificity of gene vectors. I then describe my endeavors to engineer an AAV capable of participating in a light-activatable system that can simultaneously enhance viral nuclear localization and spatially define regions of interest for enhanced gene delivery. Finally, I reveal my light-activatable virus (LAV) prototype that is an all-in-one sensor-effector <b>gene</b> <b>vector</b> capable of tunable delivery via optically-induced conformational changes on the capsid. A panel of LAVs are characterized that are capable of adjusting gene delivery based on blue light flux.

The program starts with a <b>gene</b> <b>vector,</b> i. e., the set of {{measurements}} associated with a gene, and finds similar vectors, derives a probabilistic model of these vectors, then repeats search using this model as a query, and continues to update the model and search again, until convergence. When applied to three different pathway-discovery problems, psi-square was generally more sensitive and sometimes more specific than the ad hoc methods developed for solving each of these problems before...|$|E
40|$|Extrachromosomal <b>gene</b> {{expression}} <b>vectors</b> {{that contain}} native genomic gene expression elements have numerous advantages over traditional integrating mini-gene vectors. In this protocol chapter we describe our work using episomal vectors where {{expression of a}} cDNA is controlled by a 10 kB piece of genomic DNA encompassing the promoter of the low density lipoprotein receptor. We explain methods to sub-clone large genomic inserts into <b>gene</b> expression <b>vectors.</b> We also illustrate various methods employed to ascertain whether expression from these vectors is robust and physiologically relevant by investigating their sensitivity to changes in cellular milieu. Delivery of <b>gene</b> expression <b>vectors</b> in vivo is also described using hydrodynamic tail vein injection, a high pressure, high volume tail vein injection used for liver-directed gene transfer...|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s the FGSC added {{molecular}} materials including cloned <b>genes,</b> cloning <b>vectors</b> and <b>gene</b> libraries to the collection.|$|R
50|$|Dependoviruses require helper viruses (e.g. herpesviruses) to replicate. They {{are also}} perfect {{candidates}} as <b>gene</b> <b>vectors.</b> They are utilized to investigate genes in cell {{cultures of the}} proteins which are encoded by those genes via mass production method or manipulated as probable <b>vectors</b> to examine <b>genes</b> in the cells of patients for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} several genetic diseases and cancers. The biggest advantage for such applications is that they are not known to cause any diseases.|$|R
