Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Additional demands are being placed upon reservoirs to meet a variety of diverse needs. These demands require efficient management of the limited storage through reservoir operations. This efficiency is most critical with water supply reservoirs. Reservoirs operated strictly for conservation purposes typically provide only incidental <b>flood</b> <b>control.</b> As the construction age of water resources declines, innovative strategies to utilize the finite water supplies Must be developed. Significant numbers of reallocations in reservoir <b>storage</b> between <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> and water supply pools have occurred in the past. Historically, storage transfer has increased the conservation pool at the cost of <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>storage</b> due to the greater direct economic benefits associated with municipal and industrial water supply. This transfer can only occur in multipurpose reservoirs; however, the majority of reservoirs contain no <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>storage.</b> This characteristic is fostered by the high (and generally rising) cost of including the <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> purpose in the reservoir scope. This investigation presents findings specific to operating strategies of reservoirs lacking <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>storage.</b> The non-structural strategies applied include seasonal and permanent reallocations of water supply <b>storage</b> for <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> purposes. Lake Limestone in Central Texas serves as the case study. The highly variable conditions of the watershed commonly exhibit both hydrologic extremes, floods and droughts. The agency responsible for this reservoir, the Brazos River Authority (BRA), is intensifying their efforts in the management of the water resources under their jurisdiction. This active role highlights the legal aspects involving water resources management; and, in particular, reservoir operations. Thus, the related matter of institutional liabilities of reservoir operations are discussed herein to give a comprehensive view of the affiliated concerns in the complex world of reservoir operations...|$|R

30|$|Operational {{policies}} for future scenario were framed for various combinations of resource enhancement and demand management strategies. Resource enhancement strategy through reallocation of reservoir storage capacity encompasses increasing the conservation storage volume at {{the expenses of}} <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>storage</b> volume for reservoirs. Again relatively small storage reallocation seems to be viable keeping in view the uncertainty in occurrence of extreme rainfall events and risk associated with loss in <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>storage</b> capacity, particularly, in case of extreme flood event. Analysis of historical record revealed occasional spells of moderately high inflow to Maithon and Panchet reservoirs to occur every year during non-monsoon months—the occurrence {{was found to be}} higher for Panchet reservoir (located on the main stream of Damodar river system) than for Maithon reservoir. Hence, an increase in storage capacity of the reservoirs (by reallocating 15  % of flood storage of Maithon reservoir and 20  % of flood storage of Panchet reservoir (flood storage capacity of Panchet reservoir being larger than that of Maithon reservoir) to corresponding conservation storages during season- 3 and season- 4) may be explored as a measure to improve the performance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reservoir}} is used {{mostly for}} <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>storage,</b> and is rarely filled to its [...] capacity.

When flows from the Shasta Dam, upstream on the Sacramento River, are sufficient to flush contaminated water away, water held in the reservoir is released through the outlet works into the Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. Despite this operation strategy, the reservoir was eventually deemed inadequate for the watershed, and can be filled to capacity by a single heavy storm event.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a hydro-economic optimization modeling framework {{to assess the}} economic consequences and potential trade-offs of various infrastructure development and policy pathways in the Nam Ngum Basin (Lao PDR). We considered whether large shifts in water resource demands in a relatively water abundant basin could induce meaningful economic trade-offs among water uses, including hydropower generation, irrigation expansion, <b>flood</b> <b>control,</b> and transboundary water transfer objectives. We constructed a series of sensitivity scenarios under dry, average, and wet hydrologic conditions with varying levels dam development, irrigated agricultural expansion, agricultural returns, <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>storage</b> restrictions, and water diversions to Northeast Thailand. We also considered how flows into the Mekong {{would be affected by}} these collective developments. In general, results indicate that tradeoffs between hydropower production, irrigation, and <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> are modest. Hydropower and agricultural expansion are found to be complimentary under high levels of water availability, even with the most ambitious level of irrigation expansion. Allowing for <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> by maintaining reduced storage levels in the reservoir that is largest and furthest downstream on the Nam Ngum (NN 1) has a minimal effect on economic output and decreases total system hydropower by less than 1 %. However, economic outcomes are highly dependent on water availability and economic returns to irrigated agriculture. System hydropower was greatly reduced, and inter-basin transfer projects induced large economic costs under dry conditions. These results on seasonal impacts illustrate the importance of accounting for climate variability and potential hydrologic change in cost-benefit analysis of infrastructure projects, even in watersheds that are relatively water abundant...|$|R
