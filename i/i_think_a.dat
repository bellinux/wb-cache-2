5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's {{a big deal to}} be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> {{strong case}} can be made that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
500|$|Oxford stroke Andy Michelmore was {{surprised}} by the conditions: [...] "we couldn't extend ourselves until the very end."

500|$|Forster's {{impressive}} performances for Celtic in the Champions League {{and involvement}} with the England international squad led to media reports in October and November 2013 that several clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, were considering {{to make a bid}} for the goalkeeper. In response to the press speculation, Celtic manager Neil Lennon commented, [...] "It's going to be impossible to keep Fraser, the way he's playing," [...] adding, [...] "Inevitably, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> huge club will come in and make a huge bid for him." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Chicago Music Magazine, Chloë Agnew described the lyrics of the song as [...] "really incredible". She stated that [...] "It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s really so special. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of people have}} found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events come up and tell me how much that song means to them and how it has helped them". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E

500|$|Fuller and Form {{likened the}} new Nightmare film to their 2003 remake of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and {{retracted}} an earlier statement {{when they said}} they did not plan to [...] "cherry pick" [...] the best elements of the franchise, like they did with the reboot of the Friday the 13th franchise they released in 2009. Instead, the 2010 film is more of a reimagining. The pair also explained that A Nightmare on Elm Street would have a different tone than the Friday the 13th remake. Form states, [...] "I think a Friday the 13th movie like we made was really fun. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> Nightmare movie is not that." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode to be written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, [...] "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy {{a long time to}} figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of people feel like that." [...] In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.|$|E
500|$|... "Down to Earth" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber, Mason [...] "MdL" [...] Levy, Carlos and Steven Battey of The Jackie Boyz, and Kevin Risto and Waynne Nugent of Midi Mafia. It was {{recorded}} at Icon Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and it was mixed at Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. The track {{was one of three}} songs on the standard edition of My World that Bieber co-wrote. In an interview in the November 14, 2009 issue of Billboard, Bieber explained the meaning behind the song stating, [...] "It's a ballad about the feelings I had when my parents split up and how I helped my family get through it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of kids have had their parents split up, and they should know that it wasn't because of something they did. I hope people can relate to it." ...|$|E

500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of the actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms {{of the quality of the}} show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
500|$|For the role, Bana shaved his head, gained thirty pounds, {{and spent}} two days with Read to perfect his mimicry. During filming he arrived on set {{at four in the}} morning and spent five hours being covered in Read's {{trademark}} tattoos. In spite of the film's limited release outside of Australia, Bana's performance received positive reviews. American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana, stating that [...] "in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>a</b> future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match. You cannot look away from him". Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001. Bana's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg kept most of {{the parts}} secret in the filmmaking, as {{the cast and crew}} were left {{confused}} about how the aliens looked. When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, [...] " [...] wouldn't give [...] to anybody". Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, [...] "I know some people who always say, 'Oh, everything's so secret.' I think it's good. In the old days people didn't get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there's just so much information. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> bit of mystery is always really good. You don't want to blow all of your cards beforehand." ...|$|E

500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of us can relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E
500|$|After reading Pride and Prejudice, playwright Richard Sheridan {{advised a}} friend to [...] "uy it immediately" [...] for it [...] "was one of the cleverest things" [...] he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, wrote that [...] "I have {{finished}} the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> very superior work." [...] She commented that the novel [...] "is the most probable fiction I have ever read" [...] and had become [...] "at present the fashionable novel". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that Mansfield Park was [...] "ot much of a novel, more {{the history of a}} family party in the country, very natural"—as if, comments one Austen scholar, [...] "Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery." [...] Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist Maria Edgeworth, that [...] " [...] has been pretty generally admired here" [...] and Edgeworth commented later that [...] "we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park".|$|E
500|$|After the 2001 NPC, Crusaders' captain Todd Blackadder left New Zealand to play rugby in Scotland. During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, half-back Justin Marshall {{questioned}} {{which of}} the senior players were going to step into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches. Hammett took the comment [...] "as {{a slap in the}} face", as [...] "one player doesn't make a team." [...] Hammett later said [...] "I took it that way, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of the others must have as well, because we all ended up stepping up!" [...] Subsequently, the Crusaders went through the season unbeaten, including a 96–19 victory over the New South Wales Waratahs. He again played for the All Blacks in 2002, starting against Australia and South Africa in the Tri-Nations. The 2002 NPC season was Hammett's last, and although Canterbury were knocked out in their semi-final, they managed to retain the Ranfurly Shield. Hammett's last match was his 76th for Canterbury.|$|E

60|$|What annoyed Mrs. Warrington with Dr. Johnson {{more than}} his contradictions, his sputterings, and his dirty nails, was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>an</b> {{unfavourable}} opinion which he formed of my new tragedy. Hagan once proposed that he should read some scenes from it after tea.|$|R
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|Kiersten Warren also {{returned}} to the series as Nora Huntington after being introduced {{at the end of}} the second season. On her storyline, Warren commented, [...] "There's a lot of families who are going through this. Not quite the surprise ooh, boo, child, but children from other marriages and trying to meld these families. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of people have to deal with it. I think it's fantastic that they’re doing this on the show." [...] Dougray Scott made his debut in this episode as Ian Hainsworth, Susan's romantic interest. Cherry opined that the character [...] "can legitimately rival Mike for [...] affections." [...] Daily commented on the storyline, saying: [...] "Talk about dark comedy — we're trying to find the humor in these two people bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma." [...] Scott called his character [...] "bumbling at times," [...] adding, [...] "He kind of blossoms after he rediscovers his romantic juices with Susan." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E
