When realizing that Grandpa and Bart are heading to Branson, Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Maggie take a bus there. At the theater, Grampa calls out to <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> from on-stage, but then denounces her in front of everyone, who then call her (in a chant) a hoochie, sending her fleeing off the stage in tears. Grampa then reconciles with Homer.|$|E

25|$|In {{his poem}} Ludovico Ariosto relates how Marphise, the woman warrior, knocks the knight Pinabello off his horse after <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> had mocked Marphise's companion, {{the old woman}} Gabrina. In Marphise by Eugène Delacroix, Pinabello lies on the ground, and his horse gallops off in the distance. The knight's lady, meanwhile, is forced to disrobe and give her fancy {{clothing}} to Gabrina. Marphise's horse, undisturbed by the drama, nonchalantly munches on the leaves overhead.|$|E

When <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> comes to see him, he gives her the falcon to eat. Knowing his case she changes her mind, marries him and makes him rich.|$|E
25|$|The Middle English poem, the Isle of Ladies {{describes}} a dreamer who is transported {{in his dream}} to an island where only women live, an Otherworldly island made of glass where he sees <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> love. She travels in a boat back to her own country and he travels back later with a cargo of corpses, which miraculously revive when they arrive on the further shore and seeds are put into their mouths.|$|E
25|$|This mutoscope or What the Butler Saw arcade {{machine is}} {{possibly}} Edwardian. These tourist amusements used {{a set of}} flicking cards containing sequential photographs to simulate moving pictures; they were cheap attractions in the entrances to indoor amusement arcades on piers or on the seafront. They tended to contain quaint and voyeuristic flicks: a typical one still in use at Southend pier in 1963 had a butler peeping through a keyhole to see <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> employer showing her ankles and voluminous bloomers.|$|E

25|$|The film {{revolves}} around a Tamil Indian doctor who, two {{weeks prior to}} his wedding, goes to Russia for a conference pertaining to his occupation, that of a doctor. While in Russia he struggles {{to cope with the}} language because of the Russian reluctance to speak English, and eventually, due to the gruesome murder of a local woman, he gets imprisoned. How the doctor manages to get himself out of jail in order to get married to <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> love in India, {{with the help of an}} Indian female lawyer, forms the crux of the story.|$|E
25|$|The unicorn also {{figured in}} courtly terms: for some 13th-century French authors such as Thibaut of Champagne and Richard de Fournival, the lover is {{attracted}} to <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> as the unicorn {{is to the}} virgin. With the rise of humanism, the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in Petrarch's Triumph of Chastity, and on the reverse of Piero della Francesca's portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband Federico da Montefeltro (painted c 1472-74), Bianca's triumphal car is drawn {{by a pair of}} unicorns.|$|E
25|$|Other {{pictures}} {{may be seen}} {{in houses}} and institutions open to the public: a large and striking painting of the murderess Clytemnestra is in the Guildhall Gallery of the City of London. The Death Sentence was given by the widow of the artist to Wolverhampton Art Gallery. His portrait of the Earl of Onslow (1903), is at Clandon Park, Surrey (National Trust). His full-length portrait of Sir Charles Tertius Mander, first baronet, is at Owlpen Manor, Gloucestershire, with another version {{in the collection of the}} National Trust at Wightwick Manor, and <b>his</b> <b>Lady</b> Godiva is in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.|$|E

25|$|Frederick's {{censorship}} is also {{apparent from}} {{the structure of}} the song: the Sicilians transformed the tornada, the strophe which in troubadour poetry contains a dedication to a famous person with a congedo, where the poet bids goodbye to his reader and asks the song to bear his message to <b>his</b> <b>lady.</b> The re-shaping of the Occitan model also involved the suppression of music. The authors were great readers and translators, but apparently could not play any instrument, so their work was intended for reading, which called for logical unity, posing a question, proposing, and finding a solution in the end.|$|E
25|$|The Black Arrow {{tells the}} story of Richard (Dick) Shelton during the Wars of the Roses: how he becomes a knight, rescues <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> Joanna Sedley, and obtains justice for the murder of his father, Sir Harry Shelton. Outlaws in Tunstall Forest {{organised}} by Ellis Duckworth, whose weapon and calling card is a black arrow, cause Dick to suspect that his guardian Sir Daniel Brackley and his retainers are responsible for his father's murder. Dick's suspicions are enough to turn Sir Daniel against him, so he has no recourse but to escape from Sir Daniel and join the outlaws of the Black Arrow against him. This struggle sweeps him up into the greater conflict surrounding them all.|$|E
25|$|On the French Riviera, Andrew {{lived in}} a small apartment, or hotel rooms, or on board a yacht with <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> friend, Countess Andrée de La Bigne. His {{marriage}} to Alice was effectively over, and after her recovery and release, she returned to Greece. In 1936, his sentence of exile was quashed by emergency laws, which also restored land and annuities to the King. Andrew returned to Greece for a brief visit that May. The following year, his daughter Cécile, son-in-law and two of his grandchildren were killed in an air accident at Ostend; he met Alice {{for the first time in}} six years at the funeral, which was also attended by Hermann Göring.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, he {{appeared}} on Broadway in two Shakespearean tragedies, Othello, playing Iago to James Earl Jones' Moor, and the title role in Macbeth with Glenda Jackson playing <b>his</b> <b>lady.</b> His Iago brought him another Tony nomination. He appeared with Jason Robards in the 1994 revival of Harold Pinter's No Man's Land and had great success in 1997 in Barrymore, which he also toured with after a successful Broadway run. His turn as John Barrymore brought him his second Tony Award (this time as Best Actor in Play) and a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Actor in a Play. He {{was nominated for a}} Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for his 2004 King Lear and for a Tony playing Henry Drummond in the 2007 revival of Inherit the Wind.|$|E
25|$|Malise is {{believed}} to have died in 1271, while in France. His body was brought back to Scotland, and he was buried at Dunblane Cathedral, the religious centre of Strathearn. In 1817, during reconstruction of Dunblane Cathedral, two sarcophagi were discovered with life-size effigies of a warrior and <b>his</b> <b>lady.</b> Since the fourteenth-century chronicler John of Fordun had recorded Dunblane as the burial site of Malise, these were determined to be the tombs of Malise and his countess, though which one is uncertain. It was marked with the date 1271. In addition, Sir Robert Sibbald once mentioned that in the late 17th century, there was a picture in the church which represented the Countess of Strathearn and her children kneeling for a blessing to St. Blane, though its whereabouts today are unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{front of}} the castle was erected about the year 1562 by John Mure of Rowallan and <b>his</b> <b>Lady,</b> Marion Cuninghame, {{of the family of}} Cuninghamhead. This information appears as an inscription on a marriage stone or tablet {{at the top of the}} wall: - Jon.Mvr. M.Cvgm. Spvsis 1562. The family coat of arms lies to the right. The crest of the Mure's was a Moore's head, which is sculptured near the coat of arms. This is no doubt a rebus or jeu-de-mot on the Mure name, however it is suggested that it is a reference to some feat performed in the crusades against the Saracens. The Royal Arms of Scotland, fully blazoned, are carved over the main entrance, together with the shields of the Cumin family, from whom the Mures claim descent. Over the ornamented gateway is a stone with the date 1616 inscribed upon it.|$|E

25|$|Bunthorne, heartbroken by Patience's rejection, {{has chosen}} to raffle himself off among <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> {{followers}} ("Let the merry cymbals sound"), the proceeds going to charity. The Dragoons interrupt the proceedings, and, led by the Duke, attempt to reason with the ladies ("Your maiden hearts, ah, do not steel"), but the ladies are too busy clamouring for tickets to the raffle to listen ("Come walk up"). Just as Bunthorne is handing the bag to the unattractive Jane, ready for the worst, Patience interrupts the proceedings and proposes to unselfishly sacrifice herself by loving the poet ("True Love must single-hearted be"). A delighted Bunthorne accepts immediately, and his followers, their idol lost, return to the Dragoons to whom they are engaged ("I hear the soft note of the echoing voice"). All seems resolved until Grosvenor enters and the ladies, finding him poetic, aesthetic, and far more attractive than Bunthorne, become his partisans instead ("Oh, list while we a love confess"), much {{to the dismay of}} the Dragoons, Patience, Bunthorne and especially Grosvenor himself.|$|E
25|$|Another {{report was}} that Sam Sneed was beaten {{in one of}} the label's {{meetings}} by a group of Death Row affiliates, led by Suge Knight and 2Pac. According to Daz Dillinger, the reason this happened was that Sam Sneed had too many East Coast rappers in <b>his</b> <b>Lady</b> Heroin music video. Disillusioned with the direction of Death Row, artists RBX and The D.O.C. chose to leave, after which Suge Knight exercised tighter control over the rest of the roster. Dogg Food was not produced by Dr. Dre but was mixed by Dr. Dre, a further testament to Dre's dwindling involvement with his own record label. Dr. Dre also grew tired of Knight's violence within the label, although he contributed toward two tracks on 2Pac's All Eyez on Me. The rest of the tracks on the album, however, were mostly produced by Daz Dillinger and Johnny J, despite Dr. Dre being nominally titled as Executive Producer. Shakur's behavior reportedly became erratic as he continued his verbal wars with The Notorious B.I.G., Bad Boy Records, Puff Daddy, Mobb Deep, and Prodigy, including many violent confrontations with many of those rappers at some points. In 1996, due to the infighting, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to found Aftermath; which provoked 2Pac to turn against Dr. Dre.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress {{convened in}} Philadelphia. When war seemed inevitable, Wythe was elected as Virginia's {{delegate}} to replace George Washington, who took {{command of the}} continental forces. George and Elizabeth Wythe moved to Philadelphia by September, and were inoculated against smallpox, as were fellow delegate Francis Lightfoot Lee and <b>his</b> <b>lady</b> and others. By October, Thomas Jefferson had rejoined the Congress to work with his former teacher and the other delegates, although personal tragedy forced him to leave for five months {{in the winter and}} spring. Wythe accepted many assignments relating to military, currency and other matters. He, John Dickinson and John Jay also went to New Jersey that winter and convinced that colony's assembly to maintain a united front. When petitions and other attempts failed to resolve the crisis by the following summer, all while Dunmore's raiders harassed Virginia settlements from its waterways, Wythe moved and then voted in favor of the resolution for independence that Jefferson had drafted upon his return. His fellow Virginia delegates in Philadelphia held Wythe in such esteem, that they left the first space open for Wythe when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, John Adams, who did not like many Virginians, thought so highly of Wythe that he wrote 'Thoughts on Government' concerning establishing constitutions for state governments after the war. Earlier in the session, Wythe also exchanged humorous verses with his friend delegate William Ellery of Rhode Island despite their political differences. Wythe thus signed the Declaration of Independence upon his (and his wife's) return to Philadelphia in September. The signers' names were not made public until the following January, for all knew the declaration was an act of treason, punishable by death should their rebellion fail.|$|E
