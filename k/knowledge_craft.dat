40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} embeddability of object-oriented production systems. We propose five important practical issues concerning embeddability, among which the impedance mismatch problem. We described an extension of Smalltalk to support production rules (the NéOpus system) and discuss its embeddability according to these criteria. I. Introduction The combination of rules and objects to produce integrated hybrid systems was pioneered by the seminal LOOPS system [Bobrow&Stefik 83]. A number of integrated systems were consequently developped which propose a combination of various inference mechanisms and knowledge representation paradigms, such as KEE, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Craft</b> and ART. These systems have traditionally been designed as self-contained inference factories, with few concerns about inter-software communication and reusability.

40|$|Human {{capital and}} social {{networks}} {{are the two}} pillars supporting scientists' and engineers' ability to contribute knowledge. Throughout their careers, scientists seek to enhance both. Human capital endowments include not only formal education and its representation in credentials but the actual scientific and technical <b>knowledge,</b> <b>craft</b> knowledge and technical skills. In science and technology the deploying of human capital {{in the production of}} scientific and technical knowledge is intensely and inevitably social. Science cannot be understood in purely cognitive terms. Social mechanisms undergird not only the production of knowledge but its distribution and use. Scientific and technical journals and conferences are social institutions, as well as intellectual property protections, grants and awards, job placement and career transitions which are governed by social institutions. Social networks are the means by which scientists and engineers traverse social institutions. Indeed, scientists and engineers are as dependent upon social networks as they are upon such tangible scientific tools as electron microscopes, supercomputers and synchrotrons. Research policy and management scholars have long recognized the importance of scientists' and engineers' human capital endowments and their social networks. It is surprising, though, how rarely the two are viewed as part and parcel of a single bundle...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has used a practice-led approach to explore, {{from the perspective}} of an interactive media designer, {{the problem of how to}} understand and transmit the practical <b>knowledge</b> of skilled <b>craft</b> practitioners. It has involved two practical research projects, each exploring the skills of both expert and novice craft practitioners in the fields of traditional bowl turning and clog making. In the first project I experimentally used a systems-orientated approach to explore the tacit knowledge within the practice of an experienced traditional bowl turning practitioner. This involved eliciting <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge</b> from the expert, using a low-fidelity prototype learning resource as a means of representing that knowledge, and observing learners applying the knowledge through using the resource to support their learning. In the second project I undertook a series of video-recordings with a traditional clog maker, during which I developed a less intrusive elicitation technique based on increasingly focussed observation and interviewing. This overcame the defensiveness encountered with the first practitioner with whom I used an elicitation approach based on his descriptions of his practice. In the light of the outcomes from the practical work, I reconsidered the current context for <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge</b> and developed a framework to understand craft learning. Drawing on three important theorists: Michael Polanyi and his theory of tacit knowledge, John Dewey and his theory of experiential learning, and Donald Schon and his theory of reflection, I reassessed the learning I had previously observed and proposed a new model of how <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge</b> is learned. I propose that the guidance offered by the expert can be seen as a series of bridges that provide the novice with a means of accessing the personal knowledge of the expert. These bridges are not necessarily the way to undertake a task, but a way that the expert feels to be helpful at that time. As a novice increasingly learns from the feedback from their own actions, they can progress their skill by moving through different modes of reflection. This research makes three specific contributions to knowledge. In the field of multimedia design it establishes a methodology for transmitting <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge,</b> refining principles previously published through my MA research, and it establishes techniques for eliciting <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge</b> which are interwoven with the process of developing the transmission resource. In the field of learning and pedagogy it establishes a framework for understanding craft skills learning drawing on recognised theory and validated through appraisal of the practical work undertaken. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The early Babylonians and Egyptians {{developed}} much technical <b>knowledge,</b> <b>crafts,</b> {{and mathematics}} used in practical tasks of divination, {{as well as}} a knowledge of medicine, and made lists of various kinds. While the Babylonians in particular had engaged in the earliest forms of an empirical mathematical science, with their early attempts at mathematically describing natural phenomena, they generally lacked underlying rational theories of nature. It was the ancient Greeks who engaged in the earliest forms of what is today recognized as a rational theoretical science, with the move towards a more rational understanding of nature which began at least since the Archaic Period (650 - 480 BCE) with the Presocratic school. Thales was the first to use natural explanations, proclaiming that every event had a natural cause, even though he is known for saying [...] "all things are full of gods" [...] and sacrificed an ox when he discovered his theorem. [...] Leucippus, went on to develop the theory of atomism - the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms.

40|$|Qualitative inquiry {{provides}} a means of apprehending the personal and contextual experiences of health and health care {{as well as the}} complex social, cultural and political issues that influence services and professional practice. Despite its usefulness in informing clinical practice, it is undervalued and under-utilised in contemporary nursing research. A number of organisational, ideological and educational reasons exist for this situation. This paper addresses educational issues, specifically teaching practice. We discuss <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge,</b> an important but often obscured practice, and its use in qualitative research education, drawing on the findings of a project that investigated a group of nursing academics' experiences and perceptions about teaching qualitative research. We argue that <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge</b> offers teachers a means to inspire and engage clinician students to learn not only the content and research skills required to do good qualitative research but {{to learn more about the}} standpoint and sensibilities of being qualitative researchers. In this way <b>craft</b> <b>knowledge</b> does two things. First it helps to move beyond the content versus process polemic that often dominates educational debate.

Additionally, direct observations of professional practices and researcher reflections were factored into the analyses.

Also it was determined that Lesson Study would be a desirable and sustainable means for meaningful professional development, but there was the caveat of needing to convince school administrators of its value when the cost factor was recognized.
