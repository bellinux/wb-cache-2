The monotonously tapered shape of fabricated SAS gives continuous and smooth increase of refractive index along the incident light path, resulting in very low reflectance < 5.5 % for 350 – 1, 800 nm range of wavelength.

50|$|<b>E-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> is not {{suitable}} for high-volume manufacturing because of its limited throughput. The smaller field of electron beam writing makes for very slow pattern generation compared with photolithography (the current standard) because more exposure fields must be scanned to form the final pattern area (≤mm2 for electron beam vs. ≥40 mm2 for an optical mask projection scanner). The stage moves in between field scans. The electron beam field is small enough that a rastering or serpentine stage motion is needed to pattern a 26 mm X 33 mm area for example, whereas in a photolithography scanner only a one-dimensional motion of a 26 mm X 2 mm slit field would be required.|$|E
50|$|The {{resolution}} and {{sensitivity of the}} device are both proportional {{to the size of}} the SQUID. A smaller device will have greater resolution but less sensitivity. The change in voltage induced is proportional to the inductance of the device, and limitations in the control of the bias magnetic field as well as electronics issues prevent a perfectly constant voltage from being maintained at all times. However, in practice, the sensitivity in most scanning SQUID microscopes is sufficient for almost any SQUID size for many applications, and therefore the tendency is to make the SQUID as small as possible to enhance resolution. Via <b>e-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> techniques it is possible to fabricate devices with total area of 1 - 10 μm2, although devices in the tens to hundreds of square micrometres are more common.|$|E
5000|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} directed at DPN is the patterning speed. The {{reason for this}} {{has more to do}} with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses. For example, the soft lithography method, microcontact printing (μCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to microcontact printing. The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to μCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application. μCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as photolithography can pattern over a large area in a single exposure. Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique. DPN is a maskless direct write technique that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate. No one would try to apply microcontact printing to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern. Even if they did, microcontact printing would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry. [...] The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and <b>e-beam</b> <b>lithography.</b> No one would try to use e-beam to solve a photolithography problem and then claim e-beam to be [...] "too slow". Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, <b>e-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> is slow and yet, e-beam instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world. The reason for this is because e-beam has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by microcontact printing.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{ablative}} {{nature of}} the patterning process, no development step (as in: selective removal of either the exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist as for <b>e-beam</b> and optical <b>lithography)</b> is needed, neither are optical proximity corrections.

By careful preparation, microphase-separated thin films of immiscible block copolymers can act as nanomasks for a variety of applications in electronic, optoelectronic and storage media fields. One such application is patterned media. With ever increasing areal densities, {{there is a limit to}} which the grain size within a bit can be decreased, for a conventional thin film media. Beyond a certain limit, which is dictated by the superparamagnetic effect, these grains will spontaneously reverse, resulting in undesired data loss. Patterned media has been proposed as an alternative to surpass this thermal instability criterion. In patterned media, lithographically defined nano-scale magnetic elements form single bits onto which the data is stored. Due to its unique structure in which each magnetic dots act as a single magnetic domain it can postpone the arrival of superparamagnetic effect beyond densities much higher than 10 Terabits/inch². However, very high resolutions and strict positioning control is required for its fabrication so as to attain a marketable 1 Tb/inch² advantage. (cont.) Block Copolymer self assembly holds great promise in fabrication of such devices requiring periodic, high resolution pattern generation. If issues such as long range order, pattern uniformity and placement accuracy of magnetic dots can be effectively resolved, block copolymer self assembly enabled lithography can quickly become the main stay of the multimillion dollar hard disk industry. by Anay Chaube.
