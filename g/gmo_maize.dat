All the extraction methods tested performed well {{for the majority of}} maize foods and feed products analysed. However, the highest DNA content was achieved by the Wizard, Genespin or the CTAB method, all of which produced optimal DNA yield and purity for different maize food and feed products. The samples were then screened for the presence of GM elements, along with certified reference materials. Of the food and feed samples, 8 % tested positive for the presence of one GM element (NOS terminator), of which half (4 % of the total) also contained a second element (the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35 S promoter).

In order to allow detection of their presence in an integrated screening approach, a set of SYBRGreen real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods has been developed which can be used under the same assay conditions and at similar efficiency for each of the abovementioned crops. Each qPCR method is shown to meet the performance criteria (i. e. specificity, limit of detection and PCR efficiency) set by the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL). When combined with the equivalent qPCR methods targeting GMO elements, these crop-specific SYBRGreen qPCR methods can aid the development of an efficient tool for determining GMO presence in food and/or feed products.

40|$|Although {{there is}} a strong {{controversy}} regarding the introduction and commercialisation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Europe, GM maize has been sown in Spain since 1998. Stakeholders' positions on the role that GMOs play in trends of the state of agriculture and environment in Catalonia are analysed. The application of the Driving forces -Pressures - State - Impact - Responses (DPSIR) framework in this case study highlights its potential for organising and structuring information. However, the model can be ambiguous when used as an analytical tool in value-laden complex situations. Thus, GM agriculture is sometimes seen as a pressure on the agro-environment and sometimes as a modernising response to an economic and environmental crisis. A redefinition of the DPSIR categories is proposed, aiming to reflect on these situations by better acknowledging different legitimate perspectives and narratives. This is done, on the one hand, by allowing alternative descriptions of causal chains and, on the other hand, by taking into consideration social and political aspects besides the relationship between economics and environmental spheres.

He remained in the post until September 2003, when he was appointed Vice President of SENASA, the food safety regulatory office. The revival of the Agriculture Ministry as a cabinet-level office in 2009, and the appointment of Buenos Aires Province Legislator Julián Domínguez to the post, was followed by Casamiquela's appointment as President of the INTA by Minister Domínguez in October of that year. Casamiquela oversaw the continued revitalization of INTA, which grew from 3,500 employees in 2003 to 7,200 by 2010, while focusing its efforts on the promotion of local agriculture and small farmers (which employ 54% of all agricultural workers in Argentina). INTA's Prohuerta program, launched in 2005, provided assistance to 630,000 market gardens and 148,000 small farms by 2013, as well as 19,000 rural families in Haiti. Other highlights during his tenure include an instructional program for intensive agriculture methods initiated in South Africa, and the approval for import by China of two of INTA's GMO soy and one <b>GMO</b> <b>maize</b> varieties.|$|E

40|$|Production and {{processing}} {{of genetically modified}} organisms (GMO) {{in line with the}} European food safety and labelling regulations lead to an elevated risk of unintentional GMO contamination in food producing {{and processing}} companies. For these companies GMO contamination can lead to extensive losses such as decreased product value, recall expenses or decreased brand equity. The question that occurs in many food producing and processing companies is how to manage the risk of GMO contamination most effectively. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show how food companies manage the risk of GMO contamination. Because of the complexity of the German food sector the analysis focuses on one supply chain namely: the production, processing and trading of maize and maize products. Within this supply chain an assessment of potential losses and safety measures was conducted in a two-step analysis. At first personal interviews with executives or quality managers of companies along the whole supply chain were carried out. Then the results of these interviews were analyzed and used to create the framework for a second session of formalized online interviews within companies of the maize chain. The results of the survey in maize producing, processing and trading, companies show the risk of potential losses that can occur in case of GMO contamination. Additionally the results show the safety measures that can effectively reduce the risk of <b>GMO</b> contamination. <b>Maize</b> Chain, Genetically modified Organism, Risk Management, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

40|$|We {{summarize}} the major points of international debate on health risk studies {{for the main}} commercialized edible GMOs. These <b>GMOs</b> are soy, <b>maize</b> and oilseed rape designed to contain new pesticide residues since they have been modified to be herbicide-tolerant (mostly to Roundup) or to produce mutated Bt toxins. The debated alimentary chronic risks may come from unpredictable insertional mutagenesis effects, metabolic effects, or from the new pesticide residues. The most detailed regulatory tests on the GMOs are three-month long feeding trials of laboratory rats, which are biochemically assessed. The tests are not compulsory, and are not independently conducted. The test data and the corresponding results are kept in secret by the companies. Our previous analyses of regulatory raw data at these levels, taking the representative examples of three GM maize NK 603, MON 810, and MON 863 led us to conclude that hepatorenal toxicities were possible, and that longer testing was necessary.

40|$|Thesis M. Com. (Development Theory and Policy) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} competitiveness {{and performance of}} the Zimbabwean poultry industry {{in the context of}} trade liberalization, given that both poultry output and the main inputs (animal feed and breeding stock) are tradable. Poultry is an important product as the main source of protein for consumers. It also has strong links to agriculture through the production of animal feed. Despite the rise in chicken demand over the years as a cheap source of protein, the poultry industry in Zimbabwe still faces a number of challenges which the government claims include stiff competition from cheap imports, rising input costs of maize and soya meal and illegal imports being sold at sub-economic prices. This study evaluates these factors and the impact of changing trade protection. The methodology used in this study is both qualitative and quantitative. An analysis is done on trade tariffs particularly focusing on their effect to the poultry industry. Disaggregated trade and tariff data was used to analyze the evolution of tariff regime in the industry and to calculate the effective rate of protection of the poultry sector. A value chain approach was used to understand the linkages and interests that exist in this industry. The poultry industry has been affected by imports starting 2007 and has not been exporting since then as the industry struggled to compete on the domestic market. The study showed that the effective rate of protection calculation is complicated by the different trade regimes which currently exist. If the main international competition is from South Africa then the existence of the bi-lateral agreement between Zimbabwe and South Africa means that the poultry sector has not been protected. The study has shown that the breeding subsector is characterized by a duopoly since there are only two breeding firms in Zimbabwe and the comparison carried out revealed that Zimbabwean prices of day old chicks are above those of comparable countries in the region such as South Africa. The study shows that prices for <b>GMO</b> <b>maize</b> used in South Africa are substantially cheaper than Zimbabwean prices, thereby making Zimbabwean producers uncompetitive. The study recommends policies that attract investment in the breeding sub-sector of the value chain to increase competition, a review of <b>GMO</b> <b>maize</b> policy and reducing tariffs of imported raw materials used in the poultry industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} welfare {{implications of}} some countries using new genetically modified varieties in crop production {{will depend on}} which countries choose to adopt them and on whether others (notably Western Europe) ban their importation. They also depend on existing (non-GMO-specific) agricultural policies in affected markets. This paper uses a well-received empirical economywide model {{of the global economy}} (GTAP) to quantify the effects of selected countries enjoying an assumed degree of productivity growth from adopting <b>GMO</b> <b>maize</b> and soybean. It does so first by leaving existing distortionary policies in place and then assuming agricultural policies in Western Europe are completely liberalised. In both cases we investigate the effects of Western Europe refraining from using GMO technology in its own farm production but without versus with a ban on imports of GM products. The results suggest that (a) such an import ban would have a large adverse effect on economic welfare, particularly in Western Europe itself, and (b) while estimated global economic welfare benefits from the new biotechnology are not greatly reduced by Europe’s traditional price-distorting policies, the reductions in technology gains are concentrated in non-European countries...|$|E
30|$|Measures of co-existence as {{laid down}} by German law (Sections 16 a and 36 a Act GenTG) and good {{practice}} rules (c.f. [11]) include the register on GMO release (Section 16 a GenTG), duties of GMO farmers to inform neighbours of planned GMO release (Cf. Sections 16 b (5), 18 (2) and 21 GenTG - duty to inform the authorities and participation of the public; Section 35 GenTG - duty to inform the injured party, as well as Section 3 GenTPfEV(Regulation on the Production of Genetically Modified Crops) - duty to inform the neighbour prior to the planting of GMO), distance rules for planting like GMO and non-GMO crops (Annex to GenTPfEV, specific rules for plants), and liability for the contamination of neighbouring crops (Section 36 a GenTG). All of these measures aim at solving conflicts between the individual landowners. In the nationwide register on GMO releases, information is displayed about the GMO (its name and characteristics), the property on which it will be released, {{the period in which}} it shall be cultivated and if applicable the name of the person farming the plot of land. The GMO farmer has to register the required information prior to cultivation (Section 16 a (2) and (3) GenTG). The register {{is open to the public}} as far as the characteristics and the plot of land on which the GMO will be cultivated are concerned (Section 16 a (1) sentence 3, in conjunction with (4) GenTG). Additional prior information duties rest upon the GMO farmer as he is obliged to inform his neighbour about the cultivation of GMOs at least 3 months prior to the cultivation (Section 3 (1) GenTPflEV). In case the GMO farmer does not get any response from the neighbour within 1 month after receipt, he can assume that the neighbour does not cultivate plants of the same kind as the GMO or able to cross out with it (Section 3 (2) GenTPflEV). If such plants are cultivated on neighbouring fields, the GMO farmer is obliged to meet the minimum distance requirements set out in the annex to the GenTPflEV (Section 4 GenTPflEV). Until now, only distance rules for <b>GMO</b> <b>maize</b> have been laid down. One hundred and fifty meters are required for the distance between GMO and conventional maize and 300 m for GMO and organic maize. In case the landowner complies with these regulations and the crops of the neighbour are nevertheless contaminated, although the crop was be labelled as GMO based or cannot be labelled as GMO free, the GMO farmer is liable for the damage arising out of this contamination (Section 906 Civil Law Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch - BGB) together with Section 36 a GenTG). The damage is calculated according to the impairment of saleability of the product as GMO free. In case the landowner complies with these regulations but the crops of the neighbour are nevertheless contaminated, the GMO farmer is liable for the damage arising out of the contamination, i.e. damage which the neighbour has to face because he must label his crops as GMO based or cannot label them GMO free.|$|E
40|$|In this study, two diverse {{scientific}} {{areas of}} research, namely, biological-chemical and public administration, were drawn upon {{to find an}} answer for improved risk governance of genetically modified organisms (GMO/GM) and pesticides. The need for such a study appeared from the constraints experienced with regulatory approval of GMO crops in South Africa. The knowledge gained from research on risk governance of GMOs could also be applied to pesticides. Protracted procedures causing delays in approval and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements of GMOs resulted in negative implications for research, development and commercialisation. Approval of several South African co-developed GMOs has been delayed or rejected that resulted in withdrawal or reducing of research activities, apart from appeals against decisions. The objective {{of the study was}} to identify some of the reasons for delays as experienced in risk assessments and to propose remedial actions, including the critical interface between role players in risk governance. The approach taken in this research was to obtain, by means of a questionnaire, a broad view of risk governances of GMOs as measured with criteria of good governance experienced by scientists of biotechnology and related disciplines. This was followed by another questionnaire with focus on one specific area that caused delays for GMO permit applicants. The investigation included analysis of South African legislation, guidelines and interviews. The research on risk assessment narrowed down to the two areas, illustrated by South African applicable case studies, namely, food risk/safety assessment of GMO cassava and environmental risk assessment of GMO sorghum. Approaches to improve assessments are being recommended. Uncertainty in risk assessment is an important reality because of humankind‘s limited knowledge of nature. Uncertainty is further addressed by precautious management, described as the precautionary principle is a norm legislated by the South African government in line with international agreements (the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety). The terminology, precautionary approach and principle are used interchangeably in literature. The application of the precautionary principle in South African legislation and the difficulty that could be experienced in decision making are illustrated in the case study on ‗possible unintended changes in endogenous allergens‘ in <b>GMO</b> <b>maize.</b> The research showed the importance of timely risk communication between risk assessors, risk managers (decision makers) and stakeholders in advance of the commencement of risk assessment. The importance of timely consideration of socio-economic impact of GMOs and pesticides is touched on. Risk governance structures, for both GMOs and pesticides are proposed, based on the most democratic and transparent governance models taking into consideration the European initiatives for improved risk governance. This included an interface for interaction among role players, namely, risk assessors, risk managers, scientists and stakeholders. The up-front role of an array of scientists, as the most trustworthy communicators in contentious scientific issues, is of specific importance because of the fast developing and very broad field of genetic modification of many crops. South Africa‘s national research institutes should play a much bigger role as scientific advisors in scientific risk policy making and framing for risk assessments. It is of great importance that risk assessments are focused on risks and not on the gathering of bucketsful of data; therefore, training in approaches to assessment of risk should be a priority. To achieve improvement on risk governance, the importance of policy development and the roles of all participants should be clear. Proposals for future research cover the many aspects that comprise trust in governance and the increased awareness of consumers and stakeholders of environmental risks and food safety. This study also paves a way for research on governance of phytopesticides and phytomedicines because of growing interest in these rich sources of new information that could be of great benefit to mankind.
