5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of <b>his</b> <b>birth</b> and several versions of his death.

Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E

5|$|George Pickingill {{was the son}} of Charles Pickingill, a {{labourer}} and blacksmith, and Susannah Cudner, a {{woman who}} also went by the name of Hannah Cudmore; the couple had married on 17 September 1813. Although he had no known birth record, according to parish records, George Pickingill was baptised on 26 May 1816 at the church in Hockley. The year of Pickingill's birth is however in question, as he made differing claims in different censuses; in the 1851 census, he claimed to be 26, meaning that <b>his</b> <b>birth</b> would have occurred circa 1825, while in the 1861 census, he claimed to be 46, which would have placed <b>his</b> <b>birth</b> c.1815. By the time of the 1901 census, he was claiming to be 95, moving <b>his</b> <b>birth</b> to c.1806; {{it has been suggested that}} he made himself appear older to ease the process of collecting parish assistance from the church. Throughout his life, Pickingill would also use a variety of different spellings of his surname on official records, including Pickengill, Pickingale, Pickengal, Pettingale, Pitengale, and Pittengale.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not certain}} whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1755 or 1757. Most {{historical}} evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports {{the idea that he}} was born in 1757, including Hamilton's own writings. Hamilton listed <b>his</b> <b>birth</b> year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies, and celebrated his birthday on January 11. In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures. Historians accepted 1757 as <b>his</b> <b>birth</b> year until about 1930, when additional documentation of his early life in the Caribbean was published, initially in Danish. A probate paper from St. Croix in 1768, drafted after the death of Hamilton's mother, listed him as 13 years old, which has caused some historians since the 1930s to favor a birth year of 1755.|$|E
