This process is time-consuming. There are disadvantages while working with the images like large storage, incurs more time in opening and closing and corrections are not allowed. Hence there {{is the need to}} automate the process. In this paper, the authors propose three different approaches for extracting metabolite values from MRS graph. The extracted values are stored <b>in</b> <b>data</b> <b>table</b> which requires less storage than a graph stored as an image format. The paper highlights the strengths of each method and proposes suitable situations where these methods can be most effective...|$|E

In this regard, first we use data from 1971 - 72 to 2007 - 08 to estimate a time trend for beef, mutton, poultry meat and total meat production. This time trend is estimated by employing an exponential {{function of the}} form Yf = ce bt where Yf is for meat production and t depicts the year. The estimated parameters are highly statistically significant, while the overall explanatory power of the model is very high since R 2 = 0. 99. These results indicate that annual growth rate of meat production from 1971 - 72 to 2007 - 08 is 5 % over per annum. In 2020 the projected annual growth of total production o...|$|E

Finally, we present two methods of construction from any dynamic information system DS with its underlying system S, and transition system TS describing the behaviour of DS, a concurrent model {{in the form of an}} elementary net system N [Thiagarajan, 1987] with the following property: a given transition system TS is isomorphic to the transition system associated with the constructed net system N.

40|$|The pattern {{extraction}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} problem in data mining. Usually, patterns are defined by a conjunction of simple descriptors of the form (variable = value). In this paper we consider a more general form of descriptors, namely (variable 2 valueset), where valueset is a subset of the variable domain. We present methods for generalized pattern extraction. We also investigate the problem of data table covering by a semi-optimal set of patterns. The proposed methods return more universal features satisfied by a large number of objects <b>in</b> <b>data</b> <b>table</b> (or in a given subset of objects).

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} a knowledge representation formalism {{in the context}} of fuzzy <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> A possibilistic decision logic incorporating linguistic terms is proposed for representing and reasoning about knowledge <b>in</b> fuzzy <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> Two applications based on the logic are described. The first is the extraction of fuzzy rules from general fuzzy <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>In</b> this application, the knowledge in the tables may be made explicit by the formulas of the logic or used implicitly in decision-making. The second is for the fuzzy quantization problem of precise <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> It {{can be viewed as a}} special case of the first, however, due to some special properties of the problem, a polynomial time rule extraction process can be obtained.

For instance, one of the practices works with transformers connections, students have to connect those transformers in D–Y, so in theory, between the first transformer and the second one have a 30 degrees of phase, {{with the help of}} Labview, this program can analyze and see how those phases are drawing in a screen, showing their magnitude and position. Another practice will work with motors, we have to know some parameters of a synchronous machine specifically the V curve without load, meanwhile they are taking the signal which is saving <b>in</b> <b>data</b> <b>table</b> at the same time is drawing the curve in a screen and besides they can see the triangle of power and depends on what kind of load is working, one can see if the reactive load is positive or negative which means is inductive or capacitive respectively.

40|$|We present Pavelka-style {{fuzzy logic}} for {{reasoning}} about attribute implications, i. e. formulas A ⇒ B known also as association rules and functional dependencies. Fuzzy attribute implications allow for two different interpreta-tions, namely, <b>in</b> <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> with graded (fuzzy) attributes and <b>in</b> <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> over domains with similarity relations. In the first interpretation, A ⇒ B reads “each object hav-ing all attributes from A has also all attributes from B”.

The axioms of our logic {{are inspired by}} well-known Armstrong axioms but the logic allows us to infer partially true formulas from partially true formulas.
