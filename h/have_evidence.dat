5|$|Five {{medications}} <b>have</b> <b>evidence</b> {{for long-term}} use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all <b>have</b> <b>evidence</b> (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
30|$|An {{electronic}} {{search was}} performed. Domestic studies were found using the keywords “zirconia abutments” and “zirconium abutment” in KMbase, KoreaMed, and the National Assembly Library, {{and international studies}} were found using the same keywords in PubMed. All identified studies were divided by evidence level {{from the viewpoint of}} the research type utilizing the evidence-based review manual. A total of 102 domestic studies (with Korean language) were found, and 9 of these studies were selected. In these nine studies, 3 <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> level 3 and 6 <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> level 4. A total of 97 international studies (with English language) were found, and 19 were selected. Among these 19 studies, 5 <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> level 2 and 7 <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> level 3, whereas the remainder <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> level 4. According to the studies, zirconium abutments are mechanically, biologically, and esthetically stable, but the evidence level of these studies is low, and the follow-up duration is no longer than 5  years.|$|R

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} violence and warfare, perhaps involving cannibalism, impelled the evacuations. Hints of such include dismembered bodies—dating from Chacoan times—found at two sites within the central canyon. Yet Chacoan complexes showed {{little evidence of}} being defended or defensively sited high on cliff faces or atop mesas. Only several minor sites at Chaco <b>have</b> <b>evidence</b> of the large-scale burning that would suggest enemy raids. Archaeological and cultural evidence leads scientists to believe people from this region migrated south, east, and west into the valleys and drainages of the Little Colorado River, the Rio Puerco, and the Rio Grande. Anthropologist Joseph Tainter deals at length with the structure and decline of Chaco civilization in his 1988 study The Collapse of Complex Societies.|$|E
5|$|Chad Harris-Crane first {{appears in}} the episode airing on September 23, 1999, in which, after {{discovering}} he was adopted, he moves from Los Angeles to Harmony to find his real parents. Chad married Latoya Harris while he {{was working as a}} music producer in Los Angeles. Latoya refused to accompany Chad to Harmony as {{she did not want to}} leave her friends and family. While in Harmony, Chad encounters two people with information on his past - Orville Perkins and Crystal Harris. Orville, a senile old man, erroneously believes Chad is Eve's long-lost son with Crane Industries CEO Julian Crane and claims to <b>have</b> <b>evidence</b> proving this connection. In a desperate attempt to keep her past hidden, Eve burns down Orville's house and any evidence inside and places him in a retirement home. Chad later meets jazz singer Crystal Harris, who was Eve's confidante during her relationship with Julian and subsequent pregnancy. Crystal also offers information about Chad's birth and parents, but is killed by a French drug cartel's assassin Antoine, who mistakes her for socialite Sheridan Crane, before she can deliver it to him.|$|E
5|$|Groups of {{settlers}} {{began building}} {{the first known}} permanent houses on what is now Scottish soil around 9500 years ago, and the first villages around 6000 years ago. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the}} oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this period and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age we <b>have</b> <b>evidence</b> of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial island, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters. The peoples of early Iron Age Scotland, particularly in the north and west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 BC to AD 300 with the most imposing structures having been created circa 200–100 BC. In the south and east larger earthwork hill forts survive. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure. Most are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} and clinical consequences of human T-cell lymphotropic viruses types I and II (HTLV-I/II) infection in human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) infected persons are areas of continuing interest. This article reports the preliminary {{findings of the}} hematological indices in 454 patients infected with HIV- 1 and HTLV-I/HTLV-II. Based on serology, 46. 2 % of the patients <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> of HIV- 1 infection only, 4. 6 % <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> of HTLV-I/II only, 14. 3 % <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> of both HIV- 1 and HTLV-I/II, and 34. 8 % <b>had</b> <b>evidence</b> of neither HIV- 1 or HTLV-I/II. The patient group with both HTLV-I/II and HIV- 1 infection had lower total white blood cell, platelet, and serum hematocrits than patients with either HIV- 1 or HTLV-I/II infection. While these differences were insignificant, they do not suggest any HTLV-I/II-induced protective effect against HIV- 1 related hematological consequences...|$|R

25|$|Most {{people become}} {{infected}} with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. In the United States, {{about half of}} all five-year-old children and about 90 percent of adults <b>have</b> <b>evidence</b> of previous infection. Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood. In the United States and other developed countries, many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence, it causes infectious mononucleosis 35 to 50 percent of the time.|$|E

A single helmet found at Intercisa in Hungary, where a hoard of 15-20 helmets was unearthed, has a tall, integral, iron crest attached to the ridge. A similar helmet found at Augst has three slots in its ridge for the attachment of a separate crest. There have also been finds of unattached crest pieces, or ones attached to only the ridge of the helmet.|$|E
