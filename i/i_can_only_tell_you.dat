5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too {{sure that it is}} right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E
500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2006, Rae {{applied for}} {{membership}} in the Liberal Party of Canada. His candidacy for the federal party leadership was supported by Greg Sorbara and George Smitherman, former Chrétien aides Eddie Goldenberg and Rae's brother John, as well as former top Martin advisor John Webster and others associated with the Martin camp. He announced his candidacy on April 24, 2006. At his campaign launch he responded to his critics by saying, [...] "I made mistakes before I was in politics, I made mistakes when I was in politics, I made mistakes as premier... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I have learned from those mistakes and I am the wiser for them." [...] Rae's predecessor as premier, David Peterson who was supporting Michael Ignatieff, criticized Rae's entry into the race due to his record as NDP provincial premier, though insisting that he did not hold a personal grudge against Rae.|$|E

6000|$|... "You talk of my 'pretending' to like you; but I can't {{pretend to}} hate you. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> her <b>I</b> think very highly of you; {{and how will}} that console her for losing you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Methinks, {{and please}} your highness," [...] replied Sir Kenneth, [...] "that were best asked {{of those who}} sent me, and who can render the reasons of mine errand; whereas <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> its outward form and purport." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not he!--t'e creatur' hast not'ing to do wit' squaws. As {{for any one}} else's singing Intian, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I never {{heart of}} such a person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My child, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the truth. I {{know it is}} hard to bear. I {{would save}} you if I could; but it is better that you should know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{did think}} {{that after all}} that has passed, and when I am trying to be kind to you, you would have made {{yourself}} more pleasant to me. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> your uncle that you say you won't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What am I to say? In very truth I {{do believe}} that he is mad. If I write to him, should I defend myself or accuse myself? A dozen times I have striven to write such a letter,--not that I might send it, but that I might find what I could say should I ever wish to send it. And it is impossible. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> him how unjust he has been, how cruel, how mad, how wicked!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Nivedita {{returned}} to Kolkata in mid-June as works in her school had already started. Swami Vivekananda died at Belur Math on 4 July 1902. He wrote his last letter to Christine on 21 June (1902). In {{the second week}} of July, Christine received Nivedita's letter—Tomorrow you will receive this news that will desolate your life. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> Dear, that if my presence could keep you there, you were never absent from his side on Saturday ... Death came to him so beautifully on Friday night! A half hour's sleep after meditation, and he was gone! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think {{half a dozen}} things," [...] I said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> one now. She's an enchantress. You shall {{hear the}} rest when we have left the church." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tony {{endeavored}} to slip his arm about her. “I know I’m a bad‐tempered beast now and then. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that you are}} ever so much too good for me again.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What about her?' A {{confused}} look {{came over}} Gerald. 'Well,' he added, 'I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{she gave me}} a hit over the face last time I saw her.' ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{the others}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> ye what <b>I</b> know. Some {{slipped out of}} my ken entirely. Of others I have heard vague and {{incomplete}} accounts. The leaders of the insurrection got off much more lightly than their followers, for {{they found that the}} passion of greed was even stronger than the passion of cruelty. Grey, Buyse, Wade, and others bought themselves free at the price of all their possessions. Ferguson escaped. Monmouth was executed on Tower Hill, and showed in his last moments some faint traces of that spirit which spurted up now and again from his feeble nature, like the momentary flash of an expiring fire.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{tell the}} tale of all this way, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> of what <b>I</b> saw myself. We were of the party under the {{leadership}} of Carl Celliers, afterwards an elder of the church at Kronnstadt. Celliers went on a commission to Zoutpansberg to spy out the land, and it was while he was away that so many families were cut off by Moselikatse, the remainder of them, with such of their women and children as were left alive, retreating to our laager. Then Celliers returned from his commission, and we retired to a place called Vechtkop, near the Rhenoster River; altogether we numbered not more than fifty or sixty souls, including women and children.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course you}} do, little man. A few fine epithets take your fancy {{far more than}} a little common sense and common humility; but in that you are no worse than some of your elders. So now for the {{exquisite}} shapes and glorious colours. I have never seen them; though I trust to see them ere I die. So what they are like <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> from what <b>I</b> have learnt from Mr. Darwin, and Mr. Wallace, and Mr. Jukes, and Mr. Gosse, and last, but not least, from one whose soul was as beautiful as his face, Lucas Barrett,--too soon lost to science,--who was drowned in exploring such a coral-reef as this stone was once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is not}} for me to say one way or the other. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that {{he could}} not help himself. But here's the beak a- comin' for us again." ...|$|E
60|$|That I cannot say. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that at nine-fifteen on Friday morning bail was tendered, and, after inquiries, {{accepted}} {{in the person of}} Julius Addison Tupp, of the Sunnybrook Steam Laundry, Twickenham.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, {{she carries}} four. As to the second, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that he is}} one of the finest fellows in the service, and you will {{understand}} that when I say that I am the second lieutenant.” ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this most}} welcome word, the young man’s heart exulted; {{and in the}} hope, pride, and {{self-esteem}} that kindled with {{the very thought of}} service, he forgot to dwell upon the lady’s jest. ‘Can you ask?’ he cried. ‘What is there that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do? <b>Only</b> <b>tell</b> me that.’ ...|$|R
60|$|The whole {{interview}} {{between us}} had hardly {{lasted more than}} half an hour--she had not breathed a word, in my presence, to explain the mystery of her evident distress and dismay at the prospect of her marriage, and yet she had contrived to win me over to her side of the question, I neither knew how nor why. I had entered the room, feeling that Sir Percival Glyde had fair reason to complain of the manner in which she was treating him. I left it, secretly hoping that matters might end in her taking him at his word and claiming her release. A man of my age and experience ought to have known better than to vacillate in this unreasonable manner. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make no excuse for myself; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> the truth, and say--so it was.|$|R
60|$|These, however, are but passing {{incidents}} {{in a life}} filled with danger and excitement. They would have remained unrecorded and unrevealed, {{like the rest of}} my revelations, were it not that certain recent events have to some extent removed the seal of secrecy from my lips. The death of a certain royal sovereign makes it possible for me to divulge things hitherto undivulgeable. Even now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> a part, a small part, of the terrific things that I know. When more sovereigns die <b>I</b> <b>can</b> divulge more. <b>I</b> hope to keep on divulging at intervals for years. But I am compelled to be cautious. My relations with the Wilhelmstrasse, with Downing Street and the Quai d'Orsay, are so intimate, and my footing with the Yildiz Kiosk and the Waldorf-Astoria and Childs' Restaurants are so delicate, that a single faux pas might prove to be a false step.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will do what}} I can," [...] {{said the}} old man, slowly, as his {{visitors}} seated themselves, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I see. If I do not see all, or see clearly, it cannot be helped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be good to me, {{and pass}} it over if I am wrong," [...] Emily said: [...] "I can't dispute with you; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I feel. You have always been so kind to me--may I count on your {{kindness}} still?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{going into}} the Church under the circumstances? That depends on your conscience, Fred--how far you have counted the cost, and seen what your {{position}} will require of you. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about myself, that I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence." ...|$|E
60|$|There is one puzzling {{thing about}} these prehistoric {{memories}} of mine. It is the vagueness {{of the time}} element. I lo not always know the order of events;--or <b>can</b> <b>I</b> tell, between some events, whether one, two, or {{four or five years}} have elapsed. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> roughly <b>tell</b> the passage of time by judging the changes in the appearance and pursuits of my fellows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrades," [...] he began, {{as sharp}} as a pistol-shot, [...] "our meeting tonight is important, though it need not be long. This branch has always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central European Council. We have elected many and splendid Thursdays. We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who {{occupied}} the post until last week. As you know, his services to the cause were considerable. He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which, under happier circumstances, ought to have killed everybody on the pier. As you also know, his death was as self-denying as his life, for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water {{as a substitute for}} milk, which beverage he regarded as barbaric, and as involving cruelty to the cow. Cruelty, or anything approaching to cruelty, revolted him always. But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met, but for a harder task. It is difficult properly to praise his qualities, but it is more difficult to replace them. Upon you, comrades, it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday. If any comrade suggests a name I will put it to the vote. If no comrade suggests a name, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> myself that that dear dynamiter, who is gone from us, has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I say," [...] said Bastin, [...] "that my most earnest {{desire is}} to be clear of the whole thing, which wearies and perplexes me more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>Only</b> <b>I</b> {{am not going to}} run away, unless you think it {{desirable}} to do so too, Lady Yva. I want you to understand that I am not in the least afraid of the Lord Oro, and do not for one moment believe that he will be allowed to bring about disaster to the world, as I understand is his wicked object. Therefore on the whole I am indifferent and quite prepared to accept any decision at which the rest of you may arrive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was a {{woman who}} brought it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I know. He has been talking like a madman ever since. It made my blood run cold to hear him. There's someone whom he swears he will murder. I shall be very glad to see the last of him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Pa, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I {{mean nothing}} else. Talk {{to me of}} love!' said Bella, contemptuously: though her face and figure {{certainly}} rendered the subject no incongruous one. 'Talk to me of fiery dragons! But talk to me of poverty and wealth, and there indeed we touch upon realities.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Barrington {{was still}} smiling with his eyes, but {{his lips were}} set. [...] "A little {{knowledge}} is dangerous, my dear, {{and if you could}} understand me better, I could show you where you were wrong. As it is, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I have decided to sell wheat forward and plough very little." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{gentleman who}} heard the {{conversation}} afterwards {{told me the}} following anecdote. A friend of his had long been an unsuccessful suitor {{in one of the}} higher courts of the kingdom. They met one day in the street, when the other told him that an unsealed letter, which he held in his hand, contained an offer of a pair of carriage-horses to the wife of the judge who had the control of his affair. On being told he dare not take so strong a step, M. de ----, my informant, was requested to read the letter, to seal it and {{to put it in the}} boîte aux lettres with his own hands, in order to satisfy himself of the actual state of justice in France. All this was done, and [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> add," [...] continued M. de ----, [...] "that I afterwards saw the horses in the carriage of Madame ----, and that my friend gained his cause." [...] To this anecdote <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> it exactly as I heard it, and that M. de ---- is a deputy, and one of the honestest and simplest-minded men of my acquaintance. It is but proper to add, that the judge in question has a bad name, and is little esteemed by the bar; but the above-mentioned fact would go to show that too much of the old system remains.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the impact}} of {{software}} engineering research on current practices in industry? In this paper, I report on my direct experience as a PhD/post-doc working in software engineering research projects, and then spending the following five years as an engineer in two different companies (the first one being the same I worked in collaboration with during my post-doc). Given a background in software engineering research, what cutting-edge techniques and tools from academia did I use in my daily work when developing and testing the systems of these companies? Regarding validation and verification (my main area of research), the answer is rather short: as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>only</b> FindBugs. In this paper, I report on why this was the case, and discuss all the challenging, complex open problems we face in industry and which somehow are ``neglected'' in the academic circles. In particular, I will first discuss what actual tools I could use in my daily work, such as JaCoCo and Selenium. Then, I will discuss the main open problems I faced, particularly related to environment simulators, unit and web testing. After that, popular topics in academia are presented, such as UML, regression and mutation testing. Their lack of impact on the type of projects I worked on in industry is then discussed. Finally, from this industrial experience, I provide my opinions about how this situation can be improved, in particular related to how academics are evaluated, and advocate for a greater involvement into open-source projects...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much I love you, Alice," [...] Jasper Dale was saying, unafraid, with no shyness {{in voice}} or manner. [...] "I {{wonder what you}} would say if you knew. You would laugh at me--sweet as you are, you would laugh in mockery. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>tell</b> you. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> dream of <b>telling</b> you. In my dream you are {{standing}} here by me, dear. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see you very plainly, my sweet lady, so tall and gracious, with your dark hair and your maiden eyes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> dream that <b>I</b> tell you my love; that--maddest, sweetest dream of all--that you love me in return. Everything is possible in dreams, you know, dear. My dreams are all I have, so I go far in them, even to dreaming that you are my wife. I dream how I shall fix up my dull old house for you. One room will need nothing more--it is your room, dear, and has been ready for you a long time--long before that day I saw you under the pine. Your books and your chair and your picture are there, dear--only the picture is not half lovely enough. But the other rooms of the house {{must be made to}} bloom out freshly for you. What a delight it is thus to dream of what I would do for you! Then I would bring you home, dear, and lead you through my garden and into my house as its mistress. I would see you standing beside me in the old mirror {{at the end of the}} hall--a bride, in your pale blue dress, with a blush on your face. I would lead you through all the rooms made ready for your coming, and then to your own. I would see you sitting in your own chair and all my dreams would find rich fulfilment in that royal moment. Oh, Alice, we would have a beautiful life together! It's sweet to make believe about it. You will sing to me in the twilight, and we will gather early flowers together in the spring days. When I come home from work, tired, you will put your arms about me and lay your head on my shoulder. I will stroke it--so--that bonny, glossy head of yours. Alice, my Alice--all mine in my dream--never to be mine in real life--how I love you!" ...|$|R
