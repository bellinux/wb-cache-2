But whatever these might be, they did not come to overwhelm her. The gladness of his voice, as he had spoken so eagerly to her father about the debt, had made her feel very kindly toward him. It might have been natural for a young man to resent this dragging debt. But he was fine. She observed, as he sat down, that, once the smile and <b>flush</b> <b>left</b> his face, he seemed somewhat thinner and older than she had pictured him. A shadow lay in his eyes and his lips were sad. He had evidently been working, upon their arrival. He wore overalls, dusty and ragged; his arms, bare to the elbow, were brown and muscular; his thin cotton shirt was wet with sweat and it clung to his powerful shoulders.|$|E

Document layout The manuscript must not have page number or running headers and footers. The text bloc (the printed area) should measure and must not exceed 140 x 227 mm; it must have a one-column format and be positioned {{at the center of the}} page. In A 4 format, this corresponds to 35 mm margins on all sides. If you use other formats, e. g., US Letter, please make sure the text bloc measures 140 x 227 mm (i. e., make sure line lengths do not exceed 140 mm). The title of the article must be preceded by 50 mm blank space (the blank space on top of the first page will be used for editorial purposes). The title should be set in 24 point Times, <b>flushed</b> <b>left.</b> The title should be followed by the name of the author(s) in 14 point Times, <b>flushed</b> <b>left.</b> Immediately after the name of the author, the name and country of th...|$|R

50|$|Continuous casting {{typesetting}} {{systems such}} as the Linotype were able to reduce the jaggedness of the right-hand sides of adjacent lines of <b>flush</b> <b>left</b> composition by inserting self-adjusting space bands between words to evenly distribute white space, taking excessive space that would have occurred {{at the end of}} the line and redistributing it between words.

5000|$|Line {{length is}} {{determined}} by typographic parameters based on a formal grid and template with several goals in mind; balance and function for fit and readability with a sensitivity to aesthetic style in typography. Typographers adjust line length to aid legibility or copy fit. Text can be <b>flush</b> <b>left</b> and ragged right, flush right and ragged left, or justified where all lines are of equal length. In a ragged right setting line lengths vary to create a ragged right edge of lines varying in length. Sometimes this can be visually satisfying. For justified and ragged right settings typographers can adjust line length to avoid unwanted hyphens, rivers of white space, and orphaned words/characters {{at the end of}} lines (e.g.: [...] "The", [...] "I", [...] "He", [...] "We").|$|E

Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to “express {{the spirit of a}} more progressive age” by early designers in the movement. Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a “socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.” ...|$|E

50|$|The International Typographic Style, {{also known}} as the Swiss Style, is a graphic design style that emerged in Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 1920s and was {{developed}} by designers in Switzerland during the 1950s. The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design {{as a part of the}} modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity. Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a grid, sans-serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk, and <b>flush</b> <b>left,</b> ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured typography as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named. The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day.|$|E
