5|$|Barkley was a {{prolific}} scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game {{during the regular}} season for his career and 23.0 points-per-game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and <b>fadeaways,</b> or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He {{was one of the most}} efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season).|$|E

Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwyane Wade, Karl Malone, Larry Bird and Carmelo Anthony are also well known for using this move. The even more difficult one-legged fadeaway has become Dirk Nowitzki's signature move and has been called by LeBron James the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2011 a nine-track Neon Hearts Tribute CD was {{released}} in Japan on the Simply Thrilling label. The project {{was the brainchild of}} record producer and promoter Miles Wood, who is based in the Far East and picked up on the band's popularity in Japan. In an interview with Junk Archive Miles recalled, [...] "The idea came to me after Nervous Hearts (a side project of The <b>Fadeaways)</b> played a cover of [...] "Answers" [...] at a show I organised in Yokohama. I knew there were some Neon Hearts fans in Japan and among those were a few musicians in bands that I worked with. So I mentioned the idea to Nervous Hearts’ vocalist if they would be interested in recording [...] "Answers" [...] for a Neon Hearts tribute EP or album; he said yes, and {{thought it was a good}} idea so I started asking other bands. My first question was always [...] "Do you know and like Neon Hearts?" [...] and I got some excited responses. Sometimes I would mention the idea to someone in passing and was surprised to hear them say [...] "I love Neon Hearts!" [...] and so I would immediately invite them on board." ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fadeaway</b> shot is a {{variation}} on a set jump shot in which the shooter attempts his shot leaning backward, creating the effect of [...] "fading away" [...] from his defender. This {{makes it more difficult}} for the defender to contest the shot. The <b>fadeaway</b> usually has less range than a regular jump shot, because the ball has backwards momentum due to its inertia, making it somewhat tougher to project the ball over long distances. Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone, and Steve Nash are famous for their use of the <b>fadeaway.</b> Wilt Chamberlain was criticized for his frequent use of the <b>fadeaway</b> jumper, since the follow-through usually carries the shooter away from the basket and out of rebounding position.|$|R

5000|$|Fernandez {{is perhaps}} the most ambidextrous player to have played the game since Carlos Loyzaga a {{generation}} before him. Almost always, whenever he would get the defensive rebound he would assume the role of [...] "point-center", leading the fast-break (a throwback to his point-guard days), which he admitted was a habit he could not break in the pros. Fernandez would dribble the ball running the middle of the court, either hitting the open man on either wing or finishing a lay-up with either hand. There were many instances when he would switch the ball from right hand to left hand, often drawing a foul or setting up a three-point play. One of his more famous moves was driving {{down the middle of the}} lane coming from the right side of the court, faking a right-handed shot and then, at the last second when the defender has committed himself, switching the ball to his left hand for an up-and-under scoop shot that almost always drew a foul. He had an ambidextrous hook shot that was almost impossible to stop and a weird-looking variation of a lay-up that was executed while [...] "fading away" [...] from the basket which made it equally intriguing. His [...] "elegant shot" [...] often came after a right-handed cross-over dribble and moving away from a defender. He used pivot moves, pump fakes, lookaway or no-look passes, looping shots, <b>fadeaways</b> and an array of what seemed to be trick shots from near or under the basket that he executed to perfection. He was doing this before Kevin McHale was doing his moves worthy of a chapter in an NBA playbook. Fernandez owned what was perhaps the craziest no-look pass that was executed on Philippine hardwood: an assist initiated as a fake behind-the-back pass going to one direction only to go the opposite direction at the precise moment when the recipient is ready to receive the pass. His pinpoint passing ability was so devastating to opponents because he often executed them at critical junctures of the game, either coming from his right or left hand. It didn't matter to Fernandez whether he was hitting the open man through a crowd of defenders or hitting the same open man via a Hail Mary pass from outside the backcourt. Philip Cezar and Abe King, two premier defenders of local players and imports alike, in television interviews, always said that Fernandez was the toughest assignment they ever had to handle.|$|E

This time they were able to kidnap him. Lion-Mane and the gang went for breakfast in the diner, while Thought Terror was working on Hawkman. Hawkman was rescued by Hawkgirl and Golden Eagle, but his perception was altered and saw Hawkgirl as an enemy; he beat her almost to death. Lion-Mane then set some charges around the city as did others of his group. By blowing up building they caught Hawkman's attention and {{that was part of the}} plan. Manhawks arrived, but they only were there to prevent Hawkman from escaping. The gang then took turn to beat Hawkman; Lion-Mane got over zealous and tossed Hawkman into a burning building. Hawkman recovered and tried to escape, but the Manhawks attacked him. <b>Fadeaway</b> Man lets them do their job and left with his gang. Lion-Mane got his payment and went to vacation to Africa, where he was loved and treated as king.
