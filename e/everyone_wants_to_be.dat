500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and <b>everyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Dr. Dre; {{no one wants to be}} their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E
500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But we did not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fomin's turn to Neoclassicism is {{traced to}} 1903, when he {{applied to the}} contest for Count Volkonsky estate with a neoclassical draft. In 1904, Fomin {{published}} his Revival Manifesto in Mir Iskusstva magazine, pledging to architectural legacy of Catherine and Alexander I. [...] "These days, <b>everyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> individual, to invent his own, {{and in the end}} we cannot see neither a dominant style, nor a trace of those who can eventually create it". Fomin believed in a universal idea uniting everyone, and in an architectural style that could serve it. He promoted the Academy's exhibitions in [...] "History of Russian Art" [...] (1909) and [...] "History of Architecture" [...] (1911), as vigorously as he did his Art Nouveau shows. Fomin was an outspoken advocate for building preservation, leading a campaign against the conversion of historical mansions into rental apartment buildings.|$|E
2500|$|The Times commented, [...] "there is another, sweeter side to her travails. [...] Miranda loves singing and, despite – {{or perhaps}} because of – the satire, becomes an {{evocation}} of something all humans love to do and have done since before we discovered language. The very act of singing, however dire the sound, makes us feel good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... people need to be reminded that it takes a lot more effort to sing than just watching movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because <b>everyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties. Ballinger says that she gets the most satisfaction from her live performances.|$|E
2500|$|The NJLA {{supported}} the American Library Association's position in challenging the 2001 Children's Internet Protection Act, which mandates public libraries install pornography filters on computers with Internet access {{in order for}} the libraries to receive federal funding. The Act was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 2003 decision. [...] "Obviously we feel it's a very difficult decision to implement. There's no guidance on how to implement it. There's a lot of confusion about what's going to happen and what requirements would have to be followed if federal funds were obtained," [...] said NJLA executive director Patricia Tumulty in a statement about the decision to The Star-Ledger. Tumulty said that the law would disproportionately affect libraries with less available funding. In 2002, the NJLA and corporate sponsor, the Verizon Foundation, started the nonprofit charity program New Jersey Reads to encourage literacy among the 2 million people in New Jersey who have trouble reading. New Jersey Reads was started with US$325,000 in funding from Verizon. In 2003, the NJLA organized a seminar for approximately 150 librarians, educating them on how to protect readers' privacy in light of the USA PATRIOT Act. [...] "We are grappling with this – we are a country at war and <b>everyone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> patriotic, but they're forgetting the First Amendment," [...] said one librarian who attended the convention. The association organizes the One Book New Jersey [...] program, and chooses one book for each age group to promote literacy. In 2003, then-First Lady Dina Matos McGreevey was the spokeswoman for One Book New Jersey. One Book New Jersey was developed by the NJLA and the New Jersey State Library.|$|E
