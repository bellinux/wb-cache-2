But this principle does not allow defining medium- and long-term trends, which provides evidence of lack <b>of</b> adequate <b>forecasting</b> <b>of</b> local <b>budget</b> expenditures. Now the scientifically-based approach toforecast local budget expenditures is required; the latest is impossible without using of mathematical and economic models. Given paper is aimed to develop scientifically based methods and models in order to forecast local budget expenditures and to make a medium-term <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> local <b>budget</b> expenditures for Donetsk region. In order to choice an appropriate forecasting model, based on existing theoretical issues, we distinguished three classes <b>of</b> <b>forecasting</b> models: microsimulation models, component-based models, regional-level models. This analysis allowed us to determine the forecasting technique which is the mixed variant of deterministic and econometric models. It based on using of correlatable factors, which influence directly on benchmark parameter - budget expenditures. Such technique provides the medium-term <b>forecasting</b> <b>of</b> <b>budget</b> expenditures in Donetsk region for 2014 - 2016. Input model data includes official statistical data for all considering indexes and also for benchmark parameter, covering period 2006 - 2013, by half-year. After preliminary estimates we’ve chosen two <b>forecasting</b> models <b>of</b> multivariate regression type: additive and multiplicative (logarithmic) models. Modeling results showed that ratio between budget expenditures in Donets region and Ukraine’s GDP is sufficiently stable, it changes continuously according to political and economical government decisions; the saccadic changes can be naturally explained by hypothesis of external pulse effects (as it was {{in the second half of}} 2008). The chosen models allowed us to make a medium-term <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> local <b>budget</b> expenditures <b>of</b> Donetsk region. Results <b>of</b> <b>forecasting,</b> as well as analytical conclusions can be useful for budget management in Donetsk region.

40|$|In {{situations}} where a sequence <b>of</b> <b>forecasts</b> is observed, a common {{strategy is to}} examine "rationality" conditional on a given loss function.

We establish identification of the parameters of a general class of loss functions that nest popular loss functions as special cases and provide estimation methods and asymptotic distributional results for these parameters. This allows us to construct new tests <b>of</b> <b>forecast</b> rationality that allow for asymmetric loss.

The difference between the estimated and actual figures is defined as variance.To understand the cause of the difference, managers need to investigate the questions how the variance differs from last period and what are the causes for not reaching the estimated figures.Analysers consider two types of variances: adverse variance and favourable variance. Adverse variance “exists when the difference between the budgeted and actual figure leads to a lower than expected profit”. Favourable variance “exists when the difference between the budgeted and actual figure leads to a higher than expected profit”. Rather than considering all variances, managers establish criteria to determine which variances are significant to focus on.

Our results suggest that an improvement in the quality of institutions, whether measured by the tightness of national fiscal rules, the medium-term budgetary framework or budgetary transparency, reduces the degree of optimism at the first-release stage, thereby making firstrelease figures more informative about the eventual outcomes. This supports the European Commission proposals for minimum standards or national fiscal frameworks and amendments by the European Parliament for improving national ownership.
