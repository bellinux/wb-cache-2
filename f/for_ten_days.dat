5|$|During the Californication world tour, Frusciante {{continued}} to compose his own songs, {{many of which}} would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only Water <b>for</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Days.</b> The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly stream-of-consciousness or avant-garde. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down. The songwriting and production of To Record Only Water <b>for</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Days</b> were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on Californication, focusing more on electronic and new wave elements. In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a distinctive feature of the record.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus hosts many annual or {{recurring}} festivals, {{concerts and}} events, with the festival of Aarhus Festuge {{as the most}} popular and wide-ranging, along with large sports events. It is the largest multicultural festival in Scandinavia, always based on a special theme and takes place every year <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days</b> between late August and early September, transforming the inner city with festive activities and decorations of all kinds.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Perón's death, the {{government}} suspended all official activities {{for two days}} and ordered all flags flown at half-staff <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days.</b> It soon became apparent, however, that these measures fell short of reflecting popular grief. The crowd outside of the presidential residence, where Evita died, grew dense, congesting the streets for ten blocks in each direction.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{in the annals of}} Muslim chronicles, {{that at the time of}} the Zuhr prayers, Sophronius invited Umar to pray in the rebuilt Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Umar declined, fearing that accepting the invitation might endanger the church's status as a Christian temple, and that Muslims might break the treaty and turn the temple into a mosque.

5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to harass Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had been raped in prison. The brutality of Noriega's activities led to him being suspended <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days,</b> an item of information that was picked up by the U.S. intelligence services.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAuditory {{conditioning}} {{consists of}} the pre-exposure to low levels of a potential harmful agent to protect against a subsequent harmful exposure. ObjectiveTo confirm if conditioning with an agent different from that used to cause the trauma can also be effective. MethodsThis was an experimental study with 17 guinea pigs, divided into three groups: an ototoxic control group (Cont) that received intramuscular administration of gentamicin 160 mg/kg/day <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> consecutive <b>days,</b> but no sound exposure; a sound control group (Sound) that was exposed to 85 dB broadband noise centered at 4 kHz, 30 min each <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> consecutive <b>days,</b> but received no ototoxic medications; and an experimental group (Expt) that received sound exposure identical to the Sound group and after each noise presentation, received gentamicin similarly to Cont group. The animals were evaluated by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs), and scanning electron microscopy. ResultsThe animals that were conditioned with noise did not show any protective effect compared with the ones that received only the ototoxic gentamicin administration. This lack of protection was observed functionally and morphologically. ConclusionConditioning with 85 dB broadband noises, 30 min a <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> consecutive <b>days</b> does not protect against an ototoxic gentamicin administration of 160 mg/kg/day <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> consecutive <b>days</b> in the guinea pig...|$|R

5|$|After the Olympics, Evans {{returned}} to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, {{he attempted to}} qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. Evans later stated that he felt his admission of having only trained <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days</b> had lowered his standing {{in the eyes of the}} selectors. As a result of being overlooked, Evans retired from competitive swimming.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} known for some key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days</b> in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days</b> {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E

5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days,</b> during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E
5|$|Europeans first {{witnessed}} the Great Wall {{in the early}} 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a first-hand encounter with the Great Wall, and mentions that {{in the course of}} the journey his embassy travelled alongside the Great Wall <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>days</b> {{due to a}} persistent mid to upper-level tropospheric ridge. Gradual intensification took place as the system developed strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures aided in fueling further development. Easterly wind shear caused disruption of the storms' outflow; however, the center, previously surrounded by two deep areas of convection, was situated underneath one area of thunderstorm activity. By the late morning hours of September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E
