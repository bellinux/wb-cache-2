40|$|Temperature {{transducers}} {{capable of}} control and test measurements in the 1400 - 1800 ˚C range in the fast neutron irradiation environment of the Gas Test Loop are evaluated. Among the instruments discussed are <b>high-temperature</b> <b>thermocouples,</b> resistance temperature detectors, ultrasonic thermometers, noise thermometers, and optical temperature sensors. High-temperature capability, behavior under irradiation, technical maturity, cost, and availability are among the key factors considered in assessing {{the relative merits of}} each measurement method. In the near term, the doped molybdenum versus niobium-zirconium alloy thermocouple is deemed to be best suited to the in-pile test and control requirements. Additional characterization of this thermocouple combination is needed to ensure confidence in its performance. Use of tungsten-rhenium alloy thermocouples, with specific disadvantages noted, constitutes the recommended back-up position. The Gas Test Loop (GTL) project has as its current mission to provide a conceptual design for a...|$|R
40|$|Many {{advanced}} {{nuclear reactor}} designs require new fuel, cladding, and structural materials. Data {{are needed to}} characterize the performance of these new materials in high temperature, oxidizing, and radiation conditions. To obtain this data, robust instrumentation is needed that can survive proposed test conditions. Standard thermocuoples for measuring temperature in-pile degrade at temperatures above 1100 ºC. Hence, INL initiated a project to develop specialized thermocouples for high temperature in-pile applications. Results from efforts to develop, fabricate, and evaluate specialized <b>high-temperature</b> <b>thermocouples</b> for in-pile applications suggest that several material combinations are viable. Tests show that several low neutron cross-section candidate materials are resistant to material interactions and remain ductile at high temperatures. In addition, {{results indicate that the}} thermoelectric response is singlevalued and repeatable with acceptable resolution for the candidate thermoelements considered. The final selection of the thermocouple materials will depend on the desired peak temperature and accuracy requirements. If thermocouples are needed that measure temperatures at 1600 ºC or higher, the doped Mo / Nb- 1 %Zr and Mo- 1. 6 % Nb / Nb- 1 %Zr thermoelement wire combinations are recommended with HfO 2 insulation, and a Nb- 1 %Zr sheath. Additional evaluations are underway to characterize the performance of this proposed thermocouple design. INL has worked to optimize this thermocouple’s stability. With appropriate heat treatment and fabrication approaches, results indicate that the effects of thermal cycling on the calibration of the proposed thermocouple design can be minimized. INL has initiated a series of high temperature (from 1200 to 1800 ºC) long duration (up to six months) tests. Initial results indicate the INL-developed thermocouple’s termoelectric response is stable with less than 15 ºC drift observed in over 3500 hours of the planned 4000 hours of tests at 1200 ºC. In comparison, commercially-available Type K and N thermocouples included in these 1200 ºC tests have experienced drifts up to of over 100 ºC...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{heat flux}} {{measurements}} are made using both thermocouple and thin film gages in <b>high-temperature,</b> hypersonic flows. <b>Thermocouple</b> and thin film gages have individually been extensively used in relatively {{high and low}} enthalpy conditions respectively. In this study, three test conditions with varying (intermediate) stagnation enthalpies, Mach and Reynolds numbers are created in an expansion tube facility, and temperature histories and heat flux measurements obtained using the two gage types are directly compared. Gage performance in terms of survivability, response, uncertainty, and signal-to-noise ratio is assessed for both blunt body and flat plate models...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of structural design tools for Rotary Combustion Engines (RCE) using Finite Element Modeling (FEM) requires {{knowledge about the}} response of engine materials to various service conditions. This paper describes experimental work that studied housing deformation {{as a result of}} thermal, pressure and mechanical loads. The measurement of thermal loads, clamping pressure, and deformation was accomplished by use of <b>high-temperature</b> strain gauges, <b>thermocouples,</b> and a high speed data acquisition system. FEM models for heat transfer stress analysis of the rotor housing will be verified and refined based on these experimental results...|$|R
