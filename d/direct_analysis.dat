2500|$|A {{frequent}} {{question and}} point of {{confusion in the}} ToK System is the definition and meaning of consciousness. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, {{it is crucial to}} recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are sentience, which is the capacity for mental experience and self-awareness, which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a [...] "level 3" [...] phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a [...] "perceived" [...] electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the [...] "hard" [...] problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very <b>direct</b> <b>analysis</b> of the other issue of consciousness, that of self-awareness.|$|E
2500|$|DESI {{has been}} widely studied since its {{inception}} in 2004 by Professor Zoltan Takáts, [...] et al., in Professor Graham Cooks' group from Purdue University with the goal of looking into methods that didn't require the sample to be inside of a vacuum. Both DESI and <b>direct</b> <b>analysis</b> in real time (DART) have been largely responsible for the rapid growth in ambient ionization techniques, with a proliferation of more than thirty new techniques being found today. These methods allow for complex systems to be analyzed without preparation and throughputs as high as 45 samples a minute. DESI is a combination popular techniques, such as, electrospray ionization and surface desorption techniques. Electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry was reported by Malcolm Dole in 1968, but John Bennett Fenn was awarded a nobel prize in chemistry for the development of ESI-MS in the late 1980s. Then in 1999, desorption of open surface and free matrix experiments were reported in the literature utilizing an experiment that was called desorption/ionization on silicon. The combination of these two advancements led to the introduction of DESI and DART as the main ambient ionization techniques that would later become multiple different techniques. One in particular, due to increasing studies into optimization of DESI is, Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization. In this technique the analyte is desorbed into a bridge formed via two capillaries and the analysis surface.|$|E

A straightforward, efficient, and affordable protocol to measure urine mercury content would greatly contribute to assessing one’s mercury exposure and in categorizing populations that are more vulnerable to such exposure.

Therefore, this project developed an assay that utilizes dried urine strips for <b>direct</b> mercury <b>analysis,</b> evading the limitations of time, cost, and sample quantity.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} analytical technology for highly efficient, high-resolution, and high-yield fractionation of compounds after gas chromatography (GC) separations. The technology is straightforward, {{does not require}} sophisticated cold traps or adsorbent traps, and allows collecting large numbers of fractions during a GC run. The technology is based on direct infusion of a carrier solvent {{at the end of}} the GC column, where infusion takes place in the GC oven. Pentane and hexane used as carrier solvent showed good results. Acetonitrile also showed good results as a more polar carrier solvent. Development and optimization of the technology is described, followed by demonstration in a high-throughput effect <b>directed</b> <b>analysis</b> setting toward dioxin receptor bioactivity. The GC fractionation setup was capable of collecting fractions in the second range. As a result, fractionated compounds could be collected into one or two fractions when 6. 5 s resolution fractionation was performed. Subsequently, mixtures containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, of which some are bioactive toward the dioxin receptor, were profiled with a mammalian gene reporter assay. After fractionation into 96 -well plates, we used our new approach for direct cell seeding onto the fractions prior to assaying which allowed dioxin receptor bioactivity to be measured directly after fractionation. The current technology represents a great advance in effect <b>directed</b> <b>analysis</b> for environmental screening worldwide as it allows combining the preferred analytical separation technology for often non-polar environmental pollutants with environmentally relevant bioassays, in high resolution. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of a two tier neonatal screening strategy for cystic fibrosis, which combines estimation of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by <b>direct</b> gene <b>analysis</b> in dried blood spot samples collected at age 5 days. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of two tier screening strategy. The first tier of testing immunoreactive trypsinogen concentration was measured in dried blood spot samples from neonates aged 4 - 5 days. In the second tier <b>direct</b> gene <b>analysis</b> to detect cystic fibrosis mutations deltaF 508 and deltaI 506 was performed in those blood spot samples which produced the highest 1 % of immunoreactive trypsinogen values. <b>Direct</b> gene <b>analysis</b> was also performed on blood spot samples from infants with suspected or confirmed meconium ileus, regardless of the immunoreactive trypsinogen value. SETTING [...] The South Australian Neonatal Screening Programme, operating from the department of chemical pathology at Adelaide Children's Hospital. Subjects [...] All 12, 056 neonates born in South Australia between December 1989 and June 1990. No selection criteria were applied. INTERVENTIONS [...] All infants found to have two recognised cystic fibrosis mutations on <b>direct</b> gene <b>analysis</b> were referred directly for clinical management, and those with one recognised cystic fibrosis mutation were recalled for a sweat test; their families were given genetic counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Direct or exclusion of cystic fibrosis by sweat testing of neonates identified as being at high risk of cystic fibrosis on screening and of those at minimum risk but whose subsequent clinical history raised suspicion about the disease. RESULTS [...] Of the 12, 056 infants screened, 11, 907 (98. 8 %) were reported as "cystic fibrosis not indicated" on the basis of low immunoreactive trypsinogen values. Of the 148 (1. 23 %) infants with raised immunoreactive trypsinogen values and one (0. 008 %) with meconium ileus, 132 (1. 09 %) were reported as cystic fibrosis not indicated, four (0. 033 %) were identified as having cystic fibrosis, and 13 (0. 108 %) were recalled for sweat testing after <b>direct</b> gene <b>analysis</b> for the presence of the deltaF 508 and deltaI 506 cystic fibrosis mutations. No cases of affected infants are known to have been missed to date. CONCLUSION [...] The strategy of measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by <b>direct</b> gene <b>analysis</b> is a highly specific neonatal screen for cystic fibrosis, requiring only 2. 8 families to be contacted for every case of cystic fibrosis diagnosed...|$|R
