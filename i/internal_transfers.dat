25|$|Proper use {{of these}} gas {{relationships}} requires the Kinetic-molecular theory (KMT). When gas particles possess a magnetic charge or Intermolecular force they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced (the hydrogen bond model illustrates one example). In {{the absence of any}} charge, at some point when the spacing between gas particles is greatly reduced they can no longer avoid collisions between themselves at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increased collisions among gas particles would include a fixed volume of gas, which upon heating would contain very fast particles. This means that these ideal equations provide reasonable results except for extremely high pressure (compressible) or high temperature (ionized) conditions. Notice that all of these excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system. The absence of these <b>internal</b> <b>transfers</b> is what is referred to as ideal conditions in which the energy exchange occurs only at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. When these collisions are statistically negligible (incompressible), results from these ideal equations are still meaningful. If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid (see fluid dynamics).|$|E

40|$|Chunghwa Post Co., Ltd. has readjusted its {{organizational}} structure into 23 responsibility central bureaus since its corporatization in 2003 and initiated the <b>internal</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing system since 2005 for {{the benefits of}} making easy the calculation of economic earnings in the 23 bureaus after the implementation of such a system, which is also listed {{as one of the}} evaluation items to assess the business performance of these bureaus. This study collected the earnings data before and after <b>internal</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing in every responsibility central bureau from years 2005 to 2008 and performed descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) according to the position levels and geographical districts (north, central and south) of each bureau. This study also adopted the interview method, using selected postal workers as the subjects. The findings of the study indicate: (1) there are significant differences of earnings between major and minor responsibility central bureaus before <b>internal</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing. After implementing the pricing system, however, no significant differences of earnings are found between bureaus of different responsibilities. (2) There are no significant differences of earnings among bureaus located in three different districts before <b>internal</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing. After implementing the system, however, significant differences of earnings are found among bureaus of different districts. Such differences are found larger between bureaus of the north and those of the central and south as the percentage of financial subsidies decreases. In order to achieve a "fair" and "reasonable" performance evaluation system, therefore, this study suggests the following steps to be taken in order to eliminate the significant differences created by rural-urban differences: (1) to include the rural-urban factor in the <b>internal</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing system, (2) to set up a few bureaus under special policies, and (3) to increase the percentage of financial subsidies. It is hoped that the aforementioned practices will further motivate all responsibility central bureaus to pay extra attention to their earnings performances after <b>internal</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing. 中華郵政股份有限公司自民國 92 年公司化以後，組織結構調整為 23 個責任中心局，並自 94 年度起實施郵件內部轉撥計價制度，俾利計算各責任中心局郵件內部轉撥計價後盈餘，並將其計入責任中心局績效評核項目之一。 本研究主要蒐集 94 至 97 年度各責任中心局轉撥計價前、後盈餘數據資料，分別針對不同局等組別及北、中、南三個區域責任中心局分組進行敘述性統計及變異數分析法，並以相關郵政員工為對象，兼採訪談研究方法。本研究結果發現：一、各責任中心局郵件內部轉撥計價前盈餘，對於大、小責任中心局等間存在顯著之差異。經由實施郵件內部轉撥計價制度後，各大、小責任中心局間之郵件內部轉撥後盈餘已無顯著差異。二、北、中、南部不同地區責任中心局郵件內部轉撥計價計價前盈餘並無顯著差異存在，經由郵件內部轉撥計價公式計算後，北、中、南三個不同地區責任中心局郵件內部轉撥計價後盈餘存在顯著性差異，尤其當經濟提撥補貼不經濟比率愈小時，則北部地區與中、南部地區責任中心局間差異性愈大。為達「公平」與「合理」之責任中心績效衡量制度目標，建議予該郵件內部轉撥計價制度中考慮置入其他更多質性的考量因子(如城鄉因素、政策性設局等) ，或是提高經濟提撥補貼不經濟比率，以減少北部與中、南部責任中心局郵件內部轉撥計價後盈餘之顯著差異，進而促使各責任中心局重視該績效評核項目，以達激勵效果。第一章 緒論 [...] 1 第一節 研究背景與動機 [...] 2 第二節 研究範圍與目的 [...] 5 第三節 研究架構與流程 [...] 5 第二章 文獻回顧 [...] 8 第一節 轉撥計價與責任中心制度之相關文獻 [...] 8 第二節 我國郵政相關文獻 [...] . 10 第三章 中華郵政郵件內部轉撥計價制度介紹 [...] . 13 第一節 郵件流程之簡介 [...] . 13 第二節 郵件種類之簡介 [...] . 14 第三節 郵政成本系統概述 [...] . 18 第四節 郵件內部轉撥計價之項目 [...] . 23 第四章 研究方法與設計 [...] . 30 第一節 研究方法與架構 [...] . 30 第二節 研究設計 [...] . 31 第五章 實證結果 [...] 38 第一節 轉撥計價前盈餘分析 [...] . 38 第二節 轉撥計價後盈餘分析 [...] . 43 第三節 訪談結果分析 [...] . 48 第六章 結論與建議 [...] . 52 第一節 研究結論 [...] . 52 第二節 對中華郵政公司之建議 [...] . 54 第三節 研究限制與未來研究建議 [...] . 54 參考文獻 [...] . 56 附錄 [...] 5...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} some of {{the implications}} of the dual transfer a debtor nation must undertake to service foreign debt: (a) an <b>internal</b> <b>transfer</b> from the private sector to the public sector; and (b) an external transfer from the domestic economy to foreign creditors. It shows that, under likely circumstances, a real depreciation of the home currency may complicate the <b>internal</b> <b>transfer.</b> As long as non-traded goods are a net source of revenue for the government, the depreciation called for by debt service deteriorates the public sector's terms of trade vis-a-vis the private sector and magnifies the requisite fiscal retrenchment. The paper discusses the role of trade policy (tariffs and export subsidies) in substituting for devaluation. Generating a private-sector surplus via interest-rate policy is shown to have similar costs on the government budget when the public sector has outstanding domestic debt. ...|$|R
