The composition and productivity of <b>derived</b> <b>gases</b> are determined in relation to pyrolysis temperature from 500 - 1000 °C and different gas phase residence time. It concludes that the time of complete pyrolysis decreases linearly with increasing temperature, while yield of char decreases slowly and yield of gas increases quickly. The gas yield at 1000 °C is almost 3 times higher than that at 500 °C. The gases are identified as H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 6 in addition to lower concentrations of H 2 S and other hydrocarbon gases. The gas heating value is about 20 - 37 MJ/ Nm 3 with the critical point of gas heating value between 700 to 800 °C. The gas yield increases with increasing gas phase residence time in high temperature zone, while too longer residence time can make the gas heating value decreased. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Planar Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) of a tracer species, acetone, and OH radicals was carried out to characterize the flame structures.

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of present day CH 4 diffuse degassing {{from the soil}} represents an effective tool to better estimate the degassing rate of individual sources and to calibrate global Earth degassing estimates. While many data exist on CH 4 emissions from ecosystems, agricultural soils and landfills, few estimates of CH 4 emissions from volcanic-geothermal areas have been performed. The authors report results and discuss applications of accumulation-chamber measurements of soil CH 4 and CO 2 flux from Solfatara of Pozzuoli (Naples), Vulcano Island and Poggio dell’Olivo (Viterbo) volcanic-geothermal areas, and the Palma Campania landfill (Naples). Volcanic-geothermal study areas are characterised by vent discharges of fluids with different CH 4 /CO 2 ratios (from 4. 7 X 1 E- 5 to 7. 5 X 1 E- 5, 4. 7 X 1 E- 4 and 2. 5 X 1 E- 3 by weight, for Solfatara of Pozzuoli, Vulcano island, and Poggio dell’Olivo areas, respectively). Soil CH 4 fluxes range from 0. 003 to 48 g m- 2 day- 1 in the volcanic-geothermal areas and from 0. 0021 to 936 g m- 2 day- 1 in the landfill, with high spatial variability observed in all areas. Using statistical methods different flux populations were distinguished (i. e. background soil gases and deeply <b>derived</b> <b>gases)</b> and the total gas emissions from study sites calculated. The results of this work show that CH 4 /CO 2 ratios of deep fluids, fumarolic fluids {{in the case of}} the volcanicgeothermal environment and biogas in landfills, are roughly maintained in the gas phase diffusely degassed by the soil. Due to high spatial variability, a large number of flux measurements and appropriate statistical methods are needed to estimate total gas discharge from study areas.

A high-pressure fixed packed bed (HPFPB) was employed to carry out the reaction. The results indicate that the conversion of CO (XCO) and specific production rates of alcohol (SPRAOH) and alkane (SPRAlk) are highly depended on temperature (T). In T = 423 – 573 K, maximum yield of alcohols (YAOH) and SPRAOH occur at T = 523 K. In the meantime, well performance gives the selectivity of ethanol (SEtOH) of 52. 0 C%. For the studies on varying H 2 /CO mole ratio (MH/C) from 1 to 4 at 523 K, the appropriate MH/C to produce EtOH is 2, giving higher ratios of SPRAOH/SPRAlk and YAOH/YAlk than those with other MH/C. As for varying the total gas flow rates (QG) of 300, 450, 600 to 900 cm 3 min− 1 tested at T = 523 K and MH/C = 2, the lower QG provides longer reaction time (or gaseous retention time, tR) thus offering higher XCO, however lower productivity. For setting pressure (PST) = 225 – 540 psi, a supply of higher pressure is equivalent to providing a larger amount of reactants into the reaction system, this thus suggests the use of higher PST should give both higher XCO and productivity. The assessment of the above results indicates that the MoS 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst favors the production of alcohols over alkanes, especially for ethanol.

Large eddy simulations of the conical flames {{are carried out}} to gain further understanding of the flame/flow interaction in the cone.

Without the cone (i. e. jet burner) the critical jet velocities for blowoff and liftoff of biomass <b>derived</b> <b>gases</b> are higher than that for methane/nitrogen mixture with the same heating values, indicating the enhanced flame stabilization by hydrogen in the mixture.

From the PLIF images it is shown that in the conical burner, the flame is stabilized by the cone at nearly the same position for different fuels. From large eddy simulations, the flames are shown {{to be controlled by}} the recirculation flows inside cone, which depends on the cone angle, but less sensitive to the fuel compositions and flow speed.

The composition and yield of the <b>derived</b> <b>gases</b> and distribution of the pyrolyzed product were determined at temperatures between 500 and 1000 °C under different gas phase residence times. It is found that the gas yield goes up while the char and tar yield decrease with increasing temperature. The gaseous product mainly consists of H 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 S and hydrocarbons such as CH 4, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 6, C 3 H 8, C 4 H 8 and C 4 H 6 with a little other hydrocarbon gases. Its heating value is {{in the range of}} 20 to 37 MJ/Nm 3. Maximum heating value is achieved at a temperature between 700 and 800 °C. The product distribution ratio of gas, tar and char is about 21 : 44 : 35 at 800 °C. The gas yield increases with increasing gas residence time when temperature of the residence zone is higher than 700 °C. The gas heating value shows the opposite trend when the temperature is higher than 800 °C. Calcined dolomite and limestone were used to explore their effect on pyrolyzed product distribution and composition of the gaseous product. It is found that both of them affect the product distribution, but the effect on tar cracking is not obvious when the temperature is lower than 900 °C. It is also found that H 2 S can be absorbed effectively by using either of them. About 57 % sulfur is retained in the char and 6 % in the gas phase. The results indicated that high-energy recovery could not be achieved if fuel gas is the only target product. In view of this, multi-use of the pyrolyzed product is highly recommended. © 2002 Elseveier Science B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFluids venting {{from the}} {{submarine}} {{portion of the}} Marmara Main Fault (part of the North Anatolian Fault system, Turkey) were sampled in Ti bottles deployed by submersible. The fluids consist of mixtures of fault <b>derived</b> <b>gases,</b> fault related cold seep fluids, and ambient seawater; these components can readily be distinguished using the isotopes of He and the He/Ne ratios. 3 He/ 4 He ratios range between 0. 03 ± 0. 1 and 4. 9 ± 0. 4 Ra, indicating that both crustal and mantle derived sources of helium are sampled by the fault. The dominant gas in all the samples analyzed is methane with the abundance of CO 2 below detection (≤ 2 %) in the mantle rich (high 3 He/ 4 He) fluids. This {{is in contrast to}} nearly all mantle derived fluids where the C species are dominated by CO 2. While high CH 4 /CO 2 ratios may reflect organic or inorganic reactions within the crust which reduce mantle derived CO 2 to methane, this is not a priori necessary: we show that simple dilution of mantle fluids with methane produced within local sediments could result in the high 3 He/ 4 He, methane rich gases currently emanating from the fault. This observation is supported by an anticorrelation between 3 He/ 4 He and C/ 3 He, which is consistent with addition of C and 4 He simultaneously to the fluids. The highest 3 He/ 4 He ratios were found in the Tekirdag Basin, {{at the foot of the}} escarpment bordering the Western Sea of Marmara, where seismic data are consistent with the presence of a fault network at depth which could provide conduits permitting deep-seated fluids to rise to the surface. The lack of recent volcanism, or any evidence of underlying magmatism in the area, along with low temperature fluids, strongly suggests that the 3 He-rich helium in these fluids was derived from the mantle itself with the Marmara Main Fault providing a high permeability conduit from the mantle to the surface. Assuming that the mantle source to the fluids originally had a 3 He/ 4 He ratio of 6 Ra, the minimum fluid velocities (considering only vertical transport and no mixing with parentless 4 He) implied by the high 3 He/ 4 He ratios are of the order of 1 – 100 mmyr− 1...|$|E

40|$|Bio-oil，the only liquid {{product in}} fast {{pyrolysis}} process of biomass has {{been expected to}} be very promising in the future, and the technique of pyrolysis of bio-oil has also been attracted considerable attention {{in the field of}} thermal chemical conversion recently. Bio-oil is the complex mixture in the process of depolymerization of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose under non-thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, and it can only be treated as primary liquid fuel not only because of its high oxygen content, viscosity, but also the corrosivity and low calorific value. Many researches have focused on bio-oil’s applications and further treatments. Hydrogenation and catalytic cracking has been attracted much attention in upgrading bio-oil, It’s been found out that heavy component of bio-oil is difficult to crack in the above two cases and in reforming. For the purpose of improving efficiency of bio-oil exploitation and achieving better solutions to problems occurred during bio-oil pyrolysis and gasification,as well as providing necessary data for the design of pyrolysis and gasification equipments, the physicochemical properties analysis of bio-oil produced from wood powder by self-heating biomass fast pyrolysis facility was carried out initially. Then TG, TG-FTIR and tube furnace were employed to investigate pyrolysis characteristics of bio-oil and model compounds of its heavy fractions. Finally, the design of a domestic entrained-flow reactor is introduced for improving efficiency of bio-oil utilization. The thermogravimetric analysis of bio-oil and model compounds of its heavy fractions were carried out under high purify N 2 atmosphere from room temperature to a maximum temperature of 930 ℃ with different heating rates(10 ℃/min～ 30 ℃/min). The results indicated that bio-oil pyrolysis occured in 2 steps. The evaporation of low-boiling point compounds occurred in the first stage,, followed by the cracking of heavy fractions. With increasing heating rate, the starting temperature of weight loss, the maximum velocity of weight loss and its corresponding temperature increased simultaneity; but no difference among the ultimate weight losses was observed. The evolving volatile products during the pyrolysis process were analyzed by FTIR, and the results indicated that: free water, released during the primary stage of bio-oil pyrolysis, flowed by acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones due to their low boiling point. The final products were mainly consisted of H 2 O and CO 2 due to cracking of bio-oil heavy fractions. For the model compounds of heavy fractions of bio-oil, the online analysis showed that hydroxybenzenes had the greatest tendency to decompose, followed by aldehydes and carbohydrate. Levoglucosan pyrolysis occurred in two steps: First, it was dehydrated into small molecules such as aldehydes; and then followed by the cracking of aldehydes. Enhancing heavy fractions cracking such as carbohydrates pyrolysis {{plays an important role in}} improving efficiency of bio-oil usage. Pyrolysis of bio-oil and its model compounds of heavy fractions in tube furnace was carried out over a temperature range of 700 ～ 1000 ℃ under inert atmosphere. The composition and yield of the <b>derived</b> <b>gases</b> as well as distribution of the pyrolyzed product were determined. It is found that with increasing temperature the gas yield goes up. The gaseous product mainly consists of H 2, CO, CO 2 and hydrocarbons such as CH 4 、C 2 H 4 、C 2 H 6. The heating value of eugenol is in the range of 22. 7 ～ 24. 4 MJ/Nm 3, and that of bio-oil is in the range of 22. 7 ～ 24. 4 MJ/Nm 3. 生物质热解制油技术作为生物质热化学转化领域中的前沿技术受到了较多关注。生物油作为初级的液体燃料，既可以将其改质提升成高品位液体燃料，也可以将其气化制备合成气，再合成新的液体燃料。生物油改质主要集中在催化加氢和催化裂解两个方面，其中，生物油重质组分不易在加氢、裂解与重整过程中直接分解，通过研究发现生物油重质组分中多酚的慢速聚合和缩合反应是导致生物油“老化”的重要原因；醛类和糖类等大分子物质在一定条件下聚合反应生成的低聚物导致生物油裂解不完全，因此，对生物油改质的研究尚处在初级阶段。为了提高生物油的利用效率，特别是提高生物油中的不易分解的重质组分的利用效率，更好地处理生物油热解与气化过程中出现的问题，寻找生物油新的利用方法备受关注，而生物油气化制备合成气的技术路线引起了国内外学者的广泛兴趣。 本文首先对由木屑热解得到的生物油进行了各种理化特性的分析，之后利用热重、热重-红外联用、管式炉等对生物油重质组分模型化合物的热解特性进行了实验研究，并与生物油热解特性作对比。 生物油重质组分模型化合物在氮气气氛、不同升温速率下的热重分析实验表明：升温速率的升高使得生物油重质组分模型化合物的初始失重温度、失重峰值温度及对应的最大失重速率均有所增大，升温速率对最终失重量影响较小。采用热重-红外（TG-FTIR）联用技术，对生物油及其重质组分模型化合物热解过程中所释放的气体进行了实时监测，在线分析结果表明：生物油热解反应初始阶段主要析出物为自由水、低沸点的酸类、醇类、醛类、酮类等，随后以H 2 O、CO 2 等为主（主要来自重组分的裂解）。重质组分模型化合物中酚类物质最易热解，其次是醛类物质，糖类物质的热解分为两段。提高生物油的热解效率，关键在提高生物油中糖类等大分子的热解效率。 生物油重质组分模型化合物的管式炉热解实验表明：随热解温度的升高，生物油重质组分模型化合物产气量不断提高，热解气体产物中主要包含H 2 、CO、CO 2 及烃类如CH 4 、C 2 H 4 、C 2 H 6 等,丁香酚的产气低位热值在 22. 7 ～ 24. 4 MJ/Nm 3 之间...|$|E

Through several case history examples, we will show chimney cubes can reveal vertical hydrocarbon migration paths that can be interpreted from their source into reservoir traps {{all the way to the}} surface. We will highlight distinguishing features of chimneys for oil-prone versus gas-prone prospects, and those related to separating active fault migration pathways. Further, we will show chimneys can support charging of shallow reservoirs. Our understanding of the petroleum system can improve by combining gas chimney data with other information. As such a chimney cube can be seen as a new exploration tool...|$|R

40|$|A {{combination}} of the X-ray imaging and SZ measurements of clusters permits an indirect determination of the radial temperature profiles of intracluster gas, which requires no assumption about the dynamical properties and the equation of state for clusters. A comparison of such a <b>derived</b> <b>gas</b> temperature with that given by the X-ray spectral analysis constitutes an effective probe of properties of intracluster gas. Using the available data of 31 clusters in literature, we have performed the first comparison of the central gas temperatures provided by the two methods. The good agreement between these two independent temperature estimates suggests that the distribution of intracluster gas is essentially consistent with isothermality characterized by a mean polytropic index of gamma= 0. 9 +- 0. 1.
