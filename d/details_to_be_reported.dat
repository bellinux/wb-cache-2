40|$|State {{assignment}} {{is a formidable}} task. As designs written in a hardware description language such as Esterel inherently carry more high level information that a register transfer level model, such information can <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> guide the encoding process. A question arises if the high level information alone <b>is</b> strong enough <b>to</b> suggest an efficient state assignment, allowing low-level <b>details</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ignored. This <b>report</b> suggests that with Esterel’s flexibility, most optimization potential is not within the highlevel structure. It appears effective state assignmen...|$|R
40|$|We present neuropsychological {{evidence}} {{demonstrating that}} the binding of form elements into shapes dissociates from the binding of surface <b>detail</b> <b>to</b> shape. Data <b>are</b> <b>reported</b> from a patient with bilateral parietal lesions, GK, who manifests left-side visual extinction along with many illusory conjunctions when asked to discriminate both surface and form information about stimuli. We show that there are effects of grouping on both extinction and illusory conjunctions when the tasks require report of object shape. In contrast, illusory conjunctions involving surface and form information were unaffected by grouping based on shape. In addition, grouping was stronger when forms were presented within the same hemifield than when they appeared in different hemifields, whilst illusory conjunctions of form and colour occurred equally often within and across hemifields. These results support a two-stage account of visual binding: form elements are first bound together locally into shapes, and {{this is followed by}} a second stage of binding in which shapes are integrated with surface details. The second but not the first stage o...|$|R

40|$|The decade {{following}} {{the close of}} the Second World War has been dominated throughout by the clash of political power of the United States and the Soviet Union. Their wartime alliance has crumbled. New, antagonistic alliances have come into existence. The so-called 'EastWest' split, polar in its effect, has forced the admission that prospects of stable peace depend on how successfully bridges can <b>be</b> made <b>to</b> span the gulf. This over-riding and pervading reality has blinded us to the importance of another struggle, which is everywhere mounting in force and intensity and which history may well record as a dominant theme of the twentieth century [...] the world-wide struggle for independence. In some cases it has produced revolution and violence: full-scale wars have been fought in its cause in Indonesia and Indo-China; military engagements have taken place in Kenya and Tunisia; Cypriots and British garrison forces have exchanged fire; Malayans have rioted; and 'incidents' too numerous <b>to</b> <b>detail</b> have <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> from a great variety of countries where political dependence exists.

40|$|Poly (ethylene glycol) -poly (lactic acid) block-copolymer (PEG-PLA) was {{optimized}} and characterized using H-NMR {{spectrum and}} DSC thermogram. This was then {{used for the}} preparation of PEG-PLA nanocapsules containing polyhemoglobin-tyrosinase. Transmission electron microscopic and scanning electron microscopic studies showed round and non-aggregated nanocapsules with a PEG halo around each nanocapsule. Dynamic Light Scattering showed that the Z-average diameter was 65. 2 ± 0. 5 nm (mean ± SEM) and the polydispersity index was 0. 262 ± 0. 002. Factors controlling the diameters included the stirring speed of the reaction mixture {{and the size of}} the PLA block in the PEG-PLA copolymer. At the body temperature of 37 ºC, free tyrosinase lost all its enzyme activity after 8 hours. However, Polyhemoglobin-tyrosinase nanocapcules retained 80 % of its initial activity after 8 hours. This paper contains the first part of our work on the preparation and in vitro characterisation of PEGPLA Polyhemoglobin-tyrosinase nanocapsules. Preliminary result in rats shows that 1 intravenous injection lowers the systemic tyrosine level to 10 - 13 % after 5 minutes. The result of the detailed in vitro study and the preliminary animal study in have led <b>to</b> our ongoing <b>detailed</b> animal research <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported</b> in subsequent papers...|$|R
40|$|Cercosporin is a non-host-specific polyketide toxin {{produced}} by {{many species of}} plant pathogens belonging to the genus Cercospora. This red-pigmented, light-activated toxin is an important pathogenicity determinant for Cercospora species. In this study, we screened 244 bacterial isolates representing 12 different genera for the ability to degrade cercosporin. Cercosporin degradation was determined by screening {{for the presence of}} cleared zones surrounding colonies on cercosporin-containing culture medium and was confirmed by assaying the kinetics of degradation in liquid medium. Bacteria belonging to four different genera exhibited the cercosporin-degrading phenotype. The isolates with the greatest cercosporin-degrading activity belonged to Xanthomonas campestris pv. zinniae and X. campestris pv. pruni. Isolates of these pathovars removed over 90 % of the cercosporin from culture medium within 48 h. Bacterial degradation of red cercosporin was accompanied by a shift in the color of the growth medium to brown and then green. The disappearance of cercosporin was accompanied by the appearance of a transient green product, designated xanosporic acid. Xanosporic acid and its more stable lactone derivative, xanosporolactone, <b>are</b> nontoxic <b>to</b> cercosporin-sensitive fungi and to plant tissue and are labile in the presence of light. <b>Detailed</b> spectroscopic analysis (<b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported</b> in a separate publication) of xanosporolactone revealed that cercosporin loses one methoxyl group and gains one oxygen atom in the bacterial conversion. The resulting chromophore (4, 9 -dihydroxy- 3 -oxaperlylen- 10 H- 10 -one) ha...|$|R
