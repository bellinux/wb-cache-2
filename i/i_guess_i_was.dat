500|$|Grigorieva {{had signed}} with Gibson's music label {{prior to the}} album's release. The music project {{was made by the}} film {{production}} company Icon Entertainment, owned by Gibson. She wrote all of the songs on the album, and received a credit as producer with Gibson listed as executive producer. Grigorieva explained the choice of title for the album, in an interview with IndieLondon, [...] "Well, one of the tracks on the album is called Beautiful Heartache ... everybody has a heartbreak {{at some point in their}} lives. It’s how you deal with it that’s important. So, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drawn to that notion for the album title." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} the LP received {{at the time}} of its release, the remastered CD issued 21 years later was generally well received. In the 2004 Recommended Records catalogue, Cutler wrote that the album had [...] "raised eyebrows at the time (from, as Fred calls them 'progressive music snobs'—of which <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one) for its apparent simplicity and departure from what was then thought of as Fred Style." [...] René van Peer of Leonardo Digital Reviews admitted in 2005 that he was [...] "one of those snobs" [...] and wrote [...] "I am astonished and embarrassed to find how little I grasped back then of what Frith had put into it." [...] Looking at Frith's projects after Cheap at Half the Price made it clear that what he did on the album was not a departure from his musical experiments, as people saw it at the time, but rather a part of it. Van Peer said (in retrospect) that Cheap at Half the Price [...] "bursts with inventiveness, and eradiates [...] the irrepressible joy of playful creativity".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> able, {{although}} my head aches a good bit, I {{can tell you}} that. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> much obliged for {{what you have done}} for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was arrested}} for {{political}} reasons and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> set free for political reasons, my arrest was with the objective purpose of sabotaging the talks of peace" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll get out now. It's real nice, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too heavy," [...] said Bab, as {{the face}} before her got redder and redder, and the breath {{began to come}} in puffs.|$|R
500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons. The dispute was not {{revealed}} to the press at first; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because {{she was tired of}} flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions. It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise, not only because she was tired of the traveling, but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. Maggie Roswell told The Denver Post that [...] "they offered me a $150 raise. I mean, that's lint in Fox's pocket. But Fox wanted to prove a point, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> flying myself back and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting. I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back. But now I'm busy doing other things." [...] She further added that [...] "I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don't think the money I asked for was exorbitant. I wasn't asking for what other cast members make. I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel. If they'd flown me in, I'd still be working." [...] At that point, the six main cast members of the show were paid [...] $125,000 per episode. As a result of Maggie Roswell's departure, the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily". Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Maggie Roswell's other characters.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
6000|$|... "How fare you neighbour?" [...] said a pale {{young woman}} {{carrying}} an infant to the comely dame. [...] "Here's an awful crowd, surely. The {{women will be}} fighting and tearing to get in, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> much afeard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a terrible}} disgrace--to go to prison," [...] he answered, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "But my father {{had to go through}} it, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> worse than he is." [...] He heaved a deep sigh. [...] "Well, I'll try to stand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm not smart. Some folks think I'm stupid. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> But <b>I</b> know a {{few things}} that were wonderful. Cap'n Bill may know more'n I do--a good deal more--but I'm sure he can't know the same things. Say, what's your name?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Eisner in 2005 {{recalled}} his studio as [...] "a friendly shop, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the same age}} as the youngest guys there. We all got along. The only ones who ever got into a hassle were George Tuska and Bob Powell. Powell was kind of a wiseguy and made remarks about other people in the shop. One day, George had enough of it, got up, and punched out Bob Powell". Eisner on another occasion said his partnership with Everett M. [...] "Busy" [...] Arnold created tensions when Arnold wanted to hire Powell separately: ...|$|E
2500|$|Mara was {{inspired}} to act by seeing musical theatre and classic movies, like Gone with the Wind (1939), Rebecca (1940), and Bringing Up Baby (1938), with her mother. [...] She also {{wanted to be like}} her sister, Kate Mara, a professional actress. Mara resisted pursuing acting as a child, stating to The Journal News that [...] "it never seemed that honorable to me, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always afraid that I might fail." [...] Her first and only role in high school was Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, which she got after being signed up to audition by a friend. [...] Mara acted in a few student films while at NYU, and then began her career in acting, first auditioning at the age of nineteen.|$|E
2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> (<b>I</b> <b>was)</b> more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Hem—why, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not {{far out of}} the way,” {{returned}} Elnathan, endeavoring {{to imitate}} {{the expression of the}} other’s countenance, by looking jocular. “Latin is a queer language, gentlemen; now <b>I</b> rather <b>guess</b> there <b>is</b> no one in the room, except Squire Lippet, who can believe that ‘Far. Av.’ means oatmeal, in English.” ...|$|R

My heart, Mr. Donovan, {{will remain}} forever in his grave. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> poor company, Mr. Donovan, but I cannot take any {{interest}} in no one. I should not care {{to keep you from}} gayety and your friends who can smile and entertain you. Perhaps you would prefer to walk back to the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then? Oh! Then. Oh yes, sure, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared, all right!... Say, we {{got that}} seat padded so she's darn {{comfortable}} now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, I'm {{sorry for}} what I said to you the other day an' for--for everythin' else. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit lit up. I beg pardon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Kind of. Like to read romances and stuff." [...] He {{stared at}} Mittyford beseechingly. [...] "But, say--say, I wonder why--Somehow, I haven't enjoyed Oxford {{and the rest}} of the places like I ought to. See, I'd always thought I'd be simply nutty about the quatrangles and stuff, but I'm afraid they're too highbrow for me. I hate to own up, but {{sometimes}} I wonder if I can get away with this traveling stunt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{never did}} when I was a boy, but--well--I {{did have a}} couple of fights when I was on the cattle-boat and in England. Neither of them {{amounted}} to very much, though, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared stiff!" ...|$|E
5000|$|As for his {{own role}} in the project, and its {{relation}} to the dispute over who was responsible for the design, Bethe later said that: After the H-bomb was made, reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, <b>I</b> think it <b>is</b> more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the midwife.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>are</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too, Anne, for Rachel {{often has}} that very effect on me. I {{sometimes}} think she'd {{have more of}} an influence for good, as you say yourself, if she didn't keep nagging people to do right. There {{should have been a}} special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn't talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well. There isn't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work." ...|$|R
5000|$|Claudia Mitchell-Kernan, {{recognized}} as the first scholar to interject African American women's signifyin' practices into broader linguistic discourses, recorded the following example. Grace is pregnant and beginning to show, but has not informed her sister yet. Her sister, seemingly unaware of the situation, comments on her weight gain:"Grace (noncommittally): Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> putting on a little weight.

6000|$|Her father laughed out. [...] "Mother {{been telling}} you? Well, I WAS pretty blue last night; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more scared than hurt. How'd {{you like to}} go to the theatre to-night? Sellers at the Park. Heigh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In one sense," [...] drawled the {{representative}} of the Sun. [...] "I was too late to save the man, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in time to hear something of importance. I heard the dead man denounce his assassin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jordan, with a snap in {{his dark}} eyes. [...] "Knew he was going all the while. Played me for a sucker. Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one, or I wouldn't have given him an option of selling me to Merril." ...|$|E
