5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E

25|$|The terms “Varangian” and “Rus” can {{sometimes}} be used interchangeably but there are slight <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> Both refer to the peoples of Scandinavian descent who settled in the Dnieper-Volga region {{during and after the}} 8th century. The Varangians are a more clearly definable group. They were Scandinavians in Eastern Europe who were often associated with Byzantium and the Byzantine emperor’s Varangian Guard. These mercenaries were almost entirely men who either returned to their Scandinavian homeland or married into the local Slavic culture. The term “Rus” is more difficult to define. The Rus were more inclined to settle in towns with their families. The term “Rus” is sometimes used in primary sources to describe Slavic peoples as well as Scandinavians. Its definition becomes clearer later in the period when it developed from the name of a people to the name of a political entity and area of land.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{academic}} achievement and social adjustment of mentally retarded students who have had five years of special education with mentally retarded students who have had no special education. This comparison was made to determine if there is a significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups. <b>The</b> present study was not undertaken to defend or attack special education classes. The study was designed to determine to what extent academic and social <b>differences</b> existed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups. It is hoped the results of this study can be used in planning programs for the educable mentally retarded children in the Weber County Schools. The writer proposes the following hypotheses: 1. There will be no significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups in reading. 2. There will be no significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups in arithmetic. 3. There will be no significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups in language. 4. There will be no significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups in attitude toward school. 5.

25|$|The LDS Church shares various teachings {{with other}} {{branches}} of Christianity. These include {{a belief in}} the Bible (subject to an acknowledgement that it is imperfect), the divinity of Jesus, and his atonement and resurrection. LDS theology also includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone, restorationism, millennialism, continuationism, penal substitution, and a form of apostolic succession. The practices of baptism by immersion and the eucharist (referred to as the sacrament) are also held in common. However, the Catholic Church considers doctrinal <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> to be so great that it will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as it will baptism by other Christian groups, such as the Eastern Orthodox and Protestant churches. The LDS Church does not accept baptisms performed in any other churches, as it teaches that baptism is only valid when it is conducted through proper priesthood authority.|$|E

500|$|Both East Slavs and Byzantines {{consistently}} made a {{clear distinction}} between Varangians and Kylfings, and Byzantines distinguished between them {{in the same manner as}} they separated Franks from Saracens. According to Holm such separations are indicative of clear ethnic <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> Additionally, both East Slavic and Byzantine sources explicitly associate the Varangians with Baltic region, which they called Varangia, and in Arabic, the Baltic Sea was called Bahr Varank, i.e. the [...] "Varangian Sea". There are no comparable connections when they mention the Kylfings. Another difference is the fact that the Byzantine sources connect the word varangoi with rhōs in order to make it clear that the rhōs-varangoi and the varangoi originate in Baltic just like the rhōs, but do not establish the same associations for the koulpingoi.|$|E

In 1819 the town had a steam-operated wool carding and spinning factory, a brewery, distillery, vineyards, and a winery, but not all visitors were impressed with the growing communist town on the frontier. The Society also had visitors from another communal religious society, the Shakers. In 1816 meetings between the Shakers and Harmonists considered a possible union of the two societies, but [...] religious <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> halted the union.
