Contamination problems increase when ages of relevant facilities, such as oil storage tanks and pipelines, increase over time. The <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Legislation</b> concerning soil pollution has led to the need of efficient techniques able to restore the polluted ground. Unfortunately, these techniques are expensive. Bioremediation of hydrocarbon polluted soils has been recognized as an efficient, economic and environmentally sound treatment. Particularly biostimulation and bioaugmentation are being studied in labs. A lot of studies tried to determine which method is the most efficient, but the conclusions diverge. Moreover, conditions are different in labs and contaminated sites...|$|E

40|$|There {{are four}} basic tendencies {{presented}} in the paper: dynamics, expansion, publicization as well as institutionalization. They all corresopnd to the <b>evolution</b> lines <b>of</b> modern agricultural law. Each of them defines slightly different aspect <b>of</b> agricultural <b>legislation,</b> whereas all <b>of</b> them jointly render an up-to-date image of the agricultural law “on the move”. The dynamics of agricultural law characterizes the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this <b>legislation</b> field {{from the perspective of}} the law sources, while expansion formulates the development of subject regulation, publicization denotes the method (manner) of influence, and institutionalization – law instruments being in use. The Author, with reference to the tendencies mentioned above, presents the <b>evolution</b> discrepancies <b>of</b> agrcultural law: between universalism and particularism of law regulations, between agrarisation and disagrarisation of social relationships within agriculture, and also between tradition and modernity. The result of the discussed tendencies despite all the mentioned discrepancies, is the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> law regulations referring to agriculture. The decrease of agricultural law development in one of its sections has been compensated by a general progress and even creating of a new law section...|$|R
40|$|The work briefly {{reviews the}} {{economic}} reasons {{to support an}} approach to environmental protection {{based on the principle}} of «command and control», alternative to market mechanisms. Through a synthetic examination <b>of</b> the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the Italian <b>legislation,</b> it moves on to examine the state of implementation in Italy of the «Habitats» and «Birds» directives, with regard to marine environment and the related issues. Following the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>legislation,</b> special attention is paid to the issues related to the management of marine protected areas, in relation to the different standards underlying their establishment, with a focus on the problems concerning conflicts of competence insurgents, particularly in relations between central government and regions. In relation to the particular case of the institution of the Sites of Community Interest in the marine environment (marine SCIs), it’s been developed the case study of the region of Sardinia, which was applied for the first time, through the establishment of marine SCIs overlapping to MPA’s, as an attempt to centralize the management of the two different systems of protection in a single management body. A critical analysis of this approach shows that the establishment of marine SCIs experienced in Sardinia does not meet the requirements of the Community, including those relating to the indications issued by the Commission, {{on the basis of the}} case law of the European Court of Justice on the subject...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} long {{recognised}} {{that the role}} and effects of patents vary considerably across industries. This observation raises immediately to important sets of questions. First, can we document systematically this heterogeneity and can we provide a conceptual framework for explaining this diversity? Second, how should the patent system deal with these differences? Should patent laws be tailored to industry specificities or should they be kept as homogeneous as possible? In this paper, we focus mainly on the first question and only tangentially on the second one. In particular, we try to review {{what is known about}} the inter-sectoral differences in the uses of patents and their more recent evolution and we suggest that such diversity is just to expected as it depends on complex interactions between the properties of technologies, the nature of markets and the patterns of competition, the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> and its interpretation. ...|$|E
40|$|Legislators, {{designers}} of legal information systems, {{as well as}} citizens face often problems due to the interdependence of the laws and {{the growing number of}} references needed to interpret them. Quantifying this complexity is not an easy task. In this paper, we introduce the "Legislation Network" as a novel approach to address related problems. We have collected an extensive data set of a more than 60 -year old legislation corpus, as published in the Official Journal of the European Union, and we further analysed it as a complex network, thus gaining insight into its topological structure. Among other issues, we have performed a temporal analysis of the evolution of the Legislation Network, as well as a robust resilience test to assess its vulnerability under specific cases that may lead to possible breakdowns. Results are quite promising, showing that our approach can lead towards an enhanced explanation in respect to the structure and <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> properties...|$|E
40|$|Human {{trafficking}} is a transnational {{issue that}} violates {{human rights and}} is increasingly associated with organized crime. Since {{the turn of the}} century and the passing of the United Nations Palermo Convention Protocols, combating human trafficking has required a coordinated and cooperative effort between local, regional, state, and international institutions. By studying the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> and polices of the United Kingdom and France, a more detailed look is presented on how their efforts have positively contributed to the combat of human trafficking. Ultimately, their efforts have combined two approaches: 1) Human rights based approach that reflects the protection of victims and the human rights issues involved with human trafficking. 2) An approach that reflects the criminal nature of human trafficking and its association with organized crime. The convergence of these two approaches to combat human trafficking is also represented in the multitude of European security institutions and the role that both the United Kingdom and France have played in those institutions.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of low-cost generic drugs upon patent expiry {{is an extremely}} contentious issue, with public health activists accusing pharmaceutical companies of profiteering {{at the expense of}} public health provisions, whereas pharmaceutical companies insist that stronger and lengthier protection for their intellectual property rights is necessary for them to sustain investments in research and development. This study is an overview of the transition from patent monopolies to free markets, studying the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> and the mechanisms of introducing competition from generic pharmaceuticals once a patent expires. The TRIPS agreement, due to come into force in January 2005, has major implications for countries that have not yet introduced intellectual property legislation, as it will require them to introduce a minimum standard of patent and data protection legislation. This study looks at the possibilities available to such countries regarding the transition process, and the effects that different legislative measures could have on their economies. It also makes some recommendations regarding measures that will facilitate the fastest and cheapest possible {{introduction of}} generic drugs following the expiry of a patent...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the cultural, political, ethnic and economic forces that have shaped the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> media <b>legislation</b> in Fiji and the evident impacts on journalism and society. The article argues that despite Fiji’s British colonial heritage and its smooth transition to democracy after Independence in 1970, the spectre <b>of</b> stricter <b>legislation</b> {{has been a constant}} threat. This threat finally materialised in the post- 2006 coup period, when media-related laws underwent a major overhaul, including the promulgation of the punitive Media Industry Development Decree 2010, which was later ‘preserved’ under the 2013 Constitution despite being labelled ‘undemocratic’. The 2006 coup leader Voreqe Bainimarama, who was decisively voted back into power as Prime Minister in the 2014 General Election, justified the media reforms in the name of social stability and progress.
