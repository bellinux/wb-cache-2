The region averages fewer than 150frost-free days per year, and the local climate swings wildly from years of plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought. The heavy influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation contributes to the canyon's fickle climate.|$|E

5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last {{decade and a}} half under a {{communist}} regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he <b>endures</b> as a largely forgotten author, {{with the possible exception of}} his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E

5000|$|His sufferings were in {{the place}} of the penalty, not the penalty itself. They were a {{substitution}} for the penalty, and were, therefore, strictly and properly vicarious, and were not the identical sufferings which the sinner would himself have <b>endured.</b> There are some things in the penalty of the Law, which the Lord Jesus did not <b>endure,</b> and which a substitute or a vicarious victim could not <b>endure.</b> Remorse of conscience {{is a part of the}} inflicted penalty of the Law, and will be a vital part of the sufferings of the sinner in hell—but the Lord Jesus did not <b>endure</b> that. Eternity of sufferings is an essential part of the penalty of the Law—but the Lord Jesus did not suffer forever. Thus, there are numerous sorrows connected with the consciousness of personal guilt, which the Lord Jesus did not and cannot <b>endure.</b> —Albert Barnes ...|$|R
5|$|Rupert D'Oyly Carte {{refreshed}} {{the opera}} company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, {{as well as}} provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became {{too much for the}} company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain <b>endures.</b>|$|E

Although Susanna <b>endures</b> his mental cruelty, she cannot forgive Edwin for blinding her faithful, mute stableboy (Shashi Malviya) with a whip. Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip {{with the help of}} Susanna's faithful maid (Usha Uthup), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy.|$|E

5|$|The most {{well known}} actors {{to have been}} born in the Rhondda are Sir Stanley Baker and {{brothers}} Donald and Glyn Houston. Baker was born in Ferndale and starred in films such as The Cruel Sea (1953) and Richard III (1955), though it was as actor/producer of the 1964 film Zulu that his legacy <b>endures.</b> The Houston brothers were both born in Tonypandy, with Donald gaining better success as a film actor, with memorable roles in The Blue Lagoon (1949) and Ealing's Dance Hall (1950). Glyn Houston acted primarily in British B-Movies, and was better known as a television actor.|$|E
5|$|Though much of {{the mythology}} {{surrounding}} the patrol and the site has dissipated in the national consciousness since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, World's View <b>endures</b> as a tourist attraction to this day.

5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing chaos and horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, {{the souls of}} the knights are freed from their torment, and the people celebrate as all traces of evil that plagued Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens of the Shrine use their powers and create a barrier, which is strong enough for the Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light <b>endures</b> in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Casimir IV's successor, John I Albert, {{wanted to}} grant Moldavia to his younger brother, Sigismund, but Stephen's {{diplomacy}} {{prevented him from}} invading Moldavia for years. John Albert broke into Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă, but had to acknowledge {{the loss of the}} two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler, Bogdan III, played {{an active role in the}} government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also <b>endures</b> as a cult figure in Moldovenism. After the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as Stephen the Great and Holy (Ștefan cel Mare și Sfânt).|$|E

Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats.|$|E
