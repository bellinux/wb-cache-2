25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E

These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and {{can also be used to}} great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense, such as a <b>file</b> <b>cabinet,</b> or a deadly projectile, such as a gasoline can or buzzsaw blade.|$|E

5000|$|Within the United States, {{the primary}} {{standard}} for vertical <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. [...] BIFMA used {{to maintain a}} separate Standard X5.2 for lateral <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> A-A-3186and A-A-3187respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject {{may be found in}} the article on classified information in the United States.|$|R

Vice Principal Clemmons (Duane Daniels) calls Veronica {{into his office and}} gives her {{detention}} for having keys to his <b>file</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's permanent file and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who might have known her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was [...] "vicious". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction is rife with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne.|$|E

2500|$|Local {{legend has}} it that Oz, also known as The Emerald City, was {{inspired}} by a prominent castle-like building in the community of Castle Park near Holland, Michigan, where Baum lived during the summer. The yellow brick road was derived from a road at that time paved by yellow bricks. These bricks were located in Peekskill, New York, where Baum attended the Peekskill Military Academy. Baum scholars often refer to the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (the [...] "White City") as an inspiration for the Emerald City. Other legends suggest that the inspiration came from the Hotel Del Coronado near San Diego, California. Baum was a frequent guest at the hotel and had written several of the Oz books there.

Asked about this, Hawaiian Department of Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo explained that Hawaii stopped issuing the longer [...] "Certificate" [...] in 2001 when their birth records were [...] "put into electronic files for consistent reporting", and therefore Hawaii [...] "does not have a short-form or long-form certificate".

2500|$|MyFamily.com allowed {{members to}} create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still {{available}} but no further enhancements are planned. [...] After {{three years of}} a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, [...] "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0. Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'. Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given. Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced. Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since {{the loss of the}} Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved. As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued. Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014. Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired. At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, <b>File</b> <b>Cabinet</b> documents, family recipes, and all other information.|$|E

50|$|To use {{the example}} of a {{physical}} <b>file</b> <b>cabinet,</b> if the separate drawers in the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> are represented as the highest level of sub-directories in the file system or system prompt, then the room the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most operating systems, files can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories.

In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of filing cabinets are vertical files and lateral files. A vertical <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the cabinet. A lateral <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files, which go on shelves. In the United States, file cabinets are usually built to accommodate 8.5 × 11 paper, and in other countries, filing cabinets are often designed to hold other sizes of paper, such as A4 paper.|$|E
