Utilizing domain inactivation and analytical mass mutants in conjunction with rapid-quench, mass spectrometry, and a probabilistic kinetic model, we have elucidated the pre-steady-state intra- and interchain rates and the corresponding flux of the acylation of L-Thr onto VibF. Although the intra rate is significantly faster than the inter rate, the data are most consistent with an even flux of covalent substrate loading where neither pathway dominates. These pre-steady-state results confirm previous steady-state <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> mutant <b>complementation</b> studies of VibF.

40|$|Secretory {{proteins}} {{exit the}} ER in transport vesicles that fuse to form vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) which move along microtubule tracks to the Golgi apparatus. Using the well-characterized in vitro approach {{to study the}} properties of Golgi membranes, we determined whether the Golgi enzyme NAGT I is transported to ER/Golgi intermediates. Secretory cargo was arrested at distinct steps of the secretory pathway of a glycosylation mutant cell line, and <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> of the glycosylation defect was determined. Complementation yield increased after ER exit of secretory cargo and was optimal when transport was blocked at an ER/Golgi intermediate step. The rapid drop of the complementation yield as secretory cargo progresses into the stack suggests that Golgi enzymes are preferentially targeted to ER/Golgi intermediates and not to membranes of the Golgi stack. Two mechanisms for <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> could be distinguished due to their different sensitivities to brefeldin A (BFA). Transport occurred either by direct fusion of preexisting transport intermediates with ER/Golgi intermediates, or it occurred as a BFA-sensitive and most likely COP I–mediated step. Direct fusion of ER/Golgi intermediates with cisternal membranes of the Golgi stack was not observed under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The plasmid-determined {{inducible}} alkane hydroxylase of Pseudomonas putida resolved into particulate and soluble fractions. Spinach reductase {{and spinach}} ferredoxin could replace the soluble hydroxylase component. Two alkane hydroxylase mutants show <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> (S. Benson and J. Shapiro, J. Bacteriol., 123 : 759 - 760, 1975) : one, alk- 7, lacks an active soluble component and the other, alk- 181, lacks an active particulate component. Together with previous results on a particulate alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (Benson and Shapiro, J. Bacteriol., 126 : 794 - 798, 1976), these results {{allowed us to}} assay three plasmid-determined inducible activities: soluble alkane hydroxylase (alkA+), particulate alkane hydroxylase (alkB+), and particulate alcohol dehydrogenase (alkC+). Growth tests and <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> assays revealed three groups of plasmid mutations that block expression of alkane hydroxylase activity: alkA, which so far includes only the alk- 7 mutation; alkB, which includes alk- 181 and 11 other mutations; and a pleiotropic-negative class, which includes nine mutations that lead to loss of alkA+, alkB+, and alkC+ activities.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of aptamer function in bacteria would help to establish simple model systems for screening RNA–protein interactions within an intracellular context. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I mutants (Pol Its) fail to grow at 37 °C unless an exogenous DNA polymerase such as HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is expressed within the cell. Here, we show that four RNA aptamers that inhibit HIV- 1 RT <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> block <b>complementation</b> by HIV- 1 RT when expressed in vivo. No other essential functions are impaired by aptamer expression at either temperature. Intracellular aptamer RNA concentrations from induced cultures were measured to range from 76 to 180 nM, which is comparable with exogenously expressed HIV- 1 RT levels in these cells. RT polymerase activity was reduced to background levels in cell-free extracts prepared from cultures expressing both HIV- 1 RT and the 70. 28 aptamer, compared with extracts from cultures expressing HIV- 1 RT alone. Intracellularly expressed RNA aptamers can thus be used to generate conditional null mutants in bacteria by titrating an essential protein...|$|R
40|$|HetR is an {{essential}} regulator of heterocyst development in cyanobacteria. Many mutations in HetR render Anabaena incapable of nitrogen fixation. The protein binds to a DNA palindrome upstream of hetP and other genes. We have determined the crystal structures of HetR complexed with palindromic DNA targets, 21, 23, and 29 bp at 2. 50 -, 3. 00 -, and 3. 25 -Å resolution, respectively. The highest-resolution structure shows fine details of specific protein–DNA interactions. The lower-resolution structures with longer DNA duplexes have similar interaction patterns and show how the flap domains interact with DNA in a sequence nonspecific fashion. Fifteen of 15 protein–DNA contacts predicted {{on the basis of}} the structure were confirmed by single amino acid mutations that abolished binding <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> and <b>complementation</b> <b>in</b> vivo.

In this work we have produced the recombinant protein and determined that gp 9 is a stable homotrimer and active in <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> assay completing the defective phage particles which lack gp 9. According to CD-spectroscopy data, the gp 9 polypeptide chain contains 65 - 73 % β-structure and 11 - 16 % α-helical segments, this being in good agreement with secondary structure prediction results. Additionally, we have constructed a set of plasmid vectors for expression of gp 9 deletion mutants.

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between pre-mRNA splicing and the nuclear matrix by using an in vivo system that we have developed. Plasmids containing the inducible herpesvirus tk gene promoter linked to an intron-containing segment of the rabbit beta-globin gene were transfected into HeLa cells, and then the promoter was transactivated by infection with a TK- virus. Northern analysis revealed that the globin pre-mRNA and all its splicing intermediates and products are associated with the nuclear matrix prepared from such transfected cells. When the nuclear matrix was incubated with a HeLa cell in vitro splicing extract in the presence of ATP, the amount of matrix-associated precursor progressively decreased without a temporal lag in the reaction, with a corresponding increase in free intron lariat. Thus, most of the events of the splicing process (endonucleolytic cuts and branching) occur in this <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> reaction. However, ligation of exons cannot be monitored in this system because of the abundance of preexisting mature mRNA. Since the matrix is not a self-splicing entity, whereas the in vitro splicing system cannot process efficiently deproteinized matrix RNA, we conclude from our <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> results (which can be reproduced by using micrococcal nuclease-treated splicing extract) that the nuclear matrix preparation retains parts of preassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes that have the potential to function when supplemented with soluble factors (presumably other than most of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins known to participate in splicing) present in the HeLa cell extract...|$|E

CCN 1 is homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CLF 1 gene, which is required for pre-mRNA splicing, cell cycle progression, and DNA replication, and to the Drosophila melanogaster crn gene, which is involved in neurogenesis. CLF 1 complemented the Ts phenotype of B- 4551. CCN 1, however, failed to rescue the clf 1 mutant in S. cerevisiae.

However, the presence of an m 7 GpppG or GpppG cap was deleterious to splicing, most likely due to competition for the m 7 G cap binding proteins. No significant reduction in splicing or E complex formation was detected with U 1 snRNPs reconstituted from U 1 snRNA lacking the RNA binding sites of the U 1 - 70 K or U 1 -A protein (i. e., stem-loop I and II, respectively). Complementation studies with purified HeLa U 1 snRNPs lacking subsets of the U 1 -specific proteins demonstrated a role for the U 1 -C, but not U 1 -A, protein in the formation and/or stabilization of early splicing complexes.

U 2 or U 5 snRNP cores are first reconstituted from purified native snRNP core proteins and snRNA in the absence of cellular extract and are subsequently added to splicing extracts depleted of either U 2 or U 5 snRNP. When snRNPs reconstituted with HeLa U 2 or U 5 snRNA were added to U 2 - or U 5 -depleted nuclear extract, splicing was complemented. Addition of naked snRNA, on the other hand, did not restore splicing, demonstrating that the core proteins are essential for both U 2 and U 5 snRNP functions in splicing. Hybrid U 2 or U 5 snRNPs, reconstituted with core proteins isolated from U 1 or U 2 snRNPs, were equally active in splicing complementation, indicating that the snRNP core proteins are functionally interchangeable.

We have previously isolated a unique plant SR protein (SR 45) with atypical domain organization. However, the biological and molecular functions of this novel SR protein are not known. Here, we report biological and molecular functions of this protein. Using an <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> splicing <b>complementation</b> assay, we showed that SR 45 functions as an essential splicing factor. Furthermore, the alternative splicing pattern of transcripts of several other SR genes was altered in a mutant, sr 45 - 1, suggesting that the observed phenotypic abnormalities in sr 45 - 1 are likely due to altered levels of SR protein isoforms, which in turn modulate splicing of other pre-mRNAs. sr 45 - 1 exhibited developmental abnormalities, including delayed flowering, narrow leaves and altered number of petals and stamens. The late flowering phenotype was observed under both long days and short days and was rescued by vernalization. FLC, a key flowering repressor, is up-regulated in sr 45 - 1 demonstrating that SR 45 influences the autonomous flowering pathway. Changes in the alternative splicing of SR genes and the phenotypic defects in the mutant were rescued by SR 45 cDNA, further confirming that the observed defects in the mutant are {{due to the lack of}} SR 45.

To quantitatively understand the different kinetics and how changes in affinity of a protein pair affect the light emission in the assay, a mathematical model of the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> firefly luciferase <b>complementation</b> assay was constructed. Analysis of the model finds that the change in kinetics is caused by rapid dissociation of the protein pair, low adenylation rate of luciferin, and increased affinity of adenylated luciferin to the enzyme. The model suggests that the affinity of the protein pair has an exponential relationship with the light detected in the assay. This relationship causes the change of affinity in a protein pair to be underestimated.

The citL 22 mutant is severely deficient in lipoamide dehydrogenase activity, and, as a result, lacks activity for both the alpha-ketoglutarate and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes. Thus, the E 3 components of both complexes are identical. The citL 22 mutation maps between ura and metC on the chromosome...|$|E
40|$|The DnaK {{system from}} Thermus thermophilus (DnaK(Tth)) {{exhibits}} pronounced differences in organisation and regulation to its mesophile counterpart from Escherichia coli (DnaK(Eco)). While the ATPase cycle of DnaK(Eco) is tightly {{regulated by the}} concerted action of the two cofactors DnaJ(Eco) and GrpE(Eco), the DnaK(Tth) system features an imbalance in this cochaperone mediated regulation. GrpE(Tth) considerably accelerates the ATP/ADP exchange, but DnaJ(Tth) only slightly stimulates ATPase activity, {{believed to be a}} key step for chaperone activity of DnaK(Eco). By <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>complementation</b> assays, we could not detect significant ATPase-stimulation of orthologous DnaJ(Tth). DnaKEco or DnaJ(Eco). DnaK(Tth) -complexes as compared to the DnaK(Eco) system, although they were nevertheless active in luciferase refolding experiments. Assistance of protein recovery by DnaK thus seems to be uncoupled of the magnitude of DnaJ mediated ATPase-stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Myoblast fusion is {{essential}} to muscle tissue development yet remains poorly understood. N-cadherin, like other cell surface adhesion molecules, has been implicated by others in muscle formation based on its pattern of expression and on inhibition of myoblast aggregation and fusion by antibodies or peptide mimics. Mice rendered homozygous null for N-cadherin revealed the general importance of the molecule in early development, but did not test a role in skeletal myogenesis, since the embryos died before muscle formation. To test genetically the proposed role of N-cadherin in myoblast fusion, we successfully obtained N-cadherin null primary myoblasts in culture. Fusion of myoblasts expressing or lacking N-cadherin {{was found to be}} equivalent, both <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> by intracistronic <b>complementation</b> of lacZ and in vivo by injection into the muscles of adult mice. An essential role for N-cadherin in mediating the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor was also excluded. These methods for obtaining genetically homozygous null somatic cells from adult tissues should have broad applications. Here, they demonstrate clearly that the putative fusion molecule, N-cadherin, is not essential for myoblast fusion...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{isolates}} from {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) patients undergo remarkable phenotypic divergence over time, in-cluding loss of pigmentation, hemolysis, motility, and quorum sensing and emergence of antibiotic hypersusceptibility and/or auxotrophism. With prolonged antibiotic treatment and steady decline in lung function in chronically infected patients, the di-vergent characteristics associated with CF isolates {{have traditionally been}} regarded as “adapted/unusual virulence, ” despite the degenerative nature of these adaptations. We examined the phenotypic and genotypic diversity in clonally related isogenic strains of P. aeruginosa from individual CF patients. Our observations support a novel model of intra-airway pseudomonal syn-trophy and accompanying loss of virulence. A 2007 calendar year collection of CF P. aeruginosa isolates (n 525) from 103 CF patients yielded in vitroMICs of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP, which typically has no activity against P. aerugi-nosa) ranging from 0. 02 to> 32 g/ml (median, 1. 5). Coisolation of clonally related SMX-TMP-susceptible and-resistant P. aeruginosa strains from the same host was common (57 %), as were isogenic coisolates with mutations in efflux gene determi-nants (mexR,mexAB-oprM, andmexZ) and genes governing DNAmismatch repair (mutL andmutS). In this cohort, complete <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> growth <b>complementation</b> between auxotrophic and prototrophic P. aeruginosa isogenic strains was evident and concur-rent with the coding sequence mosaicism in resistance determinants. These observations suggest that syntrophic clonal strains evolve in situ in an organized colonial structure. We propose that P. aeruginosa adopts a multicellular lifestyle in CF patients due to host selection of an energetically favorable, less-virulent microbe restricted within and symbiotic with the airway over th...|$|R
40|$|The {{biochemistry}} of {{interallelic complementation}} within the Salmonella typhimurium hisD gene was investigated by <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> protein <b>complementation</b> of mutant histidinol dehydrogenases (EC 1. 1. 1. 23). Double-mutant strains were constructed containing the hisO 1242 (constitutive overproducer) attenuator mutation and selected hisDa or hisDb mutations. Extracts from such hisDa 986 and hisDb 1799 mutant cells {{failed to show}} histidinol dehydrogenase activity but complemented to produce active enzyme. Inactive mutant histidinol dehydrogenases were purified {{from each of the}} two mutants by ion-exchange chromatography. Complementation by the purified mutant proteins required the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol and MnCl 2, and protein-protein titrations indicated that heterodimers were strongly preferred in mixtures of the complementary mutant enzymes. Neither mutant protein showed negative complementation with wild-type enzyme. The Vmax for hybrid histidinol dehydrogenase was 11 % of that for native enzyme, with only minor changes in Km values for substrate or coenzyme. Both purified mutant proteins failed to catalyze NAD-NADH exchange reactions reflective of the first catalytic step of the two-step reaction. The inactive enzymes bound 54 Mn 2 + weakly or not at all in the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol, in contrast to wild-type enzyme which bound 54 Mn 2 + to 0. 6 sites per monomer under the same conditions. The mutant proteins, like wild-type histidinol dehydrogenase, behaved as dimers on analytical gel filtration chromatography, but dissociated to form monomers in the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol. This effect of 2 -mercaptoethanol was prevented by low levels of MnCl 2. It thus appears that mutant histidinol dehydrogenase molecules bind metal ion poorly. The complementation procedure may allow for formation of a functional Mn 2 +-binding site, perhaps at the subunit interface...|$|R
