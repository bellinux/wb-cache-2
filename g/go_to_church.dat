5|$|Netball {{plays an}} {{important}} role on the social life of Cook Island women. For their social activities, rather than go to bars, they play netball and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> Netball games are most often played on Saturdays during the winter months from April to August, though games can be played throughout the year. Female players who make the national team are treated like minor celebrities.|$|E

5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that {{failed to do so}} were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E

5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> As a child, she often watched films {{with her mother and}} it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theme is}} the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Hester {{chooses not to}} conform to their rules and beliefs. Hester was {{rejected}} by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor.

25|$|Roman Catholicism {{has long}} been the main {{religion}} of Spain, and although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class. Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam, Judaism, and evangelical Christianity is also recognised in law. According to a June 2016 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research about 70% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 2% other faith, and about 25% identify with no religion. Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services. This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or never <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church,</b> 16% <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> some times a year, 9% some time per month and 15% every Sunday or multiple times per week. Recent polls and surveys have revealed that atheists and agnostics comprise anywhere from 20% to 27% of the Spanish population.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{number was}} claimed by Victor Schnirelmann, for whom between a quarter {{and a half}} of the Mari either worship the Pagan gods or are adherents of Neopagan groups.

25|$|My sister's {{disposition}} was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her {{tendency to}} seclusion; except to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> {{or take a}} walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.|$|E
25|$|At this time, the viceregal {{government}} decided {{to renovate the}} deteriorated palace in 1777, giving the work to Francisco Antonio Guerrero y Torres, putting a lien on the building's rental income. The Aztec serpent's head that serves and the building's impressive cornerstone was probably uncovered during these renovations. Cost of remodeling the house was 130,000 pesos. During this time, the palace chapel was added, built between 1778 and 1781. At that time, it was common to attend Mass everyday {{but at the same}} time upper-class women were generally not permitted to walk on the streets to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> Many large mansions and palaces, therefore, had their own chapels with their own sacristies. These families would have private Masses said in their homes.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{injunction}} to be modest, various forms of dress were developed {{in different parts of the}} Islamic world, but some forms of dress were carryovers from earlier, pre-Islamic Near Eastern societies: the practice of women covering their hair was the norm in the earlier communities of Jews and Christians. The iconography of the Virgin Mary in Christian art always shows her with her hair covered, and this convention was followed into the modern era by both Georgian and Armenian Christians, in addition to Oriental Jewish women; Catholic women would not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> without covering their heads until well into the twentieth century. The covering of the hair was taken by women to be a natural part of life as a sign of modesty and especially as a sign of respect before God.|$|E

25|$|Panic! at the Disco {{was formed}} in 2004 in the {{suburban}} area of Summerlin, Las Vegas, by childhood friends Ryan Ross, who sang and played guitar, and Spencer Smith, who played drums. They both attended Bishop Gorman High School, and they began playing music together in ninth grade. They invited friend Brent Wilson from nearby Palo Verde High School to join on bass, and Wilson invited classmate Brendon Urie to try out on guitar. The quartet soon began rehearsing in Smith's grandmother's living room. Urie {{grew up in a}} Mormon family in Las Vegas and early on missed some rehearsals to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> Ross initially was the lead vocalist for the group, but after hearing Urie sing back-up during rehearsals, the group decided to make him the lead. Initially, Panic! at the Disco was a Blink-182 cover band.|$|E

He suffers from an ailment that causes intense coughing and shivering {{that may or may not}} be related to his involvement in the Gaia Project. Though he rejects Tory and Mandy's attempts to help him during a relapse of his condition, he eventually becomes close friends with the two during their peer tutoring sessions.

25|$|The Romanovs {{were placed}} in the Napolnaya School, on the fringe of the town. The school was small, {{consisting}} of only six rooms, the furniture basic but scanty. Each prisoner received an iron bed. They were allowed to move into the desolate former schoolrooms and sort out their living arrangements on their own. Grand Duke Sergei shared a room with Feodor Remez and Prince Paley. Although the captives were under the strict guard of the Red Army soldiers, they were allowed to walk in town, to talk to people and to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> on feasts days. Preparing to spend a long time in Alapayevsk, they planted flowers and vegetable gardens near the school and spent many hours working there. On rainy days, the Romanovs read Russian novels to each other. Gradually, the regimen toughened and they were forbidden to take walks. The school was encircled with a barbed-wire fence and small trenches. Two weeks later, they were murdered.|$|E
