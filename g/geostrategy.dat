25|$|Sir Halford John Mackinder PC (15 February 1861 – 6 March 1947) was an English geographer, academic, politician, {{the first}} Principal of University Extension College, Reading (which became the University of Reading) and Director of the London School of Economics, who is {{regarded}} as one of the founding fathers of both geopolitics and <b>geostrategy.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Geostrategy</b> is the {{geographic}} {{direction of a}} state's foreign policy. More precisely, <b>geostrategy</b> describes where a state concentrates its efforts by projecting military power and directing diplomatic activity. The underlying assumption is that states have limited resources and are unable, {{even if they are}} willing, to conduct a tous asimuths foreign policy. Instead they must focus politically and militarily on specific areas of the world. <b>Geostrategy</b> describes this foreign-policy thrust of a state and does not deal with motivation or decision-making processes. The <b>geostrategy</b> of a state, therefore, is not necessarily motivated by geographic or geopolitical factors. A state may project power to a location because of ideological reasons, interest groups, or simply the whim of its leader.|$|E
50|$|Its {{defining}} characteristic is {{the inclusion}} of organic state theory, informed by social Darwinism. It was characterized by clash of civilizations-style theorizing. It is perhaps the closest of any school of <b>geostrategy</b> to a purely nationalistic conception of <b>geostrategy,</b> which ended up masking other more universal elements.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the EU criticised for its naïve idealism, in {{particular}} in its failure to counter Russia’s increasingly assertive manoeuvres. While Russia is presented as an inherently geopolitical actor, the EU’s emphasis on a normative post-geopolitical agenda is depicted as a losing strategy. The EU, it is argued, must become ‘more geopolitical’ in what is presented as an emerging ‘new Cold War’. However, post-geopolitical depictions of the EU are problematic, but derive from an overly narrow conflation of geopolitics with modernist geopolitical practices. In contrast, the paper argues that the EU’s actions are no less impregnated with geopolitical visions aimed at ordering and organising the space beyond its borders, but also argues that the EU’s geopolitical visions – and the <b>geostrategies</b> adopted to implement them – are also underpinned by a need to preserve and protect the Union’s sense of ontological security. This connection between its geopolitical visions, <b>geostrategies</b> and sense of ontological security is important, as it means challenges to the former can generate considerable anxieties {{in regard to the}} latter; anxieties that need a response. The paper argues that the return of traditional geopolitical language can be understood in these terms, calming emerging anxieties by reaffirming a sense of order and stability in terms of an historically known set of coordinates. Although seductive, this move of (mis) recognising contemporary events in terms of historical analogy is also potentially problematic. Introduction Recently it has become common to depict the European Union (EU) as plagued by crisis, wracked by an apparent inability to respond effectively to a number of considerable challenges of both an internal and external nature. Internally the EU is plagued by economic woes, rising populism and a sense of democratic deficit that combined have weakened solidarity within the EU and fostered a certain amount of anti-EU sentiment. Externally the biggest challenge has come from a revanchist Russia emboldened enough to in 2014 annex Crimea and invade eastern Ukraine, in doing so precipitating a security crisis to which the EU struggled to respond (Toal 2017 : 19; Youngs 2017 : 5, 11). These challenges have material, organisational and political elements, but they are also profoundly ontological. They are ontological because according to EU self-narratives it should not be like this. The EU is...|$|R

50|$|<b>Geostrategy</b> {{encounters}} {{a wide variety}} of criticisms. It has been called a crude form of geographic determinism. It is seen as a gloss used to justify international aggression and expansionism—it is linked to Nazi war plans, and to a perceived U.S. creation of Cold War divisions through its containment strategy. Marxists and critical theorists believe <b>geostrategy</b> is simply a justification for American imperialism.|$|E

50|$|<b>Geostrategy</b> as a {{political}} science is both descriptive and analytical like political geography but adds a normative element in its strategic prescriptions for national policy. While it stems from earlier US and British <b>geostrategy,</b> German geopolitik adopts an essentialist outlook toward the national interest, oversimplifying issues and representing itself as a panacea. As a new and essentialist ideology, geopolitik found itself {{in a position to}} prey upon the post-World War I insecurity of the populace.|$|E
50|$|Especially {{following}} World War II, {{some scholars}} divide <b>geostrategy</b> into two schools: the uniquely German organic state theory; and, the broader Anglo-American geostrategies.|$|E

50|$|As {{a science}} or science based {{political}} practice <b>geostrategy</b> uses factual and empirical analysis, thus theoretical formulations in <b>geostrategy</b> usually heavily rely on empirical base although facts-values relations or conclusions are differently observed by different and/or competitive geostrategic approaches. Geostrategic conceptions that {{stems from the}} theory become base for the countries foreign and international policies. Geostrategic conceptions are also historically acquired or even inherited {{from one country to}} another due to common history, relations between the countries, culture and even propaganda.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Geostrategy,</b> a {{subfield}} of geopolitics, {{is a type}} {{of foreign}} policy guided principally by geographical factors as they inform, constrain, or affect political and military planning. As with all strategies, <b>geostrategy</b> is concerned with matching means to ends—in this case, a country's resources (whether they are limited or extensive) with its geopolitical objectives (which can be local, regional, or global). Strategy is as intertwined with geography as geography is with nationhood, or as Gray and Sloan state it, [...] "is the mother of strategy." ...|$|E
