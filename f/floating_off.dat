5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat, crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen <b>floating</b> <b>off</b> the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag <b>floating</b> <b>off</b> Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only {{determine}} that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E

5|$|He awaited {{execution}} of his sentence at the Union Correctional Institution. Shortly {{after the trial}} and conviction, his wife Debra filed for divorce and their marriage was formally dissolved a year later. Chandler was no longer allowed to see his daughter Whitney, and, in accordance with his ex-wife's wishes, he {{was not allowed to}} see later photographs of her. In July 2008, Chandler was on Florida's short list of executions. Profiling experts speculated that Chandler may have killed previously, {{based on the belief that}} a first-time killer would not be experienced, or bold enough, to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remained a suspect in the 1982 murder of a woman found <b>floating</b> <b>off</b> Anna Maria Island until 2011, when the body was identified as 29-year-old Amy Hurst and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder. Chandler was never charged with another murder. All of his appeals of his 1994 conviction were denied; his last was in May 2007.|$|E

The MK8 team is trained to swiftly identify safe corridors for the initial landing of troops ashore.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory is}} that Trafficante crime family boss, Santo Trafficante, Jr., ordered Giancana's murder due to mob fears that Giancana would testify about Cosa Nostra and CIA plots to kill Fidel Castro. Trafficante would have needed {{permission}} from Outfit bosses Tony Accardo and Joseph Aiuppa to kill Giancana. Johnny Roselli, whose body {{was found to have}} been shot, dissected, then stuffed in an oil drum <b>floating</b> <b>off</b> Miami, was also rumored to have been killed on Trafficante's orders.|$|E

2500|$|Currents {{appeared}} on several critics' {{lists of the}} best albums of 2015. Q named Currents the year's top album, saying that [...] "Parker added dancefloor pop to their kaleidoscopic sound" [...] while calling it [...] "sonically advanced and filled with great songs". Spin ranked it as the year's fourth-best, calling it the group's [...] "best because its soul actually lies in Motown". The magazine said the album finds Parker [...] "coming to the epiphany {{that no amount of}} pitch- and time-shifting will screw with your perception of reality as much as a lyric that's as direct and true as 'They say people never change but that's bulls**t / They do.'" [...] Mojo also ranked the record as fourth-best of the year. Pitchfork ranked the album as the year's fifth-best, saying, [...] "There's still a bit of Parker's elegant guitar here, but he's mostly rerouted his perfectionistic craftsmanship to synthesizer tones and drum programming." [...] Paste ranked Currents at number eight on its list of the year's best albums, calling it a [...] "near-perfect album" [...] and [...] "a superb progression from their last efforts, a study in internal consistency." [...] Rolling Stone placed the album at number 13 on its list of the [...] "50 Best Albums of 2015", writing that Parker's [...] "musical rethink... is expansive, resulting in wide-screen adventures like 'Let It Happen'" [...] and that the record is [...] "full of weightless vocals and synthesized funk, for a set that's both blissed-out and mournful, like a set of diary entries from an astronaut <b>floating</b> <b>off</b> into oblivion". The album was also ranked fifth-best of the year by Consequence of Sound and NME, 15th-best by Stereogum, and 22nd-best by PopMatters, while Exclaim! named it the eighth-best pop/rock album of the year.|$|E

Swimming in the air, emerged the nymphs, lustrous arms {{interlocked}} like Indian jugglers' glittering snakes. Round the cascade they thronged; then paused in its spray. Of a sudden, seemed to spring from its midst, a young form of foam, that danced into the soul like a thought. At last, sideways <b>floating</b> <b>off,</b> it subsided into the grotto, a wave. Evening drawing on apace, the crimson draperies were lifted, and festooned to {{the arms of the}} idol-pillars, admitting the rosy light of the even.|$|E

To my surprise I found them in greatly increased numbers: {{on the tops of}} cardoons, posts, and other elevated situations they were literally lying together in heaps. Most of them were large and of the olive-coloured species; their size had probably prevented them from getting away earlier, but they were now <b>floating</b> <b>off</b> in great numbers, the weather being calm and tolerably dry. To-day I noticed a new species with a grey body, elegantly striped with black, and pink legs--a very pretty spider.|$|E

60|$|He did {{not turn}} to the right. He walked on, as if there still had been a ship in the {{roadstead}} to which he could get himself pulled off in the evening. Far away, beyond the houses, on the slope of an indigo promontory closing {{the view of the}} quays, the slim column of a factory-chimney smoked quietly straight up into the clear air. A Chinaman, curled down in the stern of one of the half-dozen sampans <b>floating</b> <b>off</b> the end of the jetty, caught sight of a beckoning hand.
