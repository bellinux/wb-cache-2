5|$|This lists <b>free-standing</b> {{structures}} that have {{at some point}} held the title of tallest structure in London.|$|E
5|$|A <b>free-standing</b> minaret, {{built by}} Katkhuda, {{originally}} {{stood outside the}} gate. The minaret was demolished prior {{to the opening of}} al-Azhar street by Tewfik Pasha during modernization efforts which took place throughout Cairo.|$|E
5|$|This lists {{buildings}} and <b>free-standing</b> structures {{that are under}} construction in Tokyo and are planned to rise at least 185metres (607ft). Any buildings that have been topped out but are not completed are also included.|$|E
5|$|Gjesing Church, a red-brick {{building}} {{north of}} the city centre, was completed 1983. Like many other modern churches in the area, it has a <b>free-standing</b> bell tower as well as a church hall and meeting rooms. Other churches include Zion's Church and Jerne Church.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{and former}} monastic {{buildings}} were extensively restored during the 19thcentury (amidst some controversy), and a <b>free-standing</b> bell-tower was {{added in the}} 20thcentury. The buildings are a major tourist attraction in Chester. In addition to holding services for Christian worship, the cathedral {{is used as a}} venue for concerts and exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Work at the mid-Victorian building, which {{closed as}} a {{swimming}} baths in 1975, has involved cleaning, repairs and {{the replacement of}} external stonework. The new office space is housed inside a <b>free-standing</b> timber-clad pod within the former main pool.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind arcades above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with capitals, <b>free-standing</b> columns and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and mouldings of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late Romanesque in style and the arches early Gothic. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, {{to a deeper}} level of sophistication. He {{was the first to}} write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of <b>free-standing</b> preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E
5|$|In the 3rd century, {{imperial}} mausolea {{began to}} be built as domed rotundas rather than tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. Pagan and Christian domed mausolea from this time can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings also reflect their religious functions. The pagan buildings are typically two story, dimly lit, <b>free-standing</b> structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice. Christian domed mausolea contain a single well-lit space and are usually attached to a church.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, tall, <b>free-standing</b> wooden towers called Bergfriede were {{commonly}} {{built by}} the 11th century, either as part of motte-and-bailey designs or, as part of Hohenburgen castles, with characteristic inner and outer courts. Bergfriede, which take their name from the German for a belfry, had similarities to keeps, but are usually distinguished from them on account of Bergfriede having a smaller area or footprint, usually being non-residential and being typically integrated into the outer defences of a castle, rather than being a safe refuge of last resort.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, Beshear {{unveiled}} his promised {{legislation that}} would allow casino gambling in Kentucky. Beshear's plan included a constitutional amendment allowing 12 casinos to be licensed in the state – seven {{at each of the}} state's horse racetracks and five additional <b>free-standing</b> casinos – and a companion bill specifying how the increased revenues would be spent. After the plan encountered initial resistance, House leadership reduced the number of casinos that would have been allowed to by the amendment to nine. One proposal, authored by House Speaker Jody Richards, would have guaranteed five casino licenses to the state's racetracks and allowed the other four to go to <b>free-standing</b> casinos. A competing measure, drafted by House Majority Whip Rob Wilkey and Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark, would have allowed all nine licenses to be awarded competitively, with none specifically reserved for racetracks. In late February, the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs committee failed to advance either proposal to the full floor of the House of Representatives. The following day, Speaker Richards removed Representative Dottie Sims from the committee; Sims claimed Richards retaliated against her for voting against the proposals, but Richards said he removed Sims because she told him she would vote for the proposals and then voted against them. Following Sims' removal the committee passed the amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{is situated}} near the Tomb of Sikandar Lodhi and Shisha Gumbad. Although the three structures, which {{share a common}} raised platform, were all built during the Lodhi reign, they were not constructed at the same time. The intended purpose of the builders of Bara Gumbad is unclear: {{it may have been}} intended as a <b>free-standing</b> tomb, but no tombstone has been identified. The area in which Bara Gumbad is situated was formally called Khairpur village.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{constructed}} from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres {{above the ground}} on huge piloti and is accessible via a <b>free-standing</b> staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; {{the idea was to}} keep the surfaces plain so that nothing could distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.|$|E
5|$|The tourist {{information}} centre {{is situated in}} the Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery {{in what used to}} be the old Music Hall theatre in the town square. The three main museums are Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery, Shrewsbury Castle (which houses the Shropshire Regimental Museum) and the Coleham Pumping Station. Also, there is the Gateway arts and drama centre and there are also various private galleries and art shops around the town. Another notable feature of the town is Lord Hill's Column, the largest <b>free-standing</b> Doric column in the world.|$|E
5|$|With {{the present}} {{building}} dating between 1090 and 1536, Ely Cathedral {{has a significant}} Norman nave and Decorated Gothic choir, but its most important features are its unique western tower of 1174 and central octagon of 1322, which Clifton-Taylor describes as “one of the wonders of English cathedral architecture”. It also has a unique, very large, <b>free-standing</b> Lady Chapel with a very wide vault and intricately carved stone arcades around the sedilia.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three <b>free-standing</b> domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E
5|$|Curiously, {{the legend}} {{has not been}} {{reported}} by any Byzantine author. However, {{an investigation of the}} surviving holes wherein the metal letters were riveted verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a <b>free-standing</b> triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), and which was only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred frog {{species in}} {{adaptive}} radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantis, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, {{and many other}} tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for breeding in the wild. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from <b>free-standing</b> water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the tadpole stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent {{not only on the}} quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the Dome of the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing <b>free-standing</b> domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E
5|$|The Railway Stand, on {{the west}} side of the stadium nearest to Birmingham city centre, is also <b>free-standing.</b> It was opened in 1999 and holds some 8,000 spectators in two tiers; the upper tier, a small area known as the Olympic Gallery, {{overhangs}} the lower, at the back of which is a row of executive boxes. From the 2009–10 season, the Railway Stand was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager. Visiting supporters are housed in the lower Railway Stand, segregated from home fans by plastic netting over the seats.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor is}} of Jura marble, the altar, ambo, baptismal font and {{tabernacle}} {{are made of}} Lahn marble. The wall behind the altar held a neo-gothic crucifixion scene of Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene under the cross, from the Magdalenenkirche. Low stained glass windows forming the Stations of the Cross were designed by Paul Corazolla from Berlin. The first organ was built by E. F. Walcker & Cie. and consecrated in 1974. It {{was placed on the}} right side in the opening for the chapel, visible to the congregation. The <b>free-standing</b> bell tower, housing four bells, is 42m high.|$|E
5|$|The house {{expanded}} in several phases. In 1861, before the Del Valle family moved here permanently, they added three additional rooms {{as well as}} a <b>free-standing</b> cocina (kitchen). This was to keep fire away from the main building, as well as to keep it cooler. A basement was dug out as the foundation of the new rooms. In the 1870s, another wing was added perpendicular to the 1861 addition. Finally, some time after 1895, one more room was added to the new wing, {{as well as a}} breezeway to the kitchen, completing the current shape. Remodeling completed after this time was to the interior only.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} form of decoration is relief. Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated, as were <b>free-standing</b> stelae erected within the enclosure. Egyptian artists used both bas relief and sunken relief. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief. Sunken relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone {{and when the}} builders wanted to finish quickly. It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight. Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors. In some cases, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{street names}} {{are not used}} in the development. The main {{thoroughfares}} are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street furniture and coloured ambient lighting will be colour-coded to match. A stylised map of the site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the brownfield site to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a <b>free-standing</b> big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, castles {{were built}} {{throughout}} the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically {{took the form}} of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on lower ground, a tall, <b>free-standing</b> tower (German Bergfried.) The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes. The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France {{during the first half of}} the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years. This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gród, or town. Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely. In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a <b>free-standing</b> sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|In 1730, Vaccarini {{arrived in}} Catania as the {{appointed}} city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and <b>free-standing</b> columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature {{rather than a}} general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported {{on the back of}} the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal façade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.|$|E
5|$|In their haste, Cope and Marsh did {{not always}} follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the {{discovery}} by Benjamin Mudge of the type specimen of Allosaurus in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in Wyoming; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete Allosaurus and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the Como Bluff area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it {{was found to be}} one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial Apatosaurus skeleton as if scavenging it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first <b>free-standing</b> mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{original}} furnishings were sold {{in the wake of}} the French Revolution. Some works of art, including the overdoors from the Salle des évêques, part of the municipal collections, were destroyed with the museum situated in the Aubette when the Prussian Army shelled the city during the Siege of Strasbourg in 1870. In the 20th century and especially during the reconstruction following the bomb damage of August 1944, a great deal of effort went into locating the surviving missing objects and replacing the lost works with identical or similar pieces. They were supervised by the aforementioned Hans Haug, who had become director of the newly created network of the municipal museums on 1January 1945. Some elements, though, were never restored, such as the stucco of the library. It was lost in 1817 because of leaks through the ceiling; as the only <b>free-standing</b> part of the building, the library has a flat roof.|$|E
5|$|Originally a garden, {{the demand}} for more {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two <b>free-standing</b> blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the <b>free-standing</b> pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E
5|$|School House, 70The Close, was {{formerly}} {{part of the}} Carnary college but now contains classrooms and school offices. While much of the building dates to around 1830, extensive 14th and 15th century features remain such as the stone entrance archway. The building, which is Grade I listed, adjoins the Erpingham Gate and is three storeys high and has eight bays. School End House, 69The Close, is a 17th-century timber-framed house built against {{the east end of}} the school chapel. Formerly a home, the Grade I listed building is now the senior common room for staff and a school office. The entrance is pilastered and is surrounded by lion-mask roundels. The Music School, 71The Close, was built in 1626–28 as a home for the prebendaries of the cathedral, funded by the chapter. Typical of the period, the Grade II* listed building was constructed from flint-rubble, brick, and reused materials from monastic buildings in the Close. It replaced an earlier house and incorporates the remains of a medieval <b>free-standing</b> bell tower originating in the 12th or 13th century, rebuilt around 1300 and largely demolished by 1580.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall at {{the centre}} of the north range is entered through a porch and screens passage, a feature common in houses of the period, {{designed}} to protect the occupants from draughts. As the screens are now missing, they may have been <b>free-standing</b> like those at Rufford Old Hall. The porch is decorated with elaborate carvings. The Great Hall's roof is supported by arch-braced trusses, which are decorated with carved motifs including dragons. The floor, now flagged, would probably originally have been rush-covered earth, with a central hearth. The gabled bay window overlooking the courtyard was added in 1559. The original service wing {{to the west of the}} Great Hall, behind the screens passage, was rebuilt in 1546, and housed a kitchen, buttery and pantry. A hidden shaft was discovered during a 19th-century investigation of two secret rooms above the kitchen, connecting them to a tunnel leading to the moat, the entrance to which has since been filled in. The west range now houses the gift shop and restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a <b>free-standing</b> proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build <b>free-standing</b> nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{has four}} stands. The Main Stand (renamed the Garrison Lane Stand from 2010 to 2012), a <b>free-standing</b> {{structure}} {{on the north}} side of the playing area, was completed in 1954 and has seating for fewer than 5,000 spectators. The upper tier contains the media area and an area of corporate seats as well as standard seating. The lower tier, known as the Paddocks, consists of a few rows of seats placed on the uncovered terraced area in front of the stand; the view from this area can be obstructed by the central tunnel and the dugouts. A row of executive boxes was added at the back of the Paddocks in the 1970s. The family area is divided between the eastern end of the Main Stand and the Paddock beneath. The club planned £1.3million worth of restructuring and refurbishment work on the stand, which contained hospitality areas and offices, during the 2009 closed season, and seating was replaced in 2010. The broadcasting gantry is situated in the roof of this stand.|$|E
