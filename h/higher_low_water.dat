25|$|Tides are {{commonly}} semi-diurnal (two high waters and two low waters each day), or diurnal (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters {{on a given}} day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the higher high water and the lower high water in tide tables. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the <b>higher</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> and the lower low water. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the equator.|$|E
50|$|Tides in Puget Sound are of {{the mixed}} type with two high and two low tides each tidal day. These are called Higher High Water (HHW), Lower Low Water (LLW), Lower High Water (LHW), and <b>Higher</b> <b>Low</b> <b>Water</b> (HLW). The {{configuration}} of basins, sills, and interconnections cause the tidal range to increase within Puget Sound. The difference in height between the Higher High Water and the Lower Low Water averages about 8.3 ft at Port Townsend on Admiralty Inlet, but increases to about 14.4 ft at Olympia, {{the southern end of}} Puget Sound.|$|E
50|$|A beaver dam has {{a certain}} amount of {{freeboard}} above the water level. When heavy rains occur, the river or lake fills up and the dam gradually releases the extra stored water. Often this is all that is necessary to reduce the height of the flood wave moving down the river, and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures. Flood control is achieved in other ways as well. The surface of any stream intersects the surrounding water table. By raising the stream level, the gradient of {{the surface of the water}} table above the beaver dam is reduced, and water near the beaver dam flows more slowly into the stream. This further helps in reducing flood waves, and increases water flow when there is no rain. Beaver dams also smooth out water flow by increasing the area wetted by the stream. This allows more water to seep into the ground where its flow is slowed. This water eventually finds its way back to the stream. Rivers with beaver dams in their head waters have lower high water and <b>higher</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> levels.|$|E

Bacterial growth efficiency showed a wide range (0. 2 – 23 %) and low mean value of 3 and 6 %, (in <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> respectively) suggesting that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was mostly allocated to catabolic metabolism.

40|$|Abstract- The {{occurrence}} of dangerously <b>high</b> or <b>low</b> <b>water</b> levels at coastal locations {{is an important}} public concern and is {{a significant factor in}} coastal hazard assessment, navigational safety, and ecosystem management. The monthly <b>highest</b> and <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> levels at 117 NOAA/National Ocean Service water level stations show a clear response to local mean sea level trends. The extreme levels reached by hurricanes and extra-tropical storms of the past can be adjusted for sea level trend, so that unbiased comparisons can be made. A data set of the annual <b>highest</b> and <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> levels is derived from the monthly data and used to determine the expected frequency of future storm tides rising above or falling below any given level. The same analysis is also applied to the data for each individual month in order to estimate the varying likelihood of extreme <b>high</b> or <b>low</b> levels by season. The results are a set of annual and monthly exceedance probability levels relative to the tidal datums for each station. This information should prove useful for identifying, in real time, when a rare event threshold has been crossed. The exceedance probability levels can be adjusted in the future to reflect newly-updated tidal datums...|$|R

30|$|The data exhibit some {{clustering}} at extreme levels i.e. a {{month with}} <b>high</b> (<b>low)</b> <b>water</b> level {{is likely to}} be followed by another month with <b>high</b> (<b>low)</b> <b>water</b> level. Such dependence in the data calls into question the independence assumption underlying the GP distribution. Procedures for addressing the problem of dependent exceedances can be found in Leadbetter et al. (1983), Beirlant et al. (2004), and Embrechts et al. (1997). In addition, Coles (2001) provides a basic procedure to deal with dependent data called declustering. It involves blocking the observations into clusters and the cluster maxima are taken as the independent sample of maxima. Thus, the declustering procedure is used to filter the data so as to achieve a (near-) independent sample of maxima for the application of the POT method. However, only cluster maxima are used and this leads to a less optimum use of data. In our case, the declustering procedure resulted in between 5 and 20 exceedances depending on the number of clusters. However, ignoring the dependence in the data implies that we risk underestimating the return levels and return periods (see e.g. Beirlant et al. 2004; Coles 2001). Such a conservative approach is better in the context of managing a risky operation of a hydroelectric dam. In other words, it is prudent to plan towards shorter return periods of catastrophic events provided by the independent assumption. Therefore, we assume that the water levels are independent and apply the POT method in this study.|$|R
25|$|The {{exception}} is at Cook Strait where the tidal currents periodically link <b>high</b> to <b>low</b> <b>water.</b> This is because cotidal lines 180° around the amphidromes are in opposite phase, for example <b>high</b> <b>water</b> across from <b>low</b> <b>water</b> {{at each end}} of Cook Strait. Each tidal constituent has a different pattern of amplitudes, phases, and amphidromic points, so the M2 patterns cannot be used for other tide components.|$|R

Annual water deliveries for these plant species were obtained. Well-distributed summer rains substantially reduced the irrigation needs of these plants, and all the plant species were reasonably maintained under trickle irrigation, with less than one-gallon-per-day water deliveries, except Mulberry. Plants were grouped into four categories according to their annual water deliveries, viz., very high, <b>high,</b> medium, and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> users. Trickle-irrigated plants made almost equal growth and maintained similar appearance as spray-irrigated plants, which were given more water. The data on plant growth increments were analyzed for selected ten plant species {{to determine the effects}} of reduced water treatments.
