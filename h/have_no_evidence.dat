5|$|Mulder and Scully {{determine}} {{that one of}} the dead men belonged to an Islamic terrorist group, the Isfahan, and using the ATM video are able to track down Lauren. A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry figure who appears to be Howard Graves. The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At a repair shop, the car is found to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E
5|$|Unlike modern amphibians, many temnospondyls {{are covered}} in small, closely packed scales. The undersides of most temnospondyls {{are covered in}} rows of large ventral plates. During early stages of development, they first have only small, rounded scales. Fossils show, as the animals grew, the scales on the undersides of their bodies {{developed}} into large, wide ventral plates. The plates overlap {{each other in a}} way that allows a wide range of flexibility. Later semiaquatic temnospondyls, such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of scales. They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration, the absorption of oxygen through the skin.|$|E

25|$|Visa runs are {{frowned upon}} by {{immigration}} authorities, as such acts may signify that the foreigner wishes to reside permanently and might also {{work in that}} country, purposes that visitors are prohibited from engaging in and usually require an immigrant visa or a work visa. Immigration officers may deny re-entry to visitors suspected of engaging in prohibited activities, especially when they have done repeated visa runs and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of spending reasonable time {{in their home countries}} or countries where {{they have the right to}} reside and work.|$|E

25|$|The erasures were {{sporadic}} and haphazard, {{with only}} the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished {{and it may be}} that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{government}} crackdown, Polanco-Rodriguez escaped arrest in New York by fleeing to the Dominican Republic with a fake passport. However, {{he was unable}} to stay out of trouble. He was shot in the leg during a gunfight over a woman in a Santiago nightclub. United States officials insisted that the Dominican government either extradite or imprison him. He was arrested in 1988 and sent to La Victoria prison without a trial. After fighting with other prisoners, Polanco-Rodriguez was transferred to the Monte Plata jail in 1990, where he bribed guards to allow him certain luxuries. But once again Polanco-Rodriguez became involved in an intense struggle with inmates when he stopped the attempted rape of a female prisoner. Fellow prisoners attempted to burn him alive by setting his cell cot on fire. Finally, in 1992, prison authorities released him. He is married to a woman named Johani Candelario, daughter of Renato Candelario, and is the father of five children. In an interview with The New York Times in 1996, Polanco-Rodriguez said he had retired from his life of crime, and DEA and Dominican drug officials said they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to the contrary.|$|E

500|$|When Pembleton {{begins to}} read Hal his rights, Felix stops him {{and refuses to}} let him arrest his son. Later, prosecuting {{attorney}} Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek) [...] says because the confession is inadmissible, they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to arrest Hal, and he refuses to issue an arrest warrant against {{a member of a}} prominent family without a solid case. The Wilsons decide to move to San Diego, and Felix tells Pembleton he will do everything he can to continue protecting his son. Pembleton and Ballard make a reluctant peace and, although Pembleton remains cold with her, he admits he was wrong about the Wilsons and that Ballard's instincts about the case were correct. Gee tells Pembleton he too let his personal feelings cloud his judgment, and the two agree they will bring Hal back to Baltimore when they get enough evidence against him.|$|E

2500|$|Baker {{notes that}} [...] "most {{observers}} of the Lincoln marriage have been impressed with their sexuality". Some [...] "male historians" [...] suggest that the Lincolns' sex life ended either in 1853 after their son Tad's difficult birth or in 1856 when they moved into a bigger house, but <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> for their speculations. Baker writes that there are [...] "almost no gynecological conditions resulting from childbirth" [...] other than a prolapsed uterus (which would have produced other noticeable effects on Mrs. Lincoln) that would have prevented intercourse, and in the 1850s, [...] "many middle-class couples slept in separate bedrooms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the large}} number of {{airplanes}} that have crashed in the Sierra Nevada, primarily due to the complex weather and atmospheric conditions such as downdrafts and microbursts caused by geography there, a portion of the area, a triangle whose vertices are Reno, Nevada; Fresno, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada, has been dubbed the [...] "Nevada Triangle", in reference to the Bermuda Triangle. [...] Some counts put the number of crashes in the triangle at 2,000, including millionaire and record-breaking flyer Steve Fossett. [...] Theories that the crashes are related in some way to the United States Air Force's Area 51, or to the activities of extra-terrestrial aliens, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to support them.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} Fox News story on July 25, {{mainstream}} news sources {{did not immediately}} report the story. Articles describing the Enquirer allegations were eventually published by the magazines, New York and Radar. The claims were also mentioned in opinion columns and in-house blogs of several other papers. On July 23, Glenn Beck talked about the story on his program, Headline News, recommending that Edwards sue the Enquirer if its story was proven false. On that same day, Roxanne Roberts, a style writer for The Washington Post, said, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> this is true. Lots of juicy details—enough so Edwards may feel he has to address the issue, especially if it's not true and there's an innocent explanation. Or not.

2500|$|Affective {{emotions}} and response are a primary {{factor in the}} initial stages of infidelity on both sides. Affective behaviors are how we deal emotions that we do not anticipate (Miller, 2017). An affective response immediately indicates to an individual whether something is pleasant or unpleasant and whether they decide to approach of avoid a situation (Miller, 2017). Jealousy is an automatic response when a partner is suspicious of another, and many don’t realize what is making them experience the jealousy because they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that they have been cheated on. Feeling of incompetence and later resentment can cause affective responses when a suspected unfaithful partner irritates or hurts the other’s feelings. Anger is an emotion that is in each of the stages of infidelity, but causes affective responses {{in the initial stages}}. It can spring from other more discrete emotions or can be felt from the suspected partner.|$|E
2500|$|Zuroff {{criticized the}} {{investigations}} as [...] "a pathetic whitewash {{for political reasons}} of an active Nazi collaborator" [...] and cited the prosecutor's contention that Männil was purposely targeted by the Wiesenthal Center as the best proof that Estonia lacks {{the political will to}} prosecute a prominent Estonian. Martin Arpo, superintendent of Security Police Board disagrees with this view: [...] "But the local KGB couldn't find any more evidence against the Nazi collaborators. We haven't found it either. And the KGB was a much larger organization than we are and had powers and methods, shall we say, that are not available to a Western democratic country." [...] The Russian Prosecution's Office and FSB have indicated they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> regarding Männil. After Männil's death, Efraim Zuroff, while not withdrawing the accusations, admitted that they were [...] "never able to prove that Männil personally committed murder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baggott got {{the idea}} to write Farewell to Reality and become a science activist when {{watching}} the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls [...] "fairy tale physics" [...] when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are [...] "abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation" [...] and [...] "not science". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the [...] "fuzzy science theory" [...] and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, [...] "When you start asking 'Do {{we live in a}} hologram?'
