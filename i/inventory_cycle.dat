The research was conducted on the branches (subsectors) of the food industry in Poland in 2005 - 2010. The research is based on the econometric analysis of the influence of the length of <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles</b> (in total, materials, production in progress, finished goods, commodities) on financial performance of branches measured with return on sales, assets and equity. The research proved that the effectiveness of inventory management measured with the length of <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles</b> is strongly diversified in the system of branches of the food industry. However, in general in 2005 - 2010 the <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles</b> were significantly reduced, which points to higher effectiveness of management of those assets. Moreover, on the basis of regression models the improvement in the effectiveness of inventory management measured with the length of total <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles</b> and discrete cycles was found to be positively correlated with profitability.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the classical Newsvendor model, {{also known as}} the Newsboy problem, with the demand to be fully observed and to follow in successive <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles</b> one of the Exponential, Rayleigh, and Log-Normal distributions. For each distribution, appropriate estimators for the optimal order quantity are considered, and their sampling distributions are derived. Then, through Monte-Carlo simulations, we evaluate the performance of corresponding exact and asymptotic confidence intervals for the true optimal order quantity. The case where normality for demand is erroneously assumed is also investigated. Asymptotic confidence intervals produce higher precision, but to attain equality between their actual and nominal confidence level, samples of at least a certain size should be available. This size depends upon the coefficients of variation, skewness and kurtosis. The paper concludes that having available data on the skewed demand for enough <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles</b> enables (i) to trace non-normality, and (ii) to use the right asymptotic confidence intervals in order the estimates for the optimal order quantity to be valid and precise. ...|$|R

Why is inventory investment procyclical at business-cycle frequencies but countercyclical at the very high frequencies (e. g., 2 - 3 quarters per cycle) ?

40|$|Conducting a life <b>cycle</b> <b>inventory</b> (LCI) is {{the first}} step in {{carrying}} out a life cycle analysis (LCA). However, life <b>cycle</b> <b>inventories</b> are often based on surrogate or generic data because site specific data from the facility, product, or process in question does not yet exist or cannot be measured. This thesis investigates the effects of using different types of data on the credibility of life <b>cycle</b> <b>inventories,</b> and evaluates differences that exist between using site-specific data and conceptual sources of data. In particular, the thesis examines if a life <b>cycle</b> <b>inventory</b> developed by assuming data from external sources for an industrial process is reasonably comparable to a life <b>cycle</b> <b>inventory</b> using site-specific data for this same process: the former scenario is the situation most LCA practitioners find themselves in.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} inventories empirically and theoretically. Inventories {{are important}} in miderstanding business cycles, not only because inventory investment accounts for {{a large share of}} GDP growth rate. This thesis also emphasises the cyclicality of <b>inventories.</b> Often, business <b>cycles</b> are regarded as exponential decays, i. e., successive deviations from the steady state and their returning processes. In contrast, this thesis offers a battery of evidence that economic variables, such as sales and inventories, follow damping oscillations, i. e., stable sine waves. This means that a boom is the seed of the recession that follows, and vice versa. This thesis also reveals inventories' role in such endogenous cycles. The first chapter presents empirical evidence of periodicity. VAR estimations find evidence of sine waves - namely, complex roots. Indeed, the detected complex roots seem to capture the actual business cycles; the estimated lengths of one business cycle are close to those of the post-war average in both Japan and the United States. This chapter also shows that peaks and bottoms of inventories lag behind those of production; such a time lag is called a phase shift. In addition, this chapter finds that the U. S. Federal Reserve anticipates <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles,</b> while the Bank of Japan does not. The second chapter constructs a theoretical model with a stockout constraint and a production chain in the rational dynamic general equilibrium framework, which quantitatively satisfies stylised inventory facts. Importantly, the model successfully mimics observed <b>inventory</b> <b>cycles.</b> Moreover, working hours are more volatile and the correlation between labour productivity and output is lower than in the standard real business cycle model. Finally, the third chapter offers a solution algorithm for linear rational expectation models under imperfect information. Inventories are closely related to imperfect information, and inventories are often regarded as buffers against unobserved demand shocks...|$|R

In this study, a structural time series model in the tradition of Harvey (1989) is employed to decompose German inventory investment into trend, cyclical and seasonal components. The empirical findings are compared with the results of theoretical inventory models. The estimations suggests that the German <b>inventory</b> <b>cycle</b> consists of three sub-cycles with periods of one, three and eight years. The three-year cycle of inventory investment corresponds to the well known "Kitchin" cycle and has a significant impact on GDP fluctuations.

40|$|In this paper, the {{classical}} {{economic order quantity}} (EOQ) inventory model assumption that all items of a certain product received from a supplier are of perfect quality is relaxed. Another basic assumption that the payment for the items is made {{at the beginning of}} the <b>inventory</b> <b>cycle</b> when they are received is also eased. We consider an inventory situation where items received from the supplier are of two types of quality, perfect and imperfect, and a short deferral in payment is allowed. The split between perfect and imperfect quality items is assumed to follow a known probability distribution. Both qualities of items have continuous demands, and items of imperfect quality are sold at a discount.

40|$|In a multi item {{inventory}} system, {{given the}} order cycle of each item, {{the determination of}} the replenishment times of items is known as the <b>inventory</b> <b>cycle</b> offsetting problem. In this paper, we study this problem from the view of number theory. Our theoretical results mainly tell us when the problem does not have good solutions. Not surprisingly, in all the problem instances, the fraction of instances in which cycle offsetting has a large effect is small. However, in most practical cases, when the number of items is large, and the problem parameters satisfy mild conditions, the law of large numbers will come into play. We can show that there nearly always exist good solutions according to concentration of measure inequalities. Moreover, a good solution can be found by a randomized procedure.

It uses both macro-economic data and data from surveys of individual firms’ actual and expected inventory accumulation. It is argued that over the past decade and a half, the amplitude of the <b>inventory</b> <b>cycle</b> has been reduced. This reduction in amplitude reflects the decline in the stocks to sales ratio and the decline in the relative importance of unintended inventory investment. In part, these changes have been made possible by the application of increasingly sophisticated inventory management techniques. The paper also argues that the behaviour of inventories is consistent with demand shocks being a principal source of business cycle fluctuations. This is in contrast to a number of recent papers that have argued that shocks to the cost of production are the driving force of the inventory and output cycles. We find that demand factors dominate cost factors in explaining both expected and unexpected changes in inventory investment. ...|$|E

Note that the cost shock and production smoothing mechanisms are naturally embedded in our micro-founded general equilibrium framework. Moreover, as a by-product, the production chain causes the slow adjustment of inventories in aggregate.
