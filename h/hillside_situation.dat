2500|$|One of Lautner's most {{significant}} early works, this house embodies {{many of his}} central design concerns and includes key features that {{he would continue to}} explore and develop throughout his career. It was also important as the project that united him with builder John de la Vaux. Fortuitously, the pair met through their wives, who knew each other socially— at the time, Lautner was having trouble finding contractors to work on his houses, and de la Vaux, a boat builder, was keen to move into housing construction. At his wife's suggestion de la Vaux approached Lautner and offered to build the Carling House, and they sealed the deal with a handshake. As de La Vaux recounted in the 2009 Lautner documentary, the project was briefly halted by a rare snowstorm that dumped more than six inches of snow on the Hollywood area. Lautner's design incorporates many innovative features: He used external steel cantilever beams to support the roof of the hexagonal main living area, creating a completely open space, free of any internal columns. This design, and the house's <b>hillside</b> <b>situation,</b> combine to afford 360-degree views across Los Angeles. Another striking feature is the movable wall-seat— one entire wall section of the living area, with a built-in couch, is hinged on one side and supported by a caster on the other, allowing the entire structure to swing out, opening the room out to the adjoining terrace. This is an idea he revisited with the Turner Residence in Aspen. There is also a swimming pool that partly intrudes into the living area under a sheet of plate glass, a feature that he revisited to even greater effect in the Elrod House. The Carling House has become one Lautner's most celebrated designs and marked the beginning of his fruitful collaboration with de la Vaux, which lasted through seven major projects, including the famous [...] "Chemosphere".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A fuzzy grey {{decision}} system {{framework is}} introduced as groups of expertise and disaster data collection of hillsides that can cooperate {{to prepare for}} and response to <b>hillside</b> safety <b>situations.</b> In this framework, the influential factors and weights play critical roles {{because they are the}} foundation for the evaluation model in hillside residence safety. Therefore, an integration system of Grey Statistics method and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process(FAHP) is proposed to search for the efficient model. Within this system, three pivotal issues need to be addressed: describing the information of uncertainty and imprecision, setting up a model of team decision, multi-standard and criticism, and providing an immediate evaluation system. In this paper, the system development processes and the implementation usage are discussed in detail. The results recognize relative weights between the influential factors and promote the real efficiency of Taiwan’s hillsides disaster can be important references for establishing the evaluation model. In addition, this system significantly provides an immediate decision system to improve the application in hillside residence area, increases system accuracy and computational efficiency...|$|R
