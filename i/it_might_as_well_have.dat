The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I really think that cost us sales..." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{level of}} the plateau, when I turned, was exactly that on which we stood, and the green bank of bushes, with {{occasional}} trees, was so near {{that it was difficult}} to realize how inaccessible it remained.

I placed one arm round the trunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss. Far down were the small dark figures of our servants, looking up at us.

60|$|June 11.--The {{attendance}} on the Committee, {{and afterwards}} the general {{meeting of the}} Oil Gas Company took up my morning, and the rest dribbled away in correcting proofs and trifling; reading, among the rest, an odd volume of Vivian Grey;[530] clever, {{but not so much}} so as to make me, in this sultry weather, go up-stairs to the drawing-room to seek the other volumes. Ah! villain, but you smoked when you read.--Well, Madam, perhaps I think the better of the book for that reason. Made a blunder,--went to Ravelston on the wrong day. This Anne's fault, but I did not reproach her, knowing <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been my own.|$|E
6000|$|The {{printing}} of the ANTI-MACHIAVEL was not intrinsically momentous in Friedrich's history; yet <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been dispensed with. He had here drawn a fine program, and needlessly placarded {{it for the}} street populations: and afterwards there rose, as could not fail on their part, comparison between program and performance; scornful cry, chiefly from men of weak judgment, [...] "Is this King an ANTI-Machiavel, then? Pfui!" [...] Of which,--though Voltaire's voice, too, was heard in it, in angry moments,--we shall say nothing: the reader, looking for himself, will judge by and by. And herewith enough of the ANTI-MACHIAVEL. Composition of ANTI-MACHIAVEL and speculation of the Pine HENRIADE lasted, both of them, all through this Year 1739, and farther: from these two items, not to mention any other, readers can figure sufficiently how literary a year it was.|$|E

We know that it was an accident, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been another as you. But you have not changed. I have given up hoping. I have tried everything else, and I am a very miserable woman. Now I am going to pray to you, Lawrence. You do not care for me more. Pretend that you do! You cannot give me your love. Give me the best you can. Don't despise me too utterly, Lawrence! Pity me, if you will. Heaven knows I need it. And--you will be a little kind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Beyond {{the swamp}} was a dense wood.

Upon the edge of the swamp Du-seen and his horde halted to revile us. They could not reach us with their hands; but at a command from Du-seen they fitted arrows to their bows, and I saw that the end had come. Ajor huddled close to me, and I took her in my arms. [...] "I love you, Tom," [...] she said, [...] "only you." [...] Tears came to my eyes then, not tears of self-pity for my predicament, but tears from a heart filled with a great love--a heart that sees the sun of its life and its love setting even as it rises.|$|E
60|$|As {{they talked}} on, partly in German and partly in English, their purpose in visiting Ansbach {{appeared}} to the Marches more meditated than it was. In {{fact it was}} somewhat accidental; Ansbach was near Nuremberg; it was not much {{out of the way}} to Holland. They took more and more credit to themselves for a reasoned and definite motive, in the light of their companion's enthusiasm for the place, and its charm began for them with the drive from the station through streets whose sentiment was both Italian and French, and where there was a yellowish cast in the gray of the architecture which was almost Mantuan. They rested their sensibilities, so bruised and fretted by Gothic angles and points, against the smooth surfaces of the prevailing classicistic facades of the houses as they passed, and when they arrived at their hotel, an old mansion of Versailles type, fronting on a long irregular square planted with pollard sycamores, they said that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been Lucca.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know; I can't describe," [...] {{said the}} other, {{drumming}} on the table. [...] "It seemed like this. We were six hundred, and marched with those damned poleaxes of Auberon's--the only weapons we've got. We marched two abreast. We went up Holland Walk, between the high palings {{which seemed to}} me to go straight as an arrow for Pump Street. I was near the tail of the line, and it was a long one. When the end of it was still between the high palings, {{the head of the line}} was already crossing Holland Park Avenue. Then the head plunged into the network of narrow streets on the other side, and the tail and myself came out on the great crossing. When we also had reached the northern side and turned up a small street that points, crookedly as it were, towards Pump Street, the whole thing felt different. The streets dodged and bent so much that the head of our line seemed lost altogether: <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been in North America. And all this time we hadn't seen a soul." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{would not}} have drawn your attention, reader, to the antics of our canine friends, {{were it not for}} the fact that these antics {{attracted}} the notice of a personage who merits particular description. This was no other than one of the Esquimaux inhabitants of the land--a woman, and such a woman! Most people would have pronounced her a man, for she wore precisely the same dress--fur jumper and long boots--that was worn by the men of the Dolphin. Her lips were thick and her nose was blunt; she wore her hair turned up, and twisted into a knot on the top of her head; her hood was thrown back, and inside of this hood there was a baby--a small and a very fat baby! It was, so to speak, a conglomerate of dumplings. Its cheeks were two dumplings, and its arms were four dumplings--one above each elbow and one below. Its hands, also, were two smaller dumplings, with ten extremely little dumplings at the end of them. This baby had a nose, of course, but it was so small that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> had none; and it had a mouth, too, but that was so capacious that the half of it would have been more than enough for a baby double the size. As for its eyes, they were large and black--black as two coals--and devoid of all expression save that of astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|We think {{boys are}} rude, un{{sensitive}} animals, {{but it is}} not so in all cases. Each boy has one or two sensitive spots, and if you can find out where they are located you have only to touch them and you can scorch him as with fire. I suffered miserably over that episode. I expected that the facts would be all over the village in the morning, but it was not so. The secret remained confined to the two girls and Sandy and me. That was some appeasement of my pain, but it was far from sufficient--the main trouble remained: I was under four mocking eyes, and <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been a thousand, for I suspected all girls' eyes of being the ones I so dreaded. During several weeks I could not look any young lady in the face; I dropped my eyes in confusion when any one of them smiled upon me and gave me greeting; and I said to myself, [...] "That is one of them," [...] and got quickly away. Of course I was meeting the right girls everywhere, but if they ever let slip any betraying sign I was not bright enough to catch it. When I left Hannibal four years later, the secret was still a secret; I had never guessed those girls out, and was no longer expecting to do it. Nor wanting to, either.|$|E
