She was {{eighteen}} months younger than Yeats and later claimed {{she met the}} poet as a [...] "paint-stained art student." [...] Gonne admired [...] "The Island of Statues" [...] and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, {{and she had a}} significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, [...] "it seems to me that she [...] brought <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes." [...] Yeats's love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.|$|E

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project.

40|$|During {{a recent}} {{curriculum}} methods class, {{one of my}} students inquired about my musical training. Since the vast majority of my musical experiences transpired outside the forum of formal music education, I was unable to answer the question without getting <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>life’s</b> story. This experience motivated me to chronicle my lifelong musical experiences and subsequently reflect on them. These reflections ultimately substantiate that the process of rejecting formal music education and engaging in self-teaching has been the primary method that allowed me to achieve a high level of musical literacy. The paper also argues that the process of self-teaching in the musical arena is very similar to the principles of unschooling (a term coined by American author and educator John Caldwell Holt) where learning is based on the student's interests, needs, and goals...|$|R

[...] He recalls that [...] "uperheroes crept <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> by stealth," [...] as he actively sought out covers featuring [...] "any big creature that looked vaguely dinosaur-like, trampling puny humans."
