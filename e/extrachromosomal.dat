25|$|In biology, a {{mutation}} is {{the permanent}} alteration of the nucleotide {{sequence of the}} genome of an organism, virus, or <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA or other genetic elements.|$|E
25|$|Chromosomes {{vary widely}} between {{different}} organisms. Some {{species such as}} certain bacteria, which lack histones, also contain plasmids or other <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA. These are circular structures in the cytoplasm that contain cellular DNA and {{play a role in}} horizontal gene transfer. In prokaryotes (see nucleoids) and viruses, the DNA is often densely packed and organized; in the case of archaea, by homology to eukaryotic histones, {{and in the case of}} bacteria, by histone-like proteins.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the cell}} is the cytoplasmic region that {{contains}} the genome (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotes can carry <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA elements called plasmids, which are usually circular. Linear bacterial plasmids {{have been identified in}} several species of spirochete bacteria, including members of the genus Borrelia notably Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. Though not forming a nucleus, the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid. Plasmids encode additional genes, such as antibiotic resistance genes.|$|E
25|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{is a small}} virus which infects {{humans and}} some other primate species. AAV is not {{currently}} known to cause disease. The virus causes a very mild immune response, lending further support to its apparent lack of pathogenicity. Gene therapy vectors using AAV can infect both dividing and quiescent cells and persist in an <b>extrachromosomal</b> state without integrating into the genome of the host cell, although in the native virus some integration of virally carried genes into the host genome does occur. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy, and {{for the creation of}} isogenic human disease models. Recent human clinical trials using AAV for gene therapy in the retina have shown promise.|$|E
25|$|S. cerevisiae {{has been}} highly studied {{as a model}} {{organism}} to better understand aging {{for more than five}} decades and has contributed to the identification of more mammalian genes affecting aging than any other model organism. Some of the topics studied using yeast are calorie restriction, as well as in genes and cellular pathways involved in senescence. The two most common methods of measuring aging in yeast are Replicative Life Span, which measures the number of times a cell divides, and Chronological Life Span, which measures how long a cell can survive in a non-dividing stasis state. Limiting the amount of glucose or amino acids in the growth medium has been shown to increase RLS and CLS in yeast as well as other organisms. At first, this was thought to increase RLS by up-regulating the sir2 enzyme, however it was later discovered that this effect is independent of sir2. Over-expression of the genes sir2 and fob1 has been shown to increase RLS by preventing the accumulation of <b>extrachromosomal</b> rDNA circles, which are thought {{to be one of the}} causes of senescence in yeast. The effects of dietary restriction may be the result of a decreased signaling in the TOR cellular pathway. This pathway modulates the cell's response to nutrients, and mutations that decrease TOR activity were found to increase CLS and RLS. This has also been shown to be the case in other animals. A yeast mutant lacking the genes sch9 and ras2 has recently been shown to have a tenfold increase in chronological lifespan under conditions of calorie restriction and is the largest increase achieved in any organism.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, three {{independent}} research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers {{are derived from}} phage DNA and <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA such as plasmids. In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers {{was a sign that}} the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria. [...] All three studies proposing this idea were initially rejected by high-profile journals, but eventually appeared in other journals.|$|E
50|$|In prokaryotes, nonviral <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA is {{primarily}} found in plasmids whereas in eukaryotes <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA {{is primarily}} found in organelles. Mitochondrial DNA is a {{main source of}} this <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA in eukaryotes. <b>Extrachromosomal</b> DNA is often used in research of replication because {{it is easy to}} identify and isolate.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} research articles provide more specific details regarding <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA {{in a variety}} of different organisms.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to DNA found {{outside of the}} nucleus in cells, infection of viral genomes also {{provides an example of}} <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Extrachromosomal</b> DNA {{is found}} in Apicomplexa, which {{is a group of}} protozoa. The malaria {{parasite}} (genus Plasmodium), the AIDS-related pathogen (Taxoplasma and Cryptosporidium) are both members of the Apicomplexa group. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was found in the malaria parasite. [...] There are two forms of <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA found in the malaria parasites. One of these is 6-kb linear DNA and the second is 35-kb circular DNA. These DNA molecules have been researched as potential nucleotide target sites for antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extrachromosomal</b> rDNA circles (ERC) are self replicating {{circles of}} ribosomal DNA {{found in some}} strains of yeast and thought to {{contribute}} to their aging.|$|E
50|$|The American {{molecular}} biologist Joshua Lederberg first introduced the term plasmid in 1952 - originally to describe any bacterial genetic material {{that exists in}} an <b>extrachromosomal</b> state for {{at least part of}} its replication cycle. Later in 1968, it was decided that the term plasmid should be adopted as the term for <b>extrachromosomal</b> genetic element, and to distinguish it from viruses, the definition was narrowed to genetic elements that exist exclusively or predominantly outside of the chromosome and can replicate autonomously.|$|E

5000|$|C. caviae has a relativelly small genome that {{contains}} 1.17 Mbp with 998 protein coding genes. Additionally, C. caviae strain GPIC contains an <b>extrachromosomal</b> plasmid, pCpGP1.|$|E
5000|$|... == Genome {{structure}} == [...] While most bacteria have circular chromosomes, all actinomycetes chromosomes are linear {{and fairly}} large, 8-9Mb. [...] In addition, actinomycete genomes contain <b>extrachromosomal</b> genetic {{elements such as}} rolling circle replication plasmids. [...] These <b>extrachromosomal</b> genetic elements {{have been shown to}} transport their own genes as well as chromosomal genes to other actinomycete hosts. [...] This provides a pathway for genetic information to be exchanged between cells, and could provide a mechanism for the transfer of antibiotic resistance between organisms. One study found genes for streptothricin resistance, an antibiotic produced by Actinomycete bacteria, on plasmids within gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Two {{strains of}} Chlamydia muridarum, MoPn (originally named Nigg) and SFPD, have been {{isolated}} from mice and hamsters. Glycogen production by both strains has been demonstrated. The chromosome and <b>extrachromosomal</b> plasmid of MoPn have been sequenced.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes called EEs, <b>extrachromosomal</b> elements, {{have been}} {{associated}} with genomic instability in eukaryotes. Small polydispersed DNAs (spcDNAs) are commonly found in conjunction with genome instability. SpcDNAs are derived from repetitive sequences such as satellite DNA, retrovirus-like DNA elements, and transposable elements in the genome. They are thought to be the products of gene rearrangements. Double minute chromosomes (DMs) are also <b>extrachromosomal</b> elements that are associated with genome instability. DMs are commonly seen in cancer cells. DMs are thought to be produced through breakages in chromosomes or overreplication of DNA in an organism. Studies show that in cases of cancer and other genomic instability, higher levels of EEs can be observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extrachromosomal</b> DNA is {{generally}} easy to isolate, especially plasmids may be easily isolated by cell lysis followed by precipitation of proteins, which traps chromosomal DNA in insoluble fraction and after centrifugation, plasmid DNA can be purified from soluble fraction.|$|E
5000|$|Addiction modules are toxin-antitoxin systems. Each {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} genes that specify two components: a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin that interferes with the lethal action of the toxin. Found first in E. coli on low copy number plasmids, addiction modules are responsible for a process called the postsegregational killing effect. When bacteria lose these plasmid(s) (or other <b>extrachromosomal</b> elements), the cured cells are selectively killed because the unstable antitoxin is degraded faster than the more stable toxin. The term [...] "addiction" [...] is used because the cell depends on the de novo synthesis of the antitoxin for cell survival. Thus, addiction modules are implicated in maintaining the stability of <b>extrachromosomal</b> elements.|$|E
50|$|A Hirt DNA Extraction is an {{isolation}} of all <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA in a mammalian cell. The Hirt extraction process {{gets rid of}} the high molecular weight nuclear DNA, leaving only low molecular weight mitochondrial DNA and any viral episomes present in the cell.|$|E
50|$|The GIR1 {{ribozyme}} {{was originally}} discovered during the functional {{characterization of the}} introns from the <b>extrachromosomal</b> rDNA of the Didymium iridis protist. A combination of deletion and in vitro self-splicing analyses revealed a twin-ribozyme intron organization: two distinct ribozyme domains within the intron.|$|E
5000|$|B. anthracis has {{a single}} {{chromosome}} which is a circular, 5,227,293-bp DNA molecule. [...] It also has two circular, <b>extrachromosomal,</b> double-stranded DNA plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2. Both the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids are required for full virulence and represent two distinct plasmid families.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extrachromosomal</b> arrays replace {{an earlier}} {{technique}} involving a duplicated piece of chromosome called a free duplication. The latter technique {{required that the}} gene of interest and the mosaic marker be closely linked on the duplication; the former allows free choice of mosaic marker and target gene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extrachromosomal</b> DNA is any DNA that {{is found}} {{outside of the}} nucleus of a cell. It is also {{referred}} to as extranuclear DNA or cytoplasmic DNA. Most DNA in an individual genome is found in chromosomes but DNA found outside of the nucleus also serves important biological functions.|$|E
50|$|The mosaic marker is a gene which {{exhibits}} a visible phenotype change between the functioning and non-functioning alleles. For example, ncl-1, located in chromosomal DNA, {{exhibits a}} larger nucleolus than the wild-type allele, {{which is in}} the array. Thus, cells which exhibit larger nucleoli have usually not retained the <b>extrachromosomal</b> array.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extrachromosomal</b> DNA {{was found}} to be {{structurally}} different from nuclear DNA. Cytoplasmic DNA is less methylated than DNA found within the nucleus. It was also confirmed that the sequences of cytoplasmic DNA was different from nuclear DNA in the same organism, showing that cytoplasmic DNAs are not simply fragments of nuclear DNA.|$|E
50|$|The Chlamydiaceae are {{a family}} of {{bacteria}} that belongs to the phylum Chlamydiae, order Chlamydiales. All Chlamydiaceae species are Gram-negative and express the family-specific lipopolysaccharide epitope αKdo-(2→8)-αKdo-(2→4)-αKdo (previously called the genus-specific epitope). Chlamydiaceae ribosomal RNA genes all have at least 90% DNA sequence identity. Chlamydiaceae species have varying inclusion morphology, varying <b>extrachromosomal</b> plasmid content, and varying sulfadiazine resistance.|$|E
50|$|The gene of {{interest}} is {{the target of the}} mosaic analysis. Cells lacking the <b>extrachromosomal</b> array also lack the functional gene {{of interest}}. Cells which develop normally without the array do not require the {{gene of interest}} for normal function. Cells which do not develop normally are said to require the gene. In this way, those cell lineages which require a specific gene can be identified.|$|E
50|$|His most {{prominent}} discovery was the proposal of the “Campbell model” of virus insertion, where viral DNA is {{inserted into the}} host chromosome, becoming covalently bonded to the bacterial DNA, and then remains dormant until activation. Dr. Campbell’s research was focused on a specific bacterial virus, phage lambda, and its host bacterium E. coli, but the model provided insights into how <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA can be inserted and excised in other organisms.|$|E
5000|$|Viral DNA is {{an example}} of <b>extrachromosomal</b> DNA. Understanding viral genomes is very {{important}} for understanding the evolution and mutation of the virus. Some viruses, such as HIV and oncogenetic viruses, incorporate their own DNA into the genome of the host cell. [...] Viral genomes can be made up of single stranded DNA (ssDNA), double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and can be found in both linear and circular form.|$|E
50|$|One {{of these}} {{pathways}} involves the gene Sir2, a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase. In yeast, Sir2 {{is required for}} genomic silencing at three loci: the yeast mating loci, the telomeres and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In some species of yeast, replicative aging may be partially caused by homologous recombination between rDNA repeats; excision of rDNA repeats results {{in the formation of}} <b>extrachromosomal</b> rDNA circles (ERCs). These ERCs replicate and preferentially segregate to the mother cell during cell division, and are believed to result in cellular senescence by titrating away (competing for) essential nuclear factors. ERCs have not been observed in other species (nor even all strains of the same yeast species) of yeast (which also display replicative senescence), and ERCs are not believed to contribute to aging in higher organisms such as humans (they have not been shown to accumulate in mammals in a similar manner to yeast). <b>Extrachromosomal</b> circular DNA (eccDNA) has been found in worms, flies, and humans. The origin and role of eccDNA in aging, if any, is unknown.|$|E
