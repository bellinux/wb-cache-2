5|$|Because the fox {{returns to}} her husband each night as a woman but leaves <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> as a fox, she is called Kitsune. In {{classical}} Japanese, kitsu-ne means come and sleep, and ki-tsune means always comes.|$|E
5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning. His efforts to adjust to military life and become a good soldier included springing out of bed obediently <b>each</b> <b>morning,</b> which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager {{to wake up in}} the mornings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, BK co-branded {{several of its}} breakfast {{products}} with former parent Pillsbury; Pillsbury produced a fresh-baked biscuit product for the chain in 1996 and miniature cinnamon rolls called Cini-Minis in 1998. As part of the cachet built into the products, Burger King advertises that products are cooked fresh in the restaurant <b>each</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} {{sedentary}} lifestyle at this point, {{not having a}} great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours <b>each</b> <b>morning.</b> In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the railway {{dramatically}} ended Chesham's isolation. Commuting to London became possible for the first time, as did affordable excursions to the seaside resorts on {{the south and east}} coasts. The products of the area's industries and farms could for the first time be shipped cheaply to the markets of London, and London newspapers arrived <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> at 7.28am, in time for delivery.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} the busiest {{stop on the}} Westside line by 1999 {{with an average of}} 3,005 daily boardings. In March 2008, TriMet added {{additional}} capacity during the morning and evening commuting period. This was accomplished by extending three Red Line trains from the Beaverton Transit Center stop <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> and evening during peak ridership times.|$|E
5|$|Although little-used by passengers, Brill {{station was}} {{valuable}} {{as a relatively}} rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train <b>each</b> <b>morning.</b> There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the line, 17 trains per weekday ran in each {{direction}} at intervals of one hour from around 7am to around 11pm. The initial trains were drawn by Metropolitan Railway A and B Class locomotives. Most trains stopped at all stations, but a fast trains <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> ran between Chesham and Baker Street, taking 50 minutes from start to finish. On Sundays, trains again ran at hourly intervals, but only 12 trains per day ran and there was a three-hour gap in services in the morning to allow the railway's staff to attend church.|$|E

5|$|The Truman {{family moved}} into nearby Blair House during the renovations. As the newer West Wing, {{including}} the Oval Office, remained open, Truman walked {{to and from}} his work across the street <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon. In due course, {{the decision was made}} to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House, as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations. The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.|$|E
5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia <b>each</b> <b>morning.</b> Apparently {{under the impression that}} they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E
5|$|Charles Voorhis's {{job with}} Nash {{had taken him}} to {{a new home in}} Kenosha, Wisconsin; Jerry Voorhis joined his parents there on his return from Europe. As part of his {{recovery}} from his illness, he spent several weeks in northwestern Wyoming, working on a ranch. In Kenosha, he met a social worker named Alice Louise Livingston and married her on November 27, 1924, in her hometown of Washington, Iowa. Resuming his blue-collar career after his marriage, Voorhis moved to North Carolina with his wife and went to work in a Ford plant in Charlotte until being offered work as a teacher in an Illinois school for underprivileged boys, teaching three grades, coaching sports, and giving religious talks in the school's chapel <b>each</b> <b>morning.</b> This was followed by a year in Laramie, Wyoming, where the Voorhises founded and ran an orphanage for boys.|$|E

50|$|The WGN Morning News is an American morning {{television}} news program airing on WGN-TV (channel 9), a independent television station and national superstation in Chicago, Illinois {{that serves as}} the flagship station of the Tribune Broadcasting division of the Tribune Company. The program broadcasts <b>each</b> weekday <b>morning</b> from 4:00 to 10:00 a.m. and <b>each</b> weekend <b>morning</b> from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Central Time.|$|R
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. <b>Each</b> <b>morning,</b> 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 the {{nominally}} independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received {{permission for}} a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an above-ground junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley station. The LT and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> and evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900.|$|E

5|$|Operation Barbarossa, the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, began on 22June 1941. On the same day, the Ustaše began arresting communists and their known sympathisers in the towns of Bosanska Krajina, including Prijedor. The communists had predicted this, {{and most of them}} avoided capture by escaping to the villages or hiding in the towns. Stojanović {{was one of the few}} communists arrested in Prijedor. He was imprisoned with the Serb hostages on the second floor of a school in the town. They were subjected to forced labour, being led <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> through the town to repair the road to Kozarac. The column of hostages was usually headed by Stojanović carrying a shovel on his shoulder. The Croatian Home Guards guarding the prison treated him well. While detained, Stojanović lectured a group of hostages about Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had been worked out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate {{for a lack of}} material, Anderson got up early <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> to prepare music {{for the rest of the}} band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E
5|$|Rightwise's {{new market}} cross only survived in its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 {{of the participants in}} Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross <b>each</b> <b>morning</b> at 5.00am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E
