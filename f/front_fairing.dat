2500|$|Unique to USMC UH-1E {{helicopters}} between April 1967 and 1972 {{was the use}} of the Emerson Electric TAT-101 (Tactical Armament Turret-101) nose turret. The turret housed two M60 {{machine guns}} with 1000 rounds total, and had 100 degrees in azimuth left or right, plus 15 degrees of elevation and 45 degrees of depression. [...] The slew-rate on the turret was 45 degrees per second. [...] Jamming and the need for maintenance led to the turret's <b>front</b> <b>fairing</b> being left off to assist ground crews in quickly dealing with any problems, and these reasons combined in the USMC decision to drop the turrets from inventory entirely at the end of 1972.|$|E

In 2004, Honda released the Nicky Hayden special edition, which differed from previous models in that it had a brushed aluminum frame and swing arm, a sticker kit, and white number plates on the <b>front</b> upper <b>fairing</b> and tail fairing. 2003 was the first year that Honda made improvements to the SP-2, bringing in a stronger and much lighter swing arm.|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{an outcome of}} the work carried out in doing and {{completing}} my final year project, Design and analysis <b>front</b> hood <b>fairing</b> for cars. The paper presents {{a model of the}} <b>front</b> hood <b>fairing</b> for cars that can reduce the drag coefficient of the car, model that been used is proton Iswara. The overall duty is modeling and analyzes to get the best model that can reduce the coefficient of drag of the proton Iswara because of the high drag force at front windscreen. It happen when the airflow at the windscreen is disturbed by car wiper during high speed. It is often that the wiper system generates unwanted noise and vibration during the high speed. The report starts off with an introduction in aerodynamics vehicle and design. Then proceed to investigation about the problem at the front windscreen to get information. After gathering all the relevant information, the project undergoes design process. In this steps, from the knowledge gathered before is use to make a design refers to case data that suitable for the project. Several sketches have been made and only a few have been selected based on the suitability of the front hood and dimension of the windscreen. Based on the sketches, all the sketches will be draw into CAD software and simulate in the CFD software. At the end, the fairing that can reduce more coefficient of drag will be selected. The result shown by adding <b>fairing</b> at the <b>front</b> hood will decrease the pressure and wind noise also can be reduced. Then, the airflow will smooth and the performance of the car greater than before...|$|R

5000|$|Building {{began in}} 1810. Money was {{collected}} {{to pay for}} the buildings by encouraging rich merchants and businessmen to subscribe one hundred guineas each for the privilege of being able to nominate one boy to receive free education at Inst. The roof of the main building was completed during the winter of 1811. The Institution was formally opened at 1:00pm on 1 February 1814. William Drennan announced that the aim was to ‘diffuse useful knowledge, particularly among the middling orders of society, as a necessity, not a luxury of life.' He also referred to the particularly noble and rural setting of the school - in <b>front</b> a <b>fair</b> and flourishing town, and backed by a sublime and thought-inspiring mountain.
