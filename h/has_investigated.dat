A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, <b>has</b> <b>investigated</b> whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E

25|$|One {{publication}} <b>has</b> <b>investigated</b> 226 deaths {{attributed to}} GHB. Of 226 deaths included, 213 had a cardiorespiratory arrest and 13 had fatal accidents. Seventy-one deaths (34%) had no co-intoxicants. Postmortem blood GHB was 18–4400mg/L (median=347) in deaths negative for co-intoxicants.|$|E

25|$|Although the law prohibits such {{practices}} and provides penalties for torture {{similar to those}} for homicide, {{there are reports that}} some police and prison guards continue to employ torture and brutality.

25|$|Amon's {{more recent}} work <b>has</b> <b>investigated</b> the {{regulation}} of chromosome segregation and how chromosomes are accurately transmitted to gametes in meiosis by examining gene regulatory networks. She identified two regulatory networks (FEAR and MEN) that promote the release of CDC14 which {{have the potential to}} identify the mechanisms that control the final stages of the mitotic cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|Research {{in applied}} {{psychology}} <b>has</b> <b>investigated</b> practices of meat eating {{in relation to}} morality, emotions, cognition, and personality characteristics.

25|$|A related line of {{research}} <b>has</b> <b>investigated</b> 'behavioural inhibition' in infants – early signs of an inhibited and introspective or fearful nature.
