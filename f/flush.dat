5|$|Operation Royal <b>Flush</b> was a {{military}} deception employed by the Allied Nations during the Second World War {{as part of the}} strategic deception Operation Bodyguard. Royal <b>Flush</b> was a political deception which expanded on the efforts of another Bodyguard deception, Operation Graffham, by emphasising the threat to Norway. It also lent support to parts of Operation Zeppelin via subtle diplomatic overtures to Spain and Turkey. The idea was that information from these neutral countries would filter back to the Abwehr (German Intelligence). Planned in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate, Royal <b>Flush</b> was executed throughout June by various Allied ambassadors to the neutral states. During implementation the plan was revised several times to be less extreme in its diplomatic demands. Information from neutral embassies was not well trusted by the Abwehr; as a result, Royal <b>Flush</b> had limited impact on German plans through 1944.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{velocity}} of dripline <b>flushing</b> in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems affects system design, cost, management, performance, and longevity. A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted <b>flushing</b> velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of <b>flushing</b> and three <b>flushing</b> frequencies (no <b>flushing</b> or <b>flushing</b> every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the <b>flushing</b> water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the <b>flushing</b> water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline <b>flushing</b> velocities, which also resulted in greater <b>flushing</b> volumes, tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the <b>flushing</b> water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of <b>flushing</b> nor the interaction of <b>flushing</b> frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the <b>flushing</b> water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no <b>flushing</b> or with slower dripline <b>flushing</b> velocities. As <b>flushing</b> velocity and concurrently <b>flushing</b> volume increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline. At the end of the field study, the average emitter discharge as measured in the laboratory for a total of 3970 emitters was 0. 64 L/h. which was significantly less (approximately 2. 5 %) than the discharge for new and unused emitters. Only six emitters were nearly or fully clogged, with discharges between 0 % and 5 % of new and unused emitters. <b>Flushing</b> velocity and flushin...|$|R

50|$|<b>Flushing</b> citizens, {{feeling they}} had been tricked into {{building}} the <b>Flushing</b> and Woodside in order to scare the <b>Flushing</b> and North Side into selling out to the LIRR, convinced wealthy residents of College Point and Whitestone, including Conrad Poppenhusen, to incorporate the <b>Flushing</b> and North Side Railroad in 1868. This company {{had the right to}} build a line from Long Island City to <b>Flushing</b> and beyond to Roslyn, with a branch from <b>Flushing</b> to Whitestone. The group gained control of the unfinished <b>Flushing</b> and Woodside Railroad, and opened its line to <b>Flushing,</b> paralleling the LIRR from Long Island City to Woodside, in 1868 and to College Point and Whitestone in 1869. This new line attracted most of the traffic from the older New York and <b>Flushing,</b> and the LIRR {{wanted to get rid of}} its <b>Flushing</b> branch. In 1869, the New York State Legislature authorized the <b>Flushing</b> and North Side to buy the New York and <b>Flushing</b> east of the LIRR crossing at Winfield Junction connections were built by the <b>Flushing</b> and North Side at Woodside/Winfield and <b>Flushing</b> to connect its lines. The New York and <b>Flushing</b> continued to own the line west of Winfield, and soon became the South Side Railroad's access to Long Island City. The segment between what was to become the former Laurel Hill Station and Winfield Station, was abandoned for passenger service in 1875, and completely abandoned in 1880. Part of the right-of-way ran through what is today the Mount Zion Jewish Cemetery in Maspeth.

40|$|Dripline <b>flushing</b> is a {{maintenance}} procedure that {{is recommended for}} all microirrigation systems. However, <b>flushing</b> velocity and <b>flushing</b> duration, which particularly affect the design and management of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems, have not been studied extensively. For {{a better understanding of}} the <b>flushing</b> process in driplines and manifolds, a laboratory study was conducted at Kansas State University with a 10 m transparent pipe simulating an SDI dripline. Three different sediments with sizes up to 500 µm were introduced into the pipeline, and their distribution along the pipeline was analyzed under different <b>flushing</b> velocities over various times. Head loss under the conditions of this study increased exponentially with increased <b>flushing</b> velocity, suggesting that the flow regimes could be characterized between moving beds and heterogeneous flow. The percentage of pipeline blockage was logarithmically related to the <b>flushing</b> velocity, with greater than 30 % of the pipeline occupied by larger sand sediments when the <b>flushing</b> velocity was less than 0. 3 m sˉ¹. Although <b>flushing</b> velocities at or near the calculated deposition velocity could remove the majority of the sediments with a short duration of 15 min or less, <b>flushing</b> velocities that were approximately 45 % to 65 % of the deposition velocity could achieve similar sediment removal with longer <b>flushing</b> duration (up to 180 min). The ASAE EP- 405 recommended minimum <b>flushing</b> velocity of 0. 3 m sˉ¹ still appears adequate for most microirrigation systems operating under typical conditions. Designers are encouraged to calculate the deposition velocity for new microirrigation systems and to use it as a flexible guideline to assess the adequacy of <b>flushing.</b> End-users are encouraged to extend the duration of <b>flushing</b> for perhaps as long as 5 min after the initial concentration of sediments are removed to improve overall <b>flushing.</b> Further research is warranted to evaluate <b>flushing</b> velocity, but the results of this study should be representatively instructive of the phenomenon of sediment transport in microirrigation driplines during <b>flushing...</b>|$|R
