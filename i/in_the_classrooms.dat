The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E

Qualitative research is used as the mode of inquiry for this research study. The main mode of data collection is the questionnaire that elicits information on the respondents’ views of the use of technology on <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> Participants for this study were seven local English teachers <b>in</b> Malaysia. <b>The</b> findings indicate that although Malaysian English teachers were using technology and have positive perceptions towards using technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> they feel it is crucial for them to undergo training in this aspect. They view time constraint and access to equipment as the main obstacles to implementing technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> This research concludes that although Malaysian teachers are faced with some difficulties in implementing technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> they see a value in technology and want to use technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms,</b> {{the highest}} {{priorities}} were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge {{of the subject}} matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial (or secular) schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior plants compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The teachers were selected for religiosity, not teaching skills; the outcome was pious children and a reduced risk of marriage to Protestants.|$|E

The next year, more than 30 graduating Seniors in the school (including many student leaders) complained that Tech's curriculum was old and outdated.

500|$|By the 1850s racist {{ideology}} in Minnesota began {{to match the}} rest of the U.S. gradually erasing some earlier social norms. The ruling class was composed of primarily Anglo-American Protestants. Settlers from the U.S. increasingly discussed [...] "white" [...] inhabitants as the key to Minnesota's future with an eye toward marginalizing the role that other [...] "inferior" [...] races would have in the future. Author James Wesley Bond in 1853 described Minnesota before the 1850s as [...] "a waste of woodland and prairie, uninhabited save by the different hordes of savage tribes from time immemorial." [...] Prejudices in the territory, however, were complicated. As late as 1840 mulattos in Saint Paul were commonly treated as equals to others in the community with children of all races attending the same schools. By the late 1840s, however, all blacks had been completely disenfranchised. In addition they were prevented from running for office and their children were segregated in schools. By contrast Irish Catholics and Native Americans who adopted European lifestyles were allowed to vote and their children were not segregated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Paradoxically whereas Anglo-Americans generally accepted business development by African Americans, they largely opposed business development by Irish immigrants.|$|E

It then cuts to two separate lines of male and female students, the latter being led by Lisa and Jessica, marching down a school corridor. They were led by a teacher with a whip in her hand while being watched on surveillance cameras. The scene then shifts to the male students walking past a sign that says [...] "no girls beyond this point". The first verse then begins and the students are marching into a classroom and sit at individual tables. When the chorus begins, Lisa and Jessica are standing on a stage in front of their band performing for rows of still students who stare back blankly. When the second verse begins the students are in the classroom while guards patrol its perimeter and the teacher hits a blackboard with a pointing stick. During the second chorus Lisa and Jessica get their band members together in a toilet to start their rebellion at the school. When the bridge starts smash cuts are shown of them taking over the school's PA system, and the students getting up from their chairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> and throwing objects at a teacher {{standing in front of a}} blackboard.
