30|$|In the {{remainder}} of this section we study a variation on the strict WPMF structure which resolves the difficulty of imposing a target rotation and enables us to make some useful connections with existing composite pulse sequences in NMR. This variation involves partitioning the control modulation into a target rotation P(θ, 0) followed by a sequence of phase-modulated <b>identity</b> <b>operations</b> ∏_l = 1 ^M P(2 π,ϕ_l) with the ϕ_l chosen such that amplitude noise is filtered to some order. Here the operator P(θ,ϕ) denotes the rotation through angle θ about σ̂_ϕ. By insisting these M ‘correction’ segments are all <b>identity</b> <b>operations,</b> the phase modulations do not produce complicated rotation paths and the net rotation is determined simply by the initial target pulse.|$|R

2500|$|A {{family of}} sets closed under the {{symmetric}} difference operation can be described algebraically as a vector space over the two-element finite field [...] This field has two elements, 0 and 1, and its addition and multiplication operations {{can be described as}} the familiar addition and multiplication of integers, taken modulo2. A vector space consists of a set of elements together with an addition and scalar multiplication operation satisfying certain properties generalizing the properties of the familiar real vector spaces; for the cycle space, the elements of the vector space are the Eulerian subgraphs, the addition operation is symmetric differencing, multiplication by the scalar1 is the <b>identity</b> <b>operation,</b> and multiplication by the scalar0 takes every element to the empty graph, which forms the additive identity element for the cycle space.|$|E
