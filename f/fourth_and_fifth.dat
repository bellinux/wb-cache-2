5|$|Monteverdi's first {{fifteen years}} of service in Mantua are {{bracketed}} by his publications of the third book of Madrigals in 1592 and the <b>fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>fifth</b> books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period {{is a matter of}} conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the <b>fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>fifth</b> books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.|$|E

5|$|The X-Files {{was filmed}} in the hiatus between the show's <b>fourth</b> <b>and</b> <b>fifth</b> seasons and re-shoots were {{conducted}} during the filming of the show's fifth season.

50|$|In medieval music, the {{tonality}} of {{the common}} practice period had not yet developed, and many examples may be found with harmonic structures that are built on <b>fourths</b> <b>and</b> <b>fifths.</b> The Musica enchiriadis of the mid 10th century, a guidebook for musical practice of the time, described singing in parallel <b>fourths,</b> <b>fifths,</b> <b>and</b> octaves. This development continued, and the music of the Notre Dame school may be considered the apex of a coherent harmony in this style.|$|R

50|$|The Classic tuning shows another {{advantage}} as well: The regular tunings in <b>fourths</b> <b>and</b> <b>fifths</b> remain consistent {{in each of}} the two parts of the instrument; regular tunings facilitate learning by beginners, as well as transposition and improvisation by advanced players.
