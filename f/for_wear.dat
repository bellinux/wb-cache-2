5|$|Mandarin square: Mandarin squares {{were large}} {{embroidered}} badges sewn onto the surcoat of an officials in Imperial China, Korea and Vietnam. It was embroidered with detailed, colourful animal or bird insignia indicating {{the rank of}} the official wearing it. Mandarin squares were first authorized <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> in 1391 by the Ming Dynasty. The use of squares depicting birds for civil officials and animals for military officials was {{an outgrowth of the}} use of similar squares, apparently for decorative use, in the Yuan Dynasty. The original court dress regulations of the Ming Dynasty were published in 1368, but did not refer to badges as rank insignia.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's Transformation Plan, the 3rd Brigade, 75th Division was redesignated as the 166th Aviation Brigade, {{under the}} command of Division West of the First Army. Its mission would be to train and {{mobilize}} aviation units of the Army's reserve and national guard components. It was to be the only brigade under the First Army that specialized in training for Army aviation units. It was activated 1 December 2006 as a reserve unit at Fort Riley. The brigade became a partner organization of the 1st Infantry Division, which was stationed at Fort Riley and could provide better support than the headquarters of First Army Division West, which was headquartered at Fort Carson, Colorado and maintained units all over the western United States. The brigade received a shoulder sleeve insignia on 13 June 2007, but it has not been authorized <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> due to First Army policy requiring its units to wear its SSI.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} hard, but also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine {{the weight of the}} final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or <b>for</b> <b>wear,</b> in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. Some of them may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006, the {{national}} supply division of the National Eagle Scout Association (NESA) began to issue replica Eagle Scout medals for specific wear on U.S. military dress uniforms. These medals were designed to be proportionate to other military medals: they contained the same pendant, but no scroll, and a ribbon {{that had been made}} thinner and more rectangular in shape. However, in December 2007, the NESA stopped selling the mini-medal after service uniforming committees all contacted the BSA and asked them to stop promoting the medal <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> on military dress uniforms. The Eagle Scout medal is not authorized <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> on any U.S. military uniform.|$|E

25|$|In August 2016 the U.S. Navy {{announced}} that it is eliminating the NWU Type I {{in favor of the}} Type III which will completely replace it by 1 October 2019 <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> as the standard working uniform ashore for all Navy personnel. Type III will begin being issued to new navy recruits in October 2017. The Type II will remain restricted to wear by Naval Special Warfare sailors when in desert environments. The Navy's goal of developing a single working uniform <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> aboard ship and ashore and by all ranks and rates which the NWU Type I was supposed to fulfill was never realized by the Type I. Soon after its introduction it was found to be unsuitable for shipboard wear because of its lack of flame resistance and so was banned from wear aboard ship (except for when in port) thus making it essentially a uniform to be worn while ashore only. As a uniform <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> ashore only, a pattern designed to conceal stains aboard ships is not nearly as effective at concealment as a pattern designed to conceal people on land, thus the IIIs are used ashore. The Navy continues to work to develop a new shipboard working uniform.|$|E
