If a fuel-cell is used as generator in decentralized energy generation to operate a grid in island or emergency power mode, the required load power- this includes active and reactive power-has to be delivered at all times. In order to meet this demand under island and emergency power modes electrical <b>energy</b> <b>buffers</b> have to {{be integrated into the}} decentralized <b>energy</b> generator.

50|$|Several {{large-scale}} {{energy storage}} suggestions for the grid have been done. Worldwide there is over 100 GW of Pumped-storage hydroelectricity. This improves efficiency and decreases energy losses but a conversion to an energy storing mains electricity grid {{is a very}} costly solution. Some costs could potentially be reduced by making use of energy storage equipment the consumer buys and not the state. An example is batteries in electric cars that would double as an <b>energy</b> <b>buffer</b> for the electricity grid. However besides the cost, setting-up such a system {{would still be a}} very complicated and difficult procedure. Also, energy storage apparatus' as car batteries are also built with materials that pose a threat to the environment (e.g. Lithium).

50|$|The {{mitochondrial}} {{creatine kinase}} (CKm) {{is present in}} the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it regenerates phosphocreatine (PCr) from mitochondrially generated ATP and creatine (Cr) imported from the cytosol. Apart from the two mitochondrial CK isoenzyme forms, that is, ubiquitous mtCK (present in non-muscle tissues) and sarcomeric mtCK (present in sarcomeric muscle), there are three cytosolic CK isoforms present in the cytosol, depending on the tissue. Whereas MM-CK is expressed in sarcomeric muscle, that is, skeletal and cardiac muscle, MB-CK is expressed in cardiac muscle, and BB-CK is expressed in smooth muscle and in most non-muscle tissues. Mitochondrial mtCK and cytosolic CK are connected in a so-called PCr/Cr-shuttle or circuit. PCr generated by mtCK in mitochondria is shuttled to cytosolic CK that is coupled to ATP-dependent processes, e.g. ATPases, such as acto-myosin ATPase and calcium ATPase involved in muscle contraction, and sodium/potassium ATPase involved in sodium retention in the kidney. The bound cytosolic CK accepts the PCr shuttled through the cell and uses ADP to regenerate ATP, which can then be used as energy source by the ATPases (CK is associated intimately with the ATPases, forming a functionally coupled microcompartment). PCr is not only an <b>energy</b> <b>buffer</b> but also a cellular transport form of energy between subcellular sites of energy (ATP) production (mitochondria and glycolysis) and those of energy utilization (ATPases).Thus, CK enhances skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle contractility, and is involved in the generation of blood pressure.|$|E

To deal with the intermittent nature of the input source, the system state (e. g. registers and RAM) is saved to Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) before a power failure, and restored when the power supply recovers. Existing approaches save the entire state of the system upon power failure, but this is energy and time consuming.
