500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. Bill Sammon, the Washington {{managing editor for}} Fox News Channel, claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the {{years leading up to}} the economic crisis of 2008. In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, 'Hey—(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to put people in homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with TheWrap, Freeman {{was asked if}} he considered himself atheist or agnostic. [...] He replied, [...] "It's a hard question because as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start, I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and I do, it's because I think I'm God." [...] Freeman later said that his experience working on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman did not change his views on religion.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2011, {{the newly}} {{appointed}} United States ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza visited Nakhchivan but was inexplicably refused access to Julfa by Azerbaijani authorities. Bryza {{had intended to}} investigate the cemetery but instead was told by government authorities that they would help facilitate a new trip in the coming months. In a statement released by the US embassy in Baku, Bryza stated that [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time the cemetery destruction was reported, the desecration of cultural sites [...] especially a cemetery [...] is a tragedy, which we deplore, regardless of where it happens." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins' albums Monuments to an Elegy (2014) {{and their}} {{upcoming}} tenth album (2016) will conclude the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project. Corgan is unsure when Teargarden by Kaleidyscope {{will result in}} a box set, as originally announced, but it could include up to approximately 60 previously unreleased demos recorded for the project. He also stated that the future of the band is up in the air following the project's completion, saying: [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Teargarden project, I looked at it like, OK, I'm going to take this journey, and when this journey is over—which it now will be with Day for Night—it will [...] be the beginning [...] a new era of what the Smashing Pumpkins could be in the 21st century, or it will be the end. In big capital letters. Goodbye, I'm done." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{its home}} country, Greek critic Dimitris Danikas gave the film {{a rating of}} eight out of ten ("with enthusiasm") and characterizes it as [...] "black, surreal, nightmarish." [...] He {{believes}} that Dogtooth is as important for Greek cinema as Theodoros Angelopoulos' 1970 film Reconstitution. He {{goes on to say}} [...] "Lanthimos composes and goes from one level to another like a wildcat-creator, constantly and continuously maintaining the same rigorous style. Hence the aphasia; hence the uniformity; hence the submission and the scheduled mass culture; hence also the serial killer; hence, however, the disobedience, the anarchy. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning: Dogtooth has the surrealism of Buñuel, the scalpel of Haneke, the underground horror of a thriller without the splatter. Perfect." [...] Danikas characterized Dogtooth's Academy Award nomination as [...] "the greatest Greek triumph of recent years." [...] Columnist Dimitris Bouras, writing for Kathimerini, refers to [...] "the beneficial effects that the prestigious award could have" [...] and believes that the nomination reveals three interesting facts: [...] "1) in Greece we need to be extroverts (and not only in cinema), 2) exportable product is whatever has an identity, 3) Dogtooths nomination is like an investment – manna from the heaven of Hollywood for the developing Greek cinema." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{a curious}} story altogether, I admit. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning, I do not myself believe it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's {{all right}} for you,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> jumping <b>at</b> <b>the</b> idea. 'I haven't an extra master's certificate. I'm only a passenger. I confess it funks me.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{read your}} 'Ring of Bells' {{in one of}} the {{magazines}} quite a time ago," [...] he said. [...] "It was as good as Poe. Splendid, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, splendid!" ...|$|E
60|$|FALDER. [With instinctive {{apprehension}} of some change--looking {{from one to}} the other] There's been nothing between us, sir, to prevent it.... What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trial was true. And last night we only just sat in the Park.|$|E
6000|$|... "He will be {{overcome}} with grief on knowin' that by lingerin' to speak once more {{with his father}} we were captured, an' I fear the lad may be led to some foolishly reckless move," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same moment trying to stifle a groan.|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> amused <b>at</b> <b>the</b> incredulous disgust of his tone. [...] "I {{must run}} up to town, to-morrow morning. Let us go together. You {{have a set of}} {{travelling}} chessmen." ...|$|R
60|$|Anyway, it's an ill {{business}} to criticise another people's shortcomings. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start {{was that the}} British are just as humorous as are the Americans, or the Canadians, or any of us across the Atlantic, and for greater Certainty I repeat it at the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{expressed}} her feelings, poor child," [...] said Mrs. Lecount. [...] "I {{thought it}} hard to send her back her letter, but your dear father knew best. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was, Why not let her express her feelings? What are a few threatening words, after all? In her position, poor creature, they are words, and nothing more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bolter's firm {{used to get}} sheep {{by every}} mail from ---, and send them {{regularly}} to their station, six miles off. One time they landed late in the afternoon, and yet were foolishly sent off, Bolter in charge. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time he would lose half the lot, {{as it would be}} dark long before he could reach the station.

6000|$|... "You {{must have}} had some great shock," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{astonished}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight, [...] "some terrible illness in your youth. Or perhaps it arises from a more chronic cause--a constant gnawing anxiety. I have known men as young as you whose hair was as grey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is so generous, {{and shows}} so much fine feeling, {{that it is}} almost a duty to mention it. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that I always would mention it on every {{suitable}} occasion, without regard to personal sensitiveness. A--well--a--it's of no use to disguise the fact--you must know, Mr Clennam, that it does sometimes occur that people who come here desire to offer some little--Testimonial--to the Father of the place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'B'George, he said he'd have thief and swag {{both inside}} of three days --he did, by hokey! and that's {{just about a}} week ago.

It was the blessedest idea that ever I struck!" ...|$|E
60|$|MITCHENER. I never {{supposed}} {{it would}} make much difference. What I cant stand is giving in to that Pankhurst lot. Hang it all, Balsquith, it seems only yesterday that we put them in quod for a month. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that it {{ought to have been}} ten years. If my advice had been taken this wouldnt have happened. Its a consolation to me that events are proving how thoroughly right I was.|$|E
6000|$|There {{it was in}} {{the park}} {{that for the first time}} I pitted myself against life upon a {{definite}} issue, and prepared my first experience of defeat.

6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Flora, tossing her head. 'I dare say!' and {{she gave}} him another of the old looks.
