40|$|As {{the first}} line of defense against invading pathogen, {{intestinal}} epithelium produces various antimicrobial proteins (AMP) that help in clearance of pathogen. Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is a 55 kDa AMP that is expressed in intestinal epithelium. Dysregulation of BPI in intestinal epithelium is associated with various inflammatory diseases like Crohn’s Disease, Ulcerative colitis, and <b>Infectious</b> <b>enteritis’s.</b> In this paper, we report a direct correlation between intestinal damage and BPI expression. In Caco- 2 cells, we see a significant increase in BPI levels upon membrane damage mediated by S. aureus infection and pore-forming toxins (Streptolysin and Listeriolysin). Cells detect changes in potassium level as a Danger-associated molecular pattern associated with cell damage and induce BPI expression in a p 38 dependent manner. These results are further supported by in vivo findings that the BPI expression in murine intestinal epithelium is induced upon infection with bacteria which cause intestinal damage (Salmonella Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri) whereas mutants that do not cause intestinal damage (STM ΔfliC and STM ΔinvC) did not induce BPI expression. Our results suggest that epithelial damage associated with infection act as a signal to induce BPI expression...|$|R
40|$|An {{epizootic}} causing mortality among cultured {{summer flounder}} Paralichthys dentatus occurred in summer of 1998 at a land-based facility on Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. The disease, flounder <b>infectious</b> necrotizing <b>enteritis</b> (FINE), {{was characterized by}} reddening around the anal area, distended abdomens filled with opaque serosanguineous fluid, enteritis and necrosis of the posterior intestine. In extreme cases of the disease, the posterior intestine was detached from the anus and was observed coming out the vent. The intestine of individuals that recovered from the dsease ended in a blind-sac; the abdomens of these fish were distended, due to food and water inside the intestinal blind-sac. A bacterium was isolated from ascites fluid and kidney of moribund flounder and identified as the causative agent in challenge experiments. The pathogen was identified as Vibno carchariae by morphological and biochemical characteristics and sequence of the 16 S rRNA.

We reviewed the existing literature references on MAP to (i) determine the potential impact of MAP infection in wildlife species; (ii) analyze whether wildlife reservoirs are relevant regarding MAP control in domestic ruminants; (iii) assess the importance of MAP as the cause of potential interferences with tuberculosis diagnosis in wildlife. The mean MAP prevalence reported in wildlife was 2. 41 % (95 % confidence interval 1. 76 - 3. 06). Although MAP should be considered an important disease in farmed cervids, its impact on free-ranging species is questionable.

40|$|DsbA, a {{disulfide}} bond catalyst, {{is necessary}} for realization of the pathogenic potential of Shigella flexneri. Sh 42, a mutant strain differing from wild-type M 90 TS solely because it expresses nonfunctional DsbA 33 G (substitution for 33 C at the active site), secreted less IpaB and IpaC than M 90 TS in response to various stimuli in vitro. A kinetic study demonstrated that Sh 42 responded more slowly to Congo red than M 90 TS. By modulating relative concentrations of functional and nonfunctional DsbA within bacteria, functional enzyme {{has been shown to}} be necessary for intercellular spread. By confocal microscopy, M 90 TS dividing in protru-sions was shown to secrete Ipa proteins from the septation furrow, anticipating lysis of protrusions, while Sh 42 showed minimal Ipa secretion in this location. In the light of a previous demonstration that DsbA is not necessary for entry of epithelial cells, we conclude that a role in virulence of this disulfide bond catalyst lies in facilitating secretion of Ipa proteins specifically within epithelial protrusions, in turn allowing cell-to-cell spread of S. flexneri.

40|$|Summer {{flounder}} (Paralichthys dentatus) {{constitutes a}} major fishery {{in the coastal}} northeastern United States. Spurred by population declines, cultivation of summer flounder began in 1996, but expansion of culture efforts has been constrained by disease outbreaks. Flounder <b>Infectious</b> Necrotizing <b>Enteritis</b> (FINE) causes significant mortality of juvenile flounder. The disease is characterized by ascites, intestinal prolapse, and severe inflammation of the mesentery and posterior intestinal serosa, often resulting in intestinal rupture. FINE is caused by Vibrio harveyi, a bacterial pathogen of cultured marine fish and invertebrates. To better understand the immune response to FINE, recruitment and fluctuation of leukocytes within the summer flounder peritoneum were investigated during intraperitoneal challenge with V. harveyi. Consistent with the pathology of FINE, massive infiltration of large granular leukocytes was observed in coelom of flounder 24 hours after intra-peritoneal injection of live bacteria. In these fish, the number of lymphocytes doubled, though the number of B-cells was {{not significantly different from}} saline-injected animals. The large influx of granular cells resulted in a 15 -fold increase in that population, decreasing the lymphocyte population from ~ 65 % to ~ 20 % of the total coelomic leukocyte pool.

In spite of the severe diarrhea, histopathologic changes in the intestine were mild and there was a surprising lack of inflammation.

AIM: To investigate BPI as a possible target antigen for ANCAs in inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: ANCAs were detected by routine immunofluorescence (IIF) and solid phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed for antibodies to the purified neutrophil granule proteins; MPO, PR 3, cathepsin-G, lactoferrin, and BPI in serum samples from 88 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (36 with Crohn's disease, 52 with ulcerative colitis). Thirty patients with bacterial enteritis acted as controls. RESULTS: Significantly more patients with ulcerative colitis were ANCA positive by IIF (60 %) than patients with Crohn's disease (28 %) or <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> (23 %) (p < 0. 001). IgG anti-BPI antibodies were present in 29 % of patients with ulcerative colitis, 14 % of patients with Crohn's disease, and 23 % of patients with <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis,</b> occurring in 44 % of those patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were ANCA positive by IIF. Antibodies to other ANCA antigens were rare.

40|$|Fluoroquinolone is a {{commonly}} prescribed antimicrobial agent, {{and up to}} 20 % of its users registers adverse gastroenterological symptoms. We aimed to evaluate the association between use of fluoroquinolone and gastrointestinal tract perforation. We conducted a nested case-control study on a national health insurance claims database between 1998 and 2011. The use of fluoroquinolones was classified into current (< 60 days), past (61 - 365 days prior to the index date) and any prior year use of fluoroquinolones. We used the conditional logistic regression model to estimate rate ratios (RRs), adjusting or matching by a disease risk score (DRS). We identified a cohort of 17, 510 individuals diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation and matched them to 1, 751, 000 controls. Current use of fluoroquinolone {{was associated with the}} greatest increase in risk of gastrointestinal perforations after DRS score adjustment (RR, 1. 90; 95 % CI, 1. 62 - 2. 22). The risk of gastrointestinal perforation was attenuated for past (RR, 1. 33; 95 % CI, 1. 20 - 1. 47) and any prior year use (RR, 1. 46; 95 % CI, 1. 34 - 1. 59). To gain insights into whether the observed association can be explained by unmeasured confounder, we compared the risk of gastrointestinal perforation between fluoroquinolone and macrolide. Use of macrolide, an active comparator, was not associated with a significant increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation (RR, 1. 11, 95 %CI, 0. 15 - 7. 99). Sensitivity analysis focusing on perforation requiring in-hospital procedures also demonstrated an increased risk associated with current use. To mitigate selection bias, we have also excluded people who have never used fluoroquinolone before or people with <b>infectious</b> colitis, <b>enteritis</b> or gastroenteritis. In both of the analysis, a higher risk of gastrointestinal perforation was still {{associated with the use of}} fluoroquinolone.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (Map) causes an <b>infectious</b> chronic <b>enteritis</b> (paratuberculosis or Johne's disease) principally of ruminants. The epidemiology of Map {{is poorly}} understood, particularly {{with respect to}} the role of wildlife reservoirs and the controversial issue of zoonotic potential (Crohn's disease). Genotypic discrimination of Map isolates is pivotal to descriptive epidemiology and resolving these issues. This study was undertaken to determine the genetic diversity of Map, enhance our understanding of the host range and distribution and assess the potential for interspecies transmission. Results 164 Map isolates from seven European countries representing 19 different host species were genotyped by standardized IS 900 - restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS 900 -RFLP), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and mycobacterial interspersed repeat unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analyses. Six PstI and 17 BstEII IS 900 -RFLP, 31 multiplex [SnaBI-SpeI] PFGE profiles and 23 MIRU-VNTR profiles were detected. AFLP gave insufficient discrimination of isolates for meaningful genetic analysis. Point estimates for Simpson's index of diversity calculated for the individual typing techniques were in the range of 0. 636 to 0. 664 but a combination of all three methods increased the discriminating power to 0. 879, sufficient for investigating transmission dynamics. Two predominant strain types were detected across Europe with all three typing techniques. Evidence for interspecies transmission between wildlife and domestic ruminants on the same property was demonstrated in four cases, between wildlife species on the same property in two cases and between different species of domestic livestock on one property. Conclusion The results of this study showed {{that it is necessary to}} use multiple genotyping techniques targeting different sources of genetic variation to obtain the level of discrimination necessary to investigate transmission dynamics and trace the source of Map infections. Furthermore, the combination of genotyping techniques may depend on the geographical location of the population to be tested. Identical genotypes were obtained from Map isolated from different host species co-habiting on the same property strongly suggesting that interspecies transmission occurs. Interspecies transmission of Map between wildlife species and domestic livestock on the same property provides further evidence to support a role for wildlife reservoirs of infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{that can}} be applied towards the {{diagnosis}} and prevention of Flounder <b>Infectious</b> Necrotizing <b>Enteritis</b> in summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), caused by the bacterial pathogen Vibrio harveyi, are presented in this research. Biochemical profiles are insufficient to differentiate V. harveyi from other closely related species. Biochemical profiles can, however, be used in conjunction with 16 S ribosomal DNA sequencing to provide a reliable method for identifying V. harveyi. A monitoring program for V. harveyi and other potential bacterial pathogens in cultured juvenile summer flounder found that V. harveyi was the most abundant and commonly found bacterial species in juvenile summer flounder at a commercial hatchery during the summer months. Presence of V. harveyi in summer flounder was not necessarily associated with large-scale mortalities, which only occurred after transport of juvenile fish. Temperatures of 25 °C and transport stress resulted in highest mortalities in experimental infections of summer flounder with V. harveyi. The susceptibility to experimental infection by V. harveyi strain DN 01, originally isolated from diseased summer flounder, was assessed for several economically or environmentally important fish species in the Northeast US including tautog, black sea bass, Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and mummichog. Vibrio harveyi strain DN 01 was significantly more virulent to summer flounder than to the other species tested. A mutant strain of V. harveyi (SGM 1) was created that was partially impaired in its ability to grow on a variety of media, including media with flounder intestinal mucus as a sole carbon source. The mutant also showed lower proteolytic activity in culture supernatants than the wild type. In experimental infections, the mutant was shown to be attenuated, however, it was not shown to be protective against subsequent exposure of summer flounder to wild type V. harveyi DN 01. In summary, V. harveyi is a major bacterial pathogen of juvenile summer flounder, capable of causing mortalities in situations of stress. Management options include maintaining fish at temperatures at or near 18 °C, reducing stress during transport, and timing production runs or transport {{in order to avoid the}} peak abundance of V. harveyi in incoming waters. ...|$|R

Previous experiments have shown that (a) soybean meal (SBM) alone could not replace FM in diets for cultured juvenile summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) {{and there were no}} growth differences among 20, 30, and 40 % SBM replacement of FM, but all were better than 50 % SBM replacement, and (b) that 40 % (but not 70 %) replacement of FM was possible, as long as 1. 0 % taurine was added to the diet. The current study tested whether higher levels of SBM could be included in FM diets if higher levels of taurine were used. Four SBM replacement levels (40, 50, 60, and 70 %), combined with two dietary taurine levels (1. 5 and 2. 0 %) were tested. A FM diet control was also included. Fish were fed for eight weeks and their survival and growth were measured. In addition, fish from three of the treatments (FM, 40 / 1. 5, and 70 / 1. 5) were subsequently subjected to a bacterial challenge with Vibrio harveyi, which is known to cause flounder <b>infectious</b> necrosis <b>enteritis</b> (FINE). Fish were intraperitoneally injected with V. harveyi and their survival was followed for 7 days. Survival and growth data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the survival of fish over time in the bacterial challenge was analyzed by SigmaStat log-rank survival analysis. ^ Survival ranged from 92 – 100 % in the various treatments of the feeding trial and was not significantly different among treatments. All of the SBM replacement diets yielded significantly less growth than the FM control. Diets containing 40, 50, 60 and 70 % SBM were not significantly different in the growth of fish. Level of taurine addition did not affect the outcome. It was not clear why the 40 % replacement diets with taurine did not perform as well as the FM control diets with respect to growth and food conversion ratio (FCR), as in our previous experiments. Results of the bacterial challenge indicated that fish fed the 40 / 1. 5 and 70 / 1. 5 diets had significantly better survival than did fish fed the FM diet. Any ability of SBM properties to confer added disease resistance to FINE would be tremendously beneficial. Cost savings in reduced management and treatment, as well as higher numbers of healthier fish for market are important advantages for success in aquaculture. Our results suggest that summer flounder diets containing 50 to 60 % SBM are just as effective as 40 % SBM, without significantly hindering growth or survival when amino acids, phytase, and at least 1. 5 % taurine are supplemented. SBM used in diets may provide immunostimulation to lessen juvenile summer flounder susceptibility to FINE infection. ...|$|R

40|$|Is {{the patient}} really {{suffering}} from acute appendicitis? Right lower quadrant pain {{is the most}} common sign of acute appendicitis. However, many other bowels pathologies might mimic acute appendicitis. Due to fear of the consequences of delayed or missed diagnosis, the indication for emergency appendectomy is liberally made. This {{has been shown to be}} associated with high rates of negative appendectomy with risk of potentially serious or lethal complications. Thus there is need for a better preoperative screening of patients with suspected appendicitis. This prospective single center single-blinded pilot study was conducted in the Department of surgery at the HELIOS Universitätsklinikum Wuppertal, Germany. Calprotectin was measured in pre-therapeutic stool samples of patients presenting in the emergency department with pain to the right lower quadrant. Fecal calprotectin (FC) values were analyzed using commercially available ELISA kits. Cut-off values for FC were studied using the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The Area under the curve (AUC) was reported for each ROC curve. The mean FC value was 51. 4 ± 118. 8 μg/g in patients with AA, 320. 9 ± 416. 6 μg/g in patients with <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> and 24. 8 ± 27. 4 μg/g in the control group. ROC curve showed a close to 80 % specificity and sensitivity of FC for AA at a cut-off value of 51 μg/g, AUC = 0. 7. The sensitivity of FC at this cut-off value is zero for enteritis with a specificity of 35 %. Fecal calprotectin could be helpful in screening patients with pain to the right lower quadrant for the presence of acute appendicitis or <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> with the aim of facilitating clinical decision-making and reducing the rate of negative appendectomy...|$|E
40|$|Entero{{endocrine}} cells (EEC) {{form the}} basis of the largest endocrine system in the body. They secrete multiple regulatory molecules which control physiological and homeostatic functions, particularly postprandial secretion and motility. Their key purpose is to act as sensors of luminal contents, either in a classical endocrine fashion, or by a paracrine effect on proximate cells, notably vagal afferent fibres. They also play a pivotal role in the control of food intake, and emerging data add roles in mucosal immunity and repair. We propose that EEC are fundamental in several gastrointestinal pathologies, notably Post-infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome, <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis,</b> and possibly inflammatory bowel disease.

40|$|Objective/Background: Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) is {{a chronic}} <b>infectious</b> granulomatous <b>enteritis,</b> {{primarily}} affecting ruminants, and caused by Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The disease is widely prevalent {{throughout the world}} with significant economic losses. MAP has also been implicated with human Crohn's disease. There exists {{a strong correlation between}} the immune response and development of various types of pathologies in ruminants. The polarization of the immune response, which is critical to clinical outcome of the paratuberculosis infection, is controlled by the differential expression of certain cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in Johne's disease. In previous studies, the role of different cytokines (Th 1 and Th 2) has been occasionally studied in sheep paratuberculosis. In the present study, we studied differential expression of interferon (IFN) -γ, interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 10, transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, iNOS, and TRAF 1 genes in MAP-infected sheep and established relationship with distinct pathologies. Methods: Tissue sections (small intestine, ileocecal junction, and mesenteric lymph nodes) were collected from sheep suspected for Johne's disease and appropriately preserved for RNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and histopathology. Pathologic grading was done on the basis of nature and extent of cellular infiltration, granuloma formation and abundance of acid-fast bacilli. Six sheep each with pauci (PB) - and multibacillary (MB) lesions and six healthy control sheep were selected for cytokine studies. MAP in tissue extracted genomic DNA of sheep was quantified by a quantitative PCR assay. Tissue extracted RNA was reversed transcribed to prepare c-DNA from which quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to amplify IFN-γ, IL- 1 β, IL- 10, TGF-β, β-actin, TRAF 1, and iNOS with Quantitect SYBR Green Master Mix. qRT-PCR data were analyzed using 2 −ΔΔCT method using β-actin gene as a control. All qRT-PCR results were compared by using one-way analysis of variance (least significance difference and Duncan tests) for p-value using SPSS (version 7. 5) for expression of each gene in tissues from infected and control sheep. Results: In the small intestine, PB sheep showed significant enhancements in the expression of IL- 10, TGF-β, iNOS, and IFN-γ in comparison to similar tissues from uninfected control sheep. IL- 1 α expression was significantly reduced (p < 0. 01). The expression of IL- 10 in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) tissue of PB sheep was significantly increased (p < 0. 01) as compared with the control sheep. MB sheep revealed significantly enhanced expression of TGF-β mRNA and reduction in the expression of IL- 1 α in comparison to control sheep. In the MLN of MB sheep, the expressions of IL- 10 and TGF-β were significantly (p < 0. 01) increased, and IFN-γ was significantly downregulated in comparison to uninfected control sheep. When the cytokine expression was compared between two distinctly infected groups, the MB sheep showed highly significant decrease (p < 0. 01) in the expression of iNOS and IFN-γ in the small intestine and IFN-γ in the MLN tissues. Conclusion: The present study indicated that IFN-γ and iNOS were found to play important role in the induction of Th 1 type immune response in PB sheep. MB sheep had significant reduction in expression of IFN-γ and iNOS and elevation of IL- 10 and TGF-β, which was typical of Th 2 cytokine pattern. Elevated expression of IL- 10 and TGF-β in PB cases possibly suggests the role of T-regulatory cells and may follow an independent mechanism not typical of Th 1 pattern. In view of significantly reduced expression in both forms of the disease, IL- 1 α may not be an important cytokine in ovine paratuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objective: Paratuberculosis or Johne's {{disease is}} a chronic <b>infectious</b> granulomatous <b>enteritis,</b> mainly of cattle, sheep, goats, and other {{domestic}} and wild animals caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Currently, MAP has been recognized as an important animal pathogen with significant zoonotic and public health concerns. The early detection of infected animals using suitable diagnostic methods helps in developing control and preventive strategies for the herd. Therefore, {{the present study was}} aimed to determine the comparative efficacy of certain diagnostic methods used in the identification and confirmation of MAP in the ovine tissues with distinct pathology of paratuberculosis. Methods: The ileum and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) tissues were collected from 38 sheep infected with paratuberculosis from organized farms of Rajasthan. These animals were further classified as paucibacillary (PB; n = 15) or multibacillary (MB; n = 23) on the basis of histopathological findings and mycobacterial loads. The ileum and MLN tissues of these animals were subjected to IS 900 and 251 gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacterial culture. The tissue sections from MB, PB, and uninfected control sheep groups were stained using indirect immunoperoxidase technique (IPT) and Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) method. Results: On bacterial culture examination of the ileum and MLN tissues using Herrold's egg yolk medium, MAP was isolated in 14 (60. 9 %) MB and 5 (33. 3 %) PB sheep. Of 38 sheep, IS 900 PCR detected 21 (55. 2 %) positive for MAP, of which 19 (82. 6 %) were MB and 2 (13. 3 %) were PB sheep. Similarly, 251 gene PCR detected 25 (65. 7 %) sheep positive for MAP infection, of which 21 (91. 3 %) were MB and 4 (27 %) were PB sheep. Thus, 251 gene PCR was found superior to IS 900 PCR in the detection of MAP from the tissues. In PB sheep, IPT and ZN tests were positive in 87. 5 % and 50 % of ileum sections and 70 % and 37. 5 % in MLN sections, respectively. In MB sheep, IPT and ZN tests detected all animals as positive for MAP organisms or antigen and had equal sensitivity in the detection of MAP. The overall sensitivity of IPT was found superior (95 %) to ZN staining (80 %) in the demonstration of acid-fast bacteria or its antigen in the tissues. Conclusion: The sensitivity of all the tests in the detection of MAP was lower in PB sheep than in MB sheep. Bacterial culture detected MAP in only 50 % of sheep and was found less sensitive than other tests used in the present study. Comparing the overall sensitivity of both the PCR assays, 251 gene PCR was found superior to IS 900 gene PCR. The sensitivity of IPT was found superior (95 %) to the ZN staining (80 %) in the demonstration of acid-fast bacteria in the tissues. In the present study, IPT was found superior in the detection of MAP in PB and MB form of ovine paratuberculosis. This test can be used in the confirmation of post mortem diagnosis and research of paratuberculosis along with histopathology. However, 251 gene PCR assay was found easier to perform than IPT and could be used as paratuberculosis screening test in endemic sheep farms for blood and fecal samples...|$|R
