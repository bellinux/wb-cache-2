30|$|Once {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} ASY on the term of the debt (short/long) {{and the type of}} market debt, public and private, we are interested in examining how information asymmetry influences the access to debt in the private debt market. In the subsequent analyses we study the association between ASY and <b>bank</b> <b>debt,</b> on one hand, and trade credit, on the other. We define our third dependent variable BNKDBT as the ratio <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> over total debt, and then we decompose BNKDBT into long-term and short-term <b>bank</b> <b>debt.</b> LNGBNK, our fourth dependent variable, is the ratio <b>of</b> long-term <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> over total debt; SHTBNK, our fifth dependent variable, is the ratio <b>of</b> short-term <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> to total debt; and ACCPAY, our sixth dependent variable, is the ratio of accounts payable to total debt. As a final analysis to examine in depth the firm’s choice of short-term financial sources under asymmetric information, we define our seventh dependent variable, TRDCRD, as the ratio of accounts payable to the sum <b>of</b> short-term <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> plus accounts payable. Based on information asymmetry theories of trade credit, if firms with higher information asymmetries face bank credit rationing they will use more trade credit instead (Smith 1987; Biais and Gollier 1997). Thus, we expect negative coefficients on ASY in the BNKDBT, LNGBNK, and SHTBNK regressions, 6 as well as positive coefficients on ASY in the ACCPAY and TRDCRD regressions.|$|R

40|$|We examine 242 NYSE/AMEX and OTC {{common stock}} offerings that reduce <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> and 254 that retire nonbank debt.

The significant difference in returns indicate <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> reductions transmits negative information beyond that previously cited in the stock offering literature. Regression tests show that the explanatory variable representing <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> signaling models best explains stock returns. █ Bankers are parties to information about a firm's financial condition through their special relationship as lenders. This premise is the basis for the predictions <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> signaling models, which posit that <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> issuance announcements convey positive news about a firm. Empirical research on debt offering announcements that raise cash for multi-corporate purposes supports this claim. The research documents statistically significant positive stock price reactions to <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> announcements and negative reactions to nonbank <b>debt</b> announcements. If <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> issuance announcements signal more favorable news than nonbank debt announcements, it follows that <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> reduction announcements should signal more negative news than nonbank debt reduction announcements. Market participants will view <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> reduction announcements as the result of decisions made by bankers acting upon unfavorable inside information. Our study extends prior research on equity offerings that reduce debt. We analyze 242 stock offering announcements that reduce <b>bank</b> <b>debt,</b> and 254 announcements that retire nonbank debt. Consistent with the predictions <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> signaling models, returns for <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> reductions are more negative than returns for nonbank debt reductions, and the differences in returns are statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently {{the popular}} Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) was {{reformed}} {{into what is}} now known as Private Finance 2 (PF 2). The move came {{against the backdrop of the}} unpleasant experiences which have bedeviled the PFI model leading to huge public sector bail-out and in some cases expensive buy-back schemes. One of the Principal areas being reformed is the financing structure which has often had a large portion <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt.</b> The cost <b>of</b> capital on this significant portion <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt,</b> studies have shown, has been responsible for the higher capital costs on past PFI projects. The proposed ideal financing structure for PF 2 must be low cost funds such as pension funds and insurance funds. While this paper does not go into detail on how to structure a PF 2 project using Islamic finance, it however argues that Islamic project finance holds a better promise for the financing of future PF 2 projects. This is because apart from being interest-free, it also entails the sharing of losses should they occur, an act conventional project financiers are highly averse to doing...|$|R

Using unique data on 325 first-time business start-ups, we find that firms in industries with high historical failure rates and entrepreneurs who value private control benefits use less <b>bank</b> <b>debt.</b> These effects are even strengthened in case assets have a high liquidation value and thus banks {{are more likely to}} liquidate the firm following default. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} optimal mixture and {{priority}} structure <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> and market <b>debt</b> using a trade-off {{model in which}} banks have the unique ability to renegotiate outside formal bankruptcy. Flexible <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> offers a superior trade-off between tax shields and bankruptcy costs. Ease <b>of</b> renegotiation limits <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> capacity, however. Optimal debt structure hinges upon which party has bargaining power in private workouts. Weak firms have high <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> capacity and utilize <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> exclusively. Strong firms lever up to their (lower) <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> capacity, augment with market debt, and place the bank senior. Therefore, the trade-off theory offers an explanation for: (i) why young/small firms use <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> exclusively; (ii) why large/mature firms employ mixed debt financing; and (iii) why <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> is senior. The trade-off theory also generates predictions consistent with international evidence. In countries in which the bankruptcy regime entails soft (tough) enforcement <b>of</b> contractual priority, <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> capacity is low (high), implying greater (less) reliance on market debt.

40|$|We use data on {{publicly}} traded U. K. firms {{to investigate whether}} financing choices differ systematically with R&D intensity. As well as looking at a balance sheet measure of the debt/assets ratio, we also consider the probability of raising finance by issuing new equity, and the shares <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> and secured debt in total debt. We find a nonlinear relationship with the debt/assets ratio: firms that report positive but low R&D use more debt finance than firms that report no R&D, {{but the use of}} debt finance falls with R&D intensity among those firms that report R&D. We find a simpler relationship with the probability of issuing new equity: Firms that report R&D are more likely to raise funds by issuing shares than firms that report no R&D, and this probability increases with R&D intensity. The shares <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> and secured debt in total debt are both lower for firms that report R&D compared to those that do not, and tend to fall as R&D intensity rises.

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} two seemingly unrelated {{branches of the}} literature that focuses on different aspects <b>of</b> a <b>bank's</b> interaction with its borrowers: the relative priority <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> <b>debt,</b> and the role <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> as "relationship lenders". Specifically, we show that bank seniority {{plays an important role}} in encouraging the formation of ongoing bank/firm relationships. Because the bank is senior, it is more able to reap the benefits from its relationship with the firm; because the firm has a relationship with a bank, it is more willing to exert effort, thus reducing the impact of a recession on its prospects. As a result, the firm's ex ante value is enhanced when the <b>bank's</b> <b>debt</b> is senior to that of the firm's other creditors. ...|$|R
