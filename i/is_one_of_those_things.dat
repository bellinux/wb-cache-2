You can’t approach them. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm With Cupid" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. Because they knew it would air on Valentine's Day, Fox asked the Simpsons staff to produce an episode related to the holiday. The episode's ending credits were also painted red {{in honor of the}} holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney, who also wrote the episode's first draft. The episode's title was pitched by fellow Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who based it on the popular T-shirt slogan I'm with stupid. However, Hauge later found out that the title had already been used before for an episode of another television series. However, he did not believe that copyright issues would arise: [...] "It's a very innocent mistake," [...] Hauge said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that, {{in the course of a}} career, you're gonna be on both sides of that, so nobody ever sues on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{praised the}} series' pop culture {{reference}}s. Carina Belles applauded the series for making subtle pop culture references, citing Pinkie Pie's mention of [...] "Chocolate Rain", {{a reference to}} a popular Internet meme. Many reviews and critics positively commented on the episode's ending, which featured a parody of the closing scenes to the original Star Wars. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 wrote positively of the scene, writing, [...] "Honestly, modern My Little Pony fandom <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> I'm live-and-let-live about, even though it baffles me entirely [...] this morning's episode of the show did a little homage to A New Hope." [...] i09 later named the scene one of [...] "The Best Television Moments of 2011". John Farrier from Neatorama wrote, [...] "It’s hard for Bronies to get respect from some quarters, but [...] scene alone says much in favor of the show." [...] The entertainment site Dorkly, an affiliate of CollegeHumor, featured a video comparing the two scenes and wrote, [...] "May the adorable be with you." [...] Topless Robot writer Anne Mathews named the Star Wars parody the [...] "Nerdiest Easter Egg" [...] in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, writing, [...] "This scene is a direct shoutout to the fans and completely cements the creator Lauren Faust's geek cred. The only thing missing is a Wookiee yell at the end!" ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{to those}} who refuse to be oedipalized {{in one form or}} another, at one end or the other in the treatment, the {{psychoanalyst}} is there to call the asylum or the police for help. The police on our side!—never did psychoanalysis better display its taste for supporting the movement of social repression, and for participating in it with enthusiasm. [...] notice of the dominant tone in the most respected associations: [...] consider Dr. Mendel and the Drs Stéphane, the state of fury that is theirs, and their literally police-like appeal at the thought that someone might try to escape the Oedipal dragnet. Oedipus <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that becomes all the more dangerous the less people believe in it; then the cops are there to replace the high priests.|$|E
2500|$|Flight attendants at {{the carrier}} voted to {{organize}} their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other {{issues in their}} work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012. In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters. Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has {{been critical of the}} unionization of airline employees and has stated that [...] "Unionization <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's first {{performance}} in 2005 {{was at the}} Live 8 concert, Barrie, Ontario on July 2 where the song [...] "Where Are You" [...] was premiered in its final form. For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And for us, this new record <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> where {{there are a lot}} of little guitar parts happening all over the place and little textures -- and we want to hear that stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto. The band entered a hiatus period after this while Maida worked on his solo album, The Hunter's Lullaby. They wouldn't play live again until mid-2008.|$|E

6000|$|The {{story of}} Dunstone is so slight, so trivial in its {{cardinal}} incidents, such a business of cheap feathers {{and bits of}} ribbon on the surface, that I should hesitate to tell it, {{were it not for}} its Inwardness, what one might call the symbolism of the thing. Frankly, I do not clearly see what that symbolism is, but I feel it hovering in some indefinable way whenever I recall his case.

60|$|She {{must stay}} in Brampton and do her work,--so much was clearly her duty, {{although}} {{she longed to}} flee from it. And at last she sat down and wrote to him.

The hope which she would not acknowledge, and the love which she strove to conceal from him seeped up between the words of her letter like water through grains of sand. Words, indeed, are but as grains of sand to conceal strong feelings, and as Cynthia read the letter over she felt that every line betrayed her, and knew that she could compose no lines which would not.|$|E
