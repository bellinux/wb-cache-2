5|$|Leslie asks April (Aubrey Plaza) {{to check}} on a {{budgeting}} request while they are gone. What should be a simple chore, however, has April waiting on hold at the phone for hours. When she desperately has to use the restroom, Andy agrees to wait by the phone. When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take. When Andy says he is jealous that his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hunting trip with Mark, April offers {{to give him a}} hickey to make Ann jealous, which Andy accepts.|$|E

25|$|Both polar caps are {{currently}} accumulating, confirming predicted Milankovich cycling on timescales of ~400,000 and ~4,000,000 years. Soundings by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter SHARAD indicate total cap growth of ~0.24 km3/year. Of this, 92%, or ~0.86mm/year, <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, as Mars' offset Hadley circulation {{acts as a}} nonlinear pump of volatiles northward.|$|E
25|$|The {{slope of}} the tangent line to the {{squaring}} function at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six {{times as fast as}} it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} characters, {{and three of}} them {{basically}} {{changed the course of}} British history. King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people. So I have an enormous responsibility to that, and then I have a responsibility to the actual auction, which really happened. Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is this girl who has this obsession and <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> auctions and stuff. So it's a much more layered, complicated piece than Filth and Wisdom.|$|E

500|$|After {{back-to-back}} November {{losses at}} home against St. Louis and Detroit dropped them to 7–4, the Giants playoff prospects were in question. In what would be his defining moment as Giants head coach, {{at a press conference}} following the Giants' loss to Detroit, Fassel guaranteed that [...] "This team <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> playoffs." [...] The Giants responded, winning the next week's game against Arizona and the rest of their regular season games to finish the season 12–4 and earn a bye as the NFC's top seed.|$|E
500|$|The 2000 {{season was}} {{considered}} a make-or-break year for Fassel. The conventional wisdom was that Fassel needed {{to have a strong}} year and a playoff appearance to save his job. After back-to-back losses at home against the St. Louis Rams and Detroit Lions, the Giants fell to 7–4, and their playoff prospects were in question. At a press conference following the loss to Detroit, Fassel guaranteed that [...] "his team <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> playoffs." [...] The Giants responded, winning the next week's game against Arizona and the rest of their regular season games to finish the season 12–4 and earn a bye and home-field advantage as the NFC's top seed.|$|E
500|$|The game {{featured}} three controversial officiating calls. Regarding {{the second}} quarter Tate touchdown, Fox NFL commentator Ronde Barber and Fox rules analyst Mike Pereira believed Tate had not controlled the ball while falling to the turf. On the contrary, NFL Vice President of Officiating Dean Blandino stated that Tate [...] "controlled the pass right at the goal line. This is not a receiver who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. He is taking his third step, he had demonstrated possession, had become a runner." [...] Late in the fourth quarter, Pernell McPhee was penalized for roughing the passer when it appeared {{that he had been}} pushed into Stafford. During the Lions' game-winning drive in overtime, Willie Young was held, but no penalty was called. Due to the NFL's policies on criticizing officials, Cutler did not comment, while John Fox stated, [...] "We’re not allowed to talk about officials." ...|$|E

Outside of school, Rex claims he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach, {{although he is}} really going to his best friend Cole's house to work on a motorbike with him. Like Hannah, Rex is also very emotional, and often gets angry, due to Hannah's death in the crash. He kept a tennis racket to remain, and make him deal with Hannah's death. However, Cole accidentally broke it, Rex fights with him because of this. He later apologizes to him. He hates [...] "cereal and soda night" [...] because Michael doesn not cook [...] "actual food" [...] for dinner. Rex has an aunt named Carol, who is mentioned in [...] "Two Birds", in Michael's [...] "green reality". She wants {{to spend more time with}} Rex since the crash.|$|E
500|$|In 1893, {{bimetallism}} {{had been}} {{just one of many}} proposals by Populists and others. [...] As the economic downturn continued, free silver advocates blamed its continuation on the repeal of the silver purchase act, and the issue of silver became more prominent. [...] Free silver especially resonated among farmers in the South and West, as well as miners. [...] June 1894 marked the publication of William H. Harvey's Coin's Financial School. [...] The book, composed of accounts of (fictitious) lectures on the silver issue given by an adolescent named Coin to Chicago audiences, became an immense bestseller. [...] The book included (as foils to the title character) many of Chicago's most prominent men of business; some, such as banker and future Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage, issued denials that they had participated in any such lectures. [...] This popular treatment of the currency issue was highly influential. [...] A Missourian, Ezra Peters, wrote to Illinois Senator John M. Palmer, [...] "Coins [...] Financial School is raising h— in this neck of the woods. [...] If those in favor of honest money don't do something to offset its influence the country <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dogs." [...] A Minnesota correspondent wrote in Outlook magazine: [...] "high school boys are about equally divided between silver and baseball, with a decided leaning toward the former".|$|E
500|$|Most {{radicals}} {{were confident}} that Johnson would be convicted and removed from office. [...] Stevens, however, was never {{certain of the}} result as Chief Justice Chase (the former Treasury Secretary) made rulings that favored the defense, {{and he had no}} great confidence Republicans would stick together. On May 11, the Senate met in secret session, and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote. [...] All Democrats were opposed, but an unexpectedly large number of Republicans also favored acquittal on {{some or all of the}} articles. [...] Counting votes, managers realized their best chance of gaining the required two-thirds for conviction was on the Stevens-inspired ArticleXI, and when the Senate assembled to give its verdict, they scheduled it to be voted upon first. The suspense was broken when Kansas Senator Edmund Ross, whose position was uncertain, voted for acquittal. [...] This meant that, with the votes of those who remained, the President would not be convicted on that article. [...] The article failed, 35 in favor to 19 against. In the hope that delay would bring a different result, Republicans adjourned the Senate for ten days. [...] Stevens was carried from the Senate in his chair—one observer described him as [...] "black with rage and disappointment"—and when those outside clamored for the result, Stevens shouted, [...] "The country <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> devil!" ...|$|E

500|$|On April's fourteenth birthday, Marion, her adoptive mother, {{gives her}} earrings, not the mobile phone she wanted. They argue, and April leaves for school. After lying to her friends, {{claiming}} {{she has a}} phone and <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dentist's, April chooses to play truant. While at work at a stately home, Marion hears that April has not arrived at school. She talks to her friend and colleague Elliot, who unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her from leaving. April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting {{telling the story of}} her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. In a flashback, a young April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship is an abusive one, leading to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realises that they were lied to. April then leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and, in a shopping centre, meets Elliot, who has joined her. April then visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year-old April lives at the Sunnyholme. Cared for by a woman named Mo, April befriends an older girl called Gina and is introduced to Pearl, a girl of her age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April. Gina wakes April one night to involve her in a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water, and then tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, who she pushes down a flight of stairs, and is reprimanded by Mo. A voice-over from 14-year-old April says Gina was then [...] "moved on", and, eventually, April is also moved on.|$|E
