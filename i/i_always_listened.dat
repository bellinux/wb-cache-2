[...] "Now that I have got over my first confession of the misery that follows me in secret wherever I go, I think I can tell you calmly all {{that remains to be}} told. You see, as I said, my Uncle Stephen" [...] he turned away his head quickly, {{and looked down at the}} table as the name passed his lips--"my Uncle Stephen came twice to Wincot while I was a child, and on both occasions frightened me dreadfully. He only took me up in his arms and spoke to me--very kindly, as I afterward heard, for him--but he terrified me, nevertheless. Perhaps I was frightened at his great stature, his swarthy complexion, and his thick black hair and mustache, as other children might have been; perhaps the mere sight of him had some strange influence on me which I could not then understand and cannot now explain. However it was, I used to dream of him long after he had gone away, and to fancy that he was stealing on me to catch me up in his arms whenever I was left in the dark. The servants who took care of me found this out, and used to threaten me with my Uncle Stephen whenever I was perverse and difficult to manage. As I grew up, I still retained my vague dread and abhorrence of our absent relative. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>listened</b> intently, yet without knowing why, whenever his name was mentioned by my father or my mother--listened with an unaccountable presentiment that something terrible had happened to him, or was about to happen to me. This feeling only changed when I was left alone in the Abbey; and then it seemed to merge into the eager curiosity which had begun to grow on me, rather before that time, about the origin of the ancient prophecy predicting the extinction of our race. Are you following me?" ...|$|E

According to Ralph Blumenthal in his 2000 book, Stork Club, another New York nightclub owner named Mary Louise Cecilia Guinan, widely known as Texas Guinan, {{introduced}} Billingsley to her friend, commentator Walter Winchell, in 1930. In his column in the New York Daily Mirror, Winchell called the Stork Club [...] "New York's New Yorkiest place on W. 58th". [...] Sherman Billingsley often turned to Hannagan for advice, as Billlingsley later told a friend, “…Steve helped make the Stork popular, and Steve gave me advice about everything, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>listened</b> to him." ...|$|E

In 2003, Kareen Antonn wrote to Tyler asking if she {{would be willing to}} record a French-English duet version of the song that was re-arranged by Antonn's friend Emmanuel Pribys. Tyler's initial {{reaction}} was to decline the request because Antonn was an unknown artist, [...] "but they didn't give up," [...] Tyler continued, [...] "they sent me a CD of her voice singing the song in French. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>listen</b> to things because you never know!" [...] Tyler was impressed by the demo recording, and asked to sing the song live with her to ensure that her voice was strong enough and not reliant on studio editing.|$|R

5000|$|The album can be {{listened to}} as 16 {{different}} movements or two lengthy tracks. Part I, [...] "Tao of the Dead," [...] is split into eleven tracks, whereas Part II, [...] "Strange News From Another Planet," [...] is five songs combined into one. Conrad Keely, {{in an interview}} with Spin.com, described the album's composition. [...] "It's the way I listened to albums when I was a kid, seeing as some of my favorite records were Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Yes's Relayer and Close to the Edge... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> liked <b>listening</b> to records that were just a continuous piece, like an orchestra or a symphony." ...|$|R
5000|$|Writing in the Chicago Tribune, Jack Fuller stated [...] "For me hard bop is {{like the}} blues that you find at its core. <b>I</b> can`t <b>always</b> <b>listen</b> to it with pleasure. It is never monotonous, no matter how closely it hews to the norm. And when it is {{energetic}} and smiling, {{as it is on}} this reissue of a 1962 release by tenor saxophonist Clifford Jordan backed by pianist Cedar Walton, it can almost always lift my spirits, too". Scott Yanow stated in his review for Allmusic, [...] "It would be 1973 before Jordan had another opportunity to be showcased in a quartet format, making this formerly rare set one of his best all-around recordings".|$|R

'Oh yes,' said Elizabeth, {{speaking}} slowly, and pausing now and then; 'I {{remember her}} well; I sometimes fancy I {{can hear her}} voice and her step at night, when she used {{to come up to}} the nursery to see us in bed. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> used to <b>listen</b> for her; and when she began to grow weak, and could not come up so many stairs, I used to lie and cry for half an hour. And now, when I am reading the same books with the children that I read with her, things that she said to me come back upon me.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Skaat has said, [...] "My wish {{was always}} to be a singer, and I'm still working on it." [...] Skaat {{is one of many}} {{well-known}} singers, both past and present, of Yemenite Jewish heritage—a long line that includes Bracha Zefira, Shoshana Damari, Haim Moshe, Zohar Argov, Ofra Haza, Gali Atari, Dana International, Achinoam Nini (Noa), and many others. [...] However, unlike the music of some Yemenite Jewish singers, there have been generally few hints of the distinctive singing style often associated with that culture in Skaat's music. Although Skaat has said that he has been influenced by Rivka Zohar and he has named Rami Kleinstein and Sarit Hadad as two of his favorite singers, he stated in a February 2010 interview that, [...] "I don't think I [...] ever been influenced by someone in specific. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>listened</b> to so many different kinds of music. I feel as if I have learned from each singer I listened to and still do. From the vigour of the great female singers, through the song interpretation of French performers to the intricate structures of classical music pieces. I find inspiration in them all!" ...|$|R

At the end when the emphysema took over and he was struggling with speech he had an oxygen mask and I often had to empty his bag for him. But he liked me being there because I knew to wait and let him finish his sentences between gasps. I didn't try to say the words for him because I knew how much they mattered. That was strange for me – to be patient and quiet. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted to <b>listen</b> to John." ...|$|R

Although <b>I</b> <b>always</b> couldn’t accept the knowledge quickly, he always was nice to teach me in detail. Dr. Bevan Thompson is another important teacher for me in this one year of study.

5000|$|The {{creation}} of Illinois marked {{a shift in}} Stevens' emphasis on songwriting and studio work toward live performance and more abstract concepts of motion and sound—subsequent tours and albums emphasized electronic music and modern dance over the indie folk material on Michigan and Illinois. He has ceased writing songs about individual characters with straightforward narratives or concept albums and briefly considered quitting the music business entirely after creating and promoting this album. He {{also found that the}} way in which he listened to music had changed after producing Illinois: I think now I listen more as a technician and a researcher. I'm always hearing music in terms of what I can take out of it, and <b>I</b> think I've <b>always</b> <b>listened</b> like that. <b>I</b> have a hard time just listening for pleasure. I'm much less about instinct, and more of a utilitarian listener. Like, what is the use of this song? What is the usefulness of this melody for this theme or statement? What are they doing that's unusual sounding, and how can I learn from that? Sufjan Stevens, 2006 Stevens is a classically trained oboist and his knowledge of classical and baroque music influenced many of his arrangements. Stevens himself has noted the influence of composers Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Edvard Grieg; along with contemporary composers Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass. The music on this album was written to be grandiose, to match the history of the territory. Stevens used time signature changes in the composition of Illinois for dynamic effect—for instance, [...] "Come On! Feel the Illinoise!" [...] begins with a 5/4 time signature and then changes [...] to a standard 4/4 later in the song.|$|R

She lay on the sofa quietly with her eyes shut all the time I was speaking. I could see her color come and go, and some tears fell down her cheeks; then she said in a tone which she tried to make hard and careless, but which really trembled, 'The {{military}} ought to put a guard over my son. Why does he go risking his life for other people? What business is it of his whether Cartwright's mill is burned or not?' I said that Mr. Cartwright had been very kind to you, and that I knew that you were much attached to him. I also said that the military were anxious that you should have an escort to and from the mill, but that you objected. I said that I was afraid that your life had not much value in your own eyes, for that it was by no means a happy one. 'It has value in other people's eyes,' she said irritably, 'in Lucy's and in his brother's. What would they do if he was to throw it away? Who would look after the mill and business then? He has no right to run such risks, Mrs. Porson, no right at all. Of course he is unhappy. People who let their tempers master them and do things are sure to be unhappy, and make other people unhappy, too; but that is no reason that he should cause more unhappiness by risking his own life needlessly, so, Mrs. Porson, please talk to your husband and tell him to make my son have an escort. <b>I</b> know he <b>always</b> <b>listens</b> to Mr. Porson.'" ...|$|R
