5|$|Inspector Lomax {{was played}} by Jack Warner, who {{appeared}} by {{arrangement with the}} J. Arthur Rank Organisation, with whom he was contracted. At {{the time he was}} best known as the star of Here Come the Huggetts (1948) and its sequels. Shortly after finishing The Quatermass Xperiment, he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with, as the title character in Dixon of Dock Green (1955–76). Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running joke in the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> have a shave with his electric razor.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to the}} general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E

25|$|From 1835 until 1838, Ainsworth and Dickens {{were close}} friends and often {{travelled}} together. Rookwood was published in multiple editions, with a fourth edition in 1836 including illustrations by Cruikshank, which started the working relationship between the two. Ainsworth began writing another novel in 1835. Called Crichton, he devoted {{much of his time}} to it to the point of not having time for many of his literary friends. Its publication was temporarily delayed while Ainsworth was searching for an illustrator, with Thackeray being a possible choice. However, Ainsworth felt the illustrations were unsatisfactory, so he switched to Daniel Maclise, who was also later dropped. Coinciding with the search for an illustrator and hurrying to complete the novel, Ainsworth was asked to write for the magazine The Lions of London, but could not <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> work on both projects and so attempted to finish the novel. The situation changed after Macrone, the original intended publisher, died. Ainsworth turned to Bentley as a publisher. Ainsworth eventually published his third novel in 1837. A fifth edition of Rookwood appeared in 1837, and its success encouraged Ainsworth to work on another novel about a famous outlaw, the story of Jack Sheppard.|$|E

500|$|Wagner did not resume work on Parsifal {{for eight}} years, {{during which time}} he {{completed}} Tristan und Isolde and began Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Then, between 27 and 30 August 1865, he took up Parsifal again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and {{a considerable amount of}} detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner's creative energy was devoted to the Ring cycle, which was finally completed in 1874 and given its first full performance at Bayreuth in August 1876. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on Parsifal. By 23 February 1877 he had completed a second and more extensive prose draft of the work, and by 19 April of the same year he had transformed this into a verse libretto (or [...] "poem", as Wagner liked to call his libretti).|$|E
500|$|The first {{performances}} of She Has a Name in the United States were produced by FreeFall Stage {{in a rented}} space at Victory Life Church in Folsom, California in 2014 {{under the direction of}} Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time. She and her sister had become passionate about the issue of human trafficking {{as a result of their}} involvement with the organization Run for Courage, and the two sisters considered writing a play about human trafficking in the United States. Because they were both college students, they did not <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write a play, so in 2013, their mother, Deedee Eldridge, began looking for a human-trafficking-related play that had already been written and she discovered She Has a Name. It was the only play she was able to find on the subject of human trafficking. Emma Eldridge later said of She Has a Name, [...] "I've never read something and been so compelled to do it." [...] The family decided to stage the play, and Deedee Eldridge served as producer and executive director. To have the rights to produce the play, FreeFall Stage made a special arrangement with the Playwrights Guild of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|The next week, Kim {{notices that}} Ray has {{a string of}} missed calls on his mobile phone, and {{suspects}} he is having an affair. All About Soap said that Ray is showing all the signs of having an affair, but has no scenes with Kat, which they said would be [...] "crucial" [...] if he {{was having an affair}} with her. They went on to say that if Ray reveals what he is up to, he could be the first suspect to be eliminated. Soaplife said that Kat never has her mobile out of her hand, so when Kim catches Ray texting a mystery woman, it could mean that he is texting Kat. Inside Soap also wondered if this was evidence of Ray being Kat's secret lover. Carena Crawford from All About Soap said that when Ray is seen with flowers heading for the tube and on the phone saying he is meeting the person he is speaking to, at the same time Kat is on her phone arranging to meet her lover, she thought it was [...] "the biggest clue yet" [...] that it could be Ray, especially when they later return to the pub at the same time. Inside Soap noticed in that week that episodes were [...] "desperately trying to rule out Jack" [...] when he has sex with three other women. They felt it could be a red herring, saying [...] "We reckon all this seduction is supposed to make us turn a blind eye to Jack's antics—but [...] we're keeping them peeled where [...] is concerned!"

And in the brief conversations which she vouchsafed the Vicomte, they discussed his novels. In vain he pleaded, in caressing undertones, that she should ride with him.

It was so much better, I told him, to talk over these matters personally with the owner than with an agent in his absence. Agents were often very unwilling to make changes. Mr. Vincent was a very quiet and exceedingly pleasant elderly gentleman, and thanked me very much for my invitation, but said he did not see how he could <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get out to my house before I sailed.
