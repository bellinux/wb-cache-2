40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Edrecolomab</b> is a murine {{monoclonal}} antibody to the cell-surface glycoprotein 17 - 1 A, which is expressed on epithelial tissues and on various carcinomas. Preliminary data {{suggested that it}} might be of use in the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected stage III colon cancer. We did a randomised trial in 27 countries to determine the effect of adding <b>edrecolomab</b> to the combination of fluorouracil and folinic acid in these patients. METHODS: After surgery, 2761 patients were randomly assigned <b>edrecolomab</b> plus fluorouracil-folinic acid (combination therapy [n= 912]); fluorouracil-folinic acid alone (chemotherapy [n= 927]); or <b>edrecolomab</b> alone (<b>edrecolomab</b> monotherapy [n= 922]). Patients were assessed for survival and disease recurrence after surgery. The primary endpoint tested the hypothesis that combination therapy improved overall survival relative to chemotherapy. The key secondary endpoint was to test whether <b>edrecolomab</b> monotherapy was non-inferior to chemotherapy in terms of disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Median follow-up time was 26 months (IQR 20 - 36). 3 -year overall survival on combination therapy was no different from that on chemotherapy (74. 7 % vs 76. 1 %, hazard ratio 0. 94 [95 % CI 0. 76 - 1. 15], p= 0. 53). Disease-free survival was significantly lower on <b>edrecolomab</b> monotherapy than on chemotherapy (53. 0 % vs 65. 5 %, 0. 62 [0. 53 - 0. 73], p< 0. 0001). Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 452 (25 %) patients receiving <b>edrecolomab,</b> causing treatment discontinuation in 71 (4 %). The addition of <b>edrecolomab</b> to chemotherapy did not increase neutropenia, diarrhoea, or mucositis. INTERPRETATION: The addition of <b>edrecolomab</b> to fluorouracil and folinic acid in the adjuvant treatment of resected stage III colon cancer does not improve overall or disease-free survival, and <b>edrecolomab</b> monotherapy is associated with significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival than fluorouracil and folinic acid and is therefore an inferior treatment option. <b>Edrecolomab</b> is well tolerated and its addition to fluorouracil and folinic acid does not increase the toxicity of chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Epithelial cell {{adhesion}} molecule (EpCAM) is frequently and highly expressed on human carcinomas. The emerging role of EpCAM as a signalling receptor and activator of the wnt pathway, and its expression on tumor-initiating cells, further add to its attractiveness as target for immunotherapy of cancer. Thus far, five conventional monoclonal IgG antibodies have been tested in cancer patients. These are murine IgG 2 a <b>edrecolomab</b> and its murine/human chimeric IgG 1 antibody version, and humanized, human-engineered and fully human IgG 1 antibodies 3622 W 94, ING- 1, and adecatumumab (MT 201), respectively. Here we compared all anti-EpCAM antibodies {{in an attempt to}} explain differences in clinical activity and safety. Methods We recombinantly produced all antibodies but murine <b>edrecolomab</b> and investigated them for binding affinity, EpCAM epitope recognition, ADCC and CDC, and inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation. Results ING- 1 and 3622 W 94 bound to EpCAM with much higher affinity than adecatumumab and <b>edrecolomab.</b> <b>Edrecolomab,</b> ING- 1, and 3622 W 94 all recognized epitopes in the exon 2 -encoded N-terminal domain of EpCAM, while adecatumumab recognized a more membrane proximal epitope encoded by exon 5. All antibodies induced lysis of EpCAM-expressing cancer cell lines by both ADCC and CDC with potencies that correlated with their binding affinities. The chimeric version of <b>edrecolomab</b> with a human Fcγ 1 domain was much more potent in ADCC than the murine IgG 2 a version. Only adecatumumab showed a significant inhibition of MCF- 7 breast cancer cell proliferation in the absence of complement and immune cells. Conclusion A moderate binding affinity and recognition of a distinct domain of EpCAM may best explain why adecatumumab showed a larger therapeutic window in cancer patients than the two high-affinity IgG 1 antibodies ING- 1 and 3622 W 94, both of which caused acute pancreatitis. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{conducted}} a randomized trial comparing adjuvant treatment with <b>edrecolomab</b> versus observation {{in patients with}} resected, low-risk, stage II colon cancer. This study also prospectively studied patient- and tumor-specific markers of treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After surgical resection, patients with stage II colon cancer {{were randomly assigned to}} either five infusions of <b>edrecolomab</b> at 28 -day intervals or observation without adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: Final accrual included 1, 738 patients; 865 patients received <b>edrecolomab,</b> and 873 patients were observed without adjuvant treatment. Median follow-up time was 7. 9 years. There were no significant outcome differences between study arms (overall survival [OS], P =. 71; disease-free survival, P =. 64). The combined 5 -year all-cause OS was 0. 86 (95 % CI, 0. 84 to 0. 88), and the combined 5 -year disease-specific OS was 0. 93 (95 % CI, 0. 91 to 0. 94). The relationships between demographic and histopathologic factors and survival differed for all-cause and disease-specific survival outcomes, but no combined prognostic factor model was found to adequately classify patients at higher risk of recurrence or death as a result of colon cancer. CONCLUSION: <b>Edrecolomab</b> did not prolong survival. Consequently, this large study with a long duration of follow-up provided unique data concerning the natural history of resected stage II colon cancer. Prognostic factors identified in previous retrospective and pooled analyses were associated with survival outcomes in this stage II patient cohort. Results from ongoing molecular marker studies may enhance our ability to determine the risk profile of these patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{epithelial}} {{cell adhesion molecule}} (EpCAM), or CD 326, {{was one of the}} first cancer associated biomarkers to be discovered. In the last forty years, this biomarker has been investigated for use in personalized cancer therapy, with the first monoclonal antibody, <b>edrecolomab,</b> being trialled in humans more than thirty years ago. Since then, several other monoclonal antibodies have been raised to EpCAM and tested in clinical trials. However, while monoclonal antibody therapy has been investigated against EpCAM for almost 40 years as primary or adjuvant therapy, it has not shown as much promise as initially heralded. In this review, we look at the reasons why and consider alternative targeting options, such as aptamers, to turn this almost ubiquitously expressed epithelial cancer biomarker into a viable target for future personalized therapy...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{are currently}} being approved for marketing in Europe and the United States, {{as well as other}} countries, on a regular basis. As more mAbs become available to physicians and patients, keeping track of the number, types, production cell lines, antigenic targets, and dates and locations of approvals has become challenging. Data are presented here for 34 mAbs that were approved in either Europe or the United States (US) as of March 2012, and nimotuzumab, which is marketed outside Europe and the US. Of the 34 mAbs, 28 (abciximab, rituximab, basiliximab, palivizumab, infliximab, trastuzumab, alemtuzumab, adalimumab, tositumomab-I 131, cetuximab, ibrituximab tiuxetan, omalizumab, bevacizumab, natalizumab, ranibizumab, panitumumab, eculizumab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, canakinumab, catumaxomab, ustekinumab, tocilizumab, ofatumumab, denosumab, belimumab, ipilimumab, brentuximab) are currently marketed in Europe or the US.

40|$|Abstract Background Uveal {{melanoma}} (UM) is {{the most}} common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults, and nearly 40 % of UM will develop metastasis that will ultimately lead to death. The Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by carcinomas of head and neck, ovary, colon, breast, kidney and lung. Recently, antibodies against EpCAM such as <b>Edrecolomab</b> and Catumaxomab were developed, and clinical trials with these antibodies have been used in several types of neoplasia. We studied the expression of EpCAM in UM. Methods 25 enucleated formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded UM specimens were immunostained for EpCAM. Histopathological analysis of the specimens with regards to prognostic factors such as cell type, largest (linear) tumor dimension, number of mitotic figures, scleral invasion and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were done. Results None of them was positive for this EpCAM. Conclusion In our report, UM did not express EpCAM. Therefore, it is not a helpful immunohistochemical marker to predict the behavior of UM. Further studies are needed to verify if EpCAM could also be related with prognosis and treatment of UM. </p...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in surgery and adjuvant regimes, gastrointestinal malignancy remains {{a major cause}} of neoplastic mortality. Immunotherapy is an emerging and now successful treatment modality for numerous cancers that relies on the manipulation of the immune system and its effector functions to eradicate tumour cells. The discovery that the pan-epithelial homotypic cell adhesion molecule EpCAM is differentially expressed on gastrointestinal tumours has made this a viable target for immunotherapy. Clinical trials using naked anti EpCAM antibody, immunoconjugates, anti-idiotypic and dendritic cell vaccines have met variable success. The murine IgG 2 a <b>Edrecolomab</b> was shown to reduce mortality and morbidity at a level slightly lower than treatment with 5 FU and Levamisole when administered to patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma in a large randomised controlled trial. Fully human and trifunctional antibodies that specifically recruit CD 3 -positive lymphocytes are now being tested clinically in the treatment of minimal residual disease and ascites. Although clinical trials are in their infancy, the future may bring forth an EpCAM mediated approach for the effective activation and harnessing of the immune system to destroy a pathological aberrance that has otherwise largely escaped its attention...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A murine {{monoclonal}} antibody against the 17 - 1 A epithelial antigen {{has been shown}} to be a useful adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer. Its clinical use could be extended to patients with upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. AIM: To determine the distribution of the antigen in gastric and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The activity of two monoclonal antibodies active against 17 - 1 A epithelial antigen was studied in gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinomas: fresh frozen tissue from both the carcinoma and adjacent mucosa was stained using immunocytochemistry with a murine {{monoclonal antibody}} (17 - 1 A <b>edrecolomab,</b> Glaxo Wellcome); paraffin embedded tissue was stained using the humanised monoclonal antibody 3622 W 94 (Glaxo Wellcome). RESULTS: 29 of 33 cancers (88 %) stained with the murine antibody and 39 of 40 (98 %) with the humanised antibody. The degree of staining was greater in well differentiated and moderately differentiated tumours. There was no staining of the normal background gastric or oesophageal mucosa, but areas of intestinal metaplasia stained intensely. The humanised monoclonal 3622 W 94 antibody produced more intense staining than the murine antibody. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of expression of the 17 - 1 A antigen in patients with gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinomas suggests a potential role for these antibodies as an adjuvant treatment for these common cancers...|$|E
40|$|Gene amplification, over-expression, and {{mutation}} {{of growth}} factors, or the receptors themselves, causes increased signaling through receptor kinases, {{which has been}} implicated in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Tumor growth {{has been shown to}} be decreased by interrupting this process of extensive growth factor-mediated signaling by directly targeting either the surface receptor or the ligand and thereby preventing cell survival and promoting apoptosis. Monoclonal antibodies have long been eyed as a potential new class of therapeutics targeting cancer and other diseases. Antibody-based therapy initially entered clinical practice when trastuzumab/Herceptin became the first clinically approved drug against an oncogene product as a well-established blocking reagent for tumors with hyperactivity of epidermal growth factor signaling pathways. In the first part of this review we explain basic terms related to the development of antibody-based drugs, give a brief historic perspective of the field, and also touch on topics such as the "humanization of antibodie" or creation of hybrid antibodies. The second part of the review gives an overview of the clinical usage of bispecific antibodies and antibodies "armed" with cytotoxic agents or enzymes. Further within this section, cancer-specific, site-specific, or signaling pathway-specific therapies are discussed in detail. Among other antibody-based therapeutic products, we discuss: Avastin (bevacizumab), CG 76030, Theragyn (pemtumomab), daclizumab (Zenapax), TriAb, MDX- 210, Herceptin (trastuzumab), panitumumab (ABX-EGF), mastuzimab (EMD- 72000), Erbitux (certuximab, IMC 225), Panorex (<b>edrecolomab),</b> STI 571, CeaVac, Campath (alemtuizumab), Mylotarg (gemtuzumab, ozogamicin), and many others.
