5|$|Because Vice President Carlos Álvarez {{had already}} resigned, the Congress convened {{to appoint a}} new president. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, {{governor}} of the San Luis Province, was <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> two months while calling for new presidential elections. Renewed demonstrations forced him to resign as well, and Eduardo Duhalde was appointed as the new president. He was able to complete De la Rúa's term of office.|$|E
5|$|The High Authority (the {{predecessor}} to the European Commission) was a nine-member {{executive body}} which governed the Community. The Authority consisted of nine members <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> {{a term of}} six years. Eight of these members were appointed by {{the governments of the}} six signatories. These eight members then themselves appointed a ninth person to be President of the High Authority.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} eleven presidents of Pakistan since the {{introduction}} of the post in 1956. The office was established when Pakistan was declared as a republic with the adoption of the 1956 constitution, and Saad Mirza became the first president of the country. Apart from these eleven, two acting presidents have also been <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> short periods of time. One of them, Wasim Sajjad, served as acting president on two non-consecutive occasions during 1993 and 1997–98. The president may remain <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> a tenure of five years. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the Chairman of the Senate assumes office.|$|E

5|$|After serving <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> {{an extra}} year to 1905, Clarke retired, having {{helped to create}} a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|At the 13 February 1971 election, Askin's {{majority}} {{was reduced}} by four seats to the Labor Party under Pat Hills. Morton retained his seat, despite {{a significant reduction}} in his majority to 62.68%. Morton stayed <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> another year when, on 16 June 1972 he retired from politics. At the time of his departure it had been rumoured that he had been threatening to dismiss Blacktown City Council if they did not stop blocking a $200 million development in Mount Druitt.|$|E

5|$|The longest-serving {{governor}} was the first, George Clinton, who first took office on July 30, 1777, and served seven terms {{in two different}} periods, totaling just under 21 years in office. (As 18 of those years were consecutive, Clinton also served the longest consecutive period <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> a New York governor.)

5|$|Throughout much of {{the twentieth}} century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and {{military}} unrest. After Juan Vicente Gómez's long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with Marcos Pérez Jiménez's overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes. Until 1998, the dominant political parties were Acción Democrática and COPEI, who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during the second term <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> Acción Democrática's Carlos Andrés Pérez, Venezuela {{was hit by a}} severe economic crisis. A wave of protests known as the Caracazo engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.|$|E

5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> the rest of his administration.|$|E
5|$|In November 1834, the Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Charles Spencer, Viscount Althorp, {{inherited}} a peerage, thus removing {{him from the}} House of Commons to the Lords. Melbourne had to appoint a new Commons leader and a new Chancellor (who by long custom, must {{be drawn from the}} Commons), but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as Commons leader was Lord John Russell, who William (and many others) found unacceptable due to his radical politics. William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp—who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peer—as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry. With Lord Melbourne gone, William chose to entrust power to a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. Since Peel was then in Italy, the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed Prime Minister. When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself, he saw the impossibility of governing because of the Whig majority in the House of Commons. Consequently, Parliament was dissolved to force fresh elections. Although the Tories won more seats than in the previous election, they were still in the minority. Peel remained <b>in</b> <b>office</b> <b>for</b> a few months, but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats. Lord Melbourne was restored to the Prime Minister's office, remaining there for the rest of William's reign, and the King was forced to accept Russell as Commons leader.|$|E
