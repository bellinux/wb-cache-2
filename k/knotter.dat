2500|$|A twine binder is a {{mechanical}} device or machine that wraps knotted twine around a bundle or sheave of grain in bound form {{after it has}} been reaped. While working at a farm in Whitewater, Wisconsin in 1857, John Appleby invented the twine <b>knotter.</b> Incorporating many of Jacob Behel's innovations as found in his development of the [...] "billhook" [...] <b>knotter</b> in 1864, Appleby later sold the patent around the year 1877 to William Deering who began the manufacturing and exploited the practicability of Appleby's twine <b>knotter</b> into a commercially profitable reaper-binder.|$|E
60|$|An elderly negro, in a clout like an infant's, {{and with}} a pepper and salt head, {{and a kind of}} {{attorney}} air, now approached Captain Delano. In tolerable Spanish, {{and with a}} good-natured, knowing wink, he informed him that the old <b>knotter</b> was simple-witted, but harmless; often playing his odd tricks. The negro concluded by begging the knot, for of course the stranger would not care to be troubled with it. Unconsciously, it was handed to him. With a sort of congé, the negro received it, and, turning his back, ferreted into it like a detective custom-house officer after smuggled laces. Soon, with some African word, equivalent to pshaw, he tossed the knot overboard.|$|E
5000|$|A Barber-Colman <b>knotter</b> is a {{piece of}} textile {{machinery}} used in a weaving shed. When all the warp carried on the weavers beam has been used, a new beam replaces it. Each end has to pass through the eyes on the existing healds, and through the existing reed. The <b>knotter</b> takes each new thread and knots it the existing end, which will pull it through the correct healds and reed, saving much time[...] A good man could do 32 or 33 warps a day.|$|E

50|$|As tractor {{horsepower}} further increased, {{the next}} innovation of the thrower-baler was the hydraulic tossing baler. This employs a flat pan behind the bale <b>knotter.</b> As bales advance {{out the back}} of the baler, they are pushed onto the pan one at a time. When the bale has moved fully onto the pan, the pan suddenly pops up, pushed by a large hydraulic cylinder, and tosses the bale up into the wagon like a catapult.|$|E
50|$|The Barber-Colman Company was a {{manufacturer}} of textile and milling machinery from its founding in 1894 until the 1980s. Howard Colman organized the company in Rockford, Illinois with capital from W. A. Barber. Early successes with their Hand <b>Knotter</b> and Warp Tying Machine allowed the company to expand internationally, manufacturing goods in five states and three countries. The company moved to Loves Park in the 1950s, but struggled {{following the death of}} Walter Colman in 1983. Eurotherm Controls, Inc. currently holds the rights to the company name.|$|E

50|$|The {{start of}} the Claas group took place in 1913 when August Claas, {{developed}} the company in Clarholz, Germany. In 1919, the business was transferred to Harsewinkel, Germany, where the company focused on the production of reapers. Two years later the company obtained their first patent - for a <b>knotter</b> to efficiently bind straw. In 1930, the first Harvester was developed with the European market in mind with the first Pick-up Baler following in 1934. In 1936 Claas started to market the first combine harvester built in Europe, as opposed to imported machines previously available. They then offered trailed combine harvesters (reaper-binders) to the European market.|$|E
50|$|The weavers beam is now {{placed on}} the Drawing-in frame. Here each end is passed through the healds, and then through a reed. This job was done by a reacher-in and a loomer. The reacher-in, who would be young and usually a boy, passed each end in order through to the loomer. Alternatively, if the loom had already run that cloth, a short length of the {{previous}} warp thread could be left on the healds and reed, and a Barber Colman <b>knotter</b> ties the old ends to the new. This process took 20 minutes, considerably faster than starting afresh. Spare healds and reeds are stored above head height for that purpose.|$|E

50|$|Howard Colman came to Rockford, Illinois from Wisconsin {{to open a}} {{metalworking}} {{shop for}} his prototype textile machine. He partnered with Wisconsin investor W. A. Barber and founded Barber & Colman in an office above the Spengler Brothers machine shop in the Water Power District. In 1900, Colman invented the Hand <b>Knotter,</b> which could quickly and easily tie knots in string. It was in such high demand that Barber & Colman were able to open their own plant in 1902. Within years, they had branches in Boston and England. Colman's Warp Tying Machine, introduced in 1904, was also a great success. This machine automated the process of passing threads {{through the eyes of}} heddles. Companies could reduce their workforce for this operation from fifteen to two workers. Also in 1904, the company was officially incorporated as the Barber-Colman Company.|$|E

5000|$|As within Britain, several {{settlements}} in mainland Europe have been dubbed [...] "Little Moscow" [...] during the 20th century. Similarly to Great Britain, these {{towns and villages}} often held Communist values or sympathies and often voted in local political officers of the Communist party despite being outside the Iron Curtain. In his 2011 paper Little Moscows in Western Europe: The Ecology of Small-Place Communism, Professor Ad <b>Knotter</b> of Maastricht University, identified ten such locations in mainland Western Europe that had been named as Little Moscow: Tarnac, Saint-Junien, Halluin, Sallaumines and Villerupt in France; Finsterwolde in the Netherlands and Mössingen, Selb, Frauenau and Penzberg in Germany. It {{should be noted that}} Knotter's research explored Western Europe alone, and that his work intentionally omitted research into settlements of similar characteristics in the Scandinavian north or Mediterranean south of the continent. In Germany, the village of Mörfelden in Hessen, traditionally home to many bricklayers, used to be nicknamed Little Moscow before World War Two for its support of the Communist Party, and still retains a somewhat strong presence of the otherwise very small German Communist Party.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 19th century, hay {{was cut by}} {{hand and}} most {{typically}} stored in haystacks using hay forks to rake and gather the scythed grasses into optimal sized heaps [...] - [...] neither too large (promoting conditions that might create spontaneous combustion), nor too small, {{so much of the}} pile is susceptible to rotting. These haystacks lifted most of the plant fibers up off the ground, letting air in and water drain out, so the grasses could dry and cure, to retain nutrition for livestock feed at a later time. In the 1860s mechanical cutting devices were developed; from these came the modern devices including mechanical mowers and balers. In 1872 a reaper that used a <b>knotter</b> device to bundle and bind hay was invented by Charles Withington; this was commercialized in 1874 by Cyrus McCormick. [...] In 1936, Innes invented an automatic baler that tied bales with twine using Appleby-type knotters from a John Deere grain binder; an improved version patented by Ed Nolt in 1939 was more reliable and became commonly used.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for online forecasting of water table depth and soil moisture profiles. The method combines a simple form of data assimilation with a moving window calibration of a deterministic model describing {{flow in the}} unsaturated zone as well as regional drainage. Previous work with physically-deterministic models (<b>Knotters</b> and Bierkens, 2000; <b>Knotters</b> and De Gooijer, 1999) has focussed on offline calibration and validation.

40|$|Knot {{strength}} {{is very important}} in processing ropes than other textile products. Thus double sheet bends are usually used in rope mills, because their knots are small and strong in order to tie two threads of yarn. These knots have been made by manual operation. These mills, therefore, are demanding {{to be able to make}} these knots automatically in order to improve process efficiency. In this study, we have developed a <b>knotter</b> which is able to form a double sheet bend by using a set of molds. First, we designed a path to carve tracks on the surface of the mold by using the Dowker notation. But this path was too complicated to thread yarn through the path easily. Furthermore, it is desired that the <b>knotter</b> can be carried by a worker in rope mills. We, therefore, have moved and/or composed paths in order to obtain the simpler path for double sheet bends. Finally, we have integrated these molds and instruments such as air cylinders and linear guide ways in order to make a double sheet bend knot automatically. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|E
30|$|The {{wisdom of}} Taoism teaches us that being an {{effective}} leader, {{he must have}} a noble purpose, and be effective in what he does (doing the right things), and then executes efficiently {{what he wants to}} achieve (doing things right). From the perspective of Taoism, effectiveness is about efficacy of the Tao. Tao has its particular efficacy. This efficacy is named in the title of that Laozi was later given TTC or “The Classical Book of Tao (Way) and Te (Virtue)”. Te (Virtue) can also be translated as “Efficacy.” Te is the efficacy or “power” of the Tao. Te is defined as morality (to do what is right) from a social perspective, and as inner power, efficacy and integrity from an individual perspective. Efficacy is the power or capacity to produce a desired effect. The word efficacy {{has to do with the}} ability or capacity to do something, but not about how something is done. Efficacy equals effectiveness but different from efficiency. Effectiveness refers to successfully producing the expected or desired result; it is the degree to which you achieve your objectives, solve problems, and realize profits. In business, effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your purpose. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Effectiveness is summed up by “doing the right things.” Efficiency is the accomplishment of a job with the minimum expenditure of time, effort, and cost - the shortest distance between a goal and a checkmark. In business, efficiency is summed up by “doing things right”. Being effective means being adequate to accomplish a purpose; producing the intended or expected result. Being efficient means performing or functioning in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort. Laozi uses the metaphor of people who achieve intended results in various jobs to illustrate how important it is for an effective leader to use effectiveness and efficiency to do the right things right, and to yield the most profitable and quickest route a leader can take to execute purpose. Laozi also claims that great leaders must have the purpose, i.e. to do good and be good. No matter whether you are a traveller, a speaker, an accountant, a blocker, and a <b>knotter,</b> you must have the purpose of doing the right things. You must have the strategy and efficient instruments to achieve their purposes. The efficient way for effective job in this passage are traveling without being on feet or vehicle, speaking without using any words, calculating without device, locking without bolts, and knotting without ropes. In so doing, the great positive impact can be exerted on environment and performance: no footprint and tracks left on environment, no spoken slips, no calculating mistakes, unlocked doors, and untied knots.|$|E

However these devices cannot make all knots used in the textile industry, thus workers still make knots by their hand in some textile mills.

Tracks corresponding to each knot must be carved {{on the surface of}} a mold. However experience by practice is needed to design a mold, thus a logical design process is demanded for anyone to design tracks.
