We firstly {{document}} {{the history of}} <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on the loan linked with human capital. Income Contingent Loan, a kind of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on loans has been introduced in the country since 2010. Income Contingent Loan is an income-contingent derivative loan from lender``s viewpoint in that payments begin only if a precondition is met. It is a <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> from borrower``s viewpoint as well; whether to exercise the option of getting-a-job depends on repayment strategy. However, existing research only analyzes {{the current status of}} foreign cases without considering their history and Korean specific factors on the <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> for loans. There is no research on its background and historical development. We fill the gap of this literature using interesting international cases. We find that student loan system has been introduced in order to encourage individuals to pay higher fraction of education cost which the government has paid since the 1950 s. In the 1980 s, student loan system has particularly evolved and become to create <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on the loan in order to minimize lender``s economic burden and risk exposure. Furthermore, this study examine the future prospect of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on loan. The <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on loan will evolve from debt-like toward equity-like investment. This will reduce the burden and exposure of governments while increasing the investment on human capital. This study has many policy implications discussing the development of student loan system, its vision and implementation...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} have escalated in {{significance in}} terms of their volume in global financial markets, widespread use and financial impact on companies and markets. They are akin to a two-edged sword; their use may mitigate or increase risk. Spectacular collapses in the past have brought considerable attention to these instruments. However, when used for hedging purposes, they potentially enhance or preserve value and mitigate risk of financial distress. Accounting for derivative instruments has had a difficult history with accounting standards adopting a piecemeal approach in accounting for financial instruments. However, accounting standards now require derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair values. Special requirements relating to hedge accounting apply to <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts</b> that are entered into for risk mitigation. The United States were faster in arriving at a comprehensive standard that required companies to report their <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts</b> on the balance sheet.
