50|$|Dairy {{products}} have long formed {{the backbone of}} Ireland's agricultural sector. In the early 19th century, the country was amongst the world's largest producers of dairy products. In 1848, Ireland accounted for two thirds of butter imports into the port of London. <b>Irish</b> <b>butter</b> came under pressure by competitors which were modernising their systems with the newly developed cream separators. As a consequence, <b>Irish</b> <b>butter</b> imports to London dropped to under one per cent in the early 1880s.|$|E
5000|$|The Irish Dairy Board (Board) was {{established}} {{by an act of}} the Oireachtas, the Dairy Produce Marketing Act 1961, and replaced the earlier Butter Marketing Committee. It was created to centralise the overseas marketing of Irish dairy products to achieve economies of scale and greater brand recognition. At the time of the Board's creation, the European Economic Community's market was closed to <b>Irish</b> <b>butter,</b> and the United Kingdom market limited Irish imports by an import quota.|$|E

2500|$|He joined An Bord Bainne, the Irish Dairy Board, in 1962, as General Manager, and {{developed}} the successful Kerrygold [...] "umbrella brand" [...] for <b>Irish</b> export <b>butter.</b> In 1966 he became Managing Director of the Irish Sugar Company. He soon developed {{a joint venture}} for freeze-drying food with the H. J. Heinz Co.|$|R

Later, glucose was shipped from the Netherlands to the Letterkenny Port. Today, only Irish sugar and Irish glucose are used. Butter {{has always been}} <b>Irish</b> Creamery <b>Butter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By 1752 he had {{established}} himself as a merchant selling [...] "wines, rum, <b>Irish</b> <b>butter,</b> soap, and coffee", etc. and invested in several other businesses. [...] During this early period Scott acquired several government positions. In 1752 he was named Justice of the Peace, a judge in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas, in 1754 Surveyor of Lumber, and from 1761 to 1763 was the Paymaster for the Halifax garrison. He may even have acted as Commander of Fort Sackville for a short period around 1770.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{in spite}} of the total {{annihilation}} of the Danish power in the Emerald isle, Ranald seemed to the eyes of men to be still a hale old warrior, ruling constitutionally--that is, with a wholesome fear of being outlawed or murdered if he misbehaved--over the Danes in Waterford; with five hundred fair-haired warriors at his back, two-edged axe on shoulder and two-edged sword on thigh. His ships drove a thriving trade with France and Spain in <b>Irish</b> fish, <b>butter,</b> honey, and furs. His workmen coined money in the old round tower of Dundory, built by his predecessor and namesake about the year 1003, which stands as Reginald's tower to this day. He had fought many a bloody battle since his death at Clontarf, by the side of his old leader Sigtryg Silkbeard. He had been many a time to Dublin to visit his even more prosperous and formidable friend; and was so delighted with the new church of the Holy Trinity, which Sigtryg and his bishop Donatus had just built, not in the Danish or Ostman town, but in the heart of ancient Celtic Dublin, (plain proof of the utter overthrow of the Danish power,) that he had determined to build a like church in honor of the Holy Trinity, in Waterford itself. A thriving, valiant old king he seemed, as he sat in his great house of pine logs under Reginald's Tower upon the quay, drinking French and Spanish wines out of horns of ivory and cups of gold; and over his head hanging, upon the wall, the huge doubled-edged axe with which, so his flatterers had whispered, Brian Boru had not slain him, but he Brian Boru.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{have stated}} that the French invented pecan pie soon after {{settling}} in New Orleans, after being introduced to the pecan nut by the Native American Quinipissa and Tangipahoa tribes. Claims have also been made of pecan pie existing in the early 1800s in Alabama, {{but this does not}} appear to be backed up by recipes or literature. Attempts to trace the dish's origin have not found any recipes dated earlier than a pecan custard pie recipe published in Harper's Bazaar in 1886. Well-known cookbooks such as Fannie Farmer and The Joy of Cooking did not include this dessert before 1940. The makers of Karo syrup significantly contributed to popularizing the dish and many of the recipes for variants (caramel, cinnamon, <b>Irish</b> creme, peanut <b>butter,</b> etc.) of the classic pie. The company has claimed that the dish was a 1930s [...] "discovery" [...] of a [...] "new use for corn syrup" [...] by a corporate sales executive's wife. Pecan pie was made before the invention of corn syrup and older recipes used darker sugar based syrup or molasses. The 1929 congressional club cookbook has a recipe for the pie which used only eggs, milk, sugar and pecan, no syrup. The Pecan pie came to be closely associated with the culture of the Southern United States in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
