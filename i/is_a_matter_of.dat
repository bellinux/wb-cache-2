Its script was awarded the ARTE International Prize for Best CineMart 2013 Project at the 42nd Rotterdam International Film Festival. Set in a dystopian near-future in which finding a partner <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> life and death, the film tells an unconventional love story. The film also stars Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, Olivia Colman, Léa Seydoux and John C. Reilly.|$|E

In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Monteverdi's first {{fifteen years}} of service in Mantua are {{bracketed}} by his publications of the third book of Madrigals in 1592 and {{the fourth and fifth}} books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him {{to the status of}} subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} {{and evolution of}} medieval warships <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate and conjecture: until recently, no remains of an oared warship from either ancient or early medieval times had been found, and information had to be gathered by analyzing literary evidence, crude artistic depictions {{and the remains of}} a few merchant vessels. Only in 2005–2006 did archaeological digs for the Marmaray project in the location of the Harbour of Theodosius (modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the galea type.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{role and}} {{contribution}} of war chariots in battlefield <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> dispute {{due to the}} lack of sufficient evidence. In general, it appears that during the first centuries (16th–14th century BC) chariots were used as a fighting vehicle while later in the 13th century BC their role was limited to a battlefield transport. Horse-mounted warriors were also part of the Mycenaean armies, however their precise role isn't clear due to lack of archaeological data.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no mention}} of NATO {{enlargement}} in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification, so there was no formal commitment not to expand. Whether or not the West informally committed to not enlarge NATO to the East <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> dispute among historians and international relations scholars. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer rejects that an informal agreement existed. Texas A University political scientist Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson argues that an informal agreement existed.|$|E
5|$|This {{alliance}} {{was probably}} a weakly centralized state, with a military organization {{similar to the one}} of the Hellenistic Kingdoms. The exact degree of centralization <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate, with archaeologists, such as archeologist Kris Lockyear, denying the existence of a state, because the archaeological evidence shows regional diversity and only a few region-wide trends. Others, such as historian Alexandru Diaconescu, dispute this and conclude that there was a centralized political structure.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers.

The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers.
