25|$|As desired and expected, news of {{a contest}} of such {{distance}} evoked strong enthusiasm both within and without the motorsport community. Newspaper and trade magazine articles used ever-new superlatives for the challenges expected to soon face both drivers and engineers, and continuing discussion throughout the spring and winter kept the race as the primary conversation piece of the average citizen. Everyone, it seemed, <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it.|$|E
25|$|All of them <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{about the}} Christian {{form of the}} Logos. The Catholic Church found it {{necessary}} to distinguish between the Christian logos and that of Heraclitus as part of its ideological distancing from paganism. The necessity to convert by defeating paganism was of paramount importance. Hippolytus of Rome therefore identifies Heraclitus along with the other Pre-Socratics (and Academics) as sources of heresy. Church use of the methods and conclusions of ancient philosophy as such was as yet far in the future, even though many were converted philosophers.|$|E

How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it, I don't know; so it is." ...|$|R

500|$|Iyall was {{observed}} by Mother Jones {{to be among}} {{a new group of}} female fronted rock bands that displayed a [...] "tough, wry, street-wise, [...] cynical" [...] attitude and sought to redefine {{the role of women in}} rock music. She developed a sizable following for her writing that covered topics like [...] "frustrated desire [...] sexually motivated rage" [...] from a female perspective. Critics praised her lyrics for their [...] "searing imagery", [...] "seething poetics", and [...] "" [...] "My approach was always that I <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I had a point of view," [...] Iyall said, commenting on her outspokeness.

500|$|He {{was sentenced}} to life on June 27, 1930, on the old murder charge. He {{remained}} silent during the trial. Cascioferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascioferro if he <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in his defense. Cascioferro stood up and said: [...] "Gentlemen, as you have been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for the only one I never committed." [...] The [...] "iron prefect", as Mori was known, wanted to give maximum publicity to the event. He had posters printed with pictures of Cascioferro and the text of the court sentence.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} style also rates highly; {{writing in}} The Guardian, Mark Lawson called the pilot [...] "glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work". Wry reference {{is made to}} Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed [...] "is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC". Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it [...] "talkative in the way television plays used to be when they <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English". Banks-Smith has also drawn attention to the masculine skew the programme has; [...] "Judge John Deed [...] is catnip to the ladies. These are [...] called Georgie, Charlie, Jo and—when Rita defies abbreviation—Coop".|$|E

500|$|The rest of {{the artwork}} and the liner notes were crafted by the graphic {{designer}} Tibor Kalman and his company M Kalman was a fervent critic of formalism and professional design in art and advertisements. He offered his services for free to create publicity, and discussed using unconventional materials such as sandpaper and velour for the LP sleeve. Weymouth, who was sceptical of hiring a designing firm, vetoed Kalman's ideas and held firm on the MIT computerised images. The designing process made the band members realise that the title Melody Attack was [...] "too flippant" [...] for the music recorded, and they adopted Remain in Light instead. Byrne has noted, [...] "Besides not being all that melodic, the music <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that at the time}} seemed new, transcendent, and maybe even revolutionary, at least for funk rock songs." [...] The image of the warplanes was relegated {{to the back of the}} sleeve and the doctored portraits became the front cover. Kalman later suggested that the planes were not removed altogether because they seemed appropriate during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979–81.|$|E
500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{was also}} a {{significant}} release during the burgeoning Hotlanta music scene. The scene started as a black music revival in Atlanta during the late 1980s, and developed {{with the success of}} LaFace Records and the national attention received by Atlanta-based recording artists and producers such as Toni Braxton, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri, and Babyface. The album offered realistic depictions of the city and veered from the Afrocentric themes of Arrested Development and Dupri's mainstream stylings. It was named the third best album of 1994 in ego trips list of [...] "Hip Hop's 25 Greatest Albums by Year 1980–98". Vibe included it as one of the [...] "150 Essential Albums of the Vibe Era (1992–2007)". The magazine also included the album on their 2004 list of [...] "51 Essential Albums" [...] that represent [...] "a generation, a sound, and in many cases, a movement", writing that [...] " [...] determined the South <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and after emerging form the Dungeon production lab, they said it all, sometimes sang it all—pointedly, funkdafied, and putting on absolutely no East Coast pretense.

2500|$|Beginning in the mid-1950s, Sheppard wrote {{a weekly}} column for Woman's Own, 520 words a week, [...] "trying {{to make one}} point that <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the {{everyday}} God in an accessible way". His column continued for 17 years. He wrote several books: Built As a City in 1974 about urban mission, Bias to the Poor in 1983, and two autobiographies, Parson's Pitch in 1964 and Steps Along Hope Street in 2002 (named after the street in Liverpool which links the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals).|$|E

2500|$|... (2007) Experts {{studied the}} {{protective}} properties of full face masks. The measurements {{showed that the}} workers were adequately protected. The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because they <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to each other) - and these results were not {{taken into account in}} the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the intercom stations (if necessary).|$|E
2500|$|Insisting {{that all}} mothers <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and {{a right to}} act, Barrett also {{successfully}} led large numbers of women to push the boundaries of what was acceptable for women to pursue. Historian Katherine Aiken finds Barrett’s current relatively small profile illuminating. [...] "One {{of the most prominent}} women of her time, Kate Waller Barrett is today a virtually unknown historical character." [...] Aiken notes that popular culture and historians have focused on female activists and social scientists [...] "who tended to be single, career women. Certainly, as a physician and trained nurse, Barrett's professional status was on par with any progressive reformer, male or female. However, unlike many of her contemporaries, Barrett relied on her role as wife and mother to establish her credentials.... Recent studies of maternalism {{have made it clear that}} middle-class women often used the rhetoric of motherhood to make inroads toward achieving changes favorable to women. Barrett and the NFCM illustrate this phenomenon".|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the first}} day, when [...] was {{finishing}} his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. [...] Afraid, the people left her alone. [...] In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but [...] was gone. [...] One man looked down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw [...] sitting {{by the side of}} the river combing her hair. [...] He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. [...] The people asked Coyote what to do. [...] He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. [...] He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. [...] If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. [...] Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. [...] The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> [...] "I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink." [...] The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. [...] "Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for." [...] The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.|$|E
