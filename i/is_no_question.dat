5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The later {{history of}} Kent shows clear {{evidence}} {{of a system of}} joint kingship, with the kingdom being divided into east Kent and west Kent, although it appears that there generally was a dominant king. This evidence is less clear for the earlier period, but there are early charters, known to be forged, which nevertheless imply that Æthelberht ruled as joint king with his son, Eadbald. It may be that Æthelberht was king of east Kent and Eadbald became king of west Kent; the east Kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in Kentish history. Whether or not Eadbald became a joint king with Æthelberht, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that Æthelberht had authority throughout the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, since there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds {{should be subject to}} cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E

The Ostrogoths were still more isolated, but even the Visigoths preferred to live among their own kind. As a result, the Goths settled in pockets. Finally, although Roman towns continued on a reduced level, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> as to their survival.|$|E

25|$|The Greater Toronto Area {{was home}} {{to a number of}} First Nations groups who lived on the shore of Lake Ontario long before the first Europeans arrived in the region. At various times the Neutral, Seneca, Mohawk and Huron nations were living in the vicinity.

While it is unclear as to who was the first European to reach the Toronto area, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> it {{occurred}} in the 17th century.|$|E

25|$|As {{the inquiry}} unfolded, home videos of {{initiation}} rites in the CAR's French-speaking commando {{found their way}} into the media. The new Minister of National Defence David Collenette argued that the videos were disgusting, demeaning and racist. With the continued accumulation of such politically damaging visibility, the Minister of National Defence advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to disband the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995. It has been suggested that this move was as much driven by budget cuts to the Canadian Forces as by the Somalia Affair, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that the affair gave the minister the public support needed to make his request for disbandment.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered an {{opportunity}} to do so. However, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand's alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun's advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi's hostility, which is why he was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.|$|E
25|$|Justice Brennan's opinion did {{not reach}} any of the {{questions}} on the limitations of sovereign immunity, or waiver thereof, that were considered by both the Court and the other dissents. Instead, Brennan argued that the Eleventh Amendment does not immunize states from being sued by their citizens at all. His position is that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of what the purported immunity covers, or whether it can be waived, {{because there is no}} immunity. He notes that the Eleventh Amendment, by its language, only bars suits against a state by citizens of other states. This leaves common law sovereign immunity, which Brennan asserts was surrendered by the states at the time they agreed to join into the United States.|$|E

25|$|Karmas {{are often}} wrongly {{interpreted}} as a method for reward and punishment of a soul for its good and bad deeds. In Jainism, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of there being any reward or punishment, as each soul is the master of its own destiny. The karmas {{can be said to}} represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires of a soul. They enable the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience. They ultimately mature when the necessary supportive conditions required for maturity are fulfilled. Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karmas that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the fruits.|$|E
25|$|Her {{father was}} Sir Bache Cunard, an {{heir to the}} Cunard Line {{shipping}} businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she {{spent a good deal}} of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and though this has been largely dismissed, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that he played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E
25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout generally {{declined in the}} second half of the 20th century due to angler overharvest, competition with exotic fishes, and overzealous egg collection. Populations rebounded in the park after the advent of catch-and-release-only fishing rules in the 1970s, but new and aggressive invaders are causing an increasing threat to these native fish and alarming park fisheries biologists. Nonnative lake trout, an effective fish predator, were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994. Throughout the west {{cutthroat trout}} populations preyed upon by introduced lake trout have typically declined, exhibited lower growth, or have disappeared. Aggressive lake trout control efforts by the National Park Service and no harvest limits have resulted in removing thousands of lake trout from Yellowstone Lake since 1994, including more than 12,000 in 2000. Still, the number of Yellowstone cutthroat trout monitored during the annual fall count in Yellowstone Lake was lower in recent years than at any other time in the 25-year history of the monitoring effort. Whirling disease, which has been implicated in recent years in the decline of trout populations in many western states, was discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1998. So far, it is unclear which of these two nonnative invaders has been the greater factor in the decline of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> they are causing it.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1882 R. Mowat {{published}} an inscription in which Fortuna is called daughter of Jupiter, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in {{the theology of}} Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this aporia would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the Not-Bound or Enemy of Bondage, that shows that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of choosing {{one of the two}} apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the Creative Energy, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.|$|E
