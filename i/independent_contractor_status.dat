In South Africa all the risks and obligations pertaining to the relevant employment taxes are squarely being placed on the shoulders of the employer, or if the <b>contractor</b> is truly <b>independent,</b> on the shoulders of the contractor. A failure to comply with all the complex legislation could result in dire consequences for the persons concerned. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a detailed analysis of all the relevant legislation in order to determine the obligations and potential risks for the employers and or contractors.

5000|$|Originally, the O'Farrell Theatre's {{management}} {{paid their}} dancers a flat fee per shift; in the 1980s, they replaced that fee {{with the federal}} minimum wage but allowed the women to accept tips. In 1994, Vince Stanich (the ecdysiasts' boss) created a separate company, Dancers Guild International (DGI), and changed the dancers' status from paid employees to that of unpaid [...] "independent contractors" [...] who had to pay DGI [...] "stage fees" [...] of up to $300 per eight-hour shift. Many O'Farrell stripteasers considered Stanich's new policy unfair and possibly illegal; two of them, Ellen Vickery and Jennifer Bryce, filed a class-action lawsuit against DGI (the plaintiffs would ultimately number more than 500), arguing that Stanich's reclassification of the dancers as independent contractors was unlawful {{and that they were}} owed back wages as well as a refund of the stage fees. The case was settled in 1998; the dancers were awarded $2.85 million. [...] Similar suits challenging <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> <b>status</b> have since been filed against numerous other strip clubs, and labor commissions as well as the courts have consistently ruled in favor of dancers and awarded past wages and stage fee reimbursements.

40|$|No {{tort reform}} has more {{potential}} {{to improve the}} quality of medical care and to reduce the frequency of patient injuries than exclusive hospital enterprise liability. Hospital enterprise liability would make hospitals liable for all patient injuries occurring in the hospital that are the product of provider negligence, regardless of the <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> <b>status</b> of the providers. In its 2 ̆ 2 exclusive 2 ̆ 2 form, enterprise liability would also eliminate the personal liability of individual physicians and nurses. Exclusive hospital enterprise liability has the potential to revive the dormant deterrent power of tort law. The reasons are simple. Unlike individual physicians, hospitals are experience-rated repeat players who have the vantage point and the resources needed to recognize and implement systematic improvements in the process of delivering health care. Adoption of enterprise liability would align the incentives of tort law with the goals of modern patient safety advocates who emphasize the need to shift our focus from the blaming of individual wrongdoers to the design of systems that anticipate and prevent human error. Exclusive enterprise liability would also reduce the disruption caused by the insurance cycle, spare high-risk specialists from shouldering a disproportionate share of health care 2 ̆ 7 s liability costs, reduce litigation costs that arise in multi-defendant lawsuits, and dampen the extraordinary anger of practicing physicians.

40|$|Determining {{whether an}} {{individual}} is an employee or an independent contractor is of primary importance when the individual is injured while performing assigned or contracted work. Under Nebraska law, an employee who is injured {{in the course of}} her employment is entitled to compensation from the employer. Once an injury occurs in the course of work, the injured individual has an incentive to argue that she is an employee. If her argument is accepted, she will be entitled to receive compensation from her employer or, more likely, the employer’s insurance provider. The employer or employer’s insurance provider has an opposite incentive: they want the individual classified as an independent contractor so they may avoid liability for the injury. The Nebraska Supreme Court in Larson v. Hometown Communications, Inc. addressed these two competing interests. The court in Larson clearly establishes a ten-factor analysis as controlling in determinations of employee or <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> <b>status.</b> Larson stands apart from other holdings because it emphasizes how each factor of the test should be applied to the facts, the clearest application of issues concerning employee/independent contractor analysis to date. Part II of this article sets out the facts of this case.

40|$|Background: <b>Independent</b> <b>contractor</b> <b>status</b> of NHS general dental {{practitioners}} (GDPs) and general medical practitioners (GMPs) {{has meant that}} both groups have commercial as well as professional identities. Their relationship with the state is governed by a NHS contract, the terms {{of which have been}} the focus of much negotiation and struggle in recent years. Previous study of dental contracting has taken a classical economics perspective, viewing practitioners’ behaviour as a fully rational search for contract loopholes. We apply institutional theory to this context for the first time, where individuals’ behaviour is understood as being influenced by wider institutional forces such as growing consumer demands, commercial pressures and challenges to medical professionalism. Practitioners hold values and beliefs, and carry out routines and practices which are consistent with the field’s institutional logics. By identifying institutional logics in the dental practice organisational field, we expose where tensions exist, helping to explain why contracting appears as a continual cycle of reform and resistance. Aims: To identify the factors which facilitate and hinder the use of contractual processes to manage and strategically develop General Dental Services, using a comparison with medical practice to highlight factors which are particular to NHS dental practice. Methods: Following a systematic review of health-care contracting theory and interviews with stakeholders, we undertook case studies of 16 dental and six medical practices. Case study data collection involved interviews, observation and documentary evidence; 120 interviews were undertaken in all. We tested and refined our findings using a questionnaire to GDPs and further interviews with commissioners. Results: We found that, for all three sets of actors (GDPs, GMPs, commissioners), multiple logics exist. These were interacting and sometimes in competition. We found an emergent logic of population health managerialism in dental practice, which is less compatible than the other dental practice logics of ownership responsibility, professional clinical values and entrepreneurialism. This was in contrast to medical practice, where we found a more ready acceptance of external accountability and notions of the delivery of ‘cost-effective’ care. Our quantitative work enabled us to refine and test our conceptualisations of dental practice logics. We identified that population health managerialism comprised both a logic of managerialism and a public goods logic, and that practitioners might be resistant to one and not the other. We also linked individual practitioners’ behaviour to wider institutional forces by showing that logics were predictive of responses to NHS dental contracts at the dental chair-side (the micro level), as well as predictive of approaches to wider contractual relationships with commissioners (the macro level). Conclusions: Responses to contracts can be shaped by environmental forces and not just determined {{at the level of the}} individual. In NHS medical practice, goals are more closely aligned with commissioning goals than in general dental practice. The optimal contractual agreement between GDPs and commissioners, therefore, will be one which aims at the ‘satisfactory’ rather than the ‘ideal’; and a ‘successful’ NHS dental contract is likely to be one where neither party promotes its self-interest above the other. Future work on opportunism in health care should widen its focus beyond the self-interest of providers and look at the contribution of contextual factors such as the relationship between the government and professional bodies, the role of the media, and providers’ social and professional networks.
