25|$|Nucleosomes are {{portions}} of <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>dsDNA)</b> that are wrapped around protein complexes called histone cores. These histone cores {{are composed of}} 8 subunits, two each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. This protein complex forms a cylindrical shape that dsDNA wraps around with approximately 147 base pairs. Nucleosomes are formed as a beginning step for DNA compaction that also contributes to structural support as well as serves functional roles. These functional roles are contributed by the tails of the histone subunits. The histone tails insert themselves in the minor grooves of the DNA and extend through the double helix, which leaves them open for modifications involved in transcriptional activation. Acetylation has been closely associated with increases in transcriptional activation while deacetylation has been linked with transcriptional deactivation. These reactions occur post-translation and are reversible.|$|E

50|$|PARP1 {{has a role}} in {{repair of}} {{single-stranded}} DNA (ssDNA) breaks. Knocking down intracellular PARP1 levels with siRNA or inhibiting PARP1 activity with small molecules reduces repair of ssDNA breaks. In the absence of PARP1, when these breaks are encountered during DNA replication, the replication fork stalls, and <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>dsDNA)</b> breaks accumulate. These dsDNA breaks are repaired via homologous recombination (HR) repair, a potentially error-free repair mechanism. For this reason, cells lacking PARP1 show a hyper-recombinagenic phenotype (e.g., an increased frequency of HR), which has also been observed in vivo in mice using the pun assay. Thus, if the HR pathway is functioning, PARP1 null mutants (cells without functioning PARP1) do not show an unhealthy phenotype, and in fact, PARP1 knockout mice show no negative phenotype and no increased incidence of tumor formation.|$|R

50|$|During an infection, one of {{the first}} forms of defense {{employed}} by the innate immune response is a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) encoded in the germline to recognize molecular patterns expressed by invading pathogens. These may either be on the membrane surface e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin Receptors (CLRs) or inside the cytoplasm e.g. Nod-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). In 2002, it was first reported by Martinon et al. that a subset of NLRs named NLRP1 were able to assemble and oligomerize into a common structure which collectively activated the caspase-1 cascade, thereby leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines especially IL-1B and IL-18. This NLRP1 multi-molecular complex was dubbed the ‘inflammasome’, which spurred much interest in the following years; since then, several other inflammasomes were discovered, two of which are also NLR subsets—NLRP3 and NLRC4. More recently, Hornung et al. classified an inflammasome of the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family, termed absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) which assembles upon sensing foreign cytoplasmic <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>dsDNA).</b> Notably, the pyrin domain of the adaptor protein ASC has recently been shown to function as a prion-like domain, through a self-perpetuating manner upon activation.|$|E

The DNA sense strand {{looks like the}} messenger RNA (mRNA) {{and can be used}} to read the expected protein code; for example, ATG in the sense DNA may correspond to an AUG codon in the mRNA, encoding the amino acid methionine. However, the DNA sense strand itself is not used to make protein by the cell. It is the DNA antisense strand which serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA. Since transcription results in an RNA product complementary to the DNA template strand, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA antisense strand. The mRNA is what is used for translation (protein synthesis).Hence, a base triplet 3'-TAC-5' in the DNA antisense strand {{can be used as a}} template which will result in an 5'-AUG-3' base triplet in mRNA (AUG is the codon for methionine, the start codon).

We obtained fluorescence-detected circular dichroism (FDCD) spectra, steady-state fluorescence spectra, and fluorescence lifetimes of the fluorophores in DNA.

NHEJ is the primary pathway for repairing dsDNA breaks throughout the G 0, G 1 and early S phases of the cell cycle [1]. Ku 86 and DNA ligase IV are two major proteins in the NHEJ pathway. We examined primary dermal fibroblasts from mice (wild type, Ku 86 +/−, Ku 86 −/−, and DNA ligase IV+/−) for chromosome breaks. Fibroblasts from Ku 86 +/− or DNA ligase IV+/− mice have elevated frequencies of chromosome breaks compared with those from wild-type mice. Fibroblasts from Ku 86 −/− mice have even higher levels of chromosome breaks. Primary pre-B cells from the same animals did not show significant accumulation of chromosome breaks. Rather the pre-B cells showed increased cell death. These studies demonstrate that chromosome breaks arise frequently and that NHEJ is required to repair this constant spontaneous damage...|$|R
