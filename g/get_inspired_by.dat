[...] De Villa said the script was much darker in earlier drafts, but that it was toned down due to financial reasons: [...] "The scenes between the mother and son were a lot more explicit, and we had to stay more at the level of hint and suggestion. What Heather's and Victor's characters did was a lot darker, as well—more than just the spanking, if you will!" [...] He also said that casting took place during the writing process: [...] "I always <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> actors and find myself writing for them. I don't necessarily mean writing for big-name actors or stars, but writing for actors I have worked in the past with or that I have seen in films and plays. That happened to me with the role of Victor Rasuk (who I loved in Raising Victor Vargas), Marlene Forte (a great actress, who I had the pleasure of working with on the stage), Richard Petrocelli (I had worked with him in my student short) and Elizabeth Peña (no words of introduction are necessary). For the rest of the roles, I was extremely open. My agent set me up with several meetings with very good actresses for the role that Heather Graham eventually did. One of them was Heather.

50|$|The arguably most {{important}} patron, however, was Pieter de la Court van der Voort (1664-1739). He was {{member of the}} De la Court family, who were rich cloth merchants, and became a successful economist himself. Pieter had {{a special interest in}} gardening (he introduced the pineapple to Europe) and art, and was a prominent collector 10. In his mansion in Leiden he devoted three separate rooms exclusively for the exhibition of his huge collection of paintings and other rooms contained more paintings 1. He is known to have commissioned Willem van Mieris to make paintings of all kinds - genre, portrait, landscape, history, and still life 1. In fact, he was so impressed by van Mieris’ skill, that he did not only commission original works, but also copies of well-known and much appreciated paintings. According to Pieter’s handwritten inventory of 1731 and that of his son Allard de la Court in 1749, Pieter commissioned Van Mieris to paint ten copies after the work of famous 17th-century painters, such as his father Frans I van Mieris, Gerard Dou, Ary de Vois (1632-1635 to 1680) and Philip Wouwerman (1619-1688). These works must have been accessible to him, although it is not known where the originals were located when Van Mieris copied them 1. Such copies functioned as high-valuable substitutes for much-loved 17th-century paintings that were unavailable to most collectors. Some of these copies were so good that both salesmen and owners would let them pass as the originals. However, the collectors eager to buy copies still held a clear distinction in value between original and copy. An average copy by Willem van Mieris commissioned by De la Court was 60 guilders, while he was paid much more for work of his own design 1. In total, Pieter de la Court commissioned Van Mieris at least 28 paintings, including copies. The large collection and close contact between the two men gave Van Mieris the opportunity to <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> the work of other artists, such as Van Bossuit’s sculptures, on which many of Van Mieris’ drawings are based 1. Besides paintings, Pieter de la Court also commissioned 4 vases for the garden of his Leiden mansion (see Key Works). The two were not only associated through business, but were also intimate friends and De la Court was proud of that. He denied any offer on his friend’s work and protected the works themselves and their uniqueness carefully. After his death, he left his collection to his son Allard de la Court, who extended it with more, mostly commissioned, work 11.|$|E

So far, interpretations of this dialogue suggest that Mouffe attempts to revise Schmitt's friend/enemy-distinction and carve out a theory of agonistic pluralism. An interpretation on these grounds, this article argues, reduces the dialogue to its analytical dimension and cannot comfortably be upheld. Mouffe indeed appropriates Schmitt's friend/enemy-distinction, but she also <b>gets</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> the metatheoretical facet of his intellectual heritage with the result that her theory becomes organically interwoven with a polemical dimension. Rather than aiming at a post-structuralist defanging of Schmitt's conception of the political, Mouffe recontextualizes and applies it to the current academic discourse, for this allows decontesting her radical pluralist cause by establishing a we/them opposition along a political/post-political divide...|$|R
