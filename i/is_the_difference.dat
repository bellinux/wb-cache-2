5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E
5|$|Over-provisioning (sometimes spelled as OP, over provisioning, or overprovisioning) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the}} {{physical}} {{capacity of the}} flash memory and the logical capacity presented through the operating system (OS) as available for the user. During the garbage collection, wear-leveling, and bad block mapping operations on the SSD, the additional space from over-provisioning helps lower the write amplification when the controller writes to the flash memory.|$|E
5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E

25|$|Size {{refers to}} how tight the {{tolerances}} {{are on the}} size, as measured by two parallel plates {{in contact with the}} ball surface. The starting size is the nominal ball diameter, which is the , or theoretical, ball diameter. The ball size is then determined by measuring the ball diameter variation, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the largest and smallest diameter measurement.

25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
