Chocolate blooming is often related to the migration of lipids to the surface followed by subsequent recrystallization. Here, the migration pathway of oil into a cocoa butter matrix with different dispersed particles was investigated by employing microfocus small-angle X-ray scattering and contact angle measurements. Our results showed that the chocolate powders get wet by the oil during the migration process and that the oil is migrating into the pores within seconds. Subsequently, cocoa butter is dissolved by the oil, and thus, its characteristic crystalline structure is lost. The chemical process provoked by the dissolution is also reflected by microscopical changes of the surface morphology of chocolate model samples after several hours from the addition of oil to the sample. Finally, the surface morphology was investigated before and after oil droplet exposure and compared to that of water exposure, whereby water seems to physically migrate through the particles, namely cocoa powder, sucrose, and milk powder, which dissolve in the presence of water...|$|R

50|$|In cocoa butter, {{there are}} six {{essential}} polymorphic forms. The polymorphic transformation theory {{is based on the}} fact that bloomed chocolates are always found to contain the most stable VI polymorph of cocoa butter. According to this theory, bloom occurs through the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation of cocoa butter from a less stable form (form IV or V) to the most stable form (form VI). The technology of good chocolate production depends on ensuring that only the stable form of the cocoa butter ingredient exists in the final product. In poorly tempered chocolate, form IV will transform to V and eventually form VI, resulting in bloom, while in well-tempered chocolate, form V will transform to form VI and bloom may also occur. Elevated and/or fluctuating temperatures promote the transformation rate and thus also promote the rate of bloom formation. However, it is found that the production of form VI from form V does not always lead to bloom; a direct relationship cannot be established between <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> and the evolution of the crystalline forms. The onset of transformation from form V to form VI crystals is not the cause of visual bloom; rather, this transition should be considered as an aspect of cocoa butter recrystallization that may result in bloom.|$|E

A bloomed chocolate product is characterized by the loss of its initial gloss and the formation of a gray-whitish haze, which makes the product unappealing from a consumer point of view. In the industry, most of the <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> related problems arise in filled chocolate products, like pralines and chocolate-coated biscuits. In these products, oil migration is considered the main cause of <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. It leads to the dissolution of solid cocoa butter crystals in the chocolate shell which may recrystallize with the formation of undesired crystals. These give rise, upon growth, to visual <b>fat</b> <b>bloom.</b> When looking at the available literature, most of the studies elucidate the possible mechanisms of oil migration and the subsequent <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> formation using model systems. These model systems are sometimes too distant from the real industrial applications and the important role of the microstructure of the products are often neglected, although it plays a crucial role in migration-induced <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. The main objective of this review is to describe the relationships between chocolate microstructure, oil migration, and <b>fat</b> <b>bloom.</b> Practical applications: This review can be used as a base for the development of microstructural strategies to retard oil migration and <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development in filled chocolates. An important strategy to retard oil migration and migration-induced <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> is the creation of more dense structures. By creating denser structures, the overall mobility is reduced leading to a decrease in the rate and extent of oil migration. Also, more dense structures hinder recrystallization and Ostwald ripening, thereby delaying the migration-induced <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. As fillings are less standardized and not bound by legislation, modification of the filling composition and microstructure offers more opportunities in delaying <b>fat</b> <b>bloom.</b> The main objective of the review is to describe the relationships between chocolate microstructure, oil migration, and <b>fat</b> <b>bloom,</b> as illustrated in this scheme.

At different storage times shortly after production (0, 1, 4 h), the chocolate batches, varying in tempering method, tempering degree and amount of added butter oil, were evaluated by DSC, pNMR and texture analysis. Discriminant analysis and principal component analysis were combined to investigate the potential towards prediction. The batches were classified into groups depending on the time when white spots appeared (13 wk). A good separation (100 % correct classifications, 100 % using cross-validation) was obtained using the afore-mentioned analyses and storage times.

40|$|Abstract <b>Fat</b> <b>bloom</b> on {{chocolate}} {{is a major}} problem for the confectionery industry since the unappetising appearance and negative sensory effects lead to rejection by customers. The presence of <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> on chocolate confectionery systems is usually connected to migration of liquid fat due to the difference in composition between filling triacylglycerols (TAGs) and cocoa butter TAGs. The filling TAGs migrate into the chocolate shell where they can dissolve cocoa butter crystals. Consequently, cocoa butter TAGs migrate to the surface followed by a re-crystallisation into the most stable polymorph β 1 VI. Cocoa butter is the main fat in chocolate which can be considered as a composite material consisting of solid particles (i. e. cocoa particles, sugar crystals and in some cases milk solids) in a lipid continuous matrix of cocoa butter. The final quality of the product is highly dependent on the polymorphic forms of the cocoa butter TAGs in the fat phase and the distribution and size of the solid particles. In this thesis the migration of filling oil into model shells of cocoa butter and of chocolate has been investigated as well as the <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. This was implemented through the development of novel analytical methods, where optical profilometry and confocal Raman microscopy give information regarding the shell microstructure at and below the surface, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) provides the opportunity to follow the movement of brominated TAGs from the filling into the shell. By combining these techniques with established methods such as low vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LV SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) a toolkit for the investigation of oil migration connected to surface microstructure development has been established. Imperfections, in form of pores and protrusions, at chocolate surfaces have been identified, confirming previous studies reporting these features. These imperfections were characterised using confocal Raman microscopy indicating that some protrusions are filled with fat and some are air-filled in conjunction with a fat shell, while the pores consist of air. These imperfections continued further into the chocolate shell, thus, it is suggested that they could be connected to oil migration and further to <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. The microstructure of model shells was shown to have a substantial impact on the TAG migration rate which was connected to <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. By applying seeding as pre-crystallisation technique to the shells the migration rates were decreased as well as the development of <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> crystals at the surface. In contrast, model pralines with poorly tempered shells indicated a higher oil migration rate and accelerated development of <b>fat</b> <b>bloom.</b> Furthermore, the presence of non-fat particles was shown to increase the migration rate and the <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. Additionally, the particle size of the non-fat particles proved to have an impact, where a smaller particle size gave rise to higher migration rates and thus, accelerated <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. The importance of controlled storage temperature was further demonstrated, where a minor increase in temperature from 20 to 23 °C lead to substantially higher migration rates and accelerated <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development. The mechanisms of oil migration in chocolate confectionery systems have mainly been referred to as molecular diffusion or capillary flow in literature. However, through results from the work of this thesis, convective flow is suggested to be an important contribution to the migration of filling oil in addition to molecular diffusion and capillary flow...|$|E

A novel set of analytical techniques was used and by combining migration results with surface topology results clear differences could be observed between the samples. At 23 degrees C storage the samples with a particle size of 15 mu m showed higher rate of oil migration and, further, the earliest development of <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> at the surface. This could be observed both macroscopically and microscopically. Thus, it appears as a larger specific surface area of the nonfat particles facilitates migration of filling oil, possibly due to a more heterogeneous and coarser crystal network with higher permeability. Molecular diffusion cannot explain the level of oil migration observed and, thus, convective flow {{is assumed to be}} an important contribution in addition to the molecular diffusion.

40|$|Fat {{migration}} {{is the main}} reason for the loss of quality of stored chocolate products. It includes the unpleasant softening of filled chocolates and the hardening of their fillings. Chocolates with nuts, nougat, marzipan or wafers often develop <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> because of migration of filling oils. The kinetics of fat migration and the major parameters as product geometry, diffusion constant, storage temperature and formulations are described. HPLC-analysis was used to study the diffusion of triglycerides...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fat</b> <b>bloom</b> {{development}} and associated changes in microstructure, texture, appearance and melting properties were studied. Dark chocolates varying in particle size (PS) (D 90 of 18, 25, 35 and 50 μm) were processed and pre-crystallised to under-temper regime. Bloom was induced by storing products under ambient conditions (18 ± 2 °C, RH 50 %) {{and changes in}} texture, surface whiteness, gloss and melting properties evaluated on cooling and after every 24 h in storage until reaching asymptotic values. Microstructure of products were characterised during blooming using stereoscopic binocular microscopy. Measurements on texture and surface whiteness showed initial rapid increases with consequential reductions in gloss within the first 96 h, followed by gradually decreasing gradient until reaching asymptotic levels. Storage influenced melting properties (Tonset, Tend, Tpeak and ΔHmelt) in products causing polymorphic transformation from βIV to βVI within 72 h. Micrographs showed similar surface crystalline network structure and inter-particle interactions among products from different PS after tempering, and bloom initiation occurred within 24 h in storage resulting in appearance of both liquid and unstable fat {{on the surface of}} products. The unstable fat then re-crystallised during storage into more stable polymorphs and crystal growth was promoted by Ostwald ripening (larger crystals growing at the expense of smaller ones), with the appearance of white crystalline structure which spread gradually throughout the chocolate mass after 96 h. Product containing the largest PS (50 μm) showed the fastest <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> rate, with the smallest PS (18 μm) the least, attributed mainly to hydrodynamic forces by capillary action. It was hypothesised that <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> development was initiated by capillarity, followed by growth of re-crystallised fat by diffusion across the entire chocolate mass until fully bloomed...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of crystallization processes is demonstrated at {{examples in the}} field of chocolate technology. The distribution of triglycerides and the concentration of minor lipid components influence nucleation speed. Solidification kinetics are described by means of Avrami equation. The nucleation and solidification of chocolate masses are predominantly dependent on shear stress. The shear rate accelerates cristallization and enhances polymorphic transitions. The rheology of chocolate masses is strongly influenced by the concentration of cocoa butter crystals. Within finished products lipid migration and <b>fat</b> <b>bloom</b> limit shelf life. The kinetics of fat migration are measured and calculated...|$|E
40|$|Cocoa {{butter is}} a {{vegetable}} fat that can exist under six different forms. Differential ScanningCalorimetry (DSC) {{is a tool}} that {{is often used to}} study cocoa butter crystallization. However, nosystematic method has been established to analyze the resulting curves and therefore obtain clearinterpretation of the tempering process and <b>fat</b> <b>bloom.</b> The aim of this work is to establish a methodto identify the crystalline state of cocoa butter in chocolate during tempering and blooming. Thepresented methodology will be a tool for the industry to study the tempering process and the qualityof the final product. This method will also be useful to enhance the comprehension of the stillmisunderstood blooming phenomena. A standard procedure is developed to measure the thermal behavior of a chocolate sample usingDSC. A mathematical model is used to fit the DSC curves and determine the thermal parameters asthe melting temperature, the endset temperature and the enthalpy of reaction. This method is applied to follow the tempering process of chocolate. Also, to study the <b>fat</b> <b>bloom,</b> awell-tempered chocolate is subjected to temperature variations to induce blooming. Thermalanalyses of the crystalline state of cocoa butter are made throughout the all experience using DSC. The thermogram of a well-tempered chocolate shows a well defined thin peak. While the curve of abloomed chocolate shows a wider peak with a shoulder and a peak temperature up to 1 °C higher. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{stochastic}} model {{based on a}} cellular automaton (CA) for describing the spatio-temporal dynamics of fat migration in chocolate confectionery, {{as well as the}} resulting <b>fat</b> <b>bloom,</b> is conceived. Several hypotheses on the underlying mechanisms for fat migration exist, but there is no consensus on the correct ones. Although many researchers are studying this industrially important phenomenon, few models describing it have been developed. Therefore, the incorporation of different mechanisms of fat migration into a stochastic CA-based model is discussed and the model parameters are investigated for a better understanding of both the model and the complex fat migration phenomenon...|$|E
