An existing high productivity model is extended to lower values of the Peclet number that correspond to the present operating conditions of the Langley ATP robot. (The Peclet number is the dimensionless ratio of inertial to diffusive heat transfer.) In sensitivity studies, all {{of the process and}} material parameters are individually varied. The model yields the corresponding variations in the effective bonding time (EBT) referred to the glass transition temperature. According to reptation theory, the <b>interlaminate</b> bond strength after wetting occurs is proportional to the one-fourth power of EBT. The model also computes the corresponding variations in the thermal input power (TIP) and the mass and volumetric process rates.

The dykes comprise downward-bifurcating intrusions up to 0. 5 m thick and several metres in length and are intruded into glaciogenic deposits (sandy gravel, gravelly sand, <b>interlaminated</b> silt and sand, and diamicton). The dykes were sourced from a clast-poor sandy diamicton, interpreted as a subglacial till, and were intruded downwards beneath Solheimajokull glacier during a previous phase of advance. As the glacier advanced southwards, it loaded the sediment column resulting in the intrusion of dykes with a consistent south–southwest dip (with rare northward-dipping examples). The dyke fills are characterised by laminated sediment, with laminae oriented parallel to the dyke margins and comprise <b>interlaminated</b> clay, silty clay, silt, sand, sandy gravel and diamicton. In some dykes, high concentrations of pebble- to boulder-sized clasts occur in association with rotated pods of the laminated sediment.

Adhesive interleaving can be used to contain local damage within a group of plies, i. e., to arrest crack propagation on the <b>interlaminate</b> level, and it can increase the amount of normal displacement the laminate can withstand before failure. However, the addition of adhesive interleaving to a laminate does not significantly increase its load carrying capability.

The panel construction under consideration was an E-glass fiber-reinforced composite laminate infused with vinyl ester resin (Derakane 8084). The panel was layered bi-axially with plain-woven fiber orientations at 0 ° and 90 °. Panel dimensions were approximately 203 mm × 203 mm × 1 mm (8 in × 8 in × 0. 04 in). Experiments were carried out with the panel fully clamped in a holding fixture, which was in turn fastened inside a water tank. The fixture was fastened {{in such a way}} as to allow for explosive loading experiments in the following environments: water submersion with water backing, water submersion with air backing, and air immersion with air backing. Experiments were performed in room temperature conditions, and additional experiments in the submerged environments were also performed at high and low water temperatures of 40 °C and 0 °C, respectively. A stereo Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system was employed to capture the full-field dynamic behavior of the panel during the explosive event. Results indicated that the immersion environment contributes significantly to the blast response of the material and to the specimens’ appreciable damage characteristics. The water submersion with air backing environment was found to encourage the greatest panel center point deflection and the most significant damage mechanisms around the boundary. The air immersion with air backing environment was found to encourage less center point deflection and exhibited significant impact damage from the explosive capsule. The water submersion with water backing environment encouraged the least panel deflection and minimal <b>interlaminate</b> damage around the panel boundary and center. Water temperature was found to influence the panel center point deflection, but not damage mechanisms.

40|$|Bolted cores made of coated {{silicon steel}} sheets {{constitute}} {{a vital part}} of heavy electrical equipment for transformers, motors and turbogenerators. Bolted laminates are eminently suitable for facilitating smooth magnetic flux paths, but, unfortunately, they are unable to suppress <b>interlaminate</b> shearing caused by flexural vibration generating noise levels often exceeding 100 dB during operation. The resulting din and cacophony in the surrounding has become a major environmental concern. This thesis makes an attempt to develop theoretical, experimental and numerical models for evolving an effective stiffness approach enhancing the design and analysis underlying nonlinear flexure of bolted laminates. While large machine cores contain thousands of thin sheets bolted together along with end plates, this thesis reports the results obtained on two different assemblies. Two 375 mm long 60 mm wide and 10 mm thick plates assembled with 3, 4 or 5 bolts constitute the first configuration. The second one which is much more realistic comprises 80 coated 270 micron silicon steel sheets with end plates of 2 or 4 mm thickness held together by 3 or 5 bolts. Static 3 point bend tests on these bolted assemblies are followed by instrumented impact tests. Static bending tests highlight the role of frictional nonlinearity inducing a drop in the stiffness due to sliding between the plates. An experimentally determined effective modulus in the initial linear range is utilized for static and dynamic finite element simulations. Nonlinear response of bolted plates is simulated using contact elements in between the sliding plates, plates and the bolts heads. Since the first fundamental mode of vibration dominates the tribomechanical vibration induced noise, the primary focus is on the fundamental frequency in bending. There is generally a good overall agreement in all the results obtained through theory, experiment and FE simulation. Experiments, however, unveil quite complex nonlinear effects induced by friction and plasticity outside the scope of this thesis. However, the low amplitude response of bolted laminates which is reasonably well captured in this thesis represents the starting point for initiating a more elaborate effort for addressing large amplitude nonlinear flexure in bolted laminates. These findings shed light on estimating and controlling noise and vibration levels in heavy electric machines...|$|E

The investigation has been conducted using a multidisciplinary approach to the study of sediment cores positioned on high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and TOPAS/CHIRP sub-bottom profiles. Core correlation and the age model were based on 27 AMS 14 C samples, rock magnetic parameters, lithofacies sequences, and the presence of marker beds including two oxidized layers marking the post Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) inception of deglaciation (OX- 2) and the Younger Dryas cold climatic event (OX- 1). Sediment facies analysis allowed the distinction of a number of depositional processes whose onset appears closely related to ice stream dynamics and oceanographic patterns in response to climate change. The glacigenic diamicton with low water content, high density, and high shear strength, deposited during glacial maxima, indicates ice streams grounded at the shelf edge. Massive release of IRD occurred at the inception of deglaciation in response to increased calving rates with possible outer ice streams lift off and collapse.

[...] 18 pages, 9 figures, 2 tablesThe depositional {{history of}} the Storfjorden and Kveithola trough-mouth fans (TMFs) in the northwestern Barents Sea has been {{investigated}} within two coordinated Spanish and Italian projects {{in the framework of}} the International Polar Year (IPY) Activity 367, NICE STREAMS. The investigation has been conducted using a multidisciplinary approach to the study of sediment cores positioned on high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and TOPAS/CHIRP sub-bottom profiles. Core correlation and the age model were based on 27 AMS 14 C samples, rock magnetic parameters, lithofacies sequences, and the presence of marker beds including two oxidized layers marking the post Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) inception of deglaciation (OX- 2) and the Younger Dryas cold climatic event (OX- 1). Sediment facies analysis allowed the distinction of a number of depositional processes whose onset appears closely related to ice stream dynamics and oceanographic patterns in response to climate change. The glacigenic diamicton with low water content, high density, and high shear strength, deposited during glacial maxima, indicates ice streams grounded at the shelf edge. Massive release of IRD occurred at the inception of deglaciation in response to increased calving rates with possible outer ice streams lift off and collapse. The presence of a several-meter-thick sequence of <b>interlaminated</b> sediments deposited by subglacial outbursts of turbid meltwater (plumites) indicates rapid ice streams' melting and retreat. Crudely-layered and heavily-bioturbated sediments were deposited by contour currents under climatic/environmental conditions favorable to bioproductivity. The extreme sedimentation rate of 3. 4 cma- 1 calculated for the plumites from the upper-slope area indicates a massive, nearly instantaneous (less than 150 years), terrigenous input corresponding to an outstanding meltwater event. We propose these <b>interlaminated</b> sediments to represent the high-latitude marine record of MeltWater Pulse 1 a (MWP- 1 a). Different bathymetric and oceanographic conditions controlled locally the mode of glacial retreat, resulting in different thickness of plumites on the upper continental slope of the Storfjorden and Kveithola TMFs. It is possible that the southern part of Storfjorden TMF received additional sediments from the deglaciation of the neighboring Kveithola ice stream. © 2013 This study was supported by the Spanish IPY projects SVAIS (POL 2006 - 07390 /CGL) and IPY-NICE STREAMS (CTM 2009 - 06370 -E/ANT), the Spanish project DEGLABAR (CTM 2010 - 17386), and the Italian projects OGS-EGLACOM, and PNRA-MELTSTORMPeer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{composites}} allow avoiding catastrophic failure, a key {{limitation of}} composite materials, and {{can provide a}} balanced suite of modulus, strength and ductility. The aim {{of this research is}} to manufacture hierarchical hybrid composites using a combination of continuous high elongation fibres and intermingled hybrids made out of highly aligned discontinuous fibres with lower elongation to achieve pseudo-ductility through control of failure development. The HiPerDiF (High Performance Discontinuous Fibres) method that allows a high level of fibre alignment, leading to excellent mechanical properties close to continuous fibre composites, was used to produce the intermingled hybrid discontinuous fibre preforms. The hierarchical hybrid composite configuration is composed of an intermingled hybrid discontinuous fibre layer sandwiched between continuous S-glass layers. The overall stress-strain response of the intermingled hybrid composites and the hierarchical hybrid composites was investigated for different fibre types and ratios. The analytical modelling approach previously developed by the authors for <b>interlaminated</b> hybrid composites was modified for this new type of hierarchical composite. The experimental results were analysed and the analytical model was used to evaluate the optimised balance of constituents to maximise pseudo-ductile strain in tension...|$|R
40|$|The Petersilie {{oil field}} in Ness County, Kansas {{produces}} {{out of the}} Mississippian System, a reservoir composed mainly of shallow water carbonates, at depths of around 4375 ft (1334 m). The lithology of the field ranges from limestone to dolomite, to <b>interlaminated</b> limestone-dolomite beds. Chert is commonly found throughout. Petersilie field lies {{to the west of}} the Central Kansas Uplift, and to the east of the Hugoton Embayment. The field saw much drilling activity in the 1960 ’s, when it reached a production peak of nearly 378, 000 barrels of oil per year. Production declined swiftly after that until the late 1990 ’s, when waterflooding was successfully employed. In this study, a reservoir model was produced for the Mississippian as it occurs in Petersilie field using the Department of Energy’s EdBOAST reservoir modeling software, with the intent of providing a reference for future drilling activity in the Mississippian and determining reservoir characteristics that may have contributed to the effectiveness of waterflooding in this area. The reservoir model was checked by simulation with a companion reservoir simulator program, BOAST 98. Subsequent comparison of simulated and actual oi...|$|R
40|$|The lower Prairie Evaporite {{of central}} Saskatchewan {{consists}} of three distinct members, which are named, in ascending order, the Ratner, Whitkow and Shell Lake Members. The Ratner Member consists of <b>interlaminated</b> and interbedded carbonate and anhydrite, the Whitkow Member of halite with anhydrite in the lower part, and the Shell Lake Member of anhydrite with a medial carbonate unit called the Quill Lake marker beds. The carbonate platform of the lower Winnipegosis member is overlain locally by carbonate banks with up to 300 feet of relief, which {{are included in the}} upper Winnipegosis member. Basinal areas between these banks became the sites of accumulation of the lower Prairie Evaporite which reached a maximum thickness of 350 feet. The upper 20 feet of the carbonate banks consist of algal-derived pisolitic and stromatolitic material, and of some pisolitic and stromatolitic material which probably formed in the vadose zone during subaerial exposure. These shallow water and supratidal-subaerial carbonates extend into the adjacent anhydrite of the Shell Lake Member in off-bank areas. Thus, the upper portions of the Winnipegosis banks appear to be equivalent to the uppermost part of the lower Prairie Evaporite. The Ratner Member averages 45 feet in thickness and contains eight distinct units with laminated carbonate and, or, anhydrite, which can be traced throughout {{the northern part of the}} study-area. Sub-millimeter carbonate laminae, in one of the units, can be correlated exactly over a distance of two miles. The remarkable uniformity and lateral continuity of layers in the Ratner Member suggest deposition in a basinal environment with relatively quiet water conditions. This is contrary to previous investigations which have inferred a supratidal origin for these sediments. Layers rich in organic matter have been preserved in these sediments by precompaction calcitization and dolomitization. Thick sequences of nodular mosaic and massive anhydrite, of the Shell Lake and Whitkow Members, formed on the flanks of carbonate banks. These anhydrites accumulated preferentially on the southeast sides of carbonate banks. If the regional flow was from the northwest, maximum evaporite deposition occurred on the leaward sides of banks. These thick anhydrites are lateral equivalents of, and interbedded with halite of the Whitkow Member. The relationship of nodular mosaic and massive anhydrite (Shell Lake-Whitkow Member) on bank-flanks, and <b>interlaminated</b> carbonate and anhydrite (Ratner Member), and halite (Whitkow Member), in basinal areas, is analogous to other ancient evaporite-carbonate occurrences, such as the Zechstein of Germany.

40|$|In the Podolian Dniester Basin (southwestern Ukraine) the Lower Devonian marine {{deposits}} {{are represented}} by about 530 m thick continuous sequence of <b>interlaminated</b> carbonate and schale outcrops at several localities. Conodonts occur {{in most of the}} carbonate layers of the whole Lochkovian but are not abundant and their ramiform elements are mostly broken or lacking. Therefore, only the pectiniform, Pa elements of twenty five stratigraphically important conodont species oc− curring in the region are discussed and two new species, Caudicriodus schoenlaubi and Pandorinellina? parva are pro− posed. The hypothetical phyletic relationships within the main representatives of the icriodontid and spathognathodontid genera, Caudicriodus, Zieglerodina, and Pandorinellina? are traced. Comparison of the previously published and newly obtained data revealed discrepancies in the hitherto used interpretation of some of the conodont taxa and their strati− graphic ranges. Contrary to the earlier reports, Caudicriodus postwoschmidti does not occur in the lower Lochkovian but only in the middle part of the Chortkiv Formation, high above the Monograptus uniformis Zone. Based on new material and verification of the previous determinations, a modified scheme of the Lochkovian conodont zonation in Podolia is proposed. Conodont zones: Caudicriodus hesperius, C. transiens, C. postwoschmidti, C. serus, and?Caudicriodus steinachensis are distinguished. The zones are correlated with conodont zonations in other regions—Barrandian, Cantabrian Mountains, Pyrenees, and Nevada.

Brunner Coal Measures in the Takaka valley (up to 350 m thick) consist of cross-bedded sand and gravel, <b>interlaminated</b> sand and silt, bioturbated muddy sandstone, carbonaceous mudstone and coal. Five facies associations are recognized and interpreted as river/floodbasin, estuarine and shallow marine deposits. In the Aorere and Parapara River catchments, two new members are recognized: the Quartz Wash Member, comprising quartzose sand and conglomerate, and the Washbourn Limonite Member, a sedimentary iron-ore deposit. The Takaka Limestone (up to 100 m thick), consists of bryozoan, bivalve or sandy grainstone or packstone, deposited on a tidal current-swept shallow-middle shelf with minimal terrigenous influx. Diagenesis was controlled by pressure-solution during deep burial, and resulted in a rightly cemented rock with dolomite and neomorphic features. The Tarakohe Mudstone (up to 900 m thick) is dominated in its lower half by massive mudstone of hemipelagic and turbiditic origin, and in its upper half by shallow shelf-estuarine sandstones and mudstones. The Waitui Sandstone (160 m thick) comprises shallow marine sandstone. Deposition of the Brunner Coal Measures took place in localized fault-angle depressions. The Takaka Limestone was deposited {{during a period of}} regional subsidence and minimal tectonic activity. The Tarakohe Mudstone and Waitui Sandstone were deposited in synclinal basins which were later modified by rising monoclinal boundaries...|$|R

This core contains a range of lithologies, including various types of terrigenous clastic diamictite, conglomerate and breccia, sandstone and mudrocks, volcanic lava, pyroclastic and reworked volcanic sedimentary rocks, and diatomite. The succession is divided into fourteen lithostratigraphic units (LSUs), two of which (LSUs 1 and 8) are further subdivided into three and four sub-units, respectively, based on changes in abundance of lithologies. Thirteen lithofacies are recognized, ranging from diatomite and bioturbated, fossil-bearing mudrocks (representing most ice-distal environments) through <b>interlaminated</b> sandstone-mudrock facies and sandstone with varying dispersed gravel components, to diamictite and conglomerate (representing most ice-proximal environments), and also lava, volcanic breccia and volcanic sedimentary rocks representing extrusion, fragmentation, fallout and reworking of material from basaltic volcanic activity. Three distinct types (‘motifs’) of vertical facies stacking patterns are recognized, recording glacial advance-retreat-advance cycles {{with varying degrees of}} facies preservation. Carbonate, pyrite and zeolites are the principal secondary mineral phases in the core. The pyrite overprint is particularly prominent in {{the lower half of the}} core, where it typically obscures stratification and sediment texture.
