Fate has it when JJ makes a <b>job</b> <b>transition</b> {{to take a position}} of Prosecutor, resulting in the two working under the same roof once again. With their distinctly different approaches in handling cases, plus the interference of a new secretary (Grace Wong), the already severe crisis in their relationship has been pushed to the edge to an nonredeemable state. Though JJ is still perturbed by the refusal of his marriage proposal, Chris actually has something rarely known to the others.On the other hand, an orphan Kam Po-tei (Sammy Leung), was adopted by JJ’s father Kam Po-cheung (Benz Hui), and JJ are as close as biological brothers. As a detective of the Criminal Investigation Department, Po-tei frequently cooperates with JJ. During an operation, he gets to know an undercover detective Ngai Mei-san (Sharon Chan). Though the pair are completely incompatible with each other, they do acquire the other’s strengths to offset their own deficiencies. Furthermore, Po-tei initiates to pursue Mei-san regardless of his own lot or the fact she has already a fiancé. As each of them is hesitating over their future, a murder case involving a wealthy businesswoman Pong Tit-sum (Alice Chan) makes them go through an arduous and fierce journey all together.|$|E

While most existing work on recommender systems focuses on finding what to recommend to a user, this paper places emphasis on when to make appropriate recommendations {{and its impact on}} the item selection in the context of a job recommender system. The approach we propose, however, is general and can be applied to any recommendation scenario where the decision-making process is dependent on the tenure (i. e., the time interval) between successive decisions. Our approach is inspired by the proportional hazards model in statistics. It models the tenure between two successive decisions and related factors. We further extend the model with a hierarchical Bayesian framework to address the problem of data sparsity. The proposed model estimates the likelihood of a user’s decision to make a <b>job</b> <b>transition</b> at a certain time, which is denoted as the tenure-based decision probability. New and appropriate evaluation metrics are designed to analyze the model’s performance on deciding when is the right time to recommend a job to a user. We validate the soundness of our approach by evaluating it with an anonymous job application dataset across 140 + industries on LinkedIn. Experimental results show that the hierarchical proportional hazards model has better predictability of the user’s decision time, which in turn helps the recommender system to achieve higher utility/user satisfaction...|$|E

We find that apprenticeships increase wages, and change wage profiles with more growth upfront, while wages in the non-apprenticeship sector grow at a lower rate but for longer. Non-apprentices face a much higher variance to the shocks of their match specific effects and a substantially larger variance in initial level of the offered wages. We find no evidence that qualified apprentices are harder to reallocate following job loss.

We show that informational differences across jobs give rise to experimentation in that workers may be willing to sacrifice current period output in order to take jobs where learning is fast. In addition, we find that while experimentation is the most valuable when workers are young and inexperienced, the optimal level of experimentation is initially small, rises as workers gain experience and then eventually declines. We also find that <b>job</b> <b>transitions</b> and wage growth over the life-cycle are more involved than predicted by existing models. In addition, we use our model to shed light on the importance of job diversity and early career outcomes to future wage growth and on why identical workers (along both observable and unobservable dimensions) may experience distinct career outcomes even in the long run. Finally, we show that our model’s prediction are broadly consistent with known patterns of wage dynamics and <b>job</b> <b>transitions...</b>|$|R

The question of how individuals cope with organizational change continues to be an increasingly important topic. This longitudinal study attempted to integrate models of change by including specific dispositional traits that help to predict how individuals interpret and cope with change. A four-stage model proposed by Isabella was enhanced to include behaviors and coping strategies that individuals use as they move through the change process. It was predicted that certain dispositional traits would predict certain coping behaviors and outcomes. Additionally, it was predicted that certain coping strategies and dispositional traits would be more related to themselves and certain stages throughout the change process. A total of 115 participants were recruited from various sites that included individuals who were going thorough some stage of the <b>job</b> <b>transition</b> process. Data was collected over a three-month time period, including four waves. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and regression were the two main analytic strategies used to analyze the relationships between dispositional traits, coping strategies, and key outcomes. Although specific hypotheses were not confirmed, results indicated important relationships between dispositional traits, coping behaviors, and outcomes for individuals encountering a <b>job</b> <b>transition.</b> Results generally indicate that individuals who have a Positive Outlook and are Risk Tolerant are going to be likely to use Problem-Focused Coping strategies, wheras individuals who do not possess these traits will be likely to use Emotion-Focused Coping strategies.

40|$|Re-Creation in the Age of Wisdom: Involuntary <b>Job</b> <b>Transition</b> in Women over 50 Frances Elizabeth Lyon-Dugin A {{large share}} of our time with each other is {{centered}} around employment or ‘work’, however we define it. A time of transition between jobs, especially when a job is lost through no choice of our own, is stressful. For women over 50, there are unique challenges during involuntary work transition. Ageism and sexism exist in U. S. culture, and the jobseeking environment is no exception, as this research illuminates. This dissertation explores and builds support for women over 50 in re-creating themselves through the transition of involuntary job loss, and into their next phase, whatever that might be. Six women who have experienced <b>job</b> <b>transition</b> when they were over 50 years of age are the co-researchers in this research, which {{is referred to as}} an “inquiry”. In order to fully explore the shared ways of experiencing transition and derive the greatest shared meaning from the inquiry, a social construction framework and stance is used. The methods within this framework that were chosen are one-on-one dialogues done in an Appreciative Inquiry (AI) style, autoethnography, narrative analysis, and a focus group dialogue around the narrative themes using a sequenced process of questioning. Background about the economic times in which these transitions occurred, input from individuals supporting people in <b>job</b> <b>transition</b> and related literature around the topic provide context for the rich narrative of the women involved. The women generate new meaning around the transition experience through their narratives and dialogue. What emerges from the collective voices and dialogue is a message of connection, resilience, and re-creation, along with a strong desire to mentor and share wisdom with others in future roles. Negative, challenging feelings are explored through the dialogue, but the focus turns to hope and renewed energy. Relationships that held value during the process are nurtured and expanded. Positive connections are built with new enthusiasm, and the women highlight their relatedness and their desire to continue engagement with others. A possibility for this inquiry includes connecting the positive, re-creative energy of the over 50 woman in transition with entrepreneurial environments and those workplaces experiencing high rates of change. Maximizing the desire of women over 50 to mentor and share their wisdom could also add richness to the shared community of women. Continued dialogue with the over 50 worker to explore implicit biases, prejudice, stigma and ageism in the employment process and workplace is needed. Explorative dialogue around increasing the economic and human vitality of the over 50 worker could help address future labor shortages, ensure financial security and optimize the value and contributions of workers of all ages...|$|E
