5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is {{the most common type of}} fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
25|$|Overall {{increased}} risk of death in both adults, where it is estimated to kill 53,000 nonsmokers per year, making it the 3rd leading cause of preventable death in the U.S, and in children. The World Health Organization states that passive smoking causes about 600,000 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> and about 1% of the global burden of disease. As of 2017, passive smoking causes about 900,000 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> which is about 1/8 of all deaths caused by smoking.|$|E

25|$|Smoking {{generally}} has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic {{processes such as}} respiration. Diseases related to tobacco smoking {{have been shown to}} kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> from 1990 to 2015.|$|E
25|$|Descriptions of {{the disease}} date from the 1950s. The virus was first {{described}} in 1969 from a case {{in the town of}} Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria. Lassa fever occurs relatively commonly in West Africa including the countries of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ghana. There are about 300,000 to 500,000 cases which result in 5,000 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 0.8 to 1.2 {{billion people}} {{globally}} have ascariasis, {{with the most}} heavily affected populations being in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia. This makes ascariasis {{the most common form}} of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. As of 2010 it caused about 2,700 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> down from 3,400 in 1990. Another type of Ascaris infects pigs. Ascariasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E

25|$|Serving as {{the medical}} {{officer in the}} general {{military}} hospital in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1899 {{he was the first}} to describe and successfully treat North American hookworm. He was a tireless clinician and conducted an exhaustive study of the anemia caused by hookworm infestation, which was responsible for as many as 12,000 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> From 1903–1904, he organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign, which cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population). This work reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{malnutrition}} is {{the biggest}} contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Six million children die of hunger every year. Underweight births and intrauterine growth restrictions cause 2.2 million child <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin A or zinc, for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition {{in the first two}} years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.|$|E
25|$|This natural {{resource}} is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability {{is a major}} social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion {{people around the world}} routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who {{do not have access to}} safe water and sanitation during the 2003 G8 Evian summit. Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation. Poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> are caused by polluted drinking water. The World Health Organization estimates that safe water could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from diarrhea each year.|$|E

2500|$|Worldwide in 2015, {{hepatitis}} A {{occurred in}} about 114 million people, chronic hepatitis B affected about 343 {{million people and}} chronic hepatitis C about 142 million people. In the United States, NASH affects about 11 million people and alcoholic hepatitis affects about 5 million people. Hepatitis results {{in more than a}} million <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> most of which occur indirectly from liver scarring or liver cancer. In the United States, hepatitis A is estimated to occur in about 2,500 people a year and results in about 75 deaths. The word is derived from the Greek hêpar (...) , meaning [...] "liver", and [...] (...) , meaning [...] "inflammation".|$|E
2500|$|Hypothermia is {{the cause}} of at least 1,500 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in the United States. It is more common in older people and males. One of the lowest {{documented}} body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is [...] in a near-drowning of a 7-year-old girl in Sweden. Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described. For those for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%. Deaths due to hypothermia have {{played an important role in}} many wars. The term is from Greek ὑπο, ypo, meaning [...] "under", and θερμία, thermía, meaning [...] "heat". The opposite of hypothermia is hyperthermia, an increased body temperature due to failed thermoregulation.|$|E
6000|$|San Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York; {{there are}} 60 deaths {{a week in}} the former and 500 {{a week in the}} latter--if they have luck. That is 3,120 <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in San Francisco, and eight times as many in New York--say about 25,000 or 26,000. The health of the two places is the same. So we will let it stand as a fair {{presumption}} that this will hold good all over the country, and that consequently 25,000 out of every million of people we have must die every year. That amounts to one-fortieth of our total population. One million of us, then, die annually. Out of this million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed, shot, drowned, hanged, poisoned, or meet a similarly violent death in some other popular way, such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirt conflagrations, getting buried in coal-mines, falling off house-tops, breaking through church, or lecture-room floors, taking patent medicines, or committing suicide in other forms. The Erie railroad kills 23 to 46; the other 845 railroads kill an average of one-third of a man each; and the rest of that million, amounting in the aggregate to that appalling figure of 987,631 corpses, die naturally in their beds! ...|$|E

60|$|There is a {{plenty of}} other testimonies in the magazine, but these quoted samples will answer. They show the kind of trade the Science is driving. Now we {{come back to the}} question; Does it kill a patient here and there and now and then? We must concede it. Does it {{compensate}} for this? I am persuaded that it can make a plausible showing in that direction. For instance: when it lays its hands upon a soldier who has suffered thirty years of helpless torture and makes him whole in body and mind, what is the actual sum of that achievement? This, I think: that it has restored to life a subject who had essentially died ten <b>deaths</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> for thirty years, and each of them a long and painful one. But for its interference that man would have essentially died thirty times more, in the three years which have since elapsed. There are thousand of young people in the land who are now ready to enter upon a life-long death similar to that man's. Every time the Science captures one of these and secures to him life-long immunity from imagination-manufactured disease, it may plausibly claim that in his person it has saved 300 lives. Meantime it will kill a man every now and then; but no matter, it will still be ahead on the credit side.|$|E
