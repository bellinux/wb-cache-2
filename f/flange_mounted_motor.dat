50|$|Rotating paddle level sensors are a {{very old}} and {{established}} technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed gear motor that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> on the <b>motor</b> contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed {{from a variety of}} materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as Pearlite, Bentonite or fly ash, special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals.|$|R

With regard to the non-linear and time-varying problem of the contact force, the mathematical model of the new force control system was presented and the fuzzy PID control strategy was used to drive the proposed system.

50|$|A full-diameter non-fast-opening {{rear door}} costs little, all things considered. On larger machines, {{it can be}} mounted on a hinge, davit, or dolly {{assembly}} (see photo above) that allows it to be swung or {{moved away from the}} autoclave once its bolted <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> has been separated. This provides the best possible access to the works inside. It also means that critical components are never buried deep inside the machine where they are hard to get at and thus very likely to be ignored until they cause problems. One mid-sized autoclave built for a southern aircraft repair shop to be as cheap as humanly possible lacked easy access to the circulation fan, and, when last observed by one of the manufacturer's service engineers, was making the most alarming dry-bearing noises whenever it ran.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide <b>flanges)</b> <b>mounted</b> above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|R

Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric <b>motors</b> <b>mounted</b> directly onto each saw.

50|$|Rather than {{employing}} a rigid frame to <b>mount</b> <b>motors</b> and rotors as {{is done in}} quadcopters and other multirotors, in the switchblade mechanism motors and rotors are mounted on movable arms. These arms can pivot and so enable storage of the rotors and motors inside the fuselage, where they do not cause aerodynamic drag and hence enable to aircraft to fly faster and more efficient. Compared to a pure winged aircraft, the VTOL system, including the switchblade mechanism, increases the weight of an aircraft by around 15%.|$|R

40|$|An {{extractor}} type ionization gauge {{has been}} developed for <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> in a 15. 7 mm diam. aperture. The gauge electrodes are aligned by ceramic plates. A cylindrical anode grid of 9 mm diam. and 12. 5 mm length is formed of photo-etched W-sheet.

The height of the electrodes {{from the top of}} the anode grid to the base of the hemispherical collector is 18. 9 mm. The gauge design is a compromise between obtaining a low X-ray or pressure limit, high sensitivity and high electron emission current. The foregoing, given in the same order, were respectively 5 * 10 /sup - 12 / torr; 5 torr/sup - 1 / for N/sub 2 / at 10 mA emission current and 6 torr/sup - 1 / at below 5 mA; and an emission current of between 5 - 10 mA which gave the high anode current density required to maintain a clean grid.
