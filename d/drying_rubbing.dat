50|$|The Schafer {{brothers}} were {{the subject of}} many articles and books, particularly for their origination of a <b>dry</b> <b>rub</b> seasoning {{and the way in}} which the pit beef was grilled at high heat over hardwood. Feature articles about the style of beef appeared in Saveur Magazine suggesting it was considered Baltimore's version of barbecue. Soon to follow came Baltimore-raised author Steven Raichlen whose featured article in the New York Times gave away the base recipe for the <b>dry</b> <b>rub</b> seasoning. Raichlen featured Big Fat Daddy's recipes many times thereafter, reprinting them in his Barbecue Bible series of cookbooks.|$|R

50|$|A strict {{trimming}} process {{is essential to}} the rich taste. Legs of beef are thoroughly defatted and seasoned with a <b>dry</b> <b>rub</b> of coarse salt and spices, such as juniper berries, cinnamon and nutmeg. They are then left to cure for a few days. A drying period of between one and three months follows, depending on the weight of the particular bresaola. The meat loses up to 40% of its original weight during aging.|$|R
5000|$|Memphis {{barbecue}} {{is primarily}} two different dishes: ribs, which come [...] "wet" [...] and [...] "dry", and barbecue sandwiches. Wet ribs are brushed with sauce {{before and after}} cooking, and dry ribs are seasoned with a <b>dry</b> <b>rub.</b> Barbecue sandwiches in Memphis are typically chopped pork served on a simple bun and topped with barbecue sauce, and cole slaw. Of note is the willingness of Memphians to put this chopped pork on many non-traditional dishes, such as spaghetti, pizza or nachos.|$|R
30|$|Fabrics {{are often}} rubbed against other surfaces, and color change during the {{abrasion}} process should be minimized. In the present study, the color fastness to rubbing {{of the samples}} GS- 04 and GS- 06 was tested. The <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> color fastness of the gold NP-treated silk fabrics was rated as 5 for both GS- 04 and GS- 06. And the rating of the wet color fastness of the fabrics with gold NPs was assessed to be 5. The staining of the cotton cloths was assessed to be 4 – 5 for both GS- 04 and GS- 06 under wet and dry conditions. The results demonstrate that the silk fabrics colored with gold NPs exhibited good color fastness to <b>rubbing</b> (<b>dry</b> or wet).|$|R
50|$|The last, and in {{many cases}} optional, {{ingredient}} is the barbecue sauce. There are no constants, with sauces running the gamut from clear, peppered vinegars to thick, sweet, tomato and molasses sauces to mustard-based barbecue sauces, which themselves range from mild to painfully spicy. The sauce may be used as a marinade before cooking, applied during cooking, after cooking, or used as a table sauce. An alternate form of barbecue sauce is the <b>dry</b> <b>rub,</b> a mixture of salt and spices applied to the meat before cooking.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The study {{investigated}} the effects of different methods of application of selected mordants on dyeing woven cotton with dyes from the stem bark of Albizia coriaria. The methods of application of mordants used includes; pre-mordanting, simultaneous mordanting and post-mordanting. The effects on cotton analyzed are color fastness to; light, washing, wet and <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> and color characteristics on CIELab color coordinates. Aqueous extraction method was used to extract the dye. Some selected mordants were used for dyeing viz; alum, ferrous sulphate 1, and iron water. In the control dyeing {{without the use of}} mordants, very good fastness were registered with the following fastness ratings; for washing (4 - 5), <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> (5), wet rubbing (5) and light (4). The natural dye is a substantive dye since it registered very good fastness grades without the use of mordants. The use of mordants improved color fastness to light from ratings of (4) to (5) and (6) for iron water and ferrous sulphate and a poor fastness of (3) was recorded for alum. Post-mordanting method registered the best overall fastness results and the best color strengths K/S values and color saturation values C. However, the most brilliant colors were registered with simultaneous mordanting method with all mordants. However, there was no observable effect of mordanting methods on the redness or yellowness of color. Index Terms- Albizia Coriaria, color fastness, mordanting, substantive dye. I...|$|R

This museum is part of the National Food and Beverage Foundation. The museum's exhibition is curated by Steven Raichlen who is credited for helping Big Fat Daddy's get early publicity. Schafer's induction was based solely on Schafer's contribution to Maryland's pit beef and <b>dry</b> <b>rub</b> culinary history which Raichlen calls [...] "Baltimore's Version of Barbecue". Schafer's old Pit Beef Sign, vintage meat slicer, and other objects are on display from the original pit beef stand circa 1982.|$|R
5000|$|Memphis-style {{barbecue}} {{is one of}} {{the four}} predominant regional styles of barbecue in the United States, the other three being Carolina, Kansas City, and Texas. Like many southern varieties of barbecue, Memphis-style barbecue is mostly made using pork, usually ribs and shoulders, though many restaurants will still serve beef and chicken. Memphis-style barbecue is slow cooked in a pit and ribs can be prepared either [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". [...] "Dry" [...] ribs are covered with a <b>dry</b> <b>rub</b> consisting of salt and various spices before cooking and are normally eaten without sauce. [...] "Wet" [...] ribs are brushed with sauce before, during, and after cooking.|$|R

30|$|Rubbing {{fastness}} of the dyed samples {{was determined}} using automatic Crockmeter. The method adopted is from ISO 105 X 12 evaluation procedure [22]. Both <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> and wet rubbing of the dyed fabric were assessed. Suitable testing device {{for determining the}} colour fastness to rubbing consists of a reciprocating straight line rubbing motion and a rubbing finger. The rubbing finger shall exert a downward force of 9  ±  0.2  N moving to and fro 20 times, 10 times in each direction {{in a straight line}} along a path of 10  ±  3  cm track. A bleached white fabric is attached to the rubbing finger and is rubbed against the dyed sample. While assessing wet rubbing fastness, the fabric is moistened with water and then rubbed. The staining of the cotton rubbing cloths is assessed with the grey scale for staining.|$|R
50|$|Parts of the Midwest also {{incorporate}} {{their own}} styles of barbecue into their culinary traditions. For example, in Kansas City, barbecue entails {{a wide variety}} of meats, sweet and thick sauces, <b>dry</b> <b>rubs,</b> and sliced beef brisket. Kansas City barbecue {{is a result of the}} region’s history; a combination of the cooking techniques brought to the city by freed slaves and the Texas cattle drives during the late nineteenth century has led to the development of the region's distinctive barbecue style. Barbecue as a cultural tradition spread from the South and was successfully incorporated into several Midwestern regions such as western Missouri, again owing to the cultural ideals that the barbecue tradition represents and the need for locals to express those ideals. Variations of these ideals by region are reflected in the great diversity of barbecue styles and traditions within the United States.|$|R
