5|$|On {{the day of}} the abdication, the Oireachtas, the {{parliament}} of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and {{to be involved in the}} making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|The federal Ministry of <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> and {{its local}} all-union {{affiliates}} would regularly convene {{at the federal}} Council of Ministers and its Union Republics branches to discuss the policy, duties and responsibilities of the MER.

This organ also discussed international problems and solved such problems in the international arena.|$|E

Though Báthory {{remained}} {{distrustful of}} the Habsburgs, he maintained {{the tradition of}} good relations that the Commonwealth had with its Western neighbor and confirmed past treaties between the Commonwealth and Holy Roman Empire with diplomatic missions received by Maximilian's successor, Rudolf II. The troublesome south-eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579. The Sejm of January 1578 gathered in Warsaw was persuaded to grant Báthory subsidies for the inevitable war against Muscovy.|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} how derivation tree fragments {{based on a}} variant of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) {{can be used to}} check treebank consistency. Annotation of word sequences are compared both for their internal structural consistency, and their <b>external</b> <b>relation</b> {{to the rest of the}} tree. We expand on earlier work in this area in three ways. First, we provide a more complete description of the system, showing how a naive use of TAG structures will not work, leading to a necessary refinement. We also provide a more complete account of the processing pipeline, including the grouping together of structurally similar errors and their elimination of duplicates. Second, we include the new experimental <b>external</b> <b>relation</b> check to find an additional class of errors. Third, we broaden the evaluation to include both the internal and <b>external</b> <b>relation</b> checks, and evaluate the system on both an Arabic and English treebank. The evaluation has been successful enough that the internal check has been integrated into the standard pipeline for current English treebank construction at th...|$|R

Before Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary, the organisational structure of the MER mostly stayed the same. As many other Soviet agencies, the MER had an inner-policy group known as the Collegium, {{made up of the}} minister, the two first deputy ministers and nine deputy ministers, among others. Each deputy minister usually headed his own department.|$|E
5|$|Jersey {{is neither}} a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. It does, however, have a {{relationship}} with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972. However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This {{is a result of the}} manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like Gibraltar, being a European territory for whose <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> the United Kingdom was responsible, but that that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.|$|E

The chairman and {{the other members of the}} Standing Committee have to resign from their posts when the National Assembly dissolves itself, which it normally does every fifth year. The chairman presides over the sessions of the National Assembly and authenticates laws and resolutions passed by the National Assembly by signing them. The chairman leads the activities of the Standing Committee and organises its <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> with other state bodies and is responsible for maintaining cordial relations between the members of the Standing Committee.

5|$|At Fort Belvedere, on 10 December, Edward {{signed his}} written abdication notices, {{witnessed}} by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, {{it was given}} effect by Act of Parliament: His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. Under changes introduced in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster, a single Crown for the entire empire {{had been replaced by}} multiple crowns, one for each Dominion, worn by a single monarch in an organisation then known as the British Commonwealth. Though the British government, hoping for expediency and to avoid embarrassment, wished the Dominions to accept the actions of the home government, the Dominions held that Edward's abdication required the consent of each Commonwealth state. This was duly given; by the Parliament of Australia, which was at the time in session, and by the governments of the other Dominions, whose parliaments were in recess. The government of the Irish Free State, taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in a major step towards its eventual transition to a republic, passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 December to remove references to the Crown. The King's abdication was recognised a day later in the <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> Act of the Irish Free State and legislation eventually passed in South Africa declared that the abdication took effect there on 10 December. As Edward VIII had not been crowned, his planned coronation date became that of George VI instead.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro had full {{political}} {{backing from}} the three levels of the Government of Brazil—Federal, State and City—providing all guarantees and covenants required by the IOC, {{as well as some}} additional undertakings. All levels government, as well as all major political parties in the country, pledged complete support for the bid and endorsed the conduct of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil. On June 23, 2008, the Brazilian president formed the Government Action Management Committee, under the patronage of the Minister of Sport Orlando Silva, which coordinated Federal government actions during the bid process. Another act created the Olympic Development Authority (ODA) on January 17, 2009, to coordinate public services and infrastructure delivery for eventual Games in Rio de Janeiro, based in the pioneer model developed by Sydney for the 2000 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Under legal aspects, the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) would be the entity responsible for planning and staging the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. According to the IOC, the existing legislation was sufficient to enable the organization of the Games and would be amended or modified to suit the Olympic Charter if needed. The Ministry of <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> and the Ministry of Labor guaranteed the entry, exit and working arrangements for Games personnel. People in possession of a valid passport and an Olympic or Paralympic Identity and Accreditation Card, in lieu of a visa, will be able to enter the Brazilian territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of British {{expansion}} in India was characterised by the co-existence of two approaches towards the existing princely states. The first was a policy of annexation, where the British sought to forcibly absorb the Indian princely states into the provinces which constituted their Empire in India. The second was a policy of indirect rule, where the British assumed suzerainty and paramountcy over princely states, but conceded to them sovereignty and varying degrees of internal self-government. During {{the early part of}} the 19th century, the policy of the British tended towards annexation, but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a change in this approach, by demonstrating both the difficulty of absorbing and subduing annexed states, and the usefulness of princely states as a source of support. In 1858, the policy of annexation was formally renounced, and British relations with the remaining princely states thereafter were based on subsidiary alliances, whereby the British exercised paramountcy over all princely states, with the British crown as ultimate suzerain, but at the same time respected and protected them as allies, taking control of their <b>external</b> <b>relations.</b> The exact relations between the British and each princely state were regulated by individual treaties and varied widely, with some states having complete internal self-government, others being subject to significant control in their internal affairs, and some rulers being in effect little more than the owners of landed estates, with little autonomy.|$|E

40|$|This study forms {{part of a}} {{reflection}} on the future actions of the European Union (EU) {{in the field of}} <b>external</b> cultural <b>relations.</b> It begins by taking stock of the main EU mechanisms for supporting European <b>external</b> cultural <b>relations</b> since 2007 in order to ascertain which policy areas are involved in funding culture and the kinds of projects and actors that receive funding. The second part of the paper looks at the shortcomings of current EU funding possibilities and proposes some alternative models of cooperation and funding, which have been developed by other actors in the area of European <b>external</b> cultural <b>relations.</b> The review of the current situation with regard to EU support for <b>external</b> cultural <b>relations</b> is largely based on internet research into various EU programmes and on interviews with representatives of the EU. The alternative cooperation and financial models presented {{in the second part of}} the study were identified within the framework of interviews with stakeholders in European <b>external</b> cultural <b>relations</b> and in an experts' workshop held in Brussels on 20 February 2014 under the banner "New cooperation models for European external cultural relations"...|$|R
