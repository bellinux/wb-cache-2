40|$|Abstract. As the Internet {{continues}} to grow, current networks {{are composed of}} a large number network devices from diverse vendors. The tasks of operating and managing these devices are getting more difficult and complicated. For that reason, IETF Netconf Working Group has an ongoing effort to standardize network configuration management. The Netconf protocol helps to <b>exchange</b> <b>configuration</b> information between a manager and agent. The protocol is able to effectively manage various devices on a network. However, it is still problematic for the manager to discover and manage configurable parameters in all the agents. A configuration task should follow a pre-defined process that is only obtained through hands-on experience. Because there is no formal methodology to describe such configuration processes, a series of configuration tasks becomes very inefficient when using the Netconf protocol only. This paper proposes a mechanism that can quickly discover devices and their parameters and easily recognize methods to manipulate the configuration information on them. We present the architecture for XCMS-WS which meets this mechanism. Web Services technologies, such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, support discovery agents and recognize agent services. Using these Web Services technologies, we have designed a more powerful and flexible system than the existing XCMS. For validation, we have applied XCMS-WS for the configuration management of NG-MON, a distributed, real-time Internet traffic monitoring and analysis system...|$|E
40|$|Thermo-economic {{modelling}} {{techniques are}} well known techniques to optimise power plant designs. These methods are usually based on {{the definition of a}} superstructure that includes the major options of the design. If this approach has proved to be appropriate for the optimisation of several conventional NGCC (Natural Gas Combined Cycles), it reveals some weaknesses when dealing with particularly complex systems where heat integration leads to a lot of possible heat <b>exchange</b> <b>configuration.</b> This is for example the case in advanced cycles in zero emission plants where numerous heat exchanges between the gas turbines, the steam network and the CO 2 capture units can be considered. In this situation, the superstructure approach is not anymore practical and new modelling techniques are needed. In this paper, we present a new modelling technique developed {{to be used in the}} context of a multi-objective optimisation framework. This method uses a thermodynamic model of the energy flows of the energy conversion units. The results of the model allow the calculation of the hot and cold streams to be considered in the heat exchanger network. A heat cascade model using the ?Tmin concept is used to compute the optimal integration of the heat exchange in order to maximise the energy conversion. In this model, a special steam cycle model has been developed to represent all the possible heat exchange interactions and to compute the optimal flowrates in the system with a minimum of structural information. The third part of the model is the thermo-economic estimation of the system cost to deduce the performances of the system. An optimisation method, based on a multi- objective evolutionary algorithm is then used to identify the most important system configurations. The method is illustrated on an AZEP (Advanced Zero Emission Plant) combined cycle design...|$|E
40|$|Lakeland Steel Limited {{developed}} a pilot plant for biomass pyrolysis based on sawdust. The pilot plant {{was based on}} an auger screw design which was indirectly heated using a double pipe heat <b>exchange</b> <b>configuration</b> to prevent oxidation (combustion) of the feedstock. This thesis covers the preliminary assessment of sawdust pyrolysis for R. H Tregoweth sawmills on behalf of Lakeland Steel Limited. Proximate and ultimate analyses were deployed on the sawdust to determine its composition. Proximate analysis results gave a moisture content of 60 %. The dry solids had an organic matter content of 99. 22 % with ash making the balance. Ultimate analysis was used to determine content levels of elemental carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen sulphur and oxygen. The results on a dry basis were 47. 2 %, 6. 5 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 3 %, and 44. 9 % respectively. Drying models were also used to analyse the sawdust drying characteristics. Drying curves were obtained experimentally and four models: Newton; Page; Henderson and Pabis; and Simpson and Tschernitz, were fitted to the data and their accuracy of fit was determined using residual squared sum of errors. Page’s model was used to describe the sawdust behaviour in the dryer design as it had the highest accuracy. The sawdust reaction kinetics were determined using data from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and analysed using distributed action energy model. The kinetics were observed at three heating rates of 10, 20 and 30 °C/min with a maximum temperature of 900 °C under an argon atmosphere. Sawdust was modelled as a mixture of water, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Good agreement between Gaussian distribution functions for each component and experimental data were observed. Pilot plant trials were performed using a three factor-three level design of experiment. The factors under investigation were; feedstock moisture content with levels at 15, 30 and 60; reaction temperature with levels at 400, 450 and 500 °C; and reactor auger speed with levels at 15, 20 and 25 rpm. Experiments at 60 % moisture could not be performed to completion as the auger blocked repeatedly. The other two moisture contents showed that moisture content enhanced heat exchange properties of the feedstock and this generally increased the amount of volatile organic matter released. It was observed that for 15 % moisture sawdust increase of temperature did not consistently exhibit an increase in degree of devolatilisation of organic matter. However, the 30 % moisture sawdust showed an increase in devolatilisation with increase in temperature. The effects of increasing reactor auger speed had the most consistent trend with which an increase in speed showed a decrease in degree of devolatilisation thus increasing char yield. The empirical data collected from lab scale and pilot plant experiments were used to create mass and energy balances. These were the basis of the large scale mobile pyrolysis plant which was designed to process 3. 45 tonnes per hour. Due to size restrictions the large scale dryer was not fitted in the container. It was then determined that the feedstock would either be dried using an onsite kiln or the reactor would process green sawdust. A preliminary economic feasibility assessment was performed for the base case scenario which processed pre-dried sawdust of 15 % moisture content at 400 °C and a retention time of 45 minutes. A sensitivity analysis based on predicted optimistic and pessimistic conditions showed that automation of the plant had the potential to increase the economic viability of the large scale process...|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{energy levels}} of dome-shape InAs self-assembled quantum dots (SAQD) grown by the Stranski-Krastanow mode on GaAs substrates {{are similar to}} those obtained from a two-dimensional harmonic-oscillator. A simple selection rule allows transitions only that preserve angular momentum, depicted with atomic-like orbital labels s, p, d, f, etc. This electronic structure was examined with photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) techniques. As well, in magnetic fields up to 28 Tesla applied parallel to the growth direction, SAQD energy-level degeneracies were lifted. The number of branches observed is correlated to the angular momentum. The ground state (GS) level at zero angular momentum is shifted quadratically under the magnetic field and the behavior could be explained with the Fock-Darwin (F-D) spectral model. The effect of annealing at temperatures from 825 °C to 900 °C in 25 °C steps on the SAQD electronic structure was also examined with the PL technique combined with an applied magnetic field in the Faraday configuration. The PL lines were similar to the F-D spectral lines with their degeneracy lifted by the applied magnetic field. These lines exhibited ten (anti-) crossings: three each at 10 T and 28 T, four at 18 T, while the inter-level spacing and the FWHM were reduced with increasing annealing temperature. Thus an increase in the observed (anti-) crossings resulted for the higher anneal temperatures. The in-plane excitonic reduced-mass was inferred from the systematic splitting of the PL p-branches in a magnetic field. The reduced-mass for all the annealed QD samples was about 0. 066 m 0 +/- 0. 012 m 0 which decreased slightly with anneal temperature. An 8 -band k*p model predicted a similar reduced-mass at low alloying of gallium, but an incorrect trend was observed as the alloying increased with annealing temperature. Unrealistic reduced-masses at 50 percent gallium content were reached. This discrepancy is explained assuming the F-D model is a single (independent) bulk particle picture neglecting many-body effects, and also the k*p model assumes identical disks before and after annealing. The SAQDs were in fact inhomogeneous shallow domes whose height is reduced with annealing temperatures. It is an attempt to reduce the effect of many-body interactions such as <b>exchange,</b> <b>configuration</b> and screened coulomb interactions dominant in the PL technique, the PLE technique was use. In this technique, a single level in a collection or 'ensemble' of dots is excited with tuned laser-light and only the Coulomb interactions are assumed to be important. The PLE peaks were found to be blue-shifted relative to PL peaks. Furthermore, under the influence of a magnetic field, two PLE peaks were observed that corresponded to the p and d energy states. However, three 'd' lines were expected and is hypothesized that one of the d lines remained degenerate. Moreover, the carrier dynamics observed in PLE spectra are much more difficult to interpret than that of the PL spectra. Applying the same method, the analysis of the p-branch peaks suggested an in-plane reduced-mass of ∼ 0. 084 m 0 +/- 0. 002 m 0, higher than obtained from PL measurement. Since the effective mass is normally associated with the mobility of the carriers, this would imply that the excitons in the PLE measurement are less mobile than in PL. This is despite the reduced many-body effects, suggesting that some extra interactions in the PL excitation may actually enhance the carrier mobility. Given the current interest in devices such as QD infrared photo-detectors and the necessary controls on the number of charge carriers in these devices, a single-layer and 25 -layer SAQD samples with doping in the top cap layer were compared to un-doped sample using PLE at various detection energies. No absorption signatures appeared for the doped single layer, whereas they were recovered in the 25 -layer doped sample. Evidently either dopants or injected carriers diffused into the QD layers beneath the cap. This diffusion and its influence is expected to be decreasing with depth. Finally, the number of injected charge-carriers in doped GaAs barriers interleaving 50 SAQD layers was studied {{in order to understand the}} influence on their electronic structure. From the relation between the dot density and the dopant dose, two to twenty-two charge carriers were estimated to be present in the barriers of each QD. The PLE results indicated that as this number was increased, direct radiative recombination from the higher levels decreased. In addition to Auger scattering and multi-phonon scattering, the enhanced scattering by the dopants impurities appears to add further decay channels toward the lower-energy recombination. This suggests that the PLE technique is sensitive for characterizing the doping effects in SAQD materials. Some fundamental questions regarding the optical and electronic properties of InAs/GaAs SAQD have been answered in this dissertation and the results can be used to support the future development of opto-electronic devices at the nano-scale level...|$|E

On this account we refine the heat-engine axiomatics. We consider the energy <b>exchange</b> in the <b>configuration</b> comprised of two heat reservoirs and one mechanical device and show explicitly the domains banned {{by the laws of}} thermodynamics.
