5|$|In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge {{station in}} 1886) was {{equipped}} with new signals, which required a gantry spanning all the lines into the station. In return for the LSWR cladding the LNC's entrance on Westminster Bridge Road with white <b>glazed</b> <b>brick,</b> the LNC gave consent for the stanchion supporting the gantry {{to rest on the}} LNC's platform, while reserving the right to demand the gantry be removed. At this time the LSWR also leased a small plot of land west of the Westminster Bridge Road entrance to serve as the site of new offices for the LNC, designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|Spring Street, {{a typical}} {{commercial}} 19th century corridor, {{is the primary}} roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel {{at the corner of}} Riverside Drive, a three-story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (a three-story highly decorated <b>glazed</b> <b>brick</b> building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s commercial building of pressed brick and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange <b>glazed</b> <b>brick</b> structure with terra cotta trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located {{on the east side of}} the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white <b>glazed</b> <b>brick,</b> flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E

25|$|Known also as the Ceramic Brick House. Originally {{built in}} 1887 as a Second Empire-style mansion {{complete}} with mansard roof, in 1950 {{the windows and}} roof were converted to a more standard gable with dormers. It was also refaced in polychrome <b>glazed</b> <b>brick</b> imported from Leeds. This drastic exterior redesign did not cost the house its historic status as its original framing and interior layout remain intact.|$|E
25|$|The late-Victorian era of {{red brick}} and {{terracotta}} {{gave way to}} coloured glazed terracotta - faïence: examples being the Trocadero in Temple Street, completed around 1902, and the Piccadilly Arcade, completed in 1909 as a cinema, on New Street. <b>Glazed</b> <b>brick</b> was also used with examples including Moor Street Station (1909–1914). Terracotta still remained in use, for example, in the Methodist Central Hall (1903-4) on Corporation Street. Classical architecture made a return as a preferred choice of architecture during the 1920s and 1930s as well as Art Deco, which was pioneered during the latter decade.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruins of}} Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon are spread over two {{thousand}} acres, forming the largest archaeological {{site in the}} Middle East. He enlarged the royal palace (including in it a public museum, possibly the world's first), built and repaired temples, built a bridge over the Euphrates, and constructed a grand processional boulevard (the Processional Way) and gateway (the Ishtar Gate) lavishly decorated with <b>glazed</b> <b>brick.</b> Each Spring equinox (the start of the New Year) the god Marduk would leave his city temple for a temple outside the walls, returning through the Ishtar Gate and down the Processional Way, paved with coloured stone and lined with molded lions, amidst rejoicing crowds.|$|E

500|$|With its <b>glazed</b> <b>brick,</b> [...] "zigzag" [...] motif, strong {{vertical}} elements, and {{the decorative}} structure, particularly the metal [...] "tulip", {{the building is}} considered to be an excellent example of the Art Deco style. Art Deco was most commonly seen in large commercial and public buildings, so its use in a gas station and roadside restaurant was a rare sight. The U-Drop {{is one of the few}} Art Deco cafés built in the 1930s, and it stands out architecturally from its peers, as most depression-era cafés had simpler and similar wood-frame and clapboard designs or followed the Streamline Moderne offshoot of Art Deco.|$|E
500|$|The Sanderson Factory in Barley Mow Passage, {{now known}} as Voysey House, was {{designed}} by the architect Charles Voysey in 1902. It is built in white <b>glazed</b> <b>brick,</b> with Staffordshire blue bricks (now painted black) forming horizontal bands, the plinth, and surrounds for door and window openings, and dressings in Portland stone. It was originally a wallpaper printing works, now used as office space. It is a Grade II* listed building. It faces the main factory building and was once joined to it by a bridge across the road. It was Voysey's only industrial building, and is considered an [...] "important Arts and Crafts factory building".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} designed by John Nunn and architect J.C. Berry. The 1-story concrete and brick building has a modified rectangular layout with a flat roof. [...] It features a flared tower over the gas station, and two canopies, one facing Route 66 and one facing Highway 83 over {{the front of the}} gas station office. In the rear, a second, shorter tower contained the restaurant. The main buildings were built of structural clay tile with terra-cotta <b>glazed</b> <b>brick.</b> The two towers are clad in stucco with decorative green and gold glazed terra-cotta tiles and cast concrete stepped forms. Designed {{to attract the attention of}} the passing motorists, the towers also feature geometric detailing, curvilinear massing, and are outlined with neon lighting added additional character and uniqueness to the building's design.|$|E

[...] Set {{back from the}} main road in a large graveyard, behind a low hedgerow and with some formally placed yew trees, it has [...] "an atmosphere of grandeur". [...] The building is Classical in style with some Georgian elements. [...] The front is rendered and has a gabled roof with an open pediment in which a recessed circular plaque is inset. [...] This gives the dates of construction (1837) and enlargement (1874). [...] Also on the façade are pilasters and an entrance porch. [...] All of this work dates from the 1874 enlargement. [...] The side walls are of <b>glazed</b> <b>brick</b> laid in the Flemish bond pattern. [...] The building incorporates a schoolroom.|$|E
2500|$|A 1918 {{publication}} stated: [...] "New York {{is noted}} for its beautiful buildings, and the Martinique is no exception". The hotel is 19 stories high, and [...] "capitalized on the openness of Greeley Square" [...] (now Herald Square). It was built from <b>glazed</b> <b>brick,</b> [...] terracotta and limestone, and featured bespoke [...] "rusticated stonework balconies and prominent cartouches on all three of its facades". It is crowned by a large mansard roof and has decorated dormers. The south facade serves as the building's front. A 1910 brochure states, [...] "The Gentlemen’s Broadway Cafe is a veritable architectural gem. The walls and columns of Italian marble give to this room a richness which is completed by Pompeiian panels of unquestioned merit." [...] The Louis XVI dining room was described in the same brochure: “The wainscotting and pillars are of Circassian walnut, enclosing panels of gold silk tapestry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Customs House is a brick {{building}} in the Hannover-school Neo-Gothic style that displays many elements typical of the architectural style, including extensive use of steep gables, recessed wall surfaces, and Gothic pointed arches and window designs. [...] The building is built with red brick alternating in parts with black <b>glazed</b> <b>brick</b> for contrast. [...] The Customs House's main facade facing Storgata has two tall gables on either side and a lower gable in the center. [...] The corner facing Porsgrunn City Hall is cut at a 45 degree angle to the other walls and is topped with a weather vane marked with 1891, {{the year of the}} building's completion. [...] The corner also once featured a small balcony that has since been removed. [...] One feature of the building that was very modern for the time was the use of cast iron on the building's exterior, specifically the columns that separate the double windows on the first floor. [...] The columns are marked with [...] "Porsgrunds mek. Værksted," [...] which was a local foundry once located at the end of Porselensvegen, down the street from Porsgrunds Porselænsfabrik.|$|E
50|$|Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song dynasty ordered its replacement. It was {{designed}} to resemble the original wooden pagoda but built of <b>glazed</b> <b>bricks</b> so the tower would be fire-resistant and enduring. The 55 metre high Iron Pagoda, built in 1049, is a solid core, octagonal brick tower with an inner spiral stone staircase and outside openings to allow light and air flow. The architectural style features densely positioned dougong in the eaves (miyan) and multiple storeys (louge). The <b>glazed</b> <b>bricks,</b> brown in color, gave the new tower its name, the Iron Pagoda.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the technological features of the Neo-Elamite <b>glazed</b> <b>bricks</b> discovered at the Acropolis of Susa, south-western Iran, by conducting micro-Raman spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS). The results showed that calcium antimonate white and lead antimonate yellow were used as opacifiers in the white, yellow and green glazes, and that green and turquoise glazes were achieved using copper. Coloured glazes were separated by a Si-rich brown glaze {{to prevent them from}} running together during firing. The <b>glazed</b> <b>bricks</b> most probably were not fired at temperatures higher than 900 °C...|$|R

60|$|At noon {{they drove}} into her first farmyard, a private village, {{a white house}} with no porches save a low and quite dirty stoop at the back, a crimson barn with white trimmings, a <b>glazed</b> <b>brick</b> silo, an ex-carriage-shed, now the garage of a Ford, an {{unpainted}} cow-stable, a chicken-house, a pig-pen, a corn-crib, a granary, the galvanized-iron skeleton tower of a wind-mill. The dooryard was of packed yellow clay, treeless, barren of grass, littered with rusty plowshares and wheels of discarded cultivators. Hardened trampled mud, like lava, filled the pig-pen. The doors of the house were grime-rubbed, the corners and eaves were rusted with rain, and the child who stared at them from the kitchen window was smeary-faced. But beyond the barn was a clump of scarlet geraniums; the prairie breeze was sunshine in motion; the flashing metal blades of the windmill revolved with a lively hum; a horse neighed, a rooster crowed, martins flew {{in and out of}} the cow-stable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{walls of}} the main workrooms were clad in <b>glazed</b> <b>bricks,</b> rather than the usual plaster.

[...] This may have been a retrospective justification: the Controller of the Bank was initially against the innovation as being cold and prone to condensation, and preferred plastering. However, the plasterers were at that time on strike, and completion of the building would have been delayed by six months if the <b>glazed</b> <b>bricks</b> were not used instead.
