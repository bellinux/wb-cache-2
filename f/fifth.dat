50|$|The {{ascending}} <b>fifths</b> sequence, {{contrary to}} the descending <b>fifths</b> sequence, consists of a pattern of ascending <b>fifths</b> (or descending fourths). It is much less common than the descending <b>fifths</b> sequence.|$|R
50|$|Concatenating {{the perfect}} <b>fifths</b> ((F,C), (C,G), (G,D), (D,A), (A,E), (E,B),...) yields the {{sequence}} of <b>fifths</b> (F,C,G,D,A,E,B,...); this sequence of <b>fifths</b> displays all the notes of the octave.

5000|$|The {{family of}} meantone temperaments share the common {{characteristic}} that {{they form a}} stack of identical <b>fifths,</b> the tone being the result of two <b>fifths</b> minus one octave, the major third of four <b>fifths</b> minus two octaves. Meantone temperaments are often described by the fraction of the syntonic comma by which the <b>fifths</b> are tempered: quarter-comma meantone, the most common type, tempers the <b>fifths</b> by [...] of a syntonic comma, {{with the result that}} four <b>fifths</b> produce a just major third, a syntonic comma lower than a Pythagorean major third; third-comma meantone tempers by [...] of a syntonic comma, three <b>fifths</b> producing a just major sixth, a syntonic comma lower than a Pythagorean one.|$|R

50|$|Whereas schismatic temperaments {{achieve a}} ratio {{with a number}} of perfect <b>fifths,</b> each {{tempered}} by a fraction of the schisma; meantone temperaments achieve a ratio with perfect <b>fifths,</b> each tempered by a fraction of the syntonic comma (81:80, 21.51 cents). As meantone temperaments are often described by what fraction of the syntonic comma is used to alter the perfect <b>fifths,</b> schismatic temperaments are often described by what fraction of the schisma is used to alter the perfect <b>fifths</b> (thus quarter-comma meantone temperament, eighth-schisma temperament, etc.).|$|R
40|$|In 1966, Red Mitchell began tuning his bass in <b>fifths</b> to {{meet the}} demands of film composers who {{required}} a low C. Having played in fourths for approximately twenty years, Mitchell required only nine days to adapt to <b>fifths</b> tuning. This thesis examines the changes that <b>fifths</b> tuning had on his walking bass lines through the transcription, analysis and comparison of three blues from each of Mitchell's tuning periods. The analysis will probe changes in pitch, range, intervals and motives. Other chapters include a biography of Mitchell's career and one that discusses why he chose <b>fifths.</b> Included in this section are brief summaries of other bassists who have adopted <b>fifths</b> tuning. The chapter on bass line grammar discusses those elements that were affected when Mitchell changed tunings. The concluding chapter discusses the findings showing that tuning in <b>fifths</b> did have an effect on Red Mitchell's walking bass lines...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} acceptable case {{of hidden}} <b>fifths</b> {{in the common}} practice period are horn <b>fifths.</b> Horn <b>fifths</b> arise from the limitation of valveless brass instruments to the notes of the harmonic series (hence their name). In all but their extreme high registers, these brass instruments are limited to the notes of the major triad. The typical two-instrument configuration would have the high instrument playing a scalar melody against a lower instrument confined to the notes of the tonic chord. Horn <b>fifths</b> occur when the upper voice is on the first three scale degrees.|$|R

5|$|<b>Fifth</b> Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at <b>Fifth</b> Avenue and increase heading away from <b>Fifth</b> Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, <b>Fifth</b> Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E

5000|$|Quartal and quintal harmony {{have been}} used by Robert Fripp, who has {{described}} himself as the rhythm guitarist of King Crimson. Fripp dislikes minor thirds and especially major thirds in equal temperament tuning, which is used by non-experimental guitars. Of course, just intonation's perfect octaves, perfect <b>fifths,</b> and perfect fourths are well approximated in equal temperament tuning, and perfect <b>fifths</b> and octaves are highly consonant intervals. Fripp builds chords using perfect <b>fifths,</b> fourths, and octaves in his new standard tuning (NST), a regular tuning having perfect <b>fifths</b> between its successive open-strings ( [...] , [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The two scales, both {{referred}} to as temperament ordinaire by Huygens and by Rousseau/Encyclopedie, have in common the degree of tempering applied to the <b>fifths</b> CGDAE.
