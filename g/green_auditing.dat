40|$|Purpose - To {{examine whether}} there are {{differences}} with respect to internal auditors' attitude toward environmental protection, cognizance of environmental auditing and environmental knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey based research method is used and a Mann-Whitney U-test as well as a T-test is applied on this data. Findings - There is no difference between internal auditors in the manufacturing industry and those in the service industry with respect to environmental awareness and cognizance of environmental auditing. Yet there is a significant difference with respect to knowledge of environmental protection. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to that of internal auditors' perspectives. Practical implications - Internal auditors are the "watch dogs" for firms to implement environmental management so that strengthening their enviromnental knowledge is required. Originality/value - This study reveals internal auditors' perception toward environmental management in both high- and low-pollution industries that go beyond <b>green</b> <b>auditing</b> issues...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the Leadership Conference on Biomedical Research and the Environment, the Facilities Committee focused its work on the {{development}} of best environmental practices at biomedical research facilities at the university and independent research facility level as well as consideration of potential involvement of for-profit companies and government agencies. The designation "facilities" includes all related buildings and grounds, "green auditing" of buildings and programs, purchasing of furnishings and sources, energy efficiency, and engineering services (lighting, heating, air conditioning), among other activities. The committee made a number of recommendations, including development of a national council for environmental stewardship in biomedical research, development of a system of <b>green</b> <b>auditing</b> of such research facilities, and creation of programs for sustainable building and use. In addition, the committee recommended extension of education and training programs for environmental stewardship, in cooperation with facilities managers, for all research administrators and researchers.

40|$|Environmental {{valuation}} is {{the process}} of expressing a value for a particular good or service in a context of decision making usually in terms of money or numbers. It's also considered to be a measure or indices of social, biological, ecological and demographic status of the system. Marine and coastal ecosystems provide a wide range of services include the provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services and supporting services. Food provisioning in the form of fisheries catch, aquaculture, ornamentals and bio prospecting is the most vital services from this system. The Total Economic Value of (TEV) consists of use values and non-use values. The use value includes direct use value, indirect use value, and option value, whereas the non-use value is the existence and bequest value. Three approaches are used in the valuation techniques: Slated preference (contingent valuation and choice modelling); Revealed preference (market price, cost-based, production, travel cost); Benefit transfer. The overexploitation of resources, degradation of the ecosystem will directly affect the food security and employment of the coastal population and have an indirect effect on the regional and national economy. To address these issues, environmental valuation is considered {{to be one of the}} effective tools for the Scientists and Managers. The green accounting refers to efforts to modify the national income accounts from which GDP and GNP are calculated, to incorporate use and depletion of natural resources. Stocktaking and dimension are the backbone of green and social accounting. The Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14000) are the two frameworks developed for social and green accounting. The green accounting has applications in large scale and small scale business organizations. Development and implementation of green accounting will be a challenging issue for the companies coming in the years ahead. It is an interdisciplinary framework includes several magnitudes and divisions of environmental accounting. It needs a sound environmental policy, environmental accounts and their recording and training of the future practitioners to provide technical and legal basis of <b>green</b> <b>auditing.</b> The Kyoto protocol of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is a legal binding agreement with the developing countries and developed nations designed to reduce six greenhouse gases that are believed to contribute to global warming.

40|$|Two {{previous}} papers by <b>Green</b> <b>Audit</b> {{reported the}} results of environmental measurements on Uranium isotopes in samples taken from areas of Lebanon where Israeli bombing attacks had occurred (Busby and Williams 2006, 2006 a). Beta counting and CR 39 track analysis were used to screen samples for excess alpha and beta radioactivity. Samples which were shown to be more radioactive than the background were sent for laboratory analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICPMS) and by gamma and alpha spectrometry. In general, there was evidence {{of the use of}} enriched Uranium with isotopic ratios of between 108 and 123 in soil samples, water samples from Khiam in South Lebanon, and material in an ambulance air filter from South Beirut. A crater in Khiam (crater A) had been reported to be radioactive by Dr Khobeissi of the Lebanese National Council for Scientific Research in September 2006. It was this report that prompted <b>Green</b> <b>Audit</b> to ask Dai Williams to visit Lebanon and obtain a sample of soil for analysis.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} neighbourhood green space, the neighbourhood social environment (social cohesion, neighbourhood attachment, social contacts), and mental health in four European cities. Methods: The PHENOTYPE study {{was carried out in}} 2013 in Barcelona (Spain), Stoke-on-Trent (United Kingdom), Doetinchem (The Netherlands), and Kaunas (Lithuania). 3771 adults living in 124 neighbourhoods answered questions on mental health, neighbourhood social environment, and amount and quality of <b>green</b> space. Additionally, <b>audit</b> data on neighbourhood green space were collected. Multilevel regression analyses examined the relation between neighbourhood green space and individual mental health and the influence of neighbourhood social environment. Results: Mental health was only related to <b>green</b> (<b>audit)</b> in Barcelona. The amount and quality of neighbourhood <b>green</b> space (<b>audit</b> and perceived) were related to social cohesion in Doetinchem and Stoke-on-Trent and to neighbourhood attachment in Doetinchem.
