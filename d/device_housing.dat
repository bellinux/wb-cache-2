With case studies of an integrated IEEE 802. 11 b laptop radio, we demonstrate how unconventional, ultra-compact antenna diversity maintains data throughput in wireless devices that are notoriously ill-suited for space diversity.

The instrument is battery powered with total dimension of 14 x 25 x 8 cm 3 (w x l x h), and weighs 1. 2 kg. The device consists of a front electrophoresis compartment which has the chip holder and the chip, the associated high-voltage electrodes for electrophoresis injection and separation and the detector. The detection cell is integrated into the <b>device</b> <b>housing</b> with an exchangeable plug-and-play cartridge format. The design of the dC 4 D cell has been optimized for maximum performance. The cartridge includes the topbottom excitation and pick up electrodes incorporated into the cell and connected to push-pull self-latching pins that are insulated with plastic. The metal frame of the cartridge is grounded completely to eliminate electronic interferences. The cartridge is designed to clamp a thin fluidic chip at the detection point.

40|$|In {{order to}} reach the highest {{possible}} efficiencies in a coal-fired turbine-based power system, the turbine should be directly fired with the products of coal utilization. Two main designs employ these turbines: those based on pressurized fluidized-bed combustors (PFBCs) and those based on integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCCs). In both designs, the suspended particulates, or dust, must be cleaned from the gas before it enters the turbine to prevent fouling and erosion of the blades. To produce the cleanest gas, barrier filters are being developed and are in commercial use. Barrier filters are composed of porous, high-temperature materials that allow the hot gas to pass but collect the dust on the surface. The three main configurations are candle, cross-flow, and tube. Both candle and tube filters have been tested extensively. They are primarily composed of coarsely porous ceramic {{that serves as a}} structural support, overlain with a thin, microporous ceramic layer o n the dirty gas side that serves as the primary filter surface. They are highly efficient at removing particulate matter from the gas stream and, because of their ceramic construction, are resistant to gas and ash corrosion. However, ceramics are brittle, and individual elements can fail, allowing the particulates to pass through the hole left by the filter element and erode the turbine. Because of the possibility of occasional filter breakage, safeguard devices (SGDs) must be employed to prevent the dust streaming through broken filters from reaching the turbine. The Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) safeguard device is composed of three main parts: the ceramic substrate, the adhesive coating, and the safeguard <b>device</b> <b>housing.</b> This report describes the development and laboratory testing of each of those parts as well as the bench-scale performance of both types of complete SGDs...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{development}} of Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) and electrochemical immunoarrays for sensitive and accurate detection of biomarker proteins using offline capture of analytes onto the antibody coated magnetic beads. First, it elucidates kinetic characterization of super-paramagnetic particles decorated with over 100, 000 antibodies binding to protein antigens attached to flat surfaces. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to show that these antibody-derivatized MPs (MP-Ab 2) provide essentially irreversible binding and 100 -fold increased association rates compared to free antibodies. These findings were consistent with highly efficient capture of protein antigens in solution by the MP-Ab 2, and explain in part the utility of these beads for ultrasensitive protein detection into the fM and aM range. SPR imaging microarrays were developed for detection of epitope specific immunoglobuling E (IgE) antibodies relevant to the diagnosis of severe nut allergies. Microarrays feature 16 - 25 gold sensor spots equipped with peptide and carbohydrate epitopes from major peanut allergen glycoprotein Arachis hypogaea 2 (Ara-h 2). A monoclonal anti-IgE antibody was included as positive control. IgEs were pre-captured onto magnetic beads loaded with polyclonal anti- IgE antibodies to enhance sensitivity and minimize non-specific binding for serum proteins. As low as 0. 1 attomole of IgE antibodies were detected from serum samples in 45 min assay time. Enzyme linked electrochemical immunoassays were developed on 8 screen-printed carbon electrode arrays for detection of prostate cancer biomarker proteins. These proteins are Insulin growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), vascular endothelium growth factor-D (VEGF-D), and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Serum levels of all these proteins are elevated during different stages of prostate cancer malignancy. Massively enzyme labeled magnetic beads carrying secondary antibodies were used to capture analyte proteins from serum samples. The beads were then magnetically separated, washed and transferred to an electrochemical <b>device</b> <b>housing</b> an 8 nano- structured electrode array modified with capture antibodies. Amperometric signal generated after injection of reagent solution containing 0. 1 mM hydrogen peroxide and 1 mM hydroquinone mediator was directly proportional {{to the amount of}} captured antigen.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P ME 2015 Xixxii, 152 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} twofold. One is to identify the noise sources of hairdryer system and investigate the corresponding noise generation mechanisms, and the other one is to use the panel with low mass to strength ratio and with micro-perforation to reduce the sound radiation from the fan which is installed in the duct with low aspect ratio. The proposed device will be adopted into the hairdryer to improve the sound quality of the product. Hairdryer is a typical example of the domestic product of simple ducted-fan system with low aspect ratio. A series of acoustical measurements and sound source identification approaches are conducted to search for the dominant sound sources and their characteristics in the spectrum of the hairdryer provided by Kenford Industrial Co., Ltd. The noise is found mainly in the low-to-medium frequency range. In addition, the aerodynamics pattern and aeroacoutics features can be found by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study. It is found that the maximum vortex occurs at the tip clearance regime and there is unsteady inlet flow due to the irregular structure at the inlet. Different level of the roughness is introduced at the inlet surface of hairdryer and hence the broadband noise at the low frequency regime can be reduced. In order to understand the physics behind, the aerodynamic pattern is also investigated by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) tests which can show the flow field variation at the inlet of the hairdryer. It is found that the rough surface can provide a more uniform inlet flow. However, there is a trade-off enhancement of the noise at the first and second blade passage frequencies. A passive noise control strategy is proposed with a micro-perforated panel (MPP) housing device. It shares the feature of drum-like silencer with MPP covering on the two side-branch cavities but the working principles are different and the source is placed at the centre of the device. The mechanism to control noise by MPP housing is to undergo sound cancellation supplemented with sound absorption instead of sound reflection by drum silencer or plate silencer. To realize it into the real application, the proposed device is to be designed in compact configuration compared with the traditional silencer and muffler in the market. To investigate the performance of the proposed device, a two-dimensional theoretical model for MPP <b>device</b> <b>housing</b> a dipole source is established. The vibro-acoustic interaction is studied in detail to understand the coupling between the panel vibration induced by the dipole source and the sound fields of a duct and backed cavities. With the aid of finite element method (FEM), the analytical model is validated and the device attenuation performance is studied. To optimize the design, parameters such as structural properties of the panel, perforations property of MPP and configuration of the cavities are to be investigated. To conduct the experimental validation, a small speaker is used to simulate the axial fan with dipole nature. It is found that there is good agreement among experiment, analytical model and finite element method. For the real application in the hairdryer, the MPP housing device with a compact geometry can successfully reduce noise at the blade passage frequency. The sound quality of the product will be improved by the utilization of MPP housing device as the loudness has been reduced in the dominant noise frequency region. To further improve the performance of the proposed MPP housing device, a non-uniform section hollow tube with a Herschel-Quincke nature (MPPHQ) is introduced to tackle the drawback of passband in low frequency to acquire a wider stopband. The optimization of the shape, configuration and location of the hollow tube is processed. The optimal performance can be achieved with a compact housing geometry. The hybrid MPPHQ housing maintains the performance of proposed MPP housing device and at the same time, the passband regime which is originally contributed by MPP housing device is released. In addition, the sound attenuation performances of MPP housing device with partitioned cavity to control different nature of sound sources have also been examined, numerically and experimentally. It is found that when the partitioned cavity is properly designed, the performance of MPP housing device can be significantly improved without any enlargement of geometry size. It can be beneficial for the design of silencer in the future. Department of Mechanical EngineeringPh.
