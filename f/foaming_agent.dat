30|$|Nevertheless, in harsh {{reservoir}} {{conditions of}} high temperature and water salinity foam application, especially for deep diversion, is a challenge. In this work, we investigate {{the potential of}} foam-based conformance for high-temperature and high-salinity carbonates. We evaluate different <b>foaming</b> <b>agents.</b> Stability tests and dynamic bulk foam experiments provided the means to identify suitable <b>foaming</b> <b>agents.</b> The selection was based on several key parameters including foam height, foam half-life, liquid drainage and foam decay time. The selected <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> were then used to perform different core flooding experiments to evaluate foam mobility reduction capacity and demonstrate the potential increase in oil recovery.|$|R
2500|$|Crude MCHM is a {{chemical}} <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> utilized in {{the processing of}} coal at coal preparation plants to remove impurities that contribute to pollution during combustion. The chemical washes coal in {{a process known as}} [...] "froth flotation," [...] which involves the separation of sand-size particles of coal from the surrounding rock within a tank of water or other solution. MCHM is utilized in about 20 to 25 percent of coal preparation plants in West Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrazine is an {{inorganic}} compound with the chemical formula [...] (also written [...] ), archaically called diamidogen. A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odour. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly {{used as a}} <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen {{in an effort to}} reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, {{in a manner similar to}} hydrofluoric acid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{low cost}} of SDS, {{its lack of}} impact on taste, its {{potential}} impact on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs, which contribute to malodorous breath), and its desirable action as a <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> {{have led to the}} use of SDS in the formulations of toothpastes. A series of small crossover studies (25-34 patients) have supported the efficacy of SLS in the reduction of VSCs, and its related positive impact on breath malodor, although these studies have been generally noted to reflect technical challenges in the control of study design variables. While primary sources from the group of Irma Rantanen at University of Turku, Finland conclude an impact on dry mouth (xerostomia) from SLS-containing pastes, a 2011 Cochrane review of these studies, and of the more general area, concludes that there [...] "is no strong evidence… that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth." [...] A safety concern has been raised on the basis of several studies regarding the effect of toothpaste SDS on aphthous ulcers, commonly referred to as canker or white sores. A consensus regarding practice (or change in practice) has not appeared {{as a result of the}} studies.|$|E
40|$|Foam {{injection}} molded {{samples were}} produced from recycled polyethylene-terephthalate using endothermic and exothermic <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> at different mold temperatures. The foam structure was analyzed by computer tomography and optical microscopy. The morphological properties of samples {{were analyzed by}} differential scanning calorimetry, using the three-phase model. Viscosities of the melts were changed during processing by endothermic and exothermic <b>foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> {{and as a result}} different foam structures were formed. Relationships between mold temperature and porosity were found. Morphologies of the samples made with different <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> were different, also due to the different cooling rates caused by the endothermic and exothermic foaming reactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibilities}} for making metallic foams or similar porous metal structures are reviewed. The various processes are classified {{according to the}} state of the starting metal- liquid, powdered, ionised. Liquid metal can be foamed directly by injecting gas, gas-releasing <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> or by producing supersaturated metal-gas solutions. Indirect methods include investment casting and usage of filler materials. Metal powders can also be used as starting materials for metallic foams: mixtures of such powders with <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> are compacted to foamable precursor materials that can be foamed in a second step. Instead of <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> inert gas can be directly entrapped in the precursor. Metal foams can also be made from metal powder slurries or by using polymer/powder mixtures. Finally, galvanic electro-deposition also allows to make highly porous metallic structures with open pores...|$|R
50|$|Foamed {{concrete}} typically {{consists of}} a slurry of cement and fly ash or sand and water, although some suppliers recommend pure cement and water with the <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> for very lightweight mixes. This slurry is further mixed with a synthetic aerated foam in a concrete mixing plant. The foam is created using a <b>foaming</b> <b>agent,</b> mixed with water and air from a generator. The <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> used {{must be able to}} produce air bubbles {{with a high level of}} stability, resistant to the physical and chemical processes of mixing, placing and hardening.|$|E

40|$|Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) {{steelmaking}} uses {{carbon based}} materials as slag <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> and as carburisers. Traditionally, anthracite and metallurgical coke {{are among the}} materials used as slag <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> and flat iron and lump cokes are used as carburising agents. With the ever strengthening requirements on the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, {{there is a growing}} incentive to use alternative carbon sources, e. g. end of life rubber tyres and recycled plastics, to partially replace the conventional carbon materials. The use of rubber tyres in EAF steelmaking for foamy slag optimisation has been studied in detail in collaboration with UNSW in laboratory testing and OneSteel has developed and commercialised an engineering system through plant trials for EAFs to inject blends of rubber from end of life tyres and coke into EAF as slag <b>foaming</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Vacuum {{pyrolysis}} bagasse bio-oil {{collected in}} a series of sequential fractions was analyzed for total percentage of phenols and levoglucosan components. It was established that the ratio total phenols- to-levoglucosan could be used as an indicator of the performance of alkaline solutions of bio-oil fractions (SABO) when they are used as <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> to benefit flotation of sulfured cupper minerals. A high total phenol-to-levoglucosan ratio results in high percentages of Cu in cupper flotation concentrates, L Cu. A closer look at the role of individual phenols reveals that p-cresol is the main phenol, although not the only one, responsible for the observed behavior. Additionally it was noted that rather high doses of these <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> must be used to obtain desirable results in flotation processes. A production cost estimate allows consideration of SABO as an alternative to others commercial <b>foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> especially if an optimization study reduces doses of SABO...|$|R

40|$|Closed accessFoams {{cannot be}} {{generated}} {{without the use}} of special <b>foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> as pure liquids do not foam. The most common <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> are surfactants, however often for foam stability one active agent is not enough, it is necessary to add other component to increase foam lifetime. Foams on everyday use are mostly made from mixture of different components. Properly chosen combinations of two active ingredients lead to a faster foam formation and increased foam stability. During the last decade polymers (mainly polyelectrolytes and proteins) have become frequently used additives to foaming solutions. Mixtures of surfactants and polymers often demonstrate different foaming properties in comparison to surfactant only or polymer only solutions. The nature of surfactant–polymer interactions is complicated and prediction of resulting foaming properties of such formulations is not straightforward. Properties and foaming of surfactant–polymer mixtures are discussed as well as current applications of <b>foams</b> and <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> as <b>foams</b> are widely used in cosmetics, pharmaceutics, medicine and the food industry...|$|R

50|$|Juices (grape, cherry, raspberry, etc.), syrups, water, {{milk and}} fruit-drinks {{are often used}} as {{the base of the}} cocktail. Oily and {{sparkling}} liquids result in poor homogeneity of the foam. The base liquid might contain extracts of plants and herbs such as hawthorn, strawflower, motherwort and rose hip, which themselves are used in the clinical practices. An essential element of the oxygen cocktail is the <b>foaming</b> <b>agent,</b> such as gelatin egg white or liquorice. Initially, oxygen cocktails were made with egg white. However clinical trials proved that this ingredient resulted in allergenicity and unpleasant taste and could promote infectious diseases; thus it was replaced by liquorice, which is a <b>foaming</b> <b>agent,</b> tonic and sedative.|$|E
