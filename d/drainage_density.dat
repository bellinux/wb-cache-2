Their cross-sectional form tends to evolve from V-shaped in the headwaters to U-shaped in the lower reaches.

40|$|This work morphometrically {{characterized}} watersheds {{that occur}} in the municipality of Xapuri and constructed a model that explains the extent of watershed impact and resilience. Emphasis was given to provide a decision-making tool for non-specialists. The study area is located in the State of Acre and has four sub-basins: Alto Acre, Rio Xapuri, Xipamanu and Riozinho do Rola. A cartographic survey was conducted, to include the morphometric characteristics of the area and land use and cover features that resulted in the soil-hydrographic zoning of the municipality. Sub-basins Xapuri, Xipamanu and Riozinho do Rôla revealed <b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> and orders that indicate low drainage efficiency, while Alto Acre presented high drainage orders (ninth order) and densities, contrary the geometric indices and <b>drainage</b> <b>densities,</b> and is considered to have efficient drainage. Considerable alterations in permanent preservation areas occur in the municipality of Xapuri, with conversion to less resilient areas highly sensitive to impacts.

Logging is relatively easy and less expensive in this accessible terrain, and industrial timberland has almost completely replaced the historic forests.

2500|$|However, {{more recent}} imagery has also {{emphasized}} that the term [...] "valley network" [...] incorporates a large variety of different valley forms across {{a number of different}} scales in different martian geological settings. Any branched valley system on a scale smaller than an outflow channel can be termed a valley network, probably incorporating a large variety of geomorphological formation processes. Some valley networks run for over 2000nbsp&km across the martian landscape. Some may change width downstream. Some have <b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> which do match some terrestrial values.

50|$|In Viking images, the {{resemblance}} of Alba's valley networks to terrestrial pluvial (rainfall) valleys is quite striking. The valley networks show a fine-textured, parallel to dendritic pattern with well-integrated tributary valleys and <b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> {{comparable to those}} on Earth's Hawaiian volcanoes. However, stereoscopic images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the European Mars Express orbiter show that the valleys are relatively shallow (30 m or less) and more closely resemble rills or gullies from intermittent runoff erosion than valleys formed from sustained erosion. It {{seems likely that the}} valleys on Alba Mons formed as a result of transient erosional processes, possibly related to snow or ice deposits melting during volcanic activity, or to short-lived periods of global climate change. (See Surface characteristics, above.) Whether the eroded material is an ice-rich dust or friable volcanic ash is still uncertain.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the scope}} of Solimões-Amazon fluvial system between the Negro and Madeira tributaries, three levels of Quaternary fluvial {{terraces}} overlie the Alter do Chão and Novo Remanso formations further than 100 km southward its current main channel. Smooth undulated topography presenting low <b>drainages</b> <b>density</b> formed by sparse secondary plain channels and rounded lakes characterizes these deposits. Internally, they show point bars morphology constituted by intercalated layers of mud (silt and clay) and sand forming an inclined heterolithic stratification. The asymmetric distribution of fluvial terraces allied to the records of old scroll-bars features and paleochannels in many extensions of the Solimões River suggests the predominance of a meander pattern between 240 to 6 kyears. On the other hand, {{the development of the}} current anabranching pattern took place in the last six kyears due to the Holocene sea-level rise, besides the action of neotectonics and rainforest establishment related to the increase of humidity in Amazonia...|$|R
40|$|Channels {{and valleys}} were known on the Martian volcanoes since their {{discovery}} by the Mariner 9 mission. Their analysis has generally centered on interpretation of possible origins by fluvial, lava, or viscous flows. The possible fluvial dissection of Martian volcanoes has received scant attention {{in comparison to}} that afforded outflow, runoff, and fretted channels. Photointerpretative, mapping, and morphometric studies of three Martian volcanoes were initiated: Ceraunius Tholus, Hecate Tholus, and Alba Patera. Preliminary morphometric results indicate that, for these three volcanoes, valley junction angles increase with decreasing slope. <b>Drainage</b> <b>densities</b> are quite variable, apparently reflecting complex interactions in the landscape-forming factors described. Ages of the Martian volcanoes were recently reinterpreted. This refined dating provides a time sequence in which to evaluate the degradational forms. An anomaly has appeared from the initial study: fluvial valleys seem to be present on some Martian volcanoes, but not on others of the same age. Volcanic surfaces characterized only by high permeability lava flows may have persisted without fluvial dissection...|$|R
40|$|From {{these three}} craters, a first order gradational {{evolutionary}} sequence can be proposed. As crater rims are reduced by backwasting and downwasting through fluvial and mass wasting processes, craters are enlarged by approx. 10 pct. Enlargement of drainages inside the crater eventually forms rim breaches, thereby capturing headward portions of exterior drainages. At the same time, {{the relative importance}} of gradational processes may reverse on the ejecta: aeolian activity may supersede fluvial incisement and fan formation at late stages of modification. Despite actual high <b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> on the crater exterior during early stages of gradation, the subtle scale of these systems results in low density estimates from air photos and satellite images. Because signatures developed on surfaces around all three craters appear to be mostly gradient dependent, they may not be unique to simple crater morphologies. Similar signatures may develop on portions of complex craters as well; however, important differences may also occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{catchment}}, or catchment area, is {{the area}} associated with a segment of a drainage network. Surface runoff in a catchment flows into the associated network segment. Catchment area is commonly used for estimating watershed parameters, such as upstream drainage area, flood frequency, or surface-water flow. Hydrologic analyses require relatively accurate catchment area estimates to furnish substantive conclusions. Conversely, alternative uses for catchment area may not require such precise estimates. Estimation of catchment areas using Thiessen polygons around evenly spaced points along network features is a rapid and computationally simple approach {{when compared to the}} alternative of deriving catchments from an elevation model; however, Thiessen-estimated catchments do not precisely follow the ridgelines of surface models and only provide approximate subdivisions of the watershed. This paper assesses the accuracy of Thiessen-derived catchment area estimates for several drainage networks having various <b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> and landscape types. Thiessen-derived catchment area estimates are compared to those derived from surface-elevation models...|$|R

30|$|However, {{few studies}} have been {{conducted}} in demarcating potential groundwater resources within the basement complex region of Nigeria (Edet et al. 1997), the limitations of which include usage of only two variables (<b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> and lineament densities) and covered a very limited area. Therefore, the present study attempted to cover larger areas in the SW-Nigeria using more variables with the inclusion of the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique. This gives a broader view of the potential groundwater distribution in the study area. Furthermore, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty 1980, 1986, 1992), an international acceptable quantitative tool, adopted in this study appears to be a flexible decision making tool for multiple-criterion problems such as the assessment of the potential zones of groundwater resources in rapidly urbanized area of SW-Nigeria. It enables decomposition of a problem into hierarchy and assures that both qualitative and quantitative aspects of a problem are incorporated in evaluation process. AHP has been successfully applied in several studies of water resources management by integrating MCDA (Saaty 1980, 1986, 1992) with RS and GIS techniques (Srivastava and Bhattacharya 2006; Jha et al. 2010; Machiwal et al. 2011; Mukherjee et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|A {{network of}} sinuous valleys with typical {{dendritic}} pattern characterizes northern Victoria Land (NVL) in Antarctica. Subparallel to parallel and angular to rectangular patterns are also present. Quantitative geomorphic {{analysis of the}} valley network {{has been carried out}} utilizing GIS spatial analysis. While <b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> and <b>drainage</b> frequencies show low values, segments of the NVL valley network are substantially well organized, as indicated by bifurcation ratio (R.) and direct bifurcation ratio (R-bd) parameters. All basins faithfully adhere to Horton's laws of drainage network composition. Quantitative geomorphic analysis suggests that the valley system can be ascribed to fluvial origin and that consequently, a morphoclimatic system completely different from that of present day must have driven its carving. The resulting data provide indications about the origin of the valley network and this invaluable information can be used for the reconstruction of earlier phases of glacial history and climatic and tectonic evolution of this significant Antarctic region. Fluvial erosion enhanced the denudation of the Trans-antarctic Mountains from at least 55 Ma to at least the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (ca 34 Ma). Fluvial basins adapted to the tectonic structure, following the main regional fault systems. A well-developed alpine topography postdates the fluvial morphology. Temperate glaciers were responsible for denudation until the Late Miocene. Parasitic glaciers presently mantle the previously sculpted topography. Present-day glacial erosion is negligible and denudation has been exceedingly slow since 7. 5 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Channel {{networks}} on {{the plateau}} adjacent to Juventae Chasma {{have the highest}} <b>drainage</b> <b>densities</b> reported on Mars. We model frozen precipitation on the Juventae plateau,finding that the trigger for forming these channel networks could have been ephemeral lakeshore precipitation,and {{that they do not}} require past temperatures higher than today. If short-lived and localized events explain some dendritic channel networks on Mars, this would weaken the link between dendritic valley networks and surface climate conditions that could sustain life. Our analysis uses MRAMS simulations and HiRISE DTMs. We model localized weather systems driven by water vapor release from ephemeral lakes during outflow channel formation. At Juventae Chasma,mean snowfall reaches a maximum of 0. 9 mm/hr water equivalent on the SW rim of the chasm. Radiative effects of the thick cloud cover raise maximum (minimum, mean) plateau surface temperatures by up to 24 K(9 K, 17 K) locally. The key result is that the area of maximum modeled precipitation shows a striking correspondence to the mapped Juventae plateau channel networks. Three independent methods show this fit is unlikely to be due to chance. We use a snowpack energy balance model to show that if the snow has the albedo of dust(0. 28), and for a solar luminosity of 0. 8 (≡ 3. 0 Gya), then if the atmospheric greenhouse effect is unchanged from(6 K warmer than) today only 0. 4...|$|R
