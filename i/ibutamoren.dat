50|$|In a {{clinical}} trial of an investigational compound <b>ibutamoren,</b> which raises IGF-1 in patients, {{did not result in}} an improvement in patients' Alzheimer's symptoms. Another clinical demonstrated that Cephalon's IGF-1 does not slow the progression of weakness in ALS patients, but other studies have shown strong beneficial effects of IGF-1 replacement therapy in ALS patients, and therefore IGF-1 may have the potential to be an effective and safe medicine against ALS, however other studies had conflicting results.|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone secretagogues (GSHs) are a {{class of}} drugs which act as secretagogues (i.e., induce the secretion) of growth hormone (GH). They include {{agonists}} of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), such as ghrelin (lenomorelin), pralmorelin (GHRP-2), GHRP-6, examorelin (hexarelin), ipamorelin, and <b>ibutamoren</b> (MK-677), and agonists of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (somatorelin), CJC-1295, sermorelin, and tesamorelin. Many also induce the secretion of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), as well as of other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as prolactin and cortisol. The main clinical application of these agents is the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. They also see black market use, similarly to anabolic steroids, for bodybuilding purposes.|$|E
50|$|Certain long-acting {{growth hormone}} secretagogues, such as CJC-1295 and <b>ibutamoren</b> (MK-677), {{are capable of}} {{reliably}} and effectively increasing serum GH and IGF-1 concentrations in humans. Alternatively, exogenous, pharmaceutical GH and IGF-1 (as mecasermin or mecasermin rinfabate) themselves, or analogues of IGF-1 such as des(1-3)IGF-1 and IGF-1 LR3, may be employed to increase GH/IGF-1 axis function. A number of dietary supplements, including L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-lysine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and creatine, {{may be able to}} significantly increase GH levels, although evidence is mixed. Vitamin D has been found to increase IGF-1 levels in both healthy subjects and individuals with GHD, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with low IGF-1 levels. However, there is evidence that vitamin D may also potently inhibit breast growth via activation of the vitamin D receptor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ibutamoren</b> (INN) (developmental code names MK-677, MK-0677, L-163,191) is a non-peptidic, potent, long-acting, orally-active, and {{selective}} agonist of the ghrelin receptor and a growth hormone secretagogue, mimicking the growth hormone (GH)-stimulating {{action of the}} endogenous hormone ghrelin. It has been demonstrated to increase the release of, and produces sustained increases in plasma levels of several hormones including GH and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), but without affecting cortisol levels. MK677 has shown to sustain activation of GH-IGF-1 Axis and increase in lean body mass but no change in total fat mass or visceral fat. It is currently under development as a potential treatment for reduced levels of these hormones, such as in children or elderly adults with growth hormone deficiency, and human studies have shown it to increase both muscle mass and bone mineral density, making it a promising therapy for the treatment of frailty in the elderly.|$|E
50|$|On January 13, Romero was {{informed}} {{of a potential}} doping violation stemming from an out of competition test conducted by USADA. On February 8, Yomero and his manager explained that he took a supplement after his fight and that supplement {{turned out to be}} contaminated. His team and USADA both sent out the supplement for testing and it came back that it contained a banned substance. That substance was not listed on the label, his manager said. They did not want to reveal the name of the supplement or the substance, because USADA was investigating the issue. On March 23, it was announced that Romero would appeal his suspension. His team and USADA discussed a deal for a nine-month suspension for the fighter, but Romero preferred to go to arbitration. The typical USADA anti-doping violation suspension is two years. Eventually on April 4, both parts reached an agreement for a six-month suspension. USADA revealed that Romero tested positive for <b>ibutamoren,</b> a growth hormone release stimulator. The supplement was tested and the banned substance did indeed come up, even though it was not listed on the label. Romero announced that he'll pursue legal action against the supplement company within the next few weeks. The result of the fight was not disqualified or overturned.|$|E

An unopened version of the supplement was independently tested and the banned substance did indeed come up, even though it was not listed on the label. Romero announced that he'll pursue legal action against the supplement company within the next few weeks. The result of the Souza fight was not overturned as it was an out of competition test that occurred after the fight - Romero passed both his pre-fight and fight night tests for the Souza fight.|$|E
