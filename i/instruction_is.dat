5|$|Today, Madagascar has two {{official}} languages: Malagasy and French. Madagascar {{managed to}} maintain the indigenous language, Malagasy, in society and in schools despite the colonizing power. Malagasy and French are both the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools in Madagascar. The inclusion of the African {{language as a medium}} of <b>instruction</b> <b>is</b> usually uncommon in other colonized African countries.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{computer}} software {{has been written}} for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a central processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that <b>instruction</b> <b>is</b> finished, the next one is executed.|$|E

All courses are small seminars with no more than twelve students, and are based on original sources from a list of about 200 core texts broadly based on the Great Books canon. Classroom <b>instruction</b> <b>is</b> Socratic discussion. Considerable writing is required, including two comprehensive examinations and a senior thesis. Students are admitted primarily on the basis of essays and interviews; no minimum grades or test scores are required. Shimer {{has one of the highest}} alumni doctorate rates in the country.|$|E

R-type <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> pure {{register}} <b>instructions,</b> with three register references contained in the 32-bit word. I-type instructions specify two registers, and use 16 bits to hold an immediate value. Finally J-type <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> jumps, containing a 26-bit address.|$|R

50|$|Programming the DEUCE was {{different}} from other computers. The serial nature of the Delay Lines required that <b>instructions</b> <b>be</b> ordered such that when one instruction completed execution, the next one was ready to emerge from a Delay Line. For operations on the single registers, the earliest time that the next <b>instruction</b> could <b>be</b> obeyed was 64 microseconds after the present one. Thus, <b>instructions</b> <b>were</b> not executed from sequential locations. In general, instructions could transfer one or more words. Consequently, each instruction specified {{the location of the}} next instruction. Optimum programming meant that as each <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> executed, the next one was just emerging from a Delay Line. The position of instructions in the store could greatly affect performance if the location of an <b>instruction</b> <b>was</b> not optimum.|$|R

25|$|In a {{classroom}} {{there may be}} many different guided instruction groups. Each group may be working on a different skill or at a different level. Fisher's model recommends meeting with groups 1–3 times per week, with some groups meeting more frequently and other stronger groups meeting less often. The size of the groups will also vary {{depending on how much}} face time is required for the particular skill. It is a common misconception that guided <b>instruction</b> <b>is</b> only for struggling students. This is an opportunity for teachers to provide enrichment for strong students.

25|$|One form of <b>instruction</b> <b>is</b> where {{a medical}} professional, a preceptor, teaches the medical student {{how to perform}} the {{examination}} using a simulated patient as the model. However the preferred mode of <b>instruction</b> <b>is</b> to use a teaching associate. The teaching associate will guide the medical student or nurse practitioner trainee through the examination process using their own body as the teaching tool. They will advise the student on such things as how minimize embarrassment for the patient, how to position the patient, what {{to explain to the}} patient, where to probe, and how much pressure to apply when palpating.|$|E

40|$|The machine {{language}} SAMOS {{which consists of}} the simplest <b>Instructions</b> <b>is</b> suitable {{for the education of}} a {{machine language}}. We designed the SAMOS simulator which is implemented on a mini-computer TOSBAC- 40. The SAMOS simulator is a kind of an interpreter written by FORTRAN. Even for untrained programmers, the substantially larger program can be performed by SAMOS than by a conventional assembly language. 　The problems of the minimum set of <b>instructions</b> have <b>been</b> discussed on Turing machine. We tried to obtain the minimum set of instructions of SAMOS and got the following result: Four <b>instructions</b> <b>are</b> sufficient to produce most programs.
