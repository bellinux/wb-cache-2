25|$|In {{the case}} where {{parallel}} epochs defined in history were available, elaborate {{efforts were made to}} align European and Near Eastern sequences with the datable chronology of Ancient Egypt and other known civilizations. The resulting grand sequence was also spot checked by evidence of calculateable solar or other astronomical events. These methods are only available for the relatively short term of recorded history. Most prehistory does not <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> category.|$|E
25|$|In {{representative}} democracies, it may {{not benefit}} incumbents to conduct fair elections. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections stay in office 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections. Democracies in countries with high per capita income {{have been found to}} be less prone to violence, but in countries with low incomes the tendency is the reverse. Election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> category.|$|E

25|$|Aids: The rider {{applies the}} outside leg {{slightly}} further back from its normal position, which activates the outside hind (the first {{beat of the}} intended lead). At the same time, he or she uses the outside rein to flex the horse's head toward the outside, which frees up the animal's inside shoulder, encouraging it to <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> lead. If the rider were {{to ask for the}} left lead, for example, he or she would apply the right leg behind the girth and use the right rein to turn the horse's head to the right. To make the rider's intent even clearer, the horse may be angled slightly toward the outside rail of the arena, which will guide it into taking the correct lead as it goes towards the unobstructed inside, and also discourages the horse from simply running onto the forehand.|$|E
500|$|After {{the breakup}} between Madonna and Guy Ritchie was announced, during a {{performance}} of [...] "Miles Away" [...] in the Boston leg of the tour, she dedicated the song to the [...] "emotionally retarded". She then added, [...] "You may know {{a few people who}} <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> category—God knows I do," [...] the line being a probable reference to Ritchie himself although this has not been confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{agreed to}} Carter's request without asking {{the rest of}} the band, and when {{informed}} of the idea, the other members gave only tacit approval. They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, [...] "even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that's something". The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, [...] "U2's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U2 is also obliged to resolve that issue. Going to Sarajevo seems to me to <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> category. I think it would endanger the people we go with, endanger the tour, and endanger the band." [...] Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt.|$|E

2500|$|In R. (on the {{application}} of KM) v. Cambridgeshire County Council (2012), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom declined to reconsider the case of Barry because any statement on the case would be merely an obiter dictum. However, Lady Hale suggested that Barry may have been [...] "widely misunderstood". According to her, insofar as the majority in Barry had thought that resources should be a relevant consideration in assessing {{the needs of the}} disabled person, they may have fallen into error; nevertheless, a closer analysis of the decision in Barry suggests that [...] "they did not <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> error".|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{songs that}} I sing don't <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> category, so I don't {{think about it}} at all. But I believe that music does {{influence}} people. It's a universal thing. Everybody listens to music and knows about it. I think that the lyrics can {{have a lot to}} do with influencing whoever you're singing to. I think that as far as children are concerned, parents should have control over what they listen to. If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to hear, so if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner Bros. Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote {{the lyrics to}} Hybrid Theory based on some early material. Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as [...] "everyday emotions you talk about and think about." [...] Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early 2002, [...] "It's easy to <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> thing– 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down." ...|$|E

5000|$|The JazzTimes {{review by}} Mike Shanley states [...] "Jazz duets often get {{described}} as 'conversations' {{between the two}} players, and this session clearly <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> category.

2500|$|Although {{largely unknown}} in the West {{compared}} to the Vietnam War and various right-wing coups in Latin America, the massacres and Suharto's rise to power are considered by historians {{to be a major}} turning point in the Cold War. Given US foreign policy goals of stopping the spread of communism and bringing nations into its sphere of influence, the bloody purge which decimated the PKI, the third largest Communist party in the world at the time, was considered a huge victory. Historian John Roosa, after viewing declassified documents released in 2017, notes that much [...] "of the U.S. foreign policy establishment viewed it as a great victory {{that they were able to}} sort of ‘flip’ Indonesia very quickly." [...] He also asserts that the US did not simply [...] "stand by" [...] and allow the killings to happen, stating [...] "it's easy for American commentators to <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> approach, but the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI." ...|$|E

Even {{after the death}} of Ross in 1915, Somerville continued to write and publish stories under their joint names, claiming that the two were still in contact. The Big House of Inver, a novel of 1925, <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> category.|$|R

6000|$|Kea turned {{towards me}} with a very grave face. [...] "It isn't nonsense," [...] she answered, in her most serious manner. [...] "It's {{perfectly}} true. As true as anything.

He was importuned for tobacco, drink, and money, and he judged that his begging companions consisted of an American tramp, an Austrian, a negro, and a German. Fine society to <b>fall</b> <b>into!</b> <b>That</b> eighty thousand dollars became a tremendous burden.|$|E
