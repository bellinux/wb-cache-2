25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jennifer Aniston made a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "All Mixed Up". Speculations of her appearance initially surfaced a year {{prior to the}} confirmation, and upon hearing of it, Cougar Town co-creator Bill Lawrence initially supported such allegations. Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> inclination it was happening, I would be telling everybody 'cause I don't really give a sh-t. I would love it to happen and the second it did I would tell everybody in the world, but nothing's happened." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} of The Art of Angel Sanctuary 2: Lost Angel, A.E. Sparrow of IGN praised the artbook, {{describing}} it as [...] "more of an encyclopedia or compendium for the series". He complimented the artwork, stating,"I was absolutely blown away with each turn of the page, figuring it couldn't get any more brilliant, and was proven wrong every time. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> complaint, {{it would be that}} the artwork doesn't go on long enough."

2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{his seat}} in the House of Lords, Fitzwilliam {{attended}} almost every notable debate, signing nearly every protest which the opposition used but never made a speech during Lord North's premiership. He supported John Wilkes in his fight to keep the seat {{he was elected to}} and supported the American Colonies in their dispute with Britain. On 8 July 1776 he asked Lord Rockingham to arrange for a remonstrance to be sent to the King when war broke out in America, so the Americans would see [...] "that there is still in the country a body of men of the first rank and importance, who would still wish to govern them according to the old policy". George Selwyn MP recorded that on 6 March 1782 he had been confronted by Fitzwilliam at the Brooks's and had to listen to Fitzwilliam on the dire state of the nation: [...] "I do not know if he was in earnest, but I suppose that he was. He had worked himself up to commiserate the state of the country, nay, that of the king himself, [...] that I expected every instant that his heart would have burst". When Selwyn asked Fitzwilliam [...] "if there was a possibility of salvation in any position in which our affairs could be placed", Fitzwilliam [...] "asked me...with the utmost impetuosity, what objection I had to Lord Rock being sent for. You may be pretty sure, that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any,</b> I should not have made it".|$|E
