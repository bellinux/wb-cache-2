40|$|The subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors which mediate pressor {{responses}} to sympathomimetic agonists or to nerve stimulation in pithed rabbits have been classified {{according to the}} effects of 'selective' antagonists and a comparison has been made, for the alpha 2 -subtype, with corresponding responses in the rat. In the rabbit the dose-response curve for phenylephrine was shifted to the right in parallel by prazosin (1 mg kg- 1) and was unaffected by rauwolscine (1 mg kg- 1). The dose-response curve for noradrenaline was shifted to the right by prazosin (1 mg kg- 1) and was shifted to a smaller extent by rauwolscine (1 mg kg- 1) or <b>imiloxan</b> (10 mg kg- 1). After rauwolscine, prazosin produced a rightward shift larger than when given alone. After prazosin, rauwolscine produced a rightward shift larger than when given alone. The {{responses to}} pressor nerve stimulation at low frequencies (less than 1 Hz) could be reduced by prazosin, rauwolscine or <b>imiloxan</b> but those at a higher frequency could be reduced only by prazosin. These results indicate that the responses to noradrenaline or to nerve stimulation are mediated by both alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. Low doses or frequencies have a proportionately greater component which is alpha 2. Responses to noradrenaline after prazosin (1 mg kg- 1), were sufficiently sensitive to rauwolscine to be considered as predominantly alpha 2. A comparison was therefore made of such responses in the rat and rabbit. They were produced by a lower dose per unit body weight in the rat whereas this was less marked for the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist guanabenz. In the rabbit they were more susceptible to blockade by rauwolscine but were less sensitive to Wy 26703 than in the rat. This demonstrates that the alpha 2 -adrenoceptors mediating pressor responses in vivo, like those in other tissues in vitro, are different in rat and rabbit, with regard to antagonists...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDexmedetomidine is a {{selective}} α 2 adrenergic agonist. Although dexmedetomidine {{is widely used}} for sedation and analgesia, it frequently produces hypotension and bradycardia. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine on cardiac function and coronary circulation using Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) and left ventricular pressure (LVP) were continuously monitored, and electric field stimulation (EFS) was applied to stimulate sympathetic nerve terminals. Dexmedetomidine almost completely inhibited the EFS-induced increase in LVP at all ages. The effect of dexmedetomidine on coronary artery resistance varied according to postnatal age, i. e., dexmedetomidine {{had little effect on}} CPP in young hearts (8 weeks. The increase in CPP in adult hearts was inhibited by <b>imiloxan,</b> an α 2 B antagonist, and prazosin, an α 1 antagonist. The results suggest that dexmedetomidine acts on α 2 adrenergic receptors at sympathetic nerve terminals to suppress the release of norepinephrine. In addition, the findings suggest that dexmedetomidine directly affects α 1 adrenoceptors and/or α 2 B adrenoceptors on coronary smooth muscles to increase CPP. The age-related changes in α adrenoceptor subtypes may be linked to the cardiodepressant effects of dexmedetomidine...|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that both α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptors mediate vasoconstriction in the canine external carotid circulation. The present study set out to identify the specific subtypes (α 1 A, α 1 B and α 1 D as well as α 2 A, α 2 B and α 2 C) mediating the above response. Consecutive 1 [*]min intracarotid infusions of phenylephrine (α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist) and BHT 933 (α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist) produced dose-dependent decreases in external carotid blood flow, without affecting mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate. The responses to phenylephrine were selectively antagonized by the antagonists, 5 -methylurapidil (α 1 A) or BMY 7378 (α 1 D), but not by L- 765, 314 (α 1 B), BRL 44408 (α 2 A), <b>imiloxan</b> (α 2 B) or MK 912 (α 2 C). In contrast, only BRL 44408 or MK 912 affected the responses to BHT 933. The above results support our contention that mainly the α 1 A, α 1 D, α 2 A and α 2 C-adrenoceptor subtypes mediate vasoconstriction in the canine external carotid circulation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To measure maximum binding {{capacity}} (B(max)) {{and levels}} of mRNA expression for alpha(2) -adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes in ileal and colonic muscle layers of healthy dairy cows. SAMPLE POPULATION: Ileal and colonic muscle specimens from 6 freshly slaughtered cows. PROCEDURES: Ileal and colonic muscle layers were obtained by scraping the mucosa and submucosa from full-thickness tissue specimens. Level of mRNA expression for alpha(2) -AR subtypes was measured by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis and expressed relative to the mean mRNA expression of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, ubiquitin, and 18 S ribosomal RNA. Binding studies were performed with tritiated RX 821002 ((3) H-RX 821002) and subtype-selective ligands as competitors. RESULTS: mRNA expression for alpha(2 AD) -, alpha(2 B) -, and alpha(2 C) -AR subtypes was similar in ileal and colonic muscle layers. The mRNA expression for alpha(2 AD) -AR was significantly greater than that for alpha(2 B) - and alpha(2 C) -AR subtypes, representing 92 %, 6 %, and 2 %, respectively, of the total mRNA. Binding competition of (3) H-RX 821002 with BRL 44408, <b>imiloxan,</b> and MK- 912 was best fitted by a 1 -site model. The B(max) of alpha(2 AD) - and alpha(2 C) -AR sub-types was {{greater than that of}} alpha(2 B) -AR. The B(max) and level of mRNA expression were only correlated (r = 0. 8) for alpha(2 AD) -AR. Ratio of B(max) to mRNA expression for alpha(2 C) -AR was similar to that for alpha(2 B) -AR, but significantly greater than for alpha(2 AD) -AR. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Subtypes of alpha(2) -AR in bovine intestinal muscle layers are represented by a mixture of alpha(2 AD) - and alpha(2 C) -ARs and of alpha(2 B) -AR at a lower density. Information provided here may help in clarification of the role of AR subtypes in alpha(2) -adrenergic mechanisms regulating bovine intestinal motility...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} pre- and post-junctional responsiveness in vas deferens from wild-type and α 2 A/D-adrenoceptor knockout mice. The {{response to a}} single stimulus was not significantly different between wild-type and knock-out mice. The isometric contraction to 10 Hz stimulation for 4 s was significantly larger in vas deferens from knockout as compared with wild-type. The maximum potentiation of 10 Hz stimulation-evoked contractions by yohimbine was to 206. 2 ± 38. 0 % of control in wild-type but to 135. 8 ± 13. 6 % of control in knockout. The α 2 A/D-adrenoceptor selective antagonist BRL 44408 significantly increased the 10 Hz stimulation-evoked contraction in wild-type but not knockout, and the reverse was true for the α 2 C-adrenoceptor selective antagonist spiroxatrine. The α 2 B-adrenoceptor antagonist <b>imiloxan</b> {{had no effect on}} the evoked contraction except at high concentrations, and only in wild-type. Following cocaine (3 μM) and BRL 44408 (1 μM), 10 Hz responses were similar in shape and maximum between wild-type and knock-out. The α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist xylazine virtually abolished the early component of the contraction to 10 Hz stimulation in the presence of nifedipine (10 μM) in vas deferens from knockout mice in a way consistent with a change of receptor subtype but without clear evidence for a reduced receptor number. However, the late component of the contraction to 10 Hz stimulation was significantly potentiated by xylazine in tissues from knock-out mice. It is concluded that, although non-α 2 A/D-adrenoceptors replace α 2 D-adrenoceptors in this knockout, the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist data are contradictory. The antagonist data suggest a major loss of prejunctional α 2 -adrenoceptors, but this is not necessarily supported by the agonist data...|$|E
40|$|Because {{the use of}} monoamine reuptake inhibitors as weight-reducing agents {{is limited}} by adverse effects, novel antiobesity drugs are needed. We studied acute effects of the {{noradrenaline}} (NA) and serotonin (5 -HT) reuptake inhibitor sibutramine (SIB), alone and after pretreatment with α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor (AR), and 5 -HT 1 / 2 / 7, 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 2 C receptor antagonists {{in order to determine}} which ARs and 5 -HT receptors act downstream of SIB on feeding and locomotion. Acute effects on caloric and water intake, meal microstructure and locomotion were assessed, using an automated weighing system and telemetry in male rats with restricted 18 -h access to Western style diet. SIB 3 mg/kg reduced meal size and frequency, which suggests enhanced within- and postmeal satiety. <b>Imiloxan</b> (α 2 B-AR), WB 4101 (α 1 -AR), SB- 224289 (5 -HT 1 B), and modestly BRL 44408 (α 2 A/D-AR) attenuated SIB's effect on meal size, suggesting that α 2 B- and α 1 -ARs and 5 -HT 1 B receptors mediate within-meal satiety, with a modest role for α 2 A/D-ARs. Only prazosin (α 1 / 2 B/ 2 C-AR) counteracted SIB's effect on meal frequency. At 3 mg/kg, SIB modestly increased locomotion. This effect was blocked by metergoline (5 -HT 1 / 2 / 7), WB 4101 (α 1 -AR), and RX 821002 (α 2 -AR). Interestingly, the α 2 -AR antagonists atipamezole and RX 821002 enhanced SIB's effect on caloric intake, probably due to inverse agonistic actions at α 2 A-autoreceptors that further enhanced release of NA that regulates caloric intake. Thus, an inverse agonist of presynaptic α 2 A-ARs might beneficially enhance SIB's weight-reducing effect and offer novel treatment for obesity. All in all, the present data supports the ARs and 5 -HT receptors involved in the effects of SIB on different aspects of caloric intake and locomotio...|$|E
40|$|Background Although {{acupuncture}} analgesia is well documented, its mechanisms {{have not}} been thoroughly clarified. We previously showed that electroacupuncture (EA) activates supraspinal serotonin- and norepinephrine-containing neurones that project to the spinal cord. This study investigates the involvement of spinal alpha(2) -adrenoceptors (α 2 -ARs) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptors (5 -HTRs) in EA effects on an inflammatory pain rat model. MethodsInflammatory hyperalgesia was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, 0. 08 ml) into the plantar surface of one hind paw and assessed by paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus. The selective α 2 a-AR antagonist BRL- 44408, α 2 b-AR antagonist <b>imiloxan</b> hydrochloride, 5 -HT 2 B receptor (5 -HT 2 BR) antagonist SB 204741, 5 -HT 3 R antagonist LY 278584, or 5 -HT 1 AR antagonists NAN- 190 hydrobromide, or WAY- 100635 were intrathecally administered 20 min before EA or sham EA, which was given 2 h post-CFA at acupoint GB 30. ResultsEA significantly increased PWL compared with sham [7. 20 (0. 46) vs 5. 20 (0. 43) s]. Pretreatment with α 2 a-AR [5. 35 (0. 45) s] or 5 -HT 1 AR [5. 22 (0. 38) s] antagonists blocked EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia; α 2 b-AR, 5 -HT 2 BR, and 5 -HT 3 R antagonist pretreatment did not. Sham plus these antagonists did not significantly change PWL compared with sham plus vehicle, indicating that the antagonists {{had little effect on}} PWL. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that α 2 a-ARs are on primary afferents and 5 -HT 1 ARs are localized in N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) subunit NR 1 -containing neurones in the spinal dorsal horn. ConclusionsThe data show that α 2 a-ARs and 5 -HT 1 ARs are involved in the EA inhibition of inflammatory pain and that the NMDA receptors are involved in EA action. © The Author [2012].

40|$|There {{continues}} to be a need for more effective analgesics. The α 2 -adrenoceptor (AR) agonist clonidine is an analgesic whose use is severely limited by undesirable side effects. meta-Chlorophenylguanidine (MD- 354), an agent developed in our laboratory, selectively potentiates the antinociceptive effects of clonidine in a biphasic manner. Mechanistic studies suggest that both 5 -HT 3 receptor and α 2 -AR mechanisms are involved. To further evaluate mechanisms underlying the analgesia-potentiating effect of clonidine by MD- 354, pharmacological studies using more established 5 -HT 3 receptor agonists: meta-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG) and centrally-acting SR 57227 A, and non-selective α 2 -adrenoceptor ligand TDIQ, administered alone and in combination with clonidine, were conducted in mouse antinociceptive assays. None of the examined analogs produced an antinociceptive effect when administered alone. Nevertheless, mCPBG potentiated the antinociceptive actions of clonidine in a monophasic manner and the effect was antagonized by the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist tropisetron but not by tropisetron methiodide, suggesting that potentiation is, at least in part, due to a central 5 -HT 3 receptor mechanism. SR 57227 A did not alter the antinociceptive actions of clonidine. TDIQ was found to potentiate the analgesic actions of clonidine in a synergistic manner (as determined by an isobolographic analysis) and the effect was blocked by α 2 -AR antagonists (BRL- 44408, <b>imiloxan,</b> ARC- 239; α 2 A-, α 2 B-, and α 2 C-AR antagonists, respectively). This supports the hypothesis that MD- 354 could be potentiating the analgesic actions of clonidine via an α 2 -AR agonist mechanism. In order to explore the role of the ring nitrogen atoms and the chloro substituent of conformationally-constrained rotamers of MD- 354, analogs of 2 -amino- 7 -chloro- 3, 4 -dihydroquinazoline, with a varying number of nitrogen atoms in the ring were synthesized. Preliminary binding affinity results indicated that the ring nitrogen atoms are essential for 5 -HT 3 receptor binding. In attempt to explain the varied binding and functional activity of MD- 354 at α 2 -ARs, 3 D homology models of α 2 A-, α 2 B- and α 2 C-AR were generated and docking studies of the low-energy rotamers of MD- 354 were conducted. The present studies support a role for the involvement of 5 -HT 3 receptors and α 2 -ARs in antinociception. Analgesic adjuvants with a dual mechanism of action such as MD- 354 might represent a promising avenue to pain treatment...|$|E
