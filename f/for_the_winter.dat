5|$|Later {{that summer}} Laevinus seized the main town of Zacynthus, except for its citadel, and the Acarnanian town of Oeniadae {{and the island}} of Nasos which he {{handed over to the}} Aetolians. He then withdrew his fleet to Corcyra <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sulpicius sailed round {{into the}} Aegean and joined Attalus on Aegina <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter.</b> In 208 BC the {{combined}} fleet of thirty-five Pergamene and twenty-five Roman ships {{failed to take}} Lemnos, but occupied and plundered the countryside of the island of Peparethos (Skopelos), both Macedonian possessions.|$|E

5|$|The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 {{found that}} sports-related {{costs for the}} Summer Games since 1960 is on average USD 5.2 billion and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Winter</b> Games USD 3.1 billion. This does not include wider {{infrastructure}} costs like roads, urban rail, and airports, which often cost {{as much or more}} than the sports-related costs. The most expensive Summer Games are London 2012 at USD 15 billion and the most expensive Winter Games are Sochi 2014 at USD 21.9 billion. Costs per athlete is on average USD 0.6 million for the Summer Games and USD 1.3 million <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Winter</b> Games. For London 2012, cost per athlete was USD 1.4 million; for Sochi 2014, USD 7.9 million.|$|E

5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} to do this, taking {{the greater part}} of the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the troops who were to remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt city <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fennhoff's {{history as}} Doctor Faustus in the comics is {{referenced}} in the series, with him shown reading Christopher Marlowe's The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus. Having Faustus meet Zola {{was intended to}} set up Hydra's use of mind control <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Winter</b> Soldier program, as seen in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Hydra's system of brainwashing and mind control is also seen in the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., where it {{is referred to as}} the Faustus Method.|$|E

50|$|Menshikov tower had no {{reliable}} heating facilities and was closed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winters.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> congregation built a smaller neoclassical church of St. Theodore Stratelates (completed 1806), which also doubled as the bell tower.|$|R
25|$|Because it {{was clear}} that their bowling would be {{ineffective}} on rock-hard Australian pitches (and their bodies would not withstand the hard work under such conditions), Hallam and Wass were never considered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter's</b> Ashes tour.|$|R
5|$|In December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale {{appeared in the}} Firth of Tay off the shore of Dundee, at that time Scotland's major whaling port, and attracted much local interest. The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic, but as the whaling boats were in harbour <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> some of the whalers decided to hunt this animal in their own waters.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter.</b> This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E
5|$|In the post-election {{speculation}} as to {{who would}} be given office under McKinley, Hay's name figured prominently, as did that of Whitelaw Reid; both men sought high office in the State Department, either as secretary {{or one of the}} major ambassadorial posts. Reid, in addition to his vice-presidential run, had been Minister to France under Harrison. Reid, an asthmatic, handicapped himself by departing for Arizona Territory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> leading to speculation about his health.|$|E

5|$|Junayd {{remained}} in Samarkand {{for about four}} months, until October 731, allowing his army to recover. The Turgesh meanwhile made for Bukhara, which they besieged. Junayd again resolved to meet them in battle, and managed to inflict some defeats on the Turgesh in early November and raise the siege of Bukhara, which he entered {{on the day of}} Mihragan. Junayd then returned to Merv, leaving a token garrison of 800 men behind in Samarkand. Once the Turgesh had withdrawn north <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter,</b> he evacuated the city of its Muslim inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S. At this point, {{the ship was}} held fast in the pack ice, and the prospect loomed of becoming trapped <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter.</b> It was {{during this period of}} inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, trawls, and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the oceanography and marine life of the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|Paetus {{nonetheless}} appeared {{confident of}} victory, {{and followed the}} Parthian declaration of war and capture of Tigranocerta with his own invasion of Armenia, while Corbulo remained at Syria, further strengthening the fortifications in the Euphrates frontier. Paetus had only two legions with him, IV Scythica and XII Fulminata, and advanced towards Tigranocerta. A few minor forts were taken, but a lack of supplies forced him to withdraw westwards <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E

5|$|Plutarch {{makes no}} further mention of events until the initial {{confrontation}} between Marcus Licinius Crassus and Spartacus {{in the spring}} of 71 BC, omitting the march on Rome and the retreat to Thurii described by Appian. However, as Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus' followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could be inferred that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> of 72–71 BC.|$|E
5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to {{different areas of}} the country <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1995, the Heart of the City Project {{has seen}} public {{works in the}} city centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Gallery opened in April 2001, and a 1970s town hall {{extension}} was demolished in 2002 to make way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Winter</b> Garden, which opened on 22 May 2003.
