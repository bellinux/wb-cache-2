60|$|This {{hotel is}} an edifice with a gloomy front upon a narrow street, and <b>enterable</b> through an arch, which admits you into an {{enclosed}} court; around the court, on each story, run the galleries, {{with which the}} parlors and sleeping-apartments communicate. The whole house is dingy, probably old, and seems not very clean; but yet bears traces of former magnificence; for instance, in our bedroom, the door of which is ornamented with gilding, and the cornices with frescos, some of which appear to represent the cascade of Terni, the roof is crossed with carved beams, and is painted in the interstices; the floor has a carpet, but rough tiles underneath it, which show themselves at the margin. The windows admit the wind; the door shuts so loosely as to leave great cracks; and, during the rain to-day, there was a heavy shower through our ceiling, which made a flood upon the carpet. We see no chambermaids; nothing of the comfort and neatness of an English hotel, nor of the smart splendors of an American one; but still this dilapidated palace affords us a better shelter than I expected {{to find in the}} decayed country towns of Italy. In the album of the hotel I find the names of more English travellers than of any other nation except the Americans, who, I think, even exceed the former; and, the route being the favorite one for tourists between Rome and Florence, whatever merit the inns have is probably owing {{to the demands of the}} Anglo-Saxons. I doubt not, if we chose to pay for it, this hotel would supply us with any luxury we might ask for; and perhaps even a gorgeous saloon and state bedchamber.|$|E

Originally, Lori had planned for four different races: thief-like gnome, magic wielding elf, human as jack of all trades, and archer centaur, {{as well as the}} option for a female player character. Due to the limited resources available, the development team scaled back these plans, compromising with multiple classes for the human character.

50|$|The {{opening of}} the college contributed to an {{economic}} growth than continued in the village into the 19th century. Between 1800 and 1925, numerous careers were exploited, specifically in Beaumont. The hamlet experienced expansion, counting 100 homes in 1860. Stone was a major industry there, being exported to the States from 4 quarries. The quarries eventually stopped their exportation to the USA because of taxes. Charbon and other mineral mines were also found in Beaumont. Four oil wells, {{some of the first}} in North America, were dug in 1859 in Pré-des-Surette by H.C Tweedal, an entrepreneur from Pittsburgh. They were not <b>enterable</b> but permitted for the discovery of Albert Formation, where other non-enterable wells were dug. From 1876-1879, other wells were built in Saint-Joseph. The New Brunswick Petroleum Company received an agreement for 99 years for this entire area. From 1903-1905, they dug 77 wells. The most bountiful well would give about 50 barrels a day, and it is estimated that 3000 barrels were extracted from the fields of Pré-des-Surette. There was also a copper mine, an iron mine at College Bridge from 1892-1898 and a gypsum mine in Memramcook East. Boats were built in Pré-d'en-Bas and in Beaumont. The village even had its own beurrerie from 1892-1908. There were also other industries and businesses, today most being gone, such as finishing, a mill and a foundry.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, {{when the}} dam was only half-built, but almost $5 million {{had already been}} spent on the project, large open {{fissures}} were encountered during excavation of the key trench near the right end of the dam, about 700 ft from the canyon wall. The two largest, near-vertical fissures trend generally east-west and extend more than 100 ft below {{the bottom of the}} key trench. Some of the fissures are lined by calcite and rubble fills others. Several voids, as much as 6 in wide, were encountered 60 to 85 ft below the ground surface beyond the right end of the dam and grout curtain. The largest fissures were actually <b>enterable</b> caves. One of them was eleven feet (3.4 m) wide and a hundred feet (30 m) long. Another one was nine feet (2.7 m) wide in places and 190 ft long. These were not grouted because they were beyond the keyway trench and beyond the area where the Bureau had decided grouting was required. This necessitated using twice as much grouting as had been originally anticipated - 118,000 linear feet were used in total. Later, the report of a committee of the House of Representatives which investigated the dam's collapse felt that the discovery of the caves should have been sufficient for the Bureau of Reclamation to doubt its ability to fill them in with grout, but this did not happen: the Bureau continued to insist, even after the dam had failed, that the grouting was appropriate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reported}} {{the utilization of}} water spray for controlling H 2 S release in a confined space, which is especially important in industry. A typical spray tower was modified to simulate the confined space for people's <b>enterable</b> routine operation (e. g., pump room), in which the dilution capacity of water sprays can also be evaluated. This work consists of two parts: the first part focuses on the influences of different operating conditions on chemical dilution capacities of water sprays in mechanisms; the second one is comparison between two nozzle configurations for evaluating their feasibilities of practical application. Water sprays express eligible performance for H 2 S release control even though their dilution capacity was weakened at high gaseous concentrations and rates of releases. The presence of Na 2 CO 3 can significantly improve absorption effectiveness of H 2 S in water and the optimal Na 2 CO 3 additive {{was found to be}} 1. 0 [*]g·L− 1 in this test.

40|$|International audienceKarst systems contain {{important}} groundwater resources. Due {{to their}} complexity, {{they are generally}} under exploited. Particularly, the hydrodynamic functioning of the unsaturated zone is badly understood even if its important role is admitted Today, the hydrogeologists are agreeing with the important function(s) of the unsaturated zone in karst systems, but today this role(s) is badly characterized. As they are very complex systems, karst aquifers are generally under exploited. It is necessary to progress {{in the understanding of}} the functioning of the karst systems and particulary in the functioning of the unsaturated zone in order to develop the corresponding management tools. The study of the unsaturated zone of a karst system needs some access to this part of the aquifer. Speleological access is not sufficient because the major part of the water flows in not humanly <b>enterable</b> drains. The Low-Noise Underground Laboratory of Rustrel-Pays d'Apt (LSBB) is an artificial gallery digged in the unsaturated zone of the Fontaine de Vaucluse karst aquifer catchment area. It intersects arbitrarily the fault networks in depth and then the potential areas of flows through the unsaturated zone. From 2002 to 2009, 61 points where water regularly flows have been identified. For each, flow rate has been periodically monitored. This first global study of the acquired data shows a good relation between flows and geological structures. An organization of flows with depth and geology is also underlined.

40|$|Objectives: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} Suvarna Bhasma Parada Marit by using the Ayurvedic test parameters, physico-chemical tests, and various instrumentation techniques. Methods: Suvarna Bhasma, an Ayurvedic formulation manufactured as per Bharat Bhaishajya Ratnakar 5 / 8357 (BBR), has been studied using various instrumentation techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), laser particle size distribution (PSD) analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), and physico-chemical parameters, such as the loss on drying (LOD), loss on ignition (LOI), and acid insoluble Ash (AIA) were determined. In addition, Ayurvedic tests, such as Rekhapurnatva (<b>enterable</b> in the furrows of the fingers), Varitaratwa (floatable over water), Nirdhoomta (smokeless), Dantagre Kach-Kach (gritty particle feeling between the teeth), were performed. Results: The XRD study showed Suvarna Bhasma to be crystalline in nature and to contain more than 98 % gold. The mean size of the gold crystallites was less than 10 microns, and the morphology was globular and irregular. Suvarna Bhasma contains gold as its single and major element, with EDAX and FT-IR spectra showing that it is more than 98 % pure gold. The moisture content (LOD) is less than 0. 5 %, the LOI is less than 2 %, and the AIA is not less than 95 %. The Ayurvedic tests, as specified above, helped to confirm the quality of Suvarna bhasma prepared as per the text reference (BBR). Conclusion: This chemical characterization of Suvarna Bhasma performed in this study by using modern instrumentation techniques will be helpful in understanding its pharmacological actions and will help in establishing quality protocols and specifications to substantiate the safety, efficacy & quality of Suvarna Bhasma...|$|E
40|$|Most cave entrances occur {{by natural}} happenstance {{rather than as}} an intri-cate part of the {{formation}} of the cave itself {{and the vast majority of}} caves have no entrance <b>enterable</b> by man. In the geologic lifetime of a cave any number of entrances may have opened and closed through natural processes. A surprising number of caves in the U. S. were discovered using some form of excavation or “digging ” by cavers. Pursuing obvious “digs ” is the next logical step in the process of searching for and inventorying caves. A variety of excavation techniques are employed ranging from removing soil and rolling a few rocks out of the way to “rock shaving ” using micro-blasting techniques to using heavy equipment such as a backhoe. Digging for new caves and the techniques used for the excavation must be compatible with the overall land use regulations for the specific area. The techniques used for digging on highly protected lands such as wilderness areas should cause minimal disturbance to the surface zone and within the cave. The creation of a new entrance may reveal a significant resource not previously known and increase the natural value of the area. However, digging also may create nega-tive impacts to the cave ecosystem and affect mineral growth by changing airflow patterns in the cave. Alterations to the surface zone immediately surrounding the new entrance may impact drainage, sedimentation, and energy inputs to the cave. We cannot protect a resource that we have not identified, but we don’t want to unnecessarily damage the resource in the process of discovery. In most cases, digging to search for a “new ” cave or to reopen an old entrance is appropriate, but we must remain aware of possible environmental impacts and dig softly...|$|E

40|$|The Gypsum Plain {{region of}} the Delaware Basin hosts {{approximately}} 1800 km 2 of the Castile Formation outcrop. A myriad of karstic developments from closed sinkholes to large multi-kilometer cave systems have been documented within the region. Karst studies on the distribution and speleogenetic evolution within Castile strata began within the last decade with ever increasing data resolution. In this study, {{a combination of both}} physical field surveys and analyses of high resolution (~ 30 cm accuracy) LiDAR data was used to create a theoretical model for karst development across the region. This idealized model considers speleogenetic formation type variations (hypogene and epigene), the density of karstic features based on lithology variations, and the connection between the local hydrostratigraphic setting and the regional hydrogeological framework. Field studies included physical mapping of 20 km 2 of the Gypsum Plain from the Castile’s western outcrop to where it dips into the subsurface to the east. These surface surveys involved the recording of all surfically-expressed karstic phenomena and the mapping of all <b>enterable</b> caves so that the speleogenetic evolution could be analyzed. The way in which hypogene and epigene caves are surfically expressed across the region indicates that many of the caves have been affected by either multi-stage epigenetic development or multi-stage hypogenetic development with epigenetic overprinting. Through the use of the methods outlined above, surficial karst manifestations vary across the region, from hypogenetic exposures in the west and epigenetic phreatic / vadose exposures in the east. Additionally, supplementary LiDAR data was used to create digital elevation models (DEM) so that the effectiveness of physical field surveys versus remote sensing techniques could be determined. Previous works in the area by Stafford et al., (2008 b) determined that remote sensing preserved only 36 % of all karstic features found through physical field surveys. Given today’s advancements in remote sensing accuracy, this study determined that on average LiDAR analysis identifies almost seven times more karstic features than physical surveys over a given area...|$|E

The mass is connected to adjoining building and grows up. The form is inspired by ship, the corner symbolizes keel. The corner tower was cut in 2 directions, cuts are not so expressive over the river, it is apparent from side and close view. The cut features fallacy - disturbance of the vertical lines turns beholder´s head, {{it seems to be}} thinner than the prism.

40|$|The karst {{ecosystem}} shows heterogeneity and {{variability of}} geology, hydrology, morphology and ecology {{in space and}} time. Chemical composition of water in karst {{plays a crucial role}} not only in dissolution of karst rocks and deposition but also in ecological processes. The heterogeneous nature of karst aquifers leads to difficulties in predicting groundwater flow and contaminant transport direction and travel times. For its position at the top of karst, epikarst represents the interface between surface and underground. Epikarst ecology, biodiversity and fauna have rarely been systematically studied. The typical absence of <b>enterable</b> passages makes necessary an indirect approach. In this research, epikarst biodiversity in relation to environmental conditions was studied in seven Alpine and Pre-Alpine caves, located at different altitudes, in Slovenia and in Italy: Snežna jama na planini Arto (1556 m a. s. l.), Jama pod Babjim zobom (860 m a. s. l.), Zadlaška jama (300 m a. s. l.) and Pološka jama (500 m a. s. l.), in Slovenian Alps and Pre-alps, and Grotta A del Ponte di Veja (600 m a. s. l.), Covolo della Croce (875 m a. s. l.) and Grotta di Roverè Mille (1005 m a. s. l.) in Lessinian Massif. In these caves, percolating water was monthly monitored for fauna in the period of one year. Temperature, discharge, conductivity and pH were measured at the same time, and water samples for the laboratory analyses of total hardness, concentrations of various ions (calcium, chlorine, nitrate, sulphate and phosphate) and dissolved organic carbon were taken. 66 aquatic and terrestrial, mostly hypogean, species were found. Aquatic fauna was dominant in all caves, with the exception of Covolo della Croce. Caves located at higher elevations harbour less diverse communities. No animals were found when discharge was very low and in correspondence of moonmilk formations. The most abundant and diverse group was Copepoda, with thirteen different species and 776 individuals at different maturity stadia, totally representing 61 % of the community (between two and three copepod species per cave in Slovenia and between one and six per cave in Italy). The 62 % of copepod species were stygobionts. Some copepod species (e. g. Speocyclops infernus) have wide ecological tolerance to environmental variables, other have more restricted tolerances (e. g. Lessinocamptus insoletus). With regard of copepods, there was a good agreement between the number of observed species and the total number of predicted species, confirming that the sampling method was appropriate and sampling complete. Correlations between the copepod community structure and measured parameters, obtained with Pearson correlation coefficient and principal component analysis (PCA) show different patterns. Presence of copepods was positively correlated with conductivity and dissolved organic carbon in Grotta di Roverè Mille, and with carbonate and nitrate in Pološka jama. In other caves not so high correlations were found between copepod species and measured parameters and between pairs of species. Investigations of the Alpine and Pre-alpine epikarst fauna can help to understand better the ecology of the epikarst fauna and its roles within the large range of different shallow subterranean habitats...|$|E
40|$|Dosage form - spray {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} and modern methods of medicines administration in the human body. The advantage of airborne mode of medicines delivery (inhalation) than injection and <b>enterable</b> methods is the ability to direct and rapid impact on the area of inflammation of the mucous membranes or when fine evaporation - on the bronchi and lungs. When finished medicinal product itself has not a sufficient antimicrobial activity, in its composition can be administered antimicrobial preservatives, which is especially important for medicines as aqueous solutions. Because microbial contamination can cause infection of the patient or damage to the finished product, antimicrobial preservatives are designed to prevent microbial contamination of the finished medicinal product during storage and use, especially in the case of multi-container packaging. Rationale of composition and technology of spray “Efial” was conducted by us using physical, chemical and technological methods.

Material & methods The object of the test – “Efial”containing preservatives on the lower: series 10814 (holding inoculated samples at a temperature of 20 - 25 º C) and series 10914 (holding inoculated samples at 2 - 8 º C). Materials: 1. Nutrient medium: soy-casein agar, sabourodextrose agar. 2. Solutions: buffer solution of sodium chloride and peptone pH = 7. 0, containing 50 g/l of polysorbate- 80, 5 g/l of lecithin, 1 g/l of histidine hydrochloride. Test-microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027; Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Aspergillus brasiliensis АТСС 16404. Preparation of inoculums was carried by State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine, p. 5. 1. 3. Results & discussion The checks of methods for determining total viable microorganisms suitability have been carried out. It was proved that the method of surface sowing on cups of 1 ml of medicine’s dilution 1 : 10 is suitable for determining the number of microorganisms in 1 ml and can be used during the test effectiveness of antimicrobial preservatives. Further tests of efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in the product “Efial”: s. 10 814 (holding inoculated samples at a temperature of 20 - 25 °C) and s. 10914 (holding inoculated samples at 2 - 8 °C) were conducted. The test results showed that in storage of the inoculated medicine’s samples at 2 - 8 °C, there is no significant change in the number of viable cells of the test microorganisms as compared to the original number:  it is marked a tendency to a slight decrease in the number of viable test microorganism Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus on day 7 and 14 that do not meet the admissibility of the effectiveness of antimicrobial preservative according criteria A and B;  it is marked a tendency to a slight decrease in the number of viable test microorganisms Candida albicans and small increase in the number of viable test microorganisms Aspergillus brasiliensis on day 14 that do not meet the admissibility of the effectiveness of antimicrobial preservative according criteria A and B. At the same time, medicine’s samples during storage at 2 - 8 °C, they are not an increase in the number of microorganisms within 28 days. Conclusions 1. Testing the effectiveness of antimicrobial preservatives (sodium salt propylparahydroxybenzoate - 0. 18 mg / ml sodium meathylparahydroxybenzoate - 1. 62 mg / ml) in sprays "Efial. " It is proved that the chosen preservatives ensure microbiological purity of the drug during storage at 2 to 8 ° C. 2. To ensure proper microbiological purity of the drug during its use after opening the primary packaging, the following measures: • introduced filtration through a filter with a pore size of 0. 22 microns, which provides a necessary degree of microbiological purity of the drug; • set the storage mode at 2 to 8 ° C - which is not the reproduction of microorganisms in the sample; • limited term use of the drug after opening - up to 7 days...|$|E
