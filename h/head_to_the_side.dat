Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings [...] "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget how you do it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer turns her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and looks into the distance, as the camera pans away.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} whether {{behavior of}} fielders pursuing uncatchable fly balls supported either (a) {{maintenance of a}} linear optical trajectory (LOT) with monotonic increases in optical ball height or (b) maintenance of optical acceleration cancellation (OAC) with simultaneous lateral alignment with the ball. Past work supports usage of both LOT and OAC strategies {{in the pursuit of}} catchable balls <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> When balls are uncatchable, fielders must choose either optical linearity or alignment {{at the expense of the}} other. Fielders maintained the LOT strategy more often and for a longer period of time than they did the OAC alignment strategy. Findings support the LOT strategy as primary when pursuing balls <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> whether catchable or not.

2500|$|The {{draw for}} the tournament {{took place at the}} Las Vegas Convention Centre on 19 December 1993, officiated by general-secretary Sepp Blatter. Teams were drawn by German legend Franz Beckenbauer, heavyweight boxing {{champion}} Evander Holyfield and comedian and actor Robin Williams (who put on a surgical glove and said to Blatter [...] "if you'll turn your <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and cough" [...] before drawing the teams). Numbers for placement in the group were drawn by actor Beau Bridges, Women's World Cup champion Michelle Akers, model Carol Alt, artist Peter Max, racing driver Mario Andretti and Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton.|$|E

60|$|Had it {{not been}} for a bootblack at Charing Cross I should {{probably}} never have bought the smoking-table. I had to pass that boy every morning. In vain did I scowl at him, or pass with my <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> He always pointed derisively (as I thought) at my boots. Probably my boots were speckless, but that made no difference; he jeered and sneered. I have never hated any one as I loathed that boy, and to escape him I took to going round by the Lowther Arcade. It was here that my eye fell on the smoking-table. In the Lowther Arcade, if the attendants catch you looking at any article for a fraction of a second, it is done up in brown paper, you have paid your money, and they have taken down your address before you realize that you don't want anything. In this way I became the owner of my smoking-table, and when I saw it in a brown-paper parcel on my return to my chambers I could not think what it was until I cut the strings. Such a little gem of a table no smokers should be without; and I am not ashamed to say that I was in love with mine as soon as I had fixed the pieces together. It was of walnut, and consisted mainly of a stalk and two round slabs not much bigger than dinner-plates. There were holes in the centre of these slabs for the stalk to go through, and the one slab stood two feet from the floor, the other a foot higher. The lower slab was fitted with a walnut tobacco-jar and a pipe-rack, while on the upper slab were exquisite little recesses for cigars, cigarettes, matches, and ashes. These held respectively three cigars, two cigarettes, and four wax vestas. The smoking-table was an ornament to any room; and the first night I had it I raised my eyes from my book to look at it every few minutes. I got all my pipes together {{and put them in the}} rack; I filled the jar with tobacco, the recesses with three cigars, two cigarettes, and four matches; and then I thought I would have a smoke. I swept my hand confidently along the mantelpiece, but it did not stop at a pipe. I rose and looked for a pipe. I had half a dozen, but not one was to be seen--none on the mantelpiece, none on the window-sill, none on the hearth-rug, none being used as book-markers. I tugged at the bell till William John came in quaking, and then I asked him fiercely what he had done with my pipes. I was so obviously not to be trifled with that William John, as we called him, because some thought his name was William, while others thought it was John, very soon handed me my favorite pipe, which he found in the rack on the smoking-table. This incident illustrates one of the very few drawbacks of smoking-tables. Not being used to them, you forget about them. William John, however, took the greatest pride in the table, and whenever he saw a pipe lying on the rug he pounced upon it and placed it, like a prisoner, in the rack. He was also most particular about the three cigars, the two cigarettes, and the four wax vestas, keeping them carefully in the proper compartments, where, unfortunately, I seldom thought of looking for them.|$|E

50|$|Standard CPR is {{performed}} with the person in supine position. Prone CPR or reverse CPR is CPR performed on a person lying on their chest, by turning the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and compressing the back.

5000|$|He is {{credited}} with coining the word [...] "camptodactyly" [...] to describe a flexion deformity of the finger(s) at the proximal interphalangeal joint (1906). With neurologist Joseph Grasset (1849-1918), his name {{is associated with the}} [...] "Landouzy-Grasset Law". This law states that in lesions concerning one hemisphere of the brain, a patient will turn his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of affected muscles if there is spasticity, and {{to the side of the}} cerebral lesion if there is paralysis.|$|E

50|$|The {{function}} of this muscle is <b>to</b> rotate <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> or obliquely rotate the head. It also flexes the neck. When both <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> muscle act together, it flexes {{the neck and}} extends the head. When one side acts alone, it causes <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> rotate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> and flexes laterally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same <b>side</b> (ipsilaterally).|$|R
50|$|Weakness of intorsion {{results in}} {{torsional}} diplopia, {{in which two}} different visual fields, tilted with respect to each other, are seen at <b>the</b> same time. <b>To</b> compensate for this, patients with trochlear nerve palsies tilt their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>side,</b> in order <b>to</b> fuse <b>the</b> two images into a single visual field.|$|R
50|$|The Dutch angle, {{also known}} as Dutch tilt, canted angle, or oblique angle, {{is a type of}} camera shot where the camera is set at an angle on its roll axis so that the shot is {{composed}} with vertical lines at an angle {{to the side of the}} frame, or so that the horizon line of the shot is not parallel with the bottom of the camera frame. This produces a viewpoint akin to tilting one's <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
50|$|During winter, tawny frogmouths choose northerly {{oriented}} {{positions on}} branches {{that are more}} exposed to sunlight {{in order to increase}} body heat. Pair roosting and huddling to share body warmth is also common during winter months. During daylight hours, tawny frogmouths sometimes perch on the ground to sunbathe, remaining motionless for up to five minutes. During this time, the birds open their beaks wide, close their eyes, and move their <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> to allow sunrays to penetrate beneath the thick layer of feathers.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect is}} {{different}} from colored afterimages, which appear superimposed on whatever is seen and which are quite brief. It depends on retinal orientation (tilting the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> by 45 degrees makes the colors in the above example disappear; tilting the head by 90 degrees makes the colors reappear such that the gravitationally vertical grating now looks green), and inducing the effect with one eye leads to no effect being seen with the other eye. However, {{there is some evidence}} of binocular interactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>To</b> {{compensate}} for <b>the</b> double-vision {{resulting from the}} weakness of the superior oblique, patients characteristically tilt their <b>head</b> down and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> opposite <b>the</b> affected muscle.|$|R
50|$|The lions measure c.1.20m {{high and}} c 2.20m long.

2500|$|The {{function}} of this muscle is <b>to</b> rotate <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> or obliquely rotate the head. [...] It also flexes the neck.
