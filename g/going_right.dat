Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, <b>going</b> <b>right</b> down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

25|$|After issuing the {{challenge}} to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex B movie star-turned-martial arts instructor named Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi) to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be <b>going</b> <b>right</b> for Joe, as he has begun to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had been hoping for. When Meg realizes Jeremy (Greg Germann), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who {{also happens to be}} attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of large artillery pieces and larger guns began with Burgundy. Originally a minor power, it grew {{to become one}} of the most powerful states in 14th-century Europe, and a great innovator in siege warfare. The Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold (1363-1404), based his power on the effective use of big guns and promoted research and development in all aspects of gunpowder weaponry technology. Philip established manufacturers and employed more cannon casters than any European power before him, however he wasn't the first to build large guns. The first appeared in 1375 when a dozen or so smiths in Caen developed a 900 kilogram cannon which took six weeks to create. Whereas most European guns before 1370 weighed about 20 to 40lbs (9–14kg), the French siege of Château de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte in 1375 during the Hundred Years War saw the use of guns weighing over a ton (900kg), firing stone balls weighing over 100lbs (45kg). Philip used large guns to help the French capture the fortress of Odruik in 1377, which was held by the English at the time. These guns fired projectiles far larger than any that had been used before, and among the 140 cannons Philip brought to Odruik, 109 were large, with seven guns that could shoot projectiles as heavy as 90 kilograms. The cannons smashed the city walls, some <b>going</b> <b>right</b> through them, and Odruik surrendered, inaugurating a new era of artillery warfare. Burgundy's territories rapidly expanded using their new gun designs.|$|E

[...] Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: [...] "Sometimes when I sit around {{and look at the}} game and things ain't <b>going</b> <b>right,</b> I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'." ...|$|E

"Biko" [...] means [...] "Please" [...] (or more {{accurately}} [...] "I implore you") in Igbo—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used [...] "when you're beseeching {{someone to do}} something". Okereke denied that {{it is about the}} murdered South African anti-apartheid protester Steve Biko. The lyrics of [...] "One Month Off" [...] reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful, while [...] "Zephyrus" [...] concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on E. E. Cummings' poem [...] "I Carry Your Heart with Me". Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is <b>going</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
500|$|While {{many critics}} found the band's new sound refreshing, NME criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely using their {{trademark}} funk sound, asking: [...] "Can {{we have our}} brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle." [...] Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be [...] "the best big-time American rock guitarist <b>going</b> <b>right</b> now". Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the band as [...] "New Age fuck fiends" [...] and citing [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] and [...] "Purple Stain" [...] as highlights.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March, France {{played host to}} England at the Parc des Princes. England were victorious {{but it was a}} good contest, {{with the}} final score 3–11. The French defended well, but England scored two tries and a {{conversion}} and were leading 0–8 at half time. After the break, the French played with [...] "dash and spirit", repeatedly coming close to scoring until, with 20 minutes to go, Guillemin chased a long kick from Lesieur and scored a try, which went unconverted. For the final ten minutes, with an injury to Lane, France held on with fourteen men on the field. The French press was delighted not to have witnessed another crushing defeat, comparing the result with England's recent score of 11–6 against Wales. As well as having improved in the ability to play the game, the fitness of the players was much improved, {{and they were able to}} keep <b>going</b> <b>right</b> to the end. The annihilation anticipated for the second half did not come, with each side scoring three points, Guillemin amongst the best of the French forwards.|$|E

[...] He likened his {{emotions}} on those occasions to [...] "a big blackness", {{and found that}} performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions. Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling, {{a result of his}} falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of [...] "Exit" [...] on 20 September 1987 in Washington. The concert was being filmed for the movie, and the Edge stated that [...] "the show was not going well". Bono fell while running across the stage [...] "in an attempt to try [...] get something going". Recalling the incident, Bono said [...] " [...] had taken me to some ugly place... but it was rage that caused it. That was when I realized rage is an expensive thing for your general well-being." [...] On another occasion he said [...] "I just want to take a bath after we do that. I just want to wash it off my skin."

[...] On a series of running plays, Michigan drove the ball inside Ohio State's ten-yard line. [...] Charles Grube, substituting for Jim Miller, ran on fourth down and gained four yards to Ohio State's one-yard line. [...] On first down from the one-yard line Grube fumbled, but recovered the ball. [...] On the next play, Steger ran through the right guard for a touchdown. [...] Michigan tried a pass for the extra point, but the pass from Uteritz was incomplete. [...] Ohio State never advanced the ball inside Michigan's 40-yard line.|$|E
