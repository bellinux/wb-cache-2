40|$|CIVINSThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the value of BOS contracts to the U. S. Navy with regards to <b>Facility</b> <b>Service</b> Contracting. <b>Facility</b> <b>service</b> contracting generally is NOT an inherently governmental function and is therefore a prime target for government outsourcing to private industry. Recently, a strong emphasis has been placed on utilizing the private sector when functions are not inherently governmental in nature, enabling economics and market forces to prevail. The idea is that outsourcing will provide more value to the Navy since private industry already performs <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> and will compete to win contracts. What is the most appropriate method for the Navy to use when contracting for <b>facility</b> <b>services?</b> The history of Navy service contracting will be discussed in a later section, but the Navy has many options in which to contract for <b>facility</b> <b>services.</b> Each military base or region has different requirements with regards to <b>Facility</b> <b>services.</b> The Navy may use a BOS contract, individual service contracts, or a hybrid of the two. In recent years, pilot programs have been initiated to test the feasibility of web base FSC programs where Regional IDIQ e-FSC's are used such that customers can order services through a web-base program. However, these pilot programs do not address the fundamental issue of whether the Navy should have a BOS contract or individual FSC contracts. U. S. Naval Postgraduate School, CIVINS progra...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define the added value of {{facility}} management (FM) in general and to develop a typology of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> based on their added value in the educational environment. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a literature review and first assesses the different aspects of FM added value. The different variables and relations between the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> and their effects on the educational achievement are then conceptualised and studied. Findings – Research shows that FM added value is the customer perceived trade-off between the effects of the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> on the outcome of their processes, its costs and risks. On this basis, a typology of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> was constructed around their level of fixity and their influence on the learning outcome. Practical implications – The typology strongly indicates for FM when to engage in the decision-making process relating to the educational environment in order to contribute to education. Also the typology is useful for deriving priorities for adjusting the current use situation of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> to enhance their effectiveness in both a time and financially efficient manner. Originality/value – This paper operationalises the concept of FM added value and provides several hypotheses and firm recommendations for further research to maximise the contribution of FM. The paper also presents a practical framework for evidenced-based decision making on the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> in the educational environment. It thus offers opportunities for FM to support the future learning landscap...|$|R
