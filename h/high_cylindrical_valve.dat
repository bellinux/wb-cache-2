40|$|We use the {{continuity}} equation and the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations {{to study the}} flow-pattern characteristics around a turbine runner for the small-opening <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> of a hydraulic turbine. For closure, we adopt the renormalization-group k-ε two-equation turbulence model and use the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT to numerically simulate the three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flow through the entire passage of the hydraulic turbine. The results show that a low-pressure zone develops around the runner blades when the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> is closed in a small opening; cavitation occurs at the blades, and a vortex appears at the outlet of the runner. As the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> is gradually closed, the flow velocity over the runner area increases, and the pressure gradient becomes more significant as the discharge decreases. In addition, the fluid flow velocity is relatively high between {{the lower end of}} the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> and the base, so that a high-velocity jet is easily induced. The calculation and analysis provide a theoretical basis for improving the performance of cylindrical-valve operating systems...|$|R
50|$|Once the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> has closed, {{the spring}} presses it still further {{down through the}} seat. There is a small {{distance}} between {{the point where the}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> first closes, and where the mitre valve finally closes. This has the effect of slightly increasing the volume of the closed-off volume, including the delivery pipe. As liquids are near-incompressible, even this tiny change in volume has the effect of dropping the pressure in the pipe. This drop in pressure allows the injector valve to close fully, without leakage or dribble.|$|R
50|$|Anti-dribble {{action is}} {{provided}} by a second valve seat, below the conical main seat (i.e. on the pump side). This is a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve,</b> fitting a <b>cylindrical</b> seat. This <b>valve</b> seat closes first, before the mitre valve, and shuts off the fuel flow. As the seat is cylindrical though, the spring pressure does not hold the seat surfaces {{together to make a}} tight seal, and so the mitre valve is still needed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper aims to {{highlight}} the pressure and velocity variations on power lines created by water flowing through a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve.</b> Drain <b>valve</b> is typical <b>cylindrical</b> bottom of the dam or hydroelectric penstocks. Varieties of dimensions of these valves allow different analyses of the dynamics within them. The valves are able to access water from both sides and different ways of filling and closing action items. This paper presents a method to analyse the influence of parameters on physical-mechanical construction or operation and hence derive dynamic optimal design {{of these types of}} valves. Refer to the more intermediate positions of the piston sealing and visualization power lines and areas of turbulence for each position. Flow simulation allows for three power lines recording the flow velocity values then are the velocity and pressure variations in nine distinct points on each line current. <b>Cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> characteristics Being performed {{in a wide range of}} sizes, cylinder valve has been tested only on hydraulic losses experimental methods to flow and seal leaked. A dynamic analysis for different valve openings or changes in hydrodynamic parameters under these conditions can give us additional elements on how best to use or design of the valve.

40|$|Abstract. Bingham viscoplastic {{model is}} used to {{describe}} the constitutive behavior of Magnetorheological (MR) fluids subject to an applied magnetic field. Based on Navier-Stokes’ equation, a theoretical analysis of the effect of the applied magnetic field on the viscoplastic flow in a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> is presented. The expressions for the velocity in viscoplastic flow are derived. The results indicate that the volumetric flow rate can be continuously adjusted by an external magnetic field. With the increase of the applied magnetic field the yield boundary gets closer to the two cylindrical surfaces, and the restriction of flow is increased...|$|R
