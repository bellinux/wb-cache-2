5|$|Although Theodore {{appears to}} have assumed, and was {{addressed}} by, the imperial title almost <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown.

Eleni Bees-Seferli on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.|$|E
