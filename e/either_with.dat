5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war could no longer be won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, <b>either</b> <b>with</b> the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E

5|$|Internet {{searches}} {{for information on}} suicide return webpages that 10-30% of the time encourage or facilitate suicide attempts. There is some concern that such sites may push those predisposed over the edge. Some people form suicide pacts online, <b>either</b> <b>with</b> pre-existing friends or people they have recently encountered in chat rooms or message boards. The Internet, however, may also help prevent suicide by providing a social group {{for those who are}} isolated.|$|E

Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.|$|E
5|$|The {{inflorescence}} is scapose, {{the single}} stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel {{with up to}} 20 blooms. Species bearing a solitary flower include section Bulbocodium and most of section Pseudonarcissus. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as N. papyraceus (see illustration, left) and N. tazetta (see Table I). The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be <b>either</b> <b>with</b> (pedicellate) or without (sessile) floral stalks.|$|E

5|$|To {{perform the}} inspection, the robot has to {{navigate}} around the aircraft {{and get to}} the checkpoints called up in the aircraft virtual model. The position of the aircraft in the airport or factory is not known precisely; the cobot needs to detect the aircraft in order to know its position and orientation relative to the aircraft. To do this, the robot is able to locate itself, <b>either</b> <b>with</b> the laser data from its laser range finders, or with image data from its cameras.|$|E
5|$|X-rays are {{generally}} filtered (by use of X-Ray Filters) {{to a single}} wavelength (made monochromatic) and collimated to a single direction before {{they are allowed to}} strike the crystal. The filtering not only simplifies the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without contributing useful information. Collimation is done <b>either</b> <b>with</b> a collimator (basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors. Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals (under 0.3 mm) or with large unit cells (over 150 Å).|$|E

5|$|Around 1849 Wilkes went to California, <b>either</b> <b>with</b> or {{shortly after}} his friend David Colbreth Broderick. Wilkes was a {{political}} advisor of Broderick's, but they quarreled over water issues in 1853 and Wilkes left California. Wilkes then traveled to Europe, turning the experience into another book, this one entitled Europe in a Hurry. Returning to California after Europe, he reunited with Broderick in late 1853 but another quarrel in 1854 over Wilkes' appointment to a judicial post led to Wilkes' leaving California permanently. The two men reconciled in 1859 during a visit by Broderick to New York shortly before Broderick's death. Wilkes was the recipient of Broderick's estate, and Wilkes wrote a long eulogy to his friend {{that appeared in the}} Spirit in October 1859.|$|E
