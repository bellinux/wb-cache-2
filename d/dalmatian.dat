5|$|Ljudevit Posavski, Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia, led a {{resistance}} to Frankish domination. Ljudevit {{also had to}} fight against <b>Dalmatian</b> Croatia, as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally. After unsuccessful resistance by Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats, the Franks again controlled Istria, Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Nevertheless, <b>Dalmatian</b> Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy between the two Empires, as they {{had a right to}} elect their own prince.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November, the Navy {{blockade}} of <b>Dalmatian</b> ports was challenged by civilian ships. The confrontation {{culminated in the}} Battle of the <b>Dalmatian</b> channels, when Croatian coastal and island based artillery damaged, sank, or captured a number of Yugoslav navy vessels, including Mukos PČ 176, later rechristened PB 62 Šolta. After the battle, the Yugoslav naval operations were effectively limited to the southern Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Charlemagne, King of the Franks from 768 {{until his}} death in 814, {{expanded}} the Frankish kingdom into an empire that incorporated much of western and central Europe.

The Croats lived in Pannonian Croatia and <b>Dalmatian</b> Croatia (Littoral Croatia) to the southeast of the Frankish Empire. <b>Dalmatian</b> Croatia was ruled by Duke Višeslav, one of the first known Croatian dukes.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the <b>Dalmatian</b> cities {{for the next}} few years but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were not suitable for their style of warfare.

After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of Split did not help Béla IV in his escape.|$|E
5|$|The use of Latin as the {{language}} of administration persisted until formally abolished by Heraclius in the 7th century.

Additionally, Vulgar Latin remained a minority language in the Empire, mainly along the <b>Dalmatian</b> coast (<b>Dalmatian)</b> and among the Romanian peoples.|$|E

5|$|The Frankish {{invasion}} of Croatia, {{the destruction of}} Tarsatica, the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor, and negotiations from 802–815 between the Franks and Byzantines led to a stalemate.

5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Italy {{also brought}} with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the <b>Dalmatian</b> coast. As a result, on 9 September, orders were received by 1./(Kroat.)KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic each morning and afternoon. On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy.
