5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} senior architects, {{there was a}} team of Assistant Architects who were {{actually}} responsible {{for many of the}} cemetery and memorial designs. These architects were younger, and many of them had served in the war. The Assistant Architects were: George Esselmont Gordon Leith, Wilfred Clement Von Berg, Charles Henry Holden (who in 1920 became a Principal Architect), William Harrison Cowlishaw, William Bryce Binnie, George Hartley Goldsmith, Frank Higginson, Arthur James Scott Hutton, Noel Ackroyd Rew, and John Reginald Truelove. Other architects that worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission,</b> or won competitions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> memorials, included George Salway Nicol, Harold Chalton Bradshaw, Verner Owen Rees, Gordon H. Holt, and Henry Philip Cart de Lafontaine.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, Edward Maufe was {{appointed}} Principal Architect for the UK. Maufe worked extensively <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> for 25 years until 1969, becoming Chief Architect and also succeeding Kenyon as Artistic Advisor. Together with Maufe, the other Principal Architects appointed {{during and after}} the Second World War were Hubert Worthington, Louis de Soissons, Philip Hepworth and Colin St Clair Oakes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>commission.</b> Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, the {{commission}} assembled {{to review the}} submitted designs, {{as well as a}} set produced by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan at Baker's request, and a set, unrequested, from a Mr. Folio of New York City. It is not known how the designs were displayed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission.</b> After considerable discussion among Fraser, Moore, and Herbert Adams (a sculptor and former member of the Commission), a design by Anthony de Francisci was unanimously selected.|$|E
5|$|The king retires after a {{night of}} feasting. Lady Macbeth drugs his attendants and lays daggers ready <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> of the crime.

She carries the daggers to the room and smears the drugged attendants with blood. The couple retire to wash their hands.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes necessary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> {{to deviate from}} its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Stephenson left Bristol {{to work in}} Coventry as a Senior Community Relations Officer. In 1972 he went to London to work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> for Racial Equality. While in London {{he worked}} with boxer Muhammad Ali setting up the Muhammad Ali Sports Development Association in Brixton, and also set up the Cleo Laine Schools’ Music Awards from 1977 to 1982 with Cleo Laine and John Dankworth. In 1975 he was {{appointed}} to the Sports Council and campaigned prominently against sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa. Stephenson became honorary president of Bristol's West Indian Parents' Association in 1979 and in 1981 {{was appointed to the}} Press Council.|$|E
5|$|In March 1928, Pflueger {{published}} his submission {{for a new}} building to house the San Francisco Stock Exchange, featuring strong Zigzag Moderne themes with classicist notes. Miller and Pflueger won the competition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>commission.</b> Eight months later, the Exchange committee decided instead to rebuild the Sub-treasury building at 301 Pine Street while keeping its Tuscan columns and entrance steps, requiring a completely new approach. Pflueger's first response was a sketch with little ornamentation. Construction began in December 1928. By January 1929, Pflueger's plans indicated prominent sculptures, bas-reliefs, inscriptions and carvings, to be detailed by local artists.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{conflicts}} {{have sometimes}} {{made it impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted {{in the destruction of}} sites altogether. Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was unkempt after the end of World War II and until the German reunification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005. The Six-Day War and War of Attrition resulted in the destruction of Port Tewfik Memorial and Aden Memorial, and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery. During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|War {{memorials}} {{became a}} common sight in British towns and cities following the First World War (1914–1918). Almost one million men from Britain {{were killed in the}} conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in Spalding, a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> and through his own practice. Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{outlined}} {{the request for}} the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rodgers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>commission,</b> and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and stamps. Rogers told the committee that the language for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920–1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted that the government would incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the seignorage and would never be called upon to redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from the Senate Majority Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 1889, the Commission {{received}} its initial funding. Food, transportation and lodging were all compensated, plus $5 per diem. The commissioners received an additional $10 per diem {{while they were}} actually in service. Congress appropriated an additional $20,000 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> to continue its work. In 1892, Congress appropriated another $15,000 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission.</b> March 1893, Commission got $15,000 additional appropriation.|$|E
