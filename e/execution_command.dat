MSFSC officially stood up on 13 November 2005. Stand up of the Ship Support Units (SSUs) followed establishment of MSFSC, their parent command. SSU San Diego stood up in conjunction with MSFSC.

50|$|An {{integrated}} circuit (IC) is located either within the printed material or within an enclosure that cradles the printed material. This IC receives a signal when a switch is innervated. The firmware {{located within the}} IC communicates via Universal Serial Bus (USB) either connected to a cable, or using a wireless protocol adapter to a reference database that can reside on media within a computer or appliance. Upon receipt of the coordinate structure from the firmware, the database correlates the position with a pre-determined link or pathway to digital content or <b>execution</b> <b>command</b> for an application. After correlating the link with the pathway, a signal is sent to retrieve and render the terminal of the path.|$|E

A machine only executes <b>execution</b> <b>commands</b> of a program, while the compiler only performs the verification commands. Common commands in other languages {{can be defined as}} a combination of <b>execution</b> and verification <b>commands.</b> Design of verifiers then becomes program design interpretation, modeling checking and Hoare Logic are all special verification programs, so are many of their combinations. ...|$|R

5000|$|Most of the {{commands}} in modern drill are separated into two distinct parts; the Preparatory Command, and the Command of Execution. The preparatory command indicates {{to the person}} performing the movement that a command of execution is soon to follow - and which action to perform.. The command of execution indicates the movement to be performed. An {{example of this is}} the command [...] "Present ARMS", which is utilized to command a group of soldiers to render a salute. In this command, the word [...] "Present" [...] is the preparatory command, whereas the following word, [...] "ARMS" [...] is the command of execution. The movement is performed immediately upon reception of the <b>execution</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E

The security and the reliability are vital for safety control system. Inspired by the principle of quantum entanglement, we put forward a theoretical quantum safety control protocol which is based on two-step command transmission. In the two-step protocol, a quantum switch and a classical switch are fixed in the safety control process. Quantum switch and the classical switch are in charge of the transmission of cryptogram command and the transmission of <b>execution</b> <b>command</b> respective. Quantum principle guarantees the absolute security of this protocol. Besides, this is the first quantum safety control system...|$|E

30|$|Among them, User Request (TMS_UR), Sensor Driver (TMS_SD), and Robot Controller (TMS_RC) modules are {{interface}} modules between users, sensors, and robots. The Task Scheduler (TMS_TS) module {{receives a}} sequence of subtasks from the Database (TMS_DB) module according to the user’s requests. Task Scheduler is designed to achieve the desired task and to schedule the execution timings of subtasks. The Robot Planner (TMS_RP) module manages the execution of each subtask and sends <b>execution</b> <b>commands</b> to the Robot Controller (TMS_RC) module with proper timing.|$|R
40|$|O-Plan is a command, {{planning}} and control architecture {{with an open}} modular structure intended to allow experimentation on, or replacement of, various components. The research is seeking to determine which functions are generally required {{in a number of}} application areas and across a number of different command, planning, scheduling and control systems. O-Plan aims to demonstrate how a planner, situated in a task assignment and plan <b>execution</b> (<b>command</b> and control) environment, and using extensive domain knowledge, can allow for flexible, distributed, collaborative, and mixed-initiative planning. The research is seeking to verify this total systems approach by studying a simplified three-level model with separable task assignment, plan generation and plan execution agents. O-Plan has been applied to logistics tasks that require flexible response in changing situations. The O-Plan research has achieved a clearer understanding of the components necessary in a flexible planning system, and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Overview The {{two primary}} new {{features}} are: The ability to convert GEOS-Chem binary punch output input netCDF files that MOZBC can read, and The ability to specify an alternate MPI <b>execution</b> <b>command</b> to run WRF. Specific changes: New program: Tools/gc 2 moz/python/gc 2 moz. py can be run to convert GEOS-Chem ND 49 diagnostic binary punch output into netCDF files that MOZBC can read. During the prepinpt step, MOZBC {{will look at}} the attributes of the netCDF file being read. If it has the global attribute "title" equal to "GEOS-Chem", it will look for the MOZBC input file with "-GC" appended before ". inp" When running WRF-Chem, the option [...] alt-mpi-cmd will cause it to execute WRF from within the WRFV 3 /run directory with the exact command given by the environmental variable AWC_MPICMD. During configuration, a check that WRFIO_NCD_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT is set to 1 has been added. If the [...] override option is used, then it will be set alongside the other variables...|$|E

Intentions, {{including}} their temporal properties and semantic content, are receiving increased attention, and neuroscientific studies in humans vary {{with respect to}} the topogra-phy of intention-related neural responses.

To this end, we address the distinction between future-, present-directed, and motor intentions, as well as the organization of intentions in time, specifically to what extent it is sequential or hierarchical. This has consequences as to whether these different types of intentions can be expected to occur simultaneously or not. We further illustrate how it may be useful or even necessary to distinguish types of intentions exposited in philosophy, including yes- vs. no-intentions and oblique vs. direct intentions, to accurately decode the agent’s intentions from neural signals in practical BMI applications...|$|E

30|$|To perform {{activities}} {{related to}} application life cycle management (i.e. deployment, migration, application of policies) the Orchestrator interacts with the Cloudlets in the environment. However, due {{to the degree of}} heterogeneity of the Cloudlets in relation to the security aspects, new challenges arise when carrying out this interaction [98]. The interaction between the Orchestrator and each Cloudlet follows the steps described in the well-known Authentication, Access, and Account (AAA) framework. Authentication makes it possible to identify the Orchestrator in the Cloudlet by querying its credentials. Allocation allows the Orchestrator to perform a set of actions (e.g. access to selected resources and <b>execution</b> <b>commands)</b> after it is authenticated. Finally, the account records the amount and time of use of the resources by the Orchestrator.|$|R
