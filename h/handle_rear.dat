5000|$|The Rhino Orphanage {{works to}} save and {{rehabilitate}} orphaned rhino calves injured or traumatized by rhino poaching. The Rhino Orphanage forms part of the rapid intervention and coordinated rescue response network where the appropriate <b>handling,</b> <b>rearing</b> and rehabilitation protocols are implemented, crucial to ensuring that the rhino orphans are rescued successfully, humanely and responsibly. At the Orphanage animals are reared {{in such a manner}} as to ensure their full rehabilitation and return to the wild.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{throttle}} is {{operated by the}} [...] under the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> of the saw. Unless the lock-out switch above the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> is also pressed, the throttle cannot move from the idle position, and the chain will not be driven.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, the Hyundai i30 won the 'Best Mid size Car Under $28,000'. At {{the time}} of its release in the end of 2007, the 1.6L CRDi i30 was the {{cheapest}} diesel car in Australia, coming in at just $21,490AUD for the basic (SX) model. The model above (SLX) adds Climate Control, trip computer, leather gear knob and steering wheel (with audio controls), cruise control (from 2008), body colour door <b>handles,</b> <b>rear</b> armrest with cup holders, six speakers (up from four), adjustable lumbar support for the driver, fog lights and 16" [...] alloy wheels. Australian i30 models feature a unique suspension tune for Australian road conditions.|$|R

25|$|H: The tote is a <b>handle</b> on the <b>rear</b> of the plane.(Some aficionados {{object to}} the use of the word tote preferring handle).|$|R
50|$|GS adds: 4-wheel disc brakes, 6-way (7-way in 1995) {{adjustable}} driver's seat, split folding rear seat, {{tilt steering}} column, cassette player, Power antenna (96-99), cruise control, body colored power mirrors, door <b>handles</b> and <b>rear</b> spoiler, fog lights, cargo cover and net, 16-inch wheels with 205/55/HR16 (96-99 models), lower bodyside cladding, rear windshield washer/wiper.|$|R
25|$|A bolt hold-open device {{locks the}} bolt carrier {{assembly}} open after expending the last cartridge from {{the magazine and}} is released by lifting the bolt catch lever located {{on the left side}} of the receiver. Alternatively, a left-handed shooter may release the bolt by pulling the rubber-coated charging <b>handle</b> to <b>rear</b> a short distance.|$|R
50|$|The Nitro {{made its}} debut in February 2005 at the Chicago Auto Show, as a concept car {{featuring}} an aluminum themed interior design. Aluminum-trimmed vents behind the front fenders, and other aluminum trim around the door <b>handles</b> and <b>rear</b> hatch, were routinely displayed as the center stack and shifter also included a finish in satin silver.|$|R
50|$|Two prototypes were {{presented}} to the CABA, 30 November 1956 for a first prototype, the second was sent May 28, 1957. It contained only a few detail improvements, made {{as a result of}} tests on prototype # 1. On 27 June 1957, three machine guns were sent to complete the CABA. Two copies were for the Technical Section of the Army. The weapon was found valid in its presentation and its operating principle, but it could be mounted on all military vehicles in service because of its shape and organization (no <b>handles</b> <b>rear).</b> On December 10, 1959, the prototype No. 7 and 8 were given to the Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux for adaptive trials on a circular troop transport vehicle. Ultimately, 12 prototypes were ordered in December 1956 made and experienced. The weapon remained as the prototype for the development was not considered necessary.|$|R
50|$|Exterior:Front lip/spoiler, Rear boot spoiler with {{integral}} brake light, Headlight washers, electric sunroof, colour-coded mirrors, colour-coded door <b>handles,</b> colour-coded front <b>rear</b> bumpers, {{front fog}} lights, lightweight Speedline 5 spoke alloy wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} controls of the chainsaw, {{such as the}} throttle and the engine stop (or on/off) switch, are placed {{so that they may}} operated whilst retaining a good grip on the <b>rear</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the 1965 model year, the {{full-size}} Ford platform {{was given}} a redesign. To improve ride and <b>handling,</b> the <b>rear</b> leaf springs (a design unchanged since the 1949 Ford) were replaced by a three-link coil-spring design. To comply with federal safety mandates, in 1967 the full-size Fords were updated with a padded dashboard, recessed controls, collapsible steering column with padded steering wheel, and 3-point seatbelts; 1968 models gained side marker lights.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} revised bodywork, {{mechanically}} the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and <b>handling.</b> This <b>rear</b> suspension was largely {{derived from the}} stillborn Porsche 989's rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.|$|R
50|$|For 2007, {{the base}} Grand Cherokee Laredo gains {{exterior}} color-keyed door <b>handles</b> and <b>rear</b> brow. The 26F and 28F Packages for the base Laredo trim level are now discontinued, though a 28E Package {{is now available}} for Laredo, for those who desire a base model with a V8 engine. The Rocky Mountain Edition returns for 2007. In some states, the 4.7L Powertech V8 engine is now FlexFuel-capable, and can now run on E85 Ethanol.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>handles</b> {{of a typical}} [...] "rear handle" [...] {{chainsaw}} are widely spaced, so as to provide enough leverage for good control, and also to provide some degree of control {{in the event of}} a kickback.|$|R
50|$|The Oldsmobile O4's {{doors open}} {{in a manner of}} front {{conventional}} doors and rear small suicide doors. The Oldsmobile O4 has 2 silver door handles on the front doors while it does not have door <b>handles</b> for the <b>rear</b> doors.|$|R

Self-propelled cart enables rescuer to move victim of industrial accident quickly away from toxic, flammable, explosive, corrosive, carcinogenic, asphyxiating, or extremely cold liquids. Intended for use where {{too dangerous for}} ambulances and other vehicles to approach accident site. Constructed of high-strength tubing, rides on bicycle wheels with balloon tires. Rescuer steers cart with <b>handle</b> at <b>rear.</b> Estimated mass of fully equipped vehicle is 650 lb...|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} uses Macpherson struts with a new, more rigid control-arm design, {{while the}} rear uses a torsion beam arrangement. The spring rates on Corolla are relaxed, but the S model equipped with 17-inch wheels includes unique coil, damper, and bushing tuning to offering stiffer <b>handling.</b> The <b>rear</b> torsion beam's attachments points are now {{fastened to the}} body at a slanted, diagonal angle for its bushings, {{a departure from the}} traditional straight attachment orientation; the new layout contributes improves grip, and stability.|$|R
50|$|Bubinga is {{also used}} in {{high-end}} furniture, especially by contemporary Arts and Crafts artists as well on high-end manual woodworking tools such as the front knobs and <b>rear</b> <b>handles</b> of smooth planes. Bubinga comes in various grain patterns, with rare patterns bringing top dollar.|$|R
50|$|Colt and Diemaco further {{improved}} on the design, {{adding a}} flat top carry handle and a further improved bipod to the {{weapon in the}} 1990s. Colt refers {{to it as the}} Model 950, but markets it as the Colt Automatic Rifle, and until their purchase by Colt, as the Diemaco LSW. Because of the Colt-Diemaco partnership on this system, it was the only weapon in their product line to feature A2 rear sights, and when modified a detachable carry <b>handle</b> with A2 <b>rear</b> sights (the majority of Diemaco's product line had A1 rear sights, and they actually developed a detachable carry <b>handle</b> with A1 <b>rear</b> sights). A maple leaf is stamped on the lower receiver of current Colt Automatic Rifles.|$|R
50|$|The M80 Zolja {{launcher}} is telescoping {{which is}} intended for easier transportation. The launchers consists of a forward and rear tube made of fibre-reinforced plastic, a firing mechanism, front and rear aiming sights, a carry <b>handle,</b> front and <b>rear</b> caps to keep debris out and a sling.|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{development}} engineers {{aimed for}} full-size American car ride qualities with European <b>handling.</b> Later torque-arm <b>rear</b> suspension eliminated rear wheel hop under panic braking. Brakes (front discs, rear drums) copy an Opel design, with 10 in diameter single-piston solid rotors, 9 in drums and 70/30 front/rear braking distribution.|$|R
50|$|The {{two most}} common types of kyūsu are yokode kyūsu (side hand(le) teapot), {{which has a}} side handle and which is the more common type, and ushirode kyūsu (back hand(le) teapot), which has a <b>rear</b> <b>handle,</b> just like teapots {{in other parts of}} the world; there are also uwade kyūsu (top hand(le) teapot).|$|R
25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front door <b>handles,</b> recessed <b>rear</b> door <b>handles,</b> and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden <b>rear</b> door <b>handles</b> and prominent front door handles to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|R
2500|$|Chassis {{preparation}} included heavy-duty {{front and}} rear springs (part of the factory's optional <b>handling</b> package), <b>rear</b> spring traction control arms, heavy-duty shock absorbers and a [...] "panhard" [...] type track bar in the rear to eliminate side sway. Stock wheels and tires were replaced by wide magnesium racing wheels and Goodyear racing tires. The cars were aerodynamically modified: the front ends were lowered, the hoods were slanted down and spoilers were installed below the front bumpers. The car interiors had structure-stiffening roll cages for driver protection, a stock bucket seat modified for additional support, and supplementary engine-monitoring instruments.|$|R
30|$|Morphological {{development}} of F 2 hybrid grouper is almost {{similar to that}} reported in F 1 hybrid TGGG by Ch’ng and Senoo (2008), and other groupers (Hussain and Higuchi 1980; Glamuzina et al. 2001). At an early larval stage, the presence of cupula and free neuromast observed in F 2 hybrid TGGG as early as 6  h AH indicates their remarkable ability to sense stimuli in water columns. This information is particularly important to develop a <b>handling</b> stress-free <b>rearing</b> technique to culture F 2 hybrid TGGG, as both cupula and free neuromast are easily broken by mechanical contact (Mukai and Kobayashi 1992).|$|R

50|$|The AR-15's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} carrying <b>handle</b> and <b>rear</b> sight assembly {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the design, where the carry handle serves to protect the charging handle. The AR-15 rifle has a 500 mm (19.75 inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{features}} that added to the roominess of the E30 was the suspension. The front MacPherson struts and rear semi-trailing arm suspension were a compact arrangement that left a lot of cabin and boot space for the car's overall size. The semi-trailing arms {{have been criticized for}} the dynamic toe & camber changes inherent to the suspension geometry, causing bump steer in hard cornering situations (such as racing and autocross). This has contributed to the E30 as having a reputation for [...] "tail happy" [...] <b>handling,</b> where <b>rear</b> grip is reduced in certain situations, leading to oversteer.|$|R
5000|$|In the top-handled saw, the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> and its {{operating}} controls are {{moved to the}} top of the saw. This gives a balance to the saw such that it can now be used one-handed. The front handle remains the same. The chain brake lever is usually separate, rather than being combined into the protective hand guard.|$|R
40|$|The {{hand grip}} forces {{at the front}} and <b>rear</b> <b>handles</b> of a chain saw were {{measured}} during work, in 89 professional lumberjacks. The symptoms caused by vibration to the upper limbs were compared with the hand grip force (HGF) during work. To allow better comparison between subjects we used the ratio of hand grip force (HGF) to the maximal voluntary compression force (MVC), HGF/MVC expressed as a percentage. The mean HGF during sawing varied from 5 to 12 N in all subjects. The variation in HGF was greater at the front handle than at the <b>rear</b> <b>handle,</b> during sawing. The lumberjacks who had vibration-induced white fingers (VWF), had a higher HGF/MVC in both hands than the lumberjacks without VWF. Those lumberjacks affected by VWF used over 12 % of their MVC at work. Subjects without HGF/MVC ratio. The lumberjacks with and without numbness in their hands had equal HGF/MVC ratios...|$|R
50|$|The hatch opening was {{notoriously}} small. Any gunner of extra-large size or larger, {{while wearing}} his body armor, {{would have trouble}} fitting in the turret, {{and it would be}} nearly impossible if he was wearing his gas mask case across his chest. The hatch itself had three positions: full down, half up, and full up; when full up, it acted as a rear shield for the gunner. When opened, the spring-loaded hatch automatically went to the midpoint lock. This forced the gunner to pull down the <b>handle</b> in the <b>rear</b> so that the hatch opened fully. When closing the hatch, the gunner just pulled the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> down until he could latch the hatch. The gunner had a folding pedestal to stand on when behind the machine gun. Operationally, any time the gun was mounted, the gunner had to be behind it whether the vehicle was moving or not.|$|R
25|$|It is {{a version}} of 370Z Coupé commemorating Nissan's global success in GT racing and 40 years of Z in the UK, for the UK market. It {{includes}} a choice of 3 body colours, (Pearl White, Kuro (metallic) black and Black Rose), grey 'GT' stripes running along the flanks of the car, 19inch RAYS forged alloy wheels in dark anthracite colour, retune the dampers to provide the ideal balance between ride comfort and high-speed <b>handling,</b> a <b>rear</b> view parking camera {{as part of the}} Premium Connect satellite navigation system, a tyre pressure monitoring system, seven-speed automatic option with snow mode, revised underbody insulation to reduce road noise.|$|R
