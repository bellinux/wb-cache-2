500|$|MacCallum {{credits the}} Xeer with [...] "Somalia's success without a central government, since it {{provides}} an authentic rule of law to support trade and economic development." [...] In the Xeer, law and crime are {{defined in terms of}} property rights; consequently the criminal justice system is compensatory rather than the punitive system of the majority of states, and the Xeer is [...] "unequivocal in its opposition" [...] to any form of taxation. Powell et al. (2006) find that the existence of the common law dispute resolution system in Somalia makes possible basic economic order. MacCallum compares the Xeer to the common law in 6th century Scotland, and notes that there is no monopoly of either police nor <b>judicial</b> <b>services,</b> a condition of polycentric law. However, a weakness of such a system is that it proves ineffective at handling disputes and enforcing resolutions that cross clan boundaries. For example, in a dispute involving telecommunications company Aerolite, the plaintiff from the weaker clan was unable to collect the [...] "unfairly" [...] small settlement they had been awarded.|$|E
