2500|$|Today {{a growing}} body of {{scientific}} evidence indicate that this disease process, in the cancellous bone and bone marrow, is caused by bone infarcts mediated by a range of local and systemic factors. Bone infarcts as well as damage to the deeper portion of the cancellous bone is an insidious process. It is certainly not visible clinically and routine imaging techniques such as radiographs are not effective for that sort of damage. [...] "An important and often incompletely understood principle of radiography is the amount of bone destruction that goes undetected by routine x-rays procedures; this has been demonstrated by numerous investigators. Destruction confined to the cancellous portion of the bone cannot be detected radiographically, as radiolucencies appear only when there is internal or external erosion or destruction of the bone cortex." [...] In fact no radiographic findings are specific for bone infarction / osteonecrosis. A variety of pathologies may mimic bone infarction, including stress fractures, infections, inflammations, and metabolic and neoplastic processes. The limitations apply to all imaging modalities, including plain radiography, radionuclide studies, CT scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Through-transmission alveolar ultrasound, based on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in combination with panoramic <b>dental</b> <b>radiography</b> (orthopantomography) is helpful in assessing changes in jawbone density. When practitioners have an up-to-date understanding of the disease process and a good anamnesis is combined with detailed clinical findings and course of events, the diagnosis, with the help of various imaging modality, can be achieved earlier, in most patients.|$|E

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{this study}} were to review the {{literature}} on intraoral digital radiography in endodontic treatment with focus on technical parameters and to propose recommendations for improving the quality of reports in future publications. STUDY DESIGN: Two electronic databases were searched. Titles and abstracts were selected according to preestablished criteria.

Recent reports presented technical parameters more thoroughly than older reports. Most reported important parameters for the x-ray unit, but for image interpretation only about one-half of the publications cited resolution of the display system and fewer than one-half bit depth of the graphics card.

40|$|The maxillary antrum {{and dental}} region share a close {{anatomical}} relationship, {{which means that}} dental infections and other odontogenic diseases can affect the maxillary sinus. There is variability {{in the literature of}} reported maxillary sinus mucosal hyperplasia of odontogenic origin, ranging from 58 % to 78 % and greater variability regarding the frequency of dentally induced maxillary sinusitis, ranging from 4. 6 % to 47 %. Determining the primary site of disease in these cases can be a diagnostic dilemma from both clinical and radiographic standpoints. Radiographic examinations such as conventional intraoral periapical <b>radiography,</b> <b>dental</b> panoramic <b>radiography,</b> standard plain films of the paranasal sinuses, CT, and MRI can be useful in evaluating sinus disease of odontogenic origin. Some common dental pathologies that can affect the maxillary antra such as periapical cysts, follicular cysts, odontomas, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, dental implants and oroantral fistulas will be discussed and their imaging findings reviewed. Objectives 1. Discuss the development of the maxillary sinus. 2. Describe the anatomical relationship between the dental region and the maxillary antrum. 3.

5000|$|Stafne's defect {{is usually}} {{discovered}} by chance during routine <b>dental</b> <b>radiography.</b> [...] Radiographically, it is a well-circumscribed, monolocular, round, radiolucent defect, 1-3 cm in size, usually between the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the inferior {{border of the}} posterior mandible between the molars and {{the angle of the}} jaw. It {{is one of the few}} radiolucent lesions that can occur below the IAN. The border is well corticated and it will have no effect on the surrounding structures. Computed tomography (CT) will show a shallow defect through the medial cortex of the mandible with a corticated rim and no soft tissue abnormalities, with the exception of a portion of the submandibular gland. Neoplasms, such as metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the submandibular lymph nodes or a salivary gland tumour, could create a similar appearance but rarely have such well defined borders and can usually be palpated in the floor of the mouth or submandibular triangle of the neck as a hard mass. CT and clinical exam is typically sufficient to distinguish between this and a Stafne defect. The Stafne defect also tends to not increase in size or change in radiographic appearance over time (hence the term [...] "static bone cyst"), and this can be used to help confirm the diagnosis. Tissue biopsy is not usually indicated, but if carried out, the histopathologic appearance is usually normal salivary gland tissue. Sometimes attempted biopsy of Stafne defects reveals an empty cavity (possibly because the gland was displaced at the time of biopsy), or other contents such as blood vessels, fat, lymphoid or connective tissues. Defects of the anterior lingual mandible may require biopsy for correct diagnosis at this unusual location. The radiolucent defect here may be superimposed on the lower anterior teeth and be mistaken for an odontogenic lesion. Sometimes the defect may interrupt the contour of the lower border of the mandible, and may be palpable. Sialography may be sometimes used to help demonstrate the salivary gland tissue within the bone.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The study included 270 individuals, averaging between 17 years and 25 years of age from out-patient department of New Horizon Dental College and Hospital, Sakri, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India, for third molar surgery. Panoramic and hand wrist radiographs were taken, the films were digitally processed for visualization of the wisdom teeth. The confirmations of ages were repeated again at an interval of 4 weeks by a radiologist. The extracted wisdom teeth were placed in 10 % formalin and were examined by one dental surgeon to estimate the age on the basis of root formation. Student′s t-test was adopted for statistical analysis and probability (P value) was calculated. Conclusion: Estimating the age of an individual was accurate by examining extracted third molar.

40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{diagnostic}} assessments of anterior tooth and bone status in a randomised cohort of pre-orthodontic patients using panoramic and periapical radiographs. METHOD: Four hundred and forty-four cases with matched periapical and panoramic radiographs were examined by three observers. Two were final-year postgraduate endodontic students and the other, a final-year Honours degree dental student. Multirater Kappa values were used to assess the reliability of the observers, with a value of 1 equating to complete agreement. RESULTS: With the exception of endodontic Class 1 and 2 palatal invaginations, reliability exceeded 0. 95 for all three observers. An assessment of the graduate endodontic students revealed only a marginal increase in the kappa values. Statistical analysis (p < 0. 05) determined that developmental anomalies or tooth/bone pathoses were more reliably detected by observers using periapical radiographs compared with panoramic films. This finding has relevance given the likelihood of anterior dental trauma among young children. CONCLUSION: While there have been considerable improvements in the quality of <b>dental</b> panoramic <b>radiography,</b> the present study indicated that a reliable pre-orthodontic or post-trauma diagnostic assessment should include both panoramic and intra-oral radiographs.
