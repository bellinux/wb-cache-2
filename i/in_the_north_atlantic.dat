5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain why the {{albatrosses}} became extinct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period {{are thought to have}} submerged the site of a short-tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed albatross, returned to gannet colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed.|$|E

25|$|If a small, {{discrete}} stock had existed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Biscay, then localized hunting by the Basques {{may have led}} to its over-exploitation and subsequent (near) disappearance there.

5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black dogfish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same species. A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E

40|$|Many {{models of}} the {{large-scale}} thermohaline circulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean exhibit strong zonally integrated upwelling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midlatitude <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> that significantly decreases the amount of deep water that is carried from <b>the</b> formation regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subpolar <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> toward low latitudes and across <b>the</b> equator. <b>In</b> an analysis of results from the Community Modeling Effort using a suite of models with different horizontal resolution, wind and thermohaline forcing, and mixing parameters, it is shown that the upwelling is always concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western boundary layer between roughly 30 ° and 40 °N. The vertical transport across 1000 m appears {{to be controlled by}} local dynamics and strongly depends on the horizontal resolution and mixing parameters of the model. It is suggested that in models with a realistic deep-water formation rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subpolar <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>the</b> excessive upwelling can be considered as the prime reason for the typically too low meridional overturning rates and northward heat transports <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> A new isopycnal advection and mixing parameterization of tracer transports by mesoscale eddies yield substantial improvements in these integral measures of the circulation...|$|R
