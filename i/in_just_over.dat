5|$|After having {{limited success}} on the {{previous}} two tours of England, Davidson took 23 wickets at 24.87 in 1961 as Australia prevailed 2–1. He took 5/42 in the Second Test at Lord's and then hit a counter-attacking 77 not out in the Fourth Test after the hosts looked set to take the series lead.

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>over</b> twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E

In four starts with the Bears, Richard threw three shutouts and pitched 33 scoreless innings with a 4–0 record and 26strikeouts. He was called back into the majors on July 13 and stayed with the Astros {{for the remainder of the}} season. He first pitched 14innings of baseball in six relief appearances before being placed on the starting rotation. He then started in all nine of the games he pitched during the remainder of the season.

At 17years old, he was the youngest player in the American League in the 1945 season before being optioned back to Buffalo, where on June 20 he threw seven no-hit innings, facing only 22 batters in the process, but lost the game 2–0 in extra innings. He also appeared in 13 games as a relief pitcher, and finished his minor league season with no wins, two losses and an ERA of 5.33 <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>over</b> 25 innings pitched. He {{was not on the}} active roster, and as a result did not pitch during the Tigers' World Series victory over the Chicago Cubs.|$|E
5|$|Europa orbits Jupiter <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>over</b> {{three and}} a half days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900km. With an {{eccentricity}} of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is the line intersecting this point. Research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.|$|E
