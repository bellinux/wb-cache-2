The calculator sits on top of the base of this charging station and can be used while charging; it can also be locked into the station for extra stability. An adapter for using 12-volt DC automobile power was also available.|$|R

50|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being <b>power</b> <b>plug,</b> electric plug, and plug top. The normal technical term for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical common use {{a number of other}} terms are used. The general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including <b>power</b> point, <b>plug</b> socket,wall socket, and wall plug.Modern British sockets for domestic use are normally manufactured as single or double units with an integral face plate and are designed to fit standard mounting boxes.|$|R
