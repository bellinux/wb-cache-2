25|$|Currently, three {{variations}} of clutch installation are used. The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches {{shared the same}} plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> along the same centre line as the engine crankshaft; when viewed head-on {{along the length of}} the <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.|$|E
25|$|Innovative hollow double-gear <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> allows quick shifts. The DCT {{is made up}} of two dry clutches, each {{fitted with}} {{electric}} motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.|$|E
25|$|A later {{variation}} uses {{two separate}} but identically sized clutches. These are arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along {{the length of}} the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and crankshaft centre line), and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly. This latter clutch arrangement (unlike the other two variations) is driven by a gear from the engine crankshaft.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} analytical, simulation, {{and practical}} analyses of a variable speed magnetic gearbox (MG) that uses contra-rotating (CR) <b>input</b> <b>shafts.</b> The CR turbine comprises {{two sets of}} rotors one behind the other: one rotor rotates in a clockwise direction while the other rotor rotates in an anticlockwise direction. Our magnetic gear magnetically combines the two CR <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> into a single variable speed output shaft, and consists of three rotating parts: two contra-rotating low-speed <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> and a single high-speed output shaft. Theoretical analysis is presented to show how to control {{the speed of the}} output shaft via control of the speeds of the two <b>input</b> <b>shafts.</b> This analysis is then supported by simulation and experimentation. The paper discusses the MG torque transmission capability by presenting pull-out torque test results and efficiency information when being driven through the different load torque shafts. The effective ratio of the MG is explained in terms of its torque curve result. A prototype gearbox was built, having been designed with an electromagnetic finite-element software package, and evaluated using a practical test rig...|$|R

Then the oscillatory rotation of the <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> occurs. Two ratchet wheels and driving pulleys are used to convert these oscillatory rotations to the unidirectional rotation output shaft, which is then geared up to drive the SRG.|$|R
25|$|Polytropic - This model {{takes into}} account both a rise in {{temperature}} in the gas {{as well as some}} loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of n will be between 1 and k.|$|E
25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are reports}} of a {{modified}} version known as NP-231J HD which was supposedly (SP) a [...] "heavy duty" [...] version for the Jeep Grand Cherokee with V8 engines. The NP/NV-231 case is a chain-driven unit that takes 21- or 23-spline <b>input</b> <b>shafts.</b> The 23-spline was for the AX-15 transmission, and the 21-spline {{was used for the}} AX-5 and BA 10/5 transmissions.

5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} velocity joint (TCVJ), {{also known as a}} Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the <b>input</b> and output <b>shafts</b> aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the <b>input</b> and output <b>shafts</b> and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain {{constant velocity}} for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the <b>input</b> and output <b>shafts</b> is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{had four}} main engines.

One-way clutches prevented rotation of the <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> when the couplings were drained.

2500|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. [...] The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. [...] After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|E

2500|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the longitudinal}} <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> (or prop shaft) to the pinion, which in turn drives the transverse ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an axle housing, or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the engine crankshaft and the gearbox shafts transverse, and with the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel. A differential consists of one input, the drive shaft, and two outputs which are the two drive wheels, however the rotation of the drive wheels are coupled to each other by their connection to the roadway. [...] Under normal conditions, with small tire slip, the ratio of the speeds of the two driving wheels is defined by the ratio of the radii of the paths around which the two wheels are rolling, which in turn is determined by the track-width of the vehicle (the distance between the driving wheels) and the radius of the turn.|$|E

50|$|For the Mondial t, {{the engine}} and {{transmission}} were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted {{to the rear of}} the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari's 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.|$|R
5000|$|For 1967, the Mk.II's were {{upgraded}} to [...] "B" [...] spec; they had re-designed bodywork and twin carburetors {{for an additional}} 15 hp.

The Mk.IIB's were also used for Sebring and Le Mans that year, and also it won the Reims 12 Hours in France. For the Daytona 24 Hours, two Mk II models (chassis 1016 and 1047) had their engines re-badged as Mercury engines.
