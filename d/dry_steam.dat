5|$|In the 20th century, {{demand for}} {{electricity}} {{led to the}} consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the same Larderello <b>dry</b> <b>steam</b> field where geothermal acid extraction began. It successfully lit four light bulbs. Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power plant was built there. It was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until New Zealand built a plant in 1958. In 2012, it produced some 594 megawatts.|$|E

50|$|Supercritical <b>drying</b> (superheated <b>steam</b> <b>drying)</b> {{involves}} <b>steam</b> <b>drying</b> {{of products}} containing water. This process is feasible because {{water in the}} product is boiled off, and joined with the drying medium, increasing its flow. It is usually employed in closed circuit and allows a proportion of latent heat to be recovered by recompression, a feature which is not possible with conventional air drying, for instance. The process has potential for use in foods if carried out at reduced pressure, to lower the boiling point.|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} the Normand gave a {{particularly}} large heating area (tube surface area) {{in relation to the}} grate area. The cost of this was a dense nest of tubes, where each of the numerous rows of tubes was bent into a different and complex shape. Tube ends entered the cylindrical drums perpendicularly, for good sealing. The space needed for all these tubes filled the entire lower half of the steam drum, requiring both a large drum and a separate steam dome from which to collect <b>dry</b> <b>steam.</b> The external boiler casing entered the flue uptake at one end, usually enclosing this dome. The ends of the drums extended outside the casing as hemispherical domes. Cold downcomers outside the casing linked these drums, providing a path for the return circulation of cold water.|$|E
25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The <b>dry</b> <b>steam</b> then flows into the superheater coils.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{superheated}} <b>steam</b> <b>drying</b> {{were determined}} for surface properties and pore structure of paper, properties which {{are important in}} the end use of paper. Two furnishes were investigated, thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and a TMP/kraft pulp blend. Drying of handsheets under matched conditions in air {{was used as the}} basis of comparison. TMP paper <b>dried</b> in superheated <b>steam</b> has a slightly higher surface roughness, by about 0. 5 $ mu$m at a roughness around 8 $ mu$m. This difference decreases with drying fluid temperature. It is also reduced by about half after a very light blade coating. Surface roughness of paper from 50 / 50 TMP/kraft blend is unaffected. Superheated <b>steam</b> <b>drying</b> reduces substantially the linting propensity of TMP paper, by about 30 %- 60 % depending on the criteria used. Improved lignin softening by higher web temperature from the beginning of <b>drying</b> in superheated <b>steam</b> <b>drying</b> is believed an important mechanism in improving bonding of surface fines and short fibre fragments. The Z-direction bond strength of TMP paper after surface treatment with water is about 20 % higher for sheets <b>dried</b> in <b>steam.</b> Time for water absorption is 100 %- 150 % longer for superheated <b>steam</b> <b>dried</b> TMP paper and contact angle of water is also substantially increased. Superheated <b>steam</b> <b>drying</b> substantially reduces the volume of micropores of diameter 0. 2 - 0. 6 $ mu$m while having no significant effect on larger pores. Thus superheated <b>steam</b> <b>drying</b> affects only the pore structure of the micronetwork.

6000|$|... 1336. With {{regard to}} the {{possession}} by the gases of any conducting power of the simple kind now under consideration, the question {{is a very difficult}} one to determine at present. Experiments seem to indicate that they do insulate certain low degrees of tension perfectly, and that the effects which may have appeared to be occasioned by conduction have been the result of the carrying power of the charged particles, either of the air or of dust, in it. It is equally certain, however, that with higher degrees of tension or charge the particles discharge to one another, and that is conduction. If the gases possess the power of insulating a certain low degree of tension continuously and perfectly, such a result may be due to their peculiar physical state, and the condition of separation under which their particles are placed. But in that, or in any case, we must not forget the fine experiments of Cagniard de la Tour[A], in which he has shown that liquids and their vapours can be made to pass gradually into each other, to the entire removal of any marked distinction of the two states. Thus, hot <b>dry</b> <b>steam</b> and cold water pass by insensible gradations into each other; yet the one is amongst the gases as an insulator, and the other a comparatively good conductor. As to conducting power, therefore, the transition from metals even up to gases is gradual; substances make but one series in this respect, and the various cases must come under one condition and law (444.). The specific differences of bodies as to conducting power only serves to strengthen the general argument, that conduction, like insulation, is a result of induction, and is an action of contiguous particles.|$|E

Many researchers have claimed that superheated <b>steam</b> <b>drying</b> is saving energy and produces better product quality compared to air <b>drying.</b> Superheated <b>steam</b> can be distinguished from air drying by the diffusion step in the <b>drying</b> process. <b>Steam</b> <b>drying</b> does not include moisture diffusion from {{the interior of the}} particle to its surface.

This paper is presenting a review to the models have been used to describe <b>drying</b> under superheated <b>steam.</b> Also, modelling was carried out to all the steps that take place in the drying process. These steps are: initial condensation {{on the surface of the}} particle, diffusion of the initially condensed vapour to the interior of the particle, evaporation of the initially condensed vapour and finally drying of the whole particle due to receding core model. Understanding these steps is very important for controlling the quality of the dried products and preventing difficulties such as sticking. These steps were modelled using MATLAB software. Numerical solutions with finite difference Euler’s method were used to solve the equations describe the drying steps. The theoretical results were then formulated in figures to show the behaviour of the whole drying process.

Five types of drying methods were used: microwave <b>drying,</b> <b>steam</b> injection <b>drying,</b> and three combinations of microwave heating and <b>steam</b> injection <b>drying.</b> <b>Steam</b> injection <b>drying</b> was conducted by injecting superheated steam of 120  °C through a perforated plate heated to 140  °C of an injection press.
