40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: species of kin Bidens L. : Bidens cernua L. and B. tripartita L. The {{purpose of the}} work: to reveal the {{specificity}} of the population behaviour of two close-affines species, and to state {{the differences in the}} strategy of its life cycle. For the first time, the peculiarities of the population life of the two long-sprout tickseed species have been described, the connection betwwen the architecture and plasticity, and the life state of the both species has been studied. The investigation data essentially add to th representation about the biology of the species of the tickseed. The results of the work can be used in compiling the reference books, textbooks in the Higher Courses of the ecology and morphology of plants, and in the study-field practics. The theoretical materials of the investigation will by included in a special course of the Botany. The data on the architecture and <b>heterotherapy</b> can be used in practical botany studies. The field of application: the population biology, the morphology of plant the carpologyAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
