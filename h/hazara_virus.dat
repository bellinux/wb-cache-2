Ehrlich ascitic tumor was compared with sarcoma 180 as a source of antigens; although sarcoma 180 showed many advantages over Ehrlich tumor, the latter gave, in general, better results for complement-fixing antigens. Oncolytic effect with complete recovery of the mice was observed in some instances. The highest recovery rate resulted with Congo and UNA viruses (40 %), and the second highest rate resulted with dengue 2, St. Louis, <b>Hazara,</b> and Uukuniemi <b>viruses</b> (20 %).

50|$|In 1954 the <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus,</b> {{one of the}} 34 tick borne viruses of {{the genus}} Nairovirus, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in the Ixodes tick native to that region.

50|$|This {{finding is}} {{particularly}} important because using the <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> (biosafety level 2) as a model allows scientists to investigate this serogroup of viruses {{for the development of}} antivirals, without having to work in a biosafety level 4 environment, which is the highest available level of biosecurity, and is mandatory when working with intact CCHFV. While CCHFV is the most important human pathogen in this serogroup, Hazara research is potentially useful in the development of antiviral medications for all viruses in the genus Nairovirus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae viruses, which are a family of enveloped negative-stranded RNA viruses with a genome split into three parts - Small (S), Middle (M) and Large (L). The L RNA segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} (L protein), the M RNA segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gc and Gn), and the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N). The three genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein in the form of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The N protein is the most abundant viral protein in Bunyaviridae virus particles and infected cells and, therefore, the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics.|$|E

We thus investigated whether and how virus affects migration of human epithelial cells and specifically how the nucleocapsid protein (N) modulates the cellular proteome and interactome using human Caco- 2 cells in a wound-healing assay with <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> as a model. Here, <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> blocked cell migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner, disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and specifically reduced {{the expression of the}} IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP 1) and water channel aquaporin 6 (AQP 6) that regulate cytoskeletal organization, water homeostasis and vesicle communication. Moreover, in the Caco- 2 cell proteome, we identified several distinct groups of molecules associating with N upon <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> infection, being involved in the ensemble of important cellular processes, e. g., chaperone activity, metabolism, cellular defense against infections, cell morphology, and migration. These events do not only facilitate the virus life cycle, but they are also crucial for membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics, cellular self-renewal and wound healing, being so essential for body integrity and homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Background: The genus Nairovirus in {{the family}} Bunyaviridae {{contains}} 34 tick-borne viruses classified into seven serogroups. <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> (HAZV) belongs to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) serogroup that also includes CCHF virus (CCHFV) a major pathogen for humans. HAZV is an interesting model to study CCHFV due to a close serological and phylogenetical relationship and a classification which allows handling in a BSL 2 laboratory. Nairoviruses are characterized by a tripartite negative-sense single stranded RNA genome (named L, M and S segments) that encode the RNA polymerase, the Gn-Gc glycoproteins and the nucleoprotein (NP), respectively. Currently, there are neither vaccines nor effective therapies {{for the treatment of}} any bunyavirus infection in humans. In this study we report, for the first time, the use of RNA interference (RNAi) as an approach to inhibit nairovirus replication. Results: Chemically synthesized siRNAs were designed to target the mRNA produced by the three genomic segments. We first demonstrated that the siRNAs targeting the NP mRNA displayed a stronger antiviral effect than those complementary to the L and M transcripts in A 549 cells. We further characterized the two most efficient siRNAs showing, that the induced inhibition is specific and associated with a decrease in NP synthesis during HAZV infection. Furthermore, both siRNAs depicted an antiviral activity when used before and after HAZV infection. We next showed that HAZV was sensitive to ribavirin which is also known to inhibit CCHFV. Finally, we demonstrated the additive or synergistic antiviral effect of siRNAs used in combination with ribavirin. Conclusions: Our study highlights the interest of using RNAi (alone or in combination with ribavirin) to treat nairovirus infection. This approach has to be considered for the development of future antiviral compounds targeting CCHFV, the most pathogenic nairovirus.

40|$|AbstractNairobi {{sheep disease}} (NSD) virus is the {{prototype}} of the tick-borne NSD serogroup, genus Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae. It is highly pathogenic for sheep and goats, causes disease in humans, and is widespread throughout East Africa. Ganjam virus has caused disease in goats and humans in India. Due to their occurrence on different continents and association with different ticks, these viruses were considered distinct despite serologic cross-reactivity. Their S RNA genome segments and encoded nucleocapsid proteins {{were found to be}} 1590 nucleotides and 482 amino acids in length and differed by only 10 and 3 % at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Genetic and serologic data demonstrate that Ganjam virus is an Asian variant of NSD virus.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{successful}} {{infection of the}} cell line ISE 6 derived from Ixodes scapularis tick embryos by the tick-borne <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> (HAZV), a nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. Using a recombinant Semliki Forest alphavirus replicon that replicates in these cells, {{we were able to}} inhibit replication of HAZV, and we showed that this blockage is mediated by the replication of the Semliki Forest alphavirus replicon; the vector containing the HAZV nucleoprotein gene in sense or antisense orientation efficiently inhibited HAZV replication. Moreover, expression of a distantly related nucleoprotein gene from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever nairovirus failed to induce HAZV silencing, indicating that the inhibition is sequence specific. The resistance of these cells to replicate HAZV correlated with the detection of specific RNase activity and 21 - to 24 -nucleotide-long small interfering RNAs. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that pathogen-derived resistance can be established in the tick cells via a mechanism of RNA interference...|$|E

Currently, no standardized testing method for ERVEV exists and only a small partial sequence of the polymerase gene is available. Here, we present the first complete genome sequence of ERVEV S, M, and L segments. Phylogenetic comparison of the amino acid sequence of the L-protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) revealed only 48 % homology to available L-protein sequences of other Nairoviruses like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus, <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus,</b> Kupe virus, and Dugbe virus. Among themselves, these Nairoviruses show 62 - 89 % homology in the L-protein sequences. Therefore, ERVEV seems to be only distantly related to other Nairoviruses.

Recombinant antigens were examined for their potential as nonhazardous diagnostic reagents. The nucleocapsid (N) gene of the Greek AP 92 isolate of CCHF virus was sequenced from cloned PCR products and the open reading frame was identified by homology to the N protein of a Chinese isolate of CCHF virus. The N protein was expressed to high levels in a baculovirus expression system. Three N protein-derived peptides were expressed in Eseherichia coli as fusions with glutathione S-transferase and the antigenicities of these proteins and the baculovirus-expressed protein were tested by ELISA. When tested with laboratory animal sera representing all seven serogroups of nairoviruses, the only reactive sera were those raised to CCHF virus (Greek, Nigerian and Chinese isolates) and, more weakly, <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus.</b> When tested with a panel of known positive and negative human sera, the baculovirus-expressed N protein, and the peptide derived from the central region of the N protein, proved to be the best for identifying CCHF virus-specific IgG...|$|E

A flavivirus, an orbivirus, a phlebovirus, and a nairovirus were isolated from these ticks and partial sequences obtained. The flavivirus was nearly identical to Gadgets Gully virus, isolated some 30 year previously, illustrating the remarkable genetic stability of this virus. The nearest relative to the orbivirus (for which we propose the name Sandy Bay virus) was the Scottish Broadhaven virus, and provided only the second available sequences from the Great Island orbivirus serogroup.

In this study, we established an in vitro model based on human polarized cell line in order to better characterize the mechanisms behind the molecular pathogenesis of CCHFV.

We found that HAZV and CCHFV, although closely related, are different in their preference on site of entry, suggesting that CCHFV cell receptor(s) is(are) different to HAZV one(s) and may partially explain the difference of pathogenesis between the two viruses.

40|$|Background: Crimean-Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} (CCHF) is a {{zoonotic}} viral disease that is asymptomatic in infected animals, but {{a serious threat}} to humans. Human infections begin with nonspecific febrile symptoms that progress to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome with a high case fatality rate. CCHF virus (CCHFV) is classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen and is the second most widespread medically important arbovirus after dengue virus. CCHFV has been found in at least 31 species of ticks; in particular, members of the genus Hyalomma seem to be the principal vectors as they play an important role as a natural reservoir. Methods: The susceptibility of two Hyalomma anatolicum-derived cell lines to infection with CCHFV and <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> (HAZV), an apathogenic virus closely related to CCHFV, was investigated by classical and molecular techniques in order to compare CCHFV and HAZV virus/host interactions in the context of arthropod cells. Results and conclusion: Our results showed that CCHFV and HAZV chronically infected tick cells without any cytopathic effect. Infected cells released viral particles to supernatant for at least 200 days post infection. Although both cell lines have the same susceptibility to CCHFV and HAZV, in the case of HAZV infection we observed strong differences in the kinetics of viral progeny release in the early stages. Currently, a transcriptomics approach is being used to study the cellular response to nairovirus infection...|$|E
40|$|Bunyaviruses are {{considered}} to be emerging pathogens facilitated by the segmented nature of their genome that allows reassortment between different species to generate novel viruses with altered pathogenicity. Bunyaviruses are transmitted via a diverse range of arthropod vectors, as well as rodents, and have established a global disease range with massive importance in healthcare, animal welfare and economics. There are no vaccines or anti-viral therapies available to treat human bunyavirus infections and so development of new anti-viral strategies is urgently required. Bunyamwera virus (BUNV; genus Orthobunyavirus) is the model bunyavirus, sharing aspects of its molecular and cellular biology with all Bunyaviridae family members. Here, we show {{for the first time that}} BUNV activates and requires cellular potassium (K+) channels to infect cells. Time of addition assays using K+ channel modulating agents demonstrated that K+ channel function is critical to events shortly after virus entry but prior to viral RNA synthesis/replication. A similar K+ channel dependence was identified for other bunyaviruses namely Schmallenberg virus (Orthobunyavirus) as well as the more distantly related <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> (Nairovirus). Using a rational pharmacological screening regimen, twin-pore domain K+ channels (K 2 P) were identified as the K+ channel family mediating BUNV K+ channel dependence. As several K 2 P channel modulators are currently in clinical use, our work suggests they may represent a new and safe drug class for the treatment of potentially lethal bunyavirus disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> (HAZV) is {{a member}} of the Bunyaviridae family of {{segmented}} negative stranded RNA viruses, and shares the same serogroup as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). CCHFV is responsible for fatal human disease with a mortality rate approaching 30 %, which has an increased recent incidence within southern Europe. There are no preventative or therapeutic treatments for CCHFV-mediated disease, and thus CCHFV is classified as a hazard group 4 pathogen. In contrast HAZV is not associated with serious human disease, although infection of interferon receptor knockout mice with either CCHFV or HAZV results in similar disease progression. To characterise further similarities between HAZV and CCHFV, and support the use of HAZV as a model for CCHFV infection, we investigated the structure of the HAZV nucleocapsid protein (N) and compared it to CCHFV N. N performs an essential role in the viral life cycle by encapsidating the viral RNA genome, and thus, N represents a potential therapeutic target. Results: We present the purification, crystallisation and crystal structure of HAZV N at 2. 7 Å resolution. HAZV N was expressed as an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein then purified using glutathione affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography. HAZV N crystallised in the P 212121 space group with unit cell parameters a = 64. 99, b = 76. 10, and c = 449. 28 Å. HAZV N consists of a globular domain formed mostly o...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} described isolation and preliminary identifi cation of a virus related to Dugbe virus (DUGV), family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. Six isolates {{of the virus}} were obtained from pools of Amblyomma gemma and Rhipicephalus pulchellus ticks collected from hides of cattle in Nairobi, Kenya, in October 1999. We report results of further characterization of this virus, including growth kinetics in cell culture and full-length genome sequencing and genetic characterization, which show it to be distinct from DUGV. We suggest {{that this is a}} new virus in the family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus, and we propose that it be designated Kupe virus. The genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae comprises 7 species groups containing primarily tick-borne viruses, some of which have been identified as human or animal pathogens. The genome of the nairoviruses consists of 3 segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA, small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the nucleocapsid protein, glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and viral polymerase, respectively. Additionally, an M segment– encoded nonstructural protein, NS, was recently identified M in the nairovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) (1). In recent years, nucleotide and amino acid sequence information has become available so that additional characterization of these viruses is possible, including further analysis of relationships among members of the genus.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{eukaryotic}} cells {{to change their}} shape and to migrate directionally is highly dependent on active volume regulation in cells building up tissues {{as well as in}} individual cells. Transmembrane fluxes of water via specialized water channels, called aquaporins (AQPs), facilitate the changes of volume and shape, which additionally require a complex interplay between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. AQPs {{have been shown to be}} involved in the development of inflammatory processes and diseases. The aims of the studies underlying this thesis were to further elucidate the expression and function of AQPs in both bacterial and viral infections as well as in the inflammatory disease, microscopic colitis. For this, molecular techniques qPCR, immunoblotting and live, holographic, confocal and super-resolution imaging were used. When cells of the innate immune system encounter pathogens they need to respond and prepare for migration and phagocytosis and do so through volume regulatory processes. The Gramnegative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes a small molecule-based communication system, called quorum sensing (QS) to control the production of its virulence factors and biofilms. We found that P. aeruginosa with a complete QS system elicits a stronger phagocytic response in human blood-derived macrophages compared to its lasI-/rhlI- mutant lacking the production of the QS molecules N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C 4 -HSL) and N- 3 -oxododecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3 O-C 12 -HSL). Infection with P. aeruginosa further increases the expression of AQP 9 and induces re-localisation of AQP 9 to the front and trailing ends of macrophages. Moreover, the 3 O-C 12 -HSL alone elevates the expression of AQP 9, redistribute the water channel to the front and rear ends and increases the cell area and volume of macrophages. Both infection with the wild type P. aeruginosa and the treatment with 3 OC 12 -HSL change the nano-structural architecture of the AQP 9 distribution in macrophages. Viruses use the intracellular machinery of the invaded cells to produce and assemble new viral bodies. Intracellular AQPs are localised in a membranes of cellular organelles to regulate their function and morphology. C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 fibroblasts transiently expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) -AQP 6 show a reduced expression of AQP 6 after <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> infection and an increased cell area. Overexpressing AQP 6 in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells reduces the infectivity of <b>Hazara</b> <b>virus</b> indicating that AQP 6 expression has a protective role in virus infections. Ion and water channels in the epithelial cell lining tightly regulate the water homeostasis. In microscopic colitis (MC), patients suffer from severe watery diarrhoeas. For the first time, we have shown that the expression of AQP 1, 8 and 11 and the sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHE 1 are reduced in colonic biopsies from MC patients compared to healthy control individuals. Following treatment with the glucocorticoid budesonide the patients experienced a rapid recovery and we observed a restored or increased expression of the AQPs and NHE 1 during treatment, suggesting a role for AQPs in the diarrhoeal mechanisms in MC. Taken together, this thesis provides new evidence on the importance of water homeostasis regulation through AQPs during infections and inflammation and opens up a door for further investigations of roles for AQPs in inflammatory processes...|$|E

In order to investigate further similarities between HAZV and CCHFV, and to {{support the use of}} HAZV as a model for CCHFV infection, various structural and cell biological aspects of the CCHFV and HAZV replication cycle were investigated. We present the X-ray crystal structure of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of HAZV at a resolution of 2. 7 Å, and the crystal structure of RNA-bound HAZV N at a resolution of 3 Å. HAZV N had a highly similar overall structure to CCHFV N, consisting of a globular domain containing amino acid residues from both the N and the C-termini, and an extended arm domain. A crevice within the globular domain of HAZV N had 3 nucleotides of RNA bound, in the RNA-bound HAZV N structure. RNA binding is a crucial function of HAZV N and CCHFV N, and the identification of an RNA binding site in HAZV N provides a model for the structure guided design of anti-virals to disrupt this interaction. Cellular heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) was found to be an interacting partner of the N protein of CCHFV and HAZV, both in cells and in secreted HAZV particles. The functional role of this interacting partner within the HAZV replication cycle was investigated using siRNA knock down and small molecule inhibitors of endogenous HSP 70. HAZV induced apoptosis in SW 13 cells, and HAZV N was cleaved during a 72 hr time course of infection.
