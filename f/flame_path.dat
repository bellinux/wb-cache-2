50|$|Burning wood {{not only}} {{produces}} heat {{of up to}} 1400°C (2,500 °F), it also produces fly ash and volatile salts. Wood ash settles on the pieces during the firing, and the complex interaction between flame, ash, and the minerals of the clay body forms a natural ash glaze. This glaze may show great variation in color, texture, and thickness, ranging from smooth and glossy to rough and sharp. The placement of pieces within the kiln distinctly affects the pottery's appearance, as pieces closer to the firebox may receive heavy coats of ash, or even be immersed in embers, while others deeper in the kiln may only be softly touched by ash effects. Other factors that depend on the location include temperature and oxidation/reduction. Besides location in the kiln, (as with other fuel-fired updraft kilns) the way pieces are placed near each other affects the <b>flame</b> <b>path,</b> and, thus, the appearance of pieces within localized zones of the kiln can vary as well. It is said that loading an anagama kiln {{is the most difficult}} part of the firing.

50|$|The engine's design {{allowed a}} more central {{location}} for the spark plugs to provide a better <b>flame</b> <b>path,</b> large ports for improved gas flow and hemispherical combustion chambers that in turn allowed increased power. Additionally, the sleeve valves required very much less maintenance than poppet valves which needed adjustment, grinding and even replacement {{after only a few}} thousand miles. However, the adiabatic and isothermal characteristics accompanying the increased power afforded by the large (relative to contemporary poppet valve designs) port areas in the sleeves proved the double-sleeve valve concept's Achilles heel. Much of the advantage to be gained from increased volumetric efficiency could not be realised due to the inability to transfer resultant heat in a sufficiently steep gradient to avoid excessive internal temperatures. As a consequence of these thermal conditions and contrary to conventional practice, the induction port area was reduced to substantially less than that of the exhaust port. Later engines having thinner, steel and white-metal coated sleeves possessed improved levels of heat dissipation but thermal transfer problems were to remain characteristic of the design, thus limiting development of the potential inherent in the double-sleeve valve engine.|$|E
5000|$|During the Space Shuttle design process, a McDonnell Douglas {{report in}} September 1971 {{discussed}} the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that [...] "if burnthrough occurs adjacent to hydrogen/oxygen tank or orbiter, timely sensing {{may not be}} feasible and abort not possible", accurately foreshadowing the Challenger accident. Morton Thiokol was the contractor responsible for the construction and maintenance of the shuttle's SRBs. As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as [...] "joint rotation," [...] caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This {{made it possible for}} combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a <b>flame</b> <b>path</b> could develop, causing the joint to burst—which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.|$|E
5000|$|Rover used a more {{advanced}} form of IOE engine. It was designed by Jack Swain in the mid-late 1940s and was in production from 1948 to the early 1990s. Unlike the conventional F-head IOE, this had an efficient combustion chamber designed for good combustion, rather than simple manufacture. The top surface of the block was machined at an angle, with the piston crowns angled in a [...] "pitched roof" [...] to match. At TDC, the piston almost touched the angled inlet valve and provided good 'squish' to the combustion chamber itself, offset to the side by half a cylinder diameter. The resultant combustion chamber shape was a near-ideal hemisphere, although inverted and tilted from the usual [...] "hemi-head" [...] design. The spark plug was centrally mounted and this, together with the turbulence generated by the squish, provided a short <b>flame</b> <b>path.</b> The thinness of the gas layer between piston and inlet valve was so confined as {{to reduce the risk}} of detonation on poor fuel, one factor that kept it in service with Land Rover for so long. During the late 1940s and early 1950s when the only petrol available was low octane 'pool' petrol it also allowed Rover to run higher compression ratios than many competitors with the more usual side- or overhead valve designs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{arrangement is}} a single transfer and single exhaust port, opposite each other. This [...] "cross scavenging" [...] performs poorly, as there is tendency for the flow to pass from the inlet directly to the exhaust, wasting some of the fuel mixture and also poorly scavenging {{the upper part of}} the chamber. Before Schnuerle porting, a deflector on top of the piston was used to direct the gas flow from the transfer port upwards, in a U-shaped loop around the combustion chamber roof and then down and out through the exhaust port. Apart from the gas flow never quite following this ideal path and tending to mix instead, this also gave a poorly shaped combustion chamber with long, thin <b>flame</b> <b>paths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One {{solution}} to this for side-valve engines was to place a screwed plug directly above each valve, and to access the valves through this (illustrated). The tapered threads of the screwed plug provided a reliable seal. For low-powered engines this was a popular solution for some years. It was difficult to cool this plug, as the water jacket didn't extend into the plug. As performance increased, it also became important to have better combustion chamber designs with less [...] "dead space". One solution was to place the spark plug in the centre of this plug, which at least made use of the space. However this also placed the spark plug further away from the main combustion chamber, leading to long <b>flame</b> <b>paths</b> and slower ignition.|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} {{the presence}} of explosive gas atmospheres have to be specially designed to prevent them from igniting the explosive gas. Flameproof design implies that electrical components producing incendiary electrical sparks, e. g. relays and switches, be contained in enclosures that not only withstand the maximum pressure of an internal gas explosion. In addition any holes or slits in the enclosure wall have to be designed {{in such a way that}} they will not transmit a gas explosion inside the enclosure to an explosive gas atmosphere outside it. Designs of a variety of flameproof enclosure joints, including plane flanged joints, are specified in detail in international standards (IEC) requiring that the maximum permissible average roughness of any flame gap surface has to be < 6. 3 μm. The standards also require that any damaged joint surface has to be restored to the original quality prescribed in standards (IEC). However, the standards do not provide any guidance as to what level of damage is considered significant. As a result even minor mechanical or corrosive damage of <b>flame</b> <b>path</b> surfaces gives rise to expensive overhaul and repair of flame proof apparatuses. In fact, this is mandatory in spite of the fact that a generous safety factor is included in the requirements to maximum permissible gap widths. For example, for the plane-flange configuration and explosive gas (propane) used in the present investigation, the maximum permissible width in a practical apparatus is only 0. 4 mm, whereas the real limiting value is 0. 92 mm. The purpose of the present investigation has been to obtain some experimental guidance as to what level of damage of flame gap surfaces is required to significantly reduce the flame-proofing effect of flame gaps in flameproof electrical apparatuses. The maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of an explosive gas mixture is the largest gap width between the two parts of a circular plane joint of 25 mm breadth in a standardized test, which prevents transmission of a gas explosion on the inside of the gap to an outside explosive gas mixtures. Normally the purpose of MESG experiments is to compare MESGs of different gases and vapours, using the same smooth flame gap surface in all experiments. However, in the present investigation MESG has been used as a parameter for judging whether various kinds of significant damage of the gap surface had any noticeable effect on the ability of the flame gap to prevent flame transmission. A significant reduction of MESG compared with that obtained with a standard undamaged surface (standard roughness of < 6. 3 μm) would mean that the particular type of damage under test had destroyed the gap efficiency significantly. On the other hand a significant increase of MESG compared with that for the undamaged surface would mean the damage had in fact significantly increased the gap efficiency. In the experiments performed in the present work premixed 4. 2 vol. % propane in air was used as the test gas mixture in all the experiments. Two different apparatuses were used, viz. a plane circular-flange apparatus (PCFA) and a plane rectangular-slit apparatus (PRSA).

Under the same swirl intensity, two flames with different fuel jet velocity were investigated. The time-averaged flow field shows a unique flow pattern at the quarl exit, where two recirculation vortices are formed; a strong recirculation zone formed far from the quarl exit and a larger recirculation zone extending inside the quarl. However, the instantaneous images show that, the flow pattern near the quarl exit plays {{a vital role in}} the spatial location and structure of the reaction zone. In the low fuel jet velocity flame, a pair of vortical structures, located precisely at the corners of the quarl exit, cause the flame to roll up into the central region of low speed flow, where the flame sheet then tracks the axial velocity fluctuations. The vorticity field reveals a vortical structure surrounding the reaction zones, which reside on a layer of low compressive strain adjacent to that vortical structure. In the high fuel jet velocity flame, initially a laminar flame sheet resides at the inner shear layer of the main jet, along the interface between incoming fresh gas and high temperature recirculating gas. Further downstream, vortex breakdown alters the <b>flame</b> sheet <b>path</b> toward the central flame region.

Detailed kinetic mechanisms of methane oxidation consist of around 200 or more reactions and about 40 - 50 species. At the current moment CFD simulations {{with the use}} of detailed methane mechanisms can be performed only on supercomputers. However, detailed kinetic mechanisms can be reduced, taking the specifics of rocket combustion chambers. The aim of the present project is to develop a reduced kinetic mechanism of methane oxidation suitable for CFD simulations for rocket applications. The main objective of this thesis work will be a skeletal kinetic mechanism of methane oxidation which is optimized for rocket application. A full detailed methane kinetic mechanism was chosen and reduced to form a skeletal mechanism for rocket application. The resultant skeletal mechanism contains 23 species and 49 reactions and were validated with two separate set of experimental data of ignition delay time at pressure of 50 atm. It is also verified with ignition delay time and counterflow flame temperature profile at rocket condition with pressure of 60 bar. The resultant skeletal mechanism was created through the elimination of species and reactions that are not important to the prediction of ignition delay time and temperature in counterflow non-premixed <b>flame.</b> Reaction <b>path</b> analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to reduced the full mechanism. C 3, C 4 species were found to be insignificant for methane combustion in rocket condition. C 2 species and sub-mechanism were considered important to describe fuel rich methane combustion.

The ignition delay time and temperature profile predicted by the skeletal mechanism are within 5 % difference with values predicted by the full mechanism.

While {{particular}} mixtures have characteristic flame speeds, it has also been shown that in compositionally stratified mixtures, <b>flames</b> exhibit a <b>path</b> dependency, or memory effect. The goal of the experimental work presented in this thesis was to investigate the behavior of flame speed over step changes in equivalence ratios. This sharp stratification was achieved using a soap bubble blown {{at the center of a}} combustion bomb. A laser was used to ignite the mixture from the center. Flame speed was calculated from both a pressure trace analysis and from measuring the movement of the flame front through high speed Schlieren imaging. Both methods demonstrated good correlation with the literature for homogeneous charges. However, the analysis necessarily assumes a spherical flame, but the Schlieren video showed that the laser ignition system induced a significant protrusion in the flame front. This protrusion smooths the transition from the flame speed of the inner mixture to that of the outer. Therefore, it was demonstrated that this setup is not suitable for the measurement of flame speed transitional behavior over step-changes in equivalence ratio. by Caroline Sorensen. Thesis: S.

Much of the aromatics in diesel and gasoline are alkyl-benzene species. Although toluene, the lightest of the alkyl-benzenes, {{has been the}} subject of extensive literature investigations, very little experimental data are available for heavier alkyl-benzenes (9 – 20 carbon atoms) relevant to diesel fuel. In this work, the burning velocity of ethyl-, n-propyl-and n-butyl-benzenes were measured in a premixed flat-flame burner using the heat flux method. The burning velocities were measured as a function of the equivalence ratio at atmospheric pressure and for two unburned gas temperatures (358 and 398 K). These new experiments are compared with burning velocities for toluene previously measured by the authors. The comparisons showed that ethyl-benzene has the highest flame speed, followed by n-propyl-and n-butyl-benzenes which have similar burning velocities. Toluene has the lowest flame speed. Excellent agreement was observed between the new measurements and simulations using a mechanism for alkyl-benzenes recently published by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and National University of Ireland. Based on the strong correlation between experiments and calculations, different aspects contributing to the burning speed of the fuels (thermal effects, kinetics, …) were analyzed using the model. A sensitivity analysis was used to determine the reaction rate constants that are most important in determining the <b>flame</b> speed. Reaction <b>path</b> analysis and species profiles in the flame were used to identify the key reaction paths that lead to increase or decrease in the burning velocities. Contrary to what is generally observed for alkanes whose flame speed is controlled by small radical fragments, the flame speed of aromatics is influenced by fuel specific intermediates such as phenyl, benzyl, or even heavier species. The new experimental data and modeling insight generated by this work will support the development of models for heavier alkyl-aromatics of great relevance to diesel fuel...|$|R
40|$|Soot {{particles}} {{emitted from}} modern diesel engines, despite significantly lower total mass, show higher reactivity and toxicity than black-smoking old engines, which cause serious {{health and environmental}} issues. Soot nanostructure, i. e. the internal structure of soot particles composed of nanoscale carbon fringes, can provide useful information to {{the investigation of the}} particle reactivity and its oxidation status. This thesis presents the nanostructure details of soot particles sampled directly from diesel flames in a working diesel engine as well as from exhaust gases to compare the internal structure of soot particles in the high formation stage and after in-cylinder oxidation. Thermophoretic soot sampling was conducted using an in-house-designed probe with a lacy transmission electron microscope (TEM) grid stored at the tip. The soot particles deposited on the grid were imaged using a high-resolution TEM to obtain key nanostructure parameters such as carbon fringe length, tortuosity and fringe-to-fringe separation. The TEM images show that in-flame soot particles are consisted of multiple amorphous cores with many defective carbon fringes, which are surrounded by a more oriented and graphitised outer shell. The same core-shell structures are found in the exhaust soot particles, suggesting the overall shape developed within the diesel flame does not change during soot oxidation. However, the exhaust soot particles exhibit more oxidised and less reactive nanostructures as evidenced by the increased fringe length, reduced fringe tortuosity, and lower fringe separation distance. In investigating the in-cylinder particles, the effect of jet-jet interaction on soot nanostructure was considered as one of the major factors. This is because a wall-jet head merging with a neighbouring jet head, which always occurs in diesel engines, is well known to cause high soot formation due to locally rich mixtures. This topic was investigated by performing nanostructure analysis and corresponding morphology analysis of soot particles together with the assistance of planar laser-induced fluorescence of fuel and hydroxyl (fuel- and OH-PLIF) and incandescence of soot (soot-PLII). Since a conventional diesel flame produces a large amount of soot leading to significant beam attenuation to laser diagnostics, methyl decanoate was selected as a surrogate fuel due to its low-sooting propensity. Prior to investigate the effect of jet-jet interaction on soot particles, a direct comparison in soot nanostructure and corresponding morphology is conducted between methyl decanoate and conventional diesel in single jet configuration. The results show that methyl decanoate generates smaller soot primary particles and aggregates with lower fractal dimension, which could be explained either by the earlier stage of soot formation or more oxidised soot status. From the fringe separation results showing a smaller gap for methyl decanoate, it is concluded that the sampled in-flame soot particles were more oxidised likely due to the presence of oxidisers in fuel. As for studying the impact of jet-jet interaction, two different nozzle configurations of one hole and two holes were used to simulate isolated single-jet and double-jet conditions, respectively. These soot particles impacted by the jet-jet interaction have larger aggregates composed of larger primaries, and the nanoscale internal structures are very consistent previous observations to soot particles sampled from conventional diesel flame show higher carbon fringe-to-fringe separations, both of which indicate higher particle reactivity and the formation stage of soot. In the later stage of the PhD study, the existing in-flame soot sampling system that collects only the particles close to the cylinder liner wall, and thus has limitations in clarifying the particle evolution during the development of diesel flames was upgraded by successfully designing and implementing the innovative in-bowl sampling technique. Using the new method, the soot formation processes occurring inside the piston-bowl of a small-bore diesel engine were investigated by conducting the thermophoresis-based soot sampling experiments at various locations along the <b>flame</b> development <b>path.</b> Based on soot-PLII and OH-PLIF imaging performed in the same optical engine previously, it was understood that the sooting flame impinges on and then flows along the bowl wall, suggesting a soot growth and persistence near the fuel-rich wall region. For this study, soot sampling technique was further developed to place the sampling probe in five different locations including the flame-wall impingement point and four further downstream regions: two 60 degree and two 120 degree from the jet axis with two different distances from the bowl wall in each angle. The TEM images of the sampled soot particle aggregates and their statistical analysis of sizes and fractal dimensions show that precursor-like, small soot particles form in the flame-wall impingement region, which grow in size and become large soot aggregates as travelling along the bowl wall. During this particle growth, its internal pattern also changes such that an amorphous carbon layer structure becomes a typical core-shell structure. The detailed analysis clearly indicates that the soot precursors underwent the surface growth, aggregation and coagulation to produce large, long-stretched soot aggregates during which the amorphous soot carbon layers transformed into a typical core-shell structure. At further downstream locations, the continued surface growth increases the size of soot primary particles in the core region of the soot aggregates while the oxidation of the soot primary particles located in the outer region tends to reduce the aggregate size, resulting in more compact structures. In the outer region of the flame, the intensive soot oxidation induced by the hydroxyl attack further reduces the size of large soot aggregates and at the same time, eliminates the small soot aggregates. Throughout these soot formation/oxidation processes, the soot carbon layer gaps continue to decrease, indicating more mature soot primary particles...|$|R
