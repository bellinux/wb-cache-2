5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a <b>D-dimer</b> test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal <b>D-dimer</b> result can rule out a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a <b>D-dimer</b> test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a <b>D-dimer</b> level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal.

30|$|Fibrin(ogen) {{degradation}} products (FDPs) are heterogeneous small molecules {{generated by the}} action of plasmin on both fibrin network (secondary fibrinolysis) and fibrinogen (primary fibrinogenolysis). <b>D-dimers</b> (D-domain of two fibrin molecules stabilised by FXIIIa) are specific of fibrinolysis and must be preferred when available [125 – 127]. <b>D-dimers</b> sign thrombin generation, fibrin formation and polymerisation then fibrinolysis, while the absence of <b>D-dimers</b> could represent defective fibrinolysis despite the presence of fibrin. Other markers could be useful but are not available in routine laboratories: PAP (plasmin–antiplasmin complexes), tPA and PAI- 1 [128, 129]. Both tPA and PAI- 1 are dramatically increased during septic shock, regardless of DIC diagnosis. Early inhibition of fibrinolysis during sepsis-induced coagulopathy may cause diagnostic delay regarding the importance of FDPs in DIC diagnosis.|$|R

5|$|Individuals {{suspected}} of having DVT may be assessed using a clinical prediction rule such as the Wells score.

They delivered 34 males and 36 females healthy term newborns who underwent ultrasound evaluation of the anteroposterior infrarenal abdominal aorta diameter (APAO), biochemical profile (glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, and <b>D-dimers</b> homeostasis model assessment [HOMAIR]index), and biometric parameters. Results. APAO was related to newborn length (r=+ 0. 36; P= 0. 001), head circumference (r=+ 0. 37; P= 0. 001), gestational age (r=+ 0. 40, P= 0. 0005), HOMA index (r=+ 0. 24; P= 0. 04), and <b>D-dimers</b> (r=+ 0. 33, P= 0. 004).

40|$|AbstractObjective. To {{determine}} {{the concentration of}} selected haemostatic factors (HFs) : thrombin–antithrombin complexes (TAT), antithrombin (AT), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) and <b>D-dimers</b> in carotid bifurcation plaques and to compare plaque composition in different subgroups of patients (mainly those with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis). Materials and methods. Thirty-eight consecutive patients (20 symptomatic, 18 asymptomatic) undergoing carotid endarterectomy {{were enrolled in the}} study. The concentration of selected HFs in carotid plaques was measured using mainly enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Simultaneously, the concentration of HFs in plasma was also obtained. Results. Symptomatic plaques contained significantly more TAT complexes (p= 0. 03). AT was found only in nine out of 38 carotid plaques and was present mainly in symptomatic carotid plaques (n= 8 / 9) (p< 0. 006). No {{significant differences were found between}} symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques with respect to t-PA, PAI- 1 and <b>D-dimers</b> concentration. There was an increased concentration of TAT (p< 0. 001), t-PA (p< 0. 02) and <b>D-dimers</b> (p< 0. 02) in carotid plaques of diabetic patients. Patients with coexisting intermittent claudication had elevated levels of <b>D-dimers</b> in carotid plaques (p< 0. 02). The only positive correlation was demonstrated between the concentration of AT in plasma and carotid plaques (R= 0. 76; p= 0. 02). Conclusions. All the evaluated HFs are the components of a carotid plaque. Symptomatic patients have increased concentration of TAT complexes in a carotid plaque. The symptomatic carotid plaque contains AT more frequently, which correlates positively with AT plasma levels.

5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated <b>D-dimer</b> level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in the}} length of treatment.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated <b>D-dimer.</b> In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E

As fibrinolytic/endothelial cell function markers we evaluated plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 (PAI- 1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and <b>D-dimers,</b> and as inflammatory markers; C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble interleukin (IL) - 2 receptor (s-IL 2 R), IL- 6 and serum albumin levels. The study was performed in 50 CKD patients undergoing regular HD, 11 with a central venous dialysis catheter (CVC) and 39 with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), and in 25 healthy controls. Compared to controls, CKD patients presented with significantly higher levels of CRP, s-IL 2 R, IL- 6 and <b>D-dimers,</b> and significantly lower levels of PAI- 1. The tPA/PAI- 1 ratio was significantly higher in CKD patients. We also found statistical significant correlations in CKD patients between <b>D-dimers</b> levels and inflammatory markers: CRP, albumin, s-IL 2 R and IL- 6. When comparing the two groups of CKD patients, we found that those with a CVC presented statistically significant lower levels of hemoglobin concentration and albumin, and higher levels of CRP, IL- 6, <b>D-dimers</b> and tPA. Our results showed an association between fibrinolytic/endothelial cell function and increased inflammatory markers in CKD patients.

40|$|International audienceBackgroundIn {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} routine thromboprophylaxis is not recommended but individualized risk assessment is encouraged. The incorporation of hypercoagulability biomarkers could increase the sensitivity of risk assessment models (RAM) to identify patients at VTE risk. To this aim we investigated the impact of cancer-related characteristics on hypercoagulability biomarkers. MethodsThrombin generation (TG) assessed with the Thrombogramme-Thrombinoscope®, levels of platelet derived microparticles (Pd-MP) assessed with flow cytometry, procoagulant phospholid dependent clotting time (PPL-ct) measured with a clotting assay and <b>D-Dimers</b> (were assessed in a cohort of 62 women with breast cancer and in 30 age matched healthy women. ResultsPatients showed significantly higher TG, Pd-MP, <b>D-Dimers</b> levels and shortened PPL-ct compared to the controls. The PPL-ct was inversely correlated with the levels of Pd-MP, which were increased in 97 % of patients. TG and <b>D-Dimers</b> were increased in 76 % and 59 % of patients respectively. In any stage of the disease TG was significantly increased {{as compared to the}} controls. There was no significant difference of TG in patients with local, regional of metastatic stage. There {{was no significant difference in}} Pd-MP or Pd-MP/PS+ between the subgroups of patients with local or regional stage of cancer. Patients with metastatic disease had significantly higher levels of Pd-MP and Pd-MP/PS+ compared to those with regional stage. The <b>D-Dimers</b> increased in patients with metastatic stage. In patients on chemotherapy with less than 6 months since diagnosis TG was significantly higher compared to those on chemotherapy who diagnosed in interval > 6 months.

ConclusionIn {{breast cancer patients}} the stage, the time elapsed since the diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy are determinants of cellular and plasma hypercoagulability. The levels and the procoagulant activity of Pd-MP are interconnected with the biological activity and the overall burden of cancer.

However, systemic AT use {{is complicated by}} increased risk of bleeding (odds ratio 1, 7) and clinically important survival increase is seen only in the non-heparinized subgroup. Local (intra-abdominal) inhibition of coagulation with AT may be more effective. OBJECTIVES: To investigate effects of intra-abdominal high-dose recombinant human AT (rhAT) lavage on coagulation and inflammation in experimental polymicrobial sepsis. METHODS: Murine cecal ligation and puncture model was used with peritoneal lavage after 24 h, containing rhAT (3 IU mL- 1) or saline. Clotting time, thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), <b>D-dimers,</b> tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 assessed coagulation and fibrinolysis responses. Inflammation was assessed by keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), IL- 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leukocyte count, myeloperoxidase and bacterial load. RESULTS: rhAT lavage prolonged abdominal clotting times and reduced <b>D-dimers</b> and TAT levels, indicating inhibited abdominal coagulation. Pulmonary clotting time and <b>D-dimers</b> decreased towards normal by rhAT lavage. Abdominal fibrinolysis was reduced after rhAT lavage, as were abdominal IL- 1 beta, KC, leukocytes and bacterial load. Pulmonary TNF-alpha, KC, myeloperoxidase and histopathological injury were decreased. Survival improved from 62 % (saline lavage) to 83 % (rhAT lavage, P < 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: {{to define}} the blood {{hemostatic}} potential in patients with chronic coronary heart disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Subjects and methods. The investigation {{is based on the}} in-depth dynamic clinicobiochemical study of 43 patients who has undergone surgical myocardial revascularization under extracorporeal circulation. Ten current standardized laboratory tests were used to evaluate the hemostatic system. At the stages of the investigation, the parameters of the latter were determined and the blood hemostatic potential was estimated in the patients with coronary heart disease. Results. The investigation has indicated that in patients with chronic heart disease, hypercoagulation was compensated due to the changes in the anticoagulation and fibrinolytic systems. In patients with the acute coronary syndrome, the indices of the external and internal mechanisms of coagulation were in the normal physiological range at all the stages of the investigation, even at its stage 3 whereas the parameters, such as the levels of soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC), fibrinogen, and <b>D-dimers,</b> suggest thrombinemia and activated coagulation. Conclusion. The absence of activation of the external and internal coagulation pathways with the elevated level of markers of activated coagulation of SFMC and <b>D-dimers</b> in patients with ACS is not that of activation, as such. The patients of this group show a reduction in coagulation factors due to their uptake for the stabilization of the functional status of the hemostatic system.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Men and women (n= 18, 097, 52 % women, 56 ± 12 years) were randomly recruited from various villages in Molise (Italy) in the framework of the population-based cohort study "Moli-sani". Hemochromocytometric analyses were performed using an automatic analyzer (Beckman Coulter, IL, Milan, Italy). Associations of platelet indices with dependent variables were investigated by multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Full models including age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, menopause, white and red blood cell counts, mean corpuscular volume, <b>D-dimers,</b> C-reactive protein, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, glucose, and drug use explained 16 %, 21 %, 1. 9 % and 4. 7 % of platelet count, plateletcrit, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width variability, respectively; variables that appeared to be most strongly associated were white blood cell count, age, and sex. Platelet count, mean platelet volume and plateletcrit were positively associated with white blood cell count, while platelet distribution width was negatively associated with white blood cell count.
