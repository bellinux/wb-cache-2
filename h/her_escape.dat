5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of <b>her</b> <b>escape,</b> and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in <b>her</b> <b>escape,</b> and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect <b>her</b> <b>escape.</b> A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped <b>her</b> <b>escape</b> and then killed her.|$|E
