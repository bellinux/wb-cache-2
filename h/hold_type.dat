40|$|Abstract Background More {{and more}} {{countries}} hold databases on cattle movements. The {{primary purpose of}} the registration of cattle movements is to provide data for quick tracing of contagious animals in case of disease outbreaks and food safety scares. Nevertheless, these data can also be used for analytical studies to get insight into the nature of the contact structure between and within cattle <b>holding</b> <b>types.</b> This paper focuses on the effect post- 2001 FMD movement regulations have had on the number of cattle movements between different and within the same cattle <b>holding</b> <b>types.</b> Important characteristics and dynamics of cattle movement patterns of Dutch cattle <b>holding</b> <b>types</b> were identified using data on cattle movements after the 2001 FMD outbreak. Results The results showed that in 2001, just after the FMD outbreak when strict movement restriction regulations were in force, a reduced number of cattle movements was seen compared to before the FMD outbreak. However, the number of cattle movements off-farm for live trade and the number of imported cattle increased in the period 2002 – 2004 to higher levels than expected, i. e. to levels almost as high as before the FMD outbreak, despite operative movement restriction regulations. As the number of cattle movements to and from traders strongly decreased just after the FMD outbreak in 2001, traders regained their central role again in the network in the years 2002 – 2004. Conclusions Quantifying the Dutch cattle contact structure between and within <b>holding</b> <b>types</b> up to 3. 5 years after the FMD outbreak gave evidence that the post-FMD movement restriction regulations were not able {{to reduce the number of}} cattle movements in the longer term. With that the risk of a large epidemic increased. Quantifying contact structures based on animal movement data between different and within the same cattle <b>holding</b> <b>types</b> is important for targeting disease control and for assessing compliance with legislation. </p...|$|R

50|$|Type {{checking}} {{was further}} improved and automated when the conventional byte word of 32-bits was lengthened to 36-bits for Symbolics 3600-model Lisp machines {{and eventually to}} 40-bits or more (usually, the excess bits not {{accounted for by the}} following were used for error-correcting codes). The first group of extra bits were used to <b>hold</b> <b>type</b> data, making the machine a tagged architecture, and the remaining bits were used to implement CDR coding (wherein the usual linked list elements are compressed to occupy roughly half the space), aiding garbage collection by reportedly an order of magnitude. A further improvement was two microcode instructions which specifically supported Lisp functions, reducing the cost of calling a function to as little as 20 clock cycles, in some Symbolics implementations.|$|E

While on a ship these containers are plugged into an electrical outlet (typically 440 VAC) that ties into the ship's power generation. Refrigerated container ships are not limited by the number of refrigeration containers they can carry, unlike other container ships which may be limited in their number of refrigeration outlets or have insufficient generator capacity. Each reefer container unit is typically designed with a stand-alone electrical circuit and has its own breaker switch that allows it to be connected and disconnected as required. In principle each individual unit could be repaired while the ship was still underway.|$|E
5000|$|Methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and {{insoluble}} contaminants. Halideions, {{which are}} soluble contaminants, such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the corrosivity of alcohol fuels. Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways: they chemically attack passivating oxide films onseveral metals causing pitting corrosion, and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical, galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clogs the fuel system over time.To prevent corrosion the fuel system must be made of suitable materials,electrical wires must be properly insulated and the fuel level sensor must be of pulse and <b>hold</b> <b>type,</b> magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type. In addition, high quality alcohol should have a low concentration of contaminants and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added. Scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.The experiments are done with E50, which is more aggressive & speeds up the corrosion effect. It is very clear that by {{increasing the amount of}} water in fuel ethanol one can reduce the corrosion. At 2% or 20,000 ppm water in the fuel ethanol the corrosion stopped. The observations in Japan are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol. The reaction mechanism is 3 EtOH + Al -> Al(OEt)3 + [...] H2 will be the same at lower-mid blends. When enough water is present in the fuel, the aluminumwill react preferably with water to produce Al2O3, repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer. The aluminum alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer; water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer.|$|E

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{theory for}} laminated plates with delaminations {{is used to}} consider the influence of inelastic deformations on the dynamic behavior of composite plates with delaminations. The laminate model {{is based on a}} generalized displacement formulation implemented at the layer level. The delamination behavior can be modeled using any general interfacial fracture law: however, for the current work a linear model is employed. The interfacial displacement jumps are expressed in an internally consistent fashion in terms of the fundamental unknown interfacial tractions. The current theory imposes no restrictions on the size, location, distribution, or direction of growth of the delaminations. The proposed theory is used to consider the inelastic, dynamic response of delaminated plates in cylindrical bending subjected to a ramp and <b>hold</b> <b>type</b> of loading. The individual layers in the current study are assumed to be either titanium or aluminum. The inelastic response of both materials is modeled using the unified viscoplastic theory of Bodner and Partom. It is shown that the presence of both inelastic behavior and delamination can have a significant influence on the plate response. In particular it is shown that these mechanisms are strongly interactive. This result emphasizes the need to consider both mechanisms simultaneously...|$|E

In particular, the influence of inelastic deformations and delamination at the interfaces of the lamina on the macroscopic and local response of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }/Al plates are studied. The work is carried out using a recently developed plate theory which models both delamination and localized history-dependent effects such, as inelasticity. A linear debonding model for the interface is employed for the current work. The theory models both the initiation and growth of delaminations without imposing any restrictions on the location, size, or direction of growth of the delamination. In the current work {{the response of the}} individual lamina in the plate are modeled using the Method of Cells (MOC) micromechanical model.
