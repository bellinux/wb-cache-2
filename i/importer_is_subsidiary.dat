30|$|Although the set-covering {{problem is}} NP-hard, it is {{possible}} to optimally solve realistic-size instances of the case study at hand by Cplex, significantly outperforming a previously proposed node-arc formulation, which, unlike this approach, can only be used when all <b>importers</b> <b>are</b> served before all exporters. Moreover, the set-covering model can be effectively used to evaluate a new distribution policy, in which <b>importers</b> <b>are</b> allowed to be visited after exporters. Even if doing so enlarges the set of feasible routes, they can be efficiently enumerated in a short time and Cplex can optimally solve instances up to three times larger with respect to the current business volumes of the carrier.|$|R
