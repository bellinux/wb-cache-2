The coaster is made of a transparent acrylic material, much like a clear plastic, that most waterslides in resorts and theme parks are made of. Within the acrylic tube, water jets are used for uphill propulsion, a similar concept to conveyor belts on roller coasters.|$|E

50|$|Bacon's {{official}} citation reads:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. S/Sgt. Bacon distinguished himself while serving as a squad leader with the 1st Platoon, Company B, during an operation west of Tam Ky. When Company B came under fire from an enemy bunker line to the front, S/Sgt. Bacon quickly organized his men and led them forward in an assault. He advanced on a hostile bunker and destroyed it with grenades. As he did so, several fellow soldiers including the 1st Platoon leader, were struck by machine gun fire and fell wounded in an exposed position forward {{of the rest of the}} platoon. S/Sgt. Bacon immediately assumed command of the platoon and assaulted the hostile gun position, finally killing the enemy gun crew in a single-handed effort. When the 3d Platoon moved to S/Sgt. Bacon's location, its leader was also wounded. Without hesitation S/Sgt. Bacon took charge of the additional platoon and continued the fight. In the ensuing action he personally killed 4 more enemy soldiers and silenced an antitank weapon. Under his leadership and example, the members of both platoons accepted his authority without question. Continuing to ignore the intense hostile fire, he climbed up on the <b>exposed</b> <b>deck</b> of a tank and directed fire into the enemy position while several wounded men were evacuated. As a result of S/Sgt. Bacon's extraordinary efforts, his company was able to move forward, eliminate the enemy positions, and rescue the men trapped to the front. S/Sgt. Bacon's bravery at the risk of his life was in the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design of water breakers’ platings for {{container}} ships, under impact lateral pressure due to green water loads, that in extreme sea conditions may damage goods, facilities and equipments on the <b>exposed</b> <b>deck.</b> The consequences of such loads may be mitigated through a combination of enhancing sea keeping analysis and structural design, that require direct calculation tools and a long time, as it is preliminary necessary to determine the ship motions relative to waves, then calculate the green water pressure and, finally, analyze the structural response under some acceptable criteria. In the study some formulas, useful to evaluate the maximum impact pressure due to green water loads, corresponding to the most severe sea state condition the ship may encounter during its lifetime, as function of the water height of the wave surface above the main deck at bow, are discussed and adopted. Subsequently, the ultimate strength check of platings is carried out splitting the process into two phases, namely the quasi-static loading step and the dynamic/impact one. Finally, some numerical analyses are carried out, varying the plating thickness and aspect ratio, as well as the initial impact velocity between the plate and the water surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} marine green macroalga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides is {{now considered}} to be an introduced marine pest along the northwest Atlantic and southern Australian coasts. International or domestic translocation of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides is usually attributed to the fouling of ship hulls or shellfish, particularly oysters. A likely domestic vector is shipboard transport, involving the translocation of whole thalli or fragments entangled in fishing nets, ropes, etc. that are then released in a previously unaffected area. Here we investigated the survival of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides under emersed conditions, simulating shipboard transport. C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides was able to survive periods of emersion of up to 90 days in high relative air humidity. Net photosynthesis remained positive at about 50 % of the rates of submersed control thalli. After 2 days of emersion and 4 days of rehydration under submersed conditions thalli recover to their initial net photosynthesis rates. Hence, C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides is likely to survive long shipboard journeys entrapped in fishing nets, anchor wells or other protected, high-humidity areas of a vessel. Furthermore, C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides may survive emersion on an <b>exposed</b> <b>deck</b> during short trips, especially in cooler conditions such as at night. The incursion sites of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides in Australia are generally in modified environments, often associated with shipping-related infrastructure such as wharves, jetties, rip rap, and moorings...|$|E
