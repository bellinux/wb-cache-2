60|$|HECTOR. Some day I shall kill you, {{if you go}} too far. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> fool.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sailor!' exclaimed {{the acute}} utilitarian, his curiosity {{stifling}} his hauteur. 'Why! just now, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> soldier.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> brave man. They wouldn't {{have given}} you that medal if you'd been a coward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan, you're {{a little}} bit more of a real man than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> willing to do {{anything}} against me and my brothers." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{beg your}} pardon. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> asking for information.|$|R
60|$|HARRY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} play tennis this afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not especially. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{very good}} fellow. I have always thought that;--except when {{you made me}} take back the ring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do you mean?' said Keller. 'If you're {{enough of}} a Britisher to throw this thing away, I shan't. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> newspaper-man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Sam, hush," [...] Tom said soothingly. [...] "My poor fellow, why, {{where have}} you come from? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{prisoner}} with the French." ...|$|E
60|$|MANGAN. Well, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> rather {{particular}} about people's characters.|$|R
60|$|BLOOM: (Fascinated) <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> of good stock by your accent.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> never coming. <b>I</b> begged {{you to come}} at once.|$|R
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. How can you {{sit there}} telling me such lies? You, Ellie, of all people! And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{perfectly}} simple, straightforward, good girl.|$|E
6000|$|... 'With Mark Gardner, and {{the king}} of the clothes-brushes, and all their train, in moustaches and parti-coloured parasols!' cried Percy. 'Theodora, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{sensible}} woman.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> woman. I {{took you}} to be twenty-five--at least twenty-two. Seventeen, with that shape! You're only a girl--a kid. You don't know anything." ...|$|E
60|$|JESSIE (after a pause). Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{so fond of}} Miss Edgeworth.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{never going}} to leave the lady in black velvet.|$|R
30|$|You’re not the {{friendly}} guy <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> (Kurt shifts {{in his chair}} and sighs).|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw you in {{the park}} yesterday, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> ghost. But my trai--my man, I mean--saw you too. I knew by that that you were genuine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marbury {{tells me}} you're a high mogul {{in the public}} library. I was surprised. Didn't hardly think you were old enough. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> girl, still in college maybe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{the devil}} are {{the lower classes}}?" [...] cried the carrier. [...] "You are the lower classes yourself! If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{blooming}} aristocrat, I shouldn't have given you a lift." ...|$|E
60|$|CUSINS. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{determined}} {{to turn your}} back on the wicked side of life.|$|R
60|$|Bessie (Defending herself). Why should I {{make the}} poor old friendless man miserable? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> far away. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> dead. <b>I</b> didn't know but <b>you</b> had never <b>been</b> born. I... I... (Harry turns to her. She desperately.) It {{was easier to}} believe it myself. (Carried away.) And after all it's true. It's come to pass. This is the to-morrow we've been waiting for.|$|R
60|$|Cecily. Oh, I merely {{came back}} to water the roses. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> with Uncle Jack.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A career!' exclaimed Caroline. 'What, {{you want}} to set {{the world in a}} blaze! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> poetic dreamer, a listless, superfine {{speculator}} of an exhausted world. And all the time you are very ambitious!' ...|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. [braced] Am I? Well, youre a live one: {{thats one}} comfort. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> ghost. [He sits down, quite {{undisturbed}} by the pistol] Who are you; {{and what the}} devil were you doing in my new Turkish bath? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{seems to}} me, youngster, {{that you know}} pretty well as much as I do, for I cannot do more than fudge an observation. How on earth did you learn all this? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> fisher-boy before you joined.” ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO. You {{never told}} me you couldn't fight, Tops. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> an {{accomplished}} boxer.|$|R
5000|$|... (I saw you {{in passing}} at the temple. In that {{beautiful}} lace, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the Virgin.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bell gave a {{prolonged}} whistle. [...] "Excuse me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> Mrs. Something-or-other for sure. Aren't you mistress here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{wonderful}} blunders, and ingenious halts, he {{drew her}} into prompting him throughout, then exclaimed, 'There! {{you know it}} much better. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> clever little girl! Come, won't you say it once, and let me hear how well it sounds?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How filthy! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> decent fellow. You {{were about}} the only one here. She's been with Clutton and Potter and Flanagan, even with old Foinet--that's why he takes so much trouble about her--and now two of you, you and Lawson. It makes me sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} drowsy day," [...] I said to myself, idly {{turning over}} {{the leaves of the}} sketch-book to find a blank page. [...] "Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> mile off by this time!" [...] For, to my surprise, the two walkers were back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a leetle mite {{smarter than}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>was.</b> So long. Got a leetle {{business}} now--you understand a leetle business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Ho,’ ses Bob, surprised. ’I didn’t {{know you}} ’ad any geraniums, Henery. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> digging for gravel this year.’ ...|$|R
60|$|LOUKA (turning to Raina). <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> fonder of {{him than}} of Sergius. You know best whether I was right.|$|R
