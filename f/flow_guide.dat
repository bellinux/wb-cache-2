In the present study, a passive mixing enhancement strategy of using inclined struts along with a <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> vane is presented and experimentally tested at atmospheric pressure conditions.

40|$|The {{benchmark}} calculations {{performed by}} CRS 4 with Star-CD on a reference {{geometry of the}} MEGAPIE target are presented in this report (benchmark M 1). Scope of the benchmark is {{a comparison of the}} results obtained by the various partners involved in the MEGAPIE project using different codes and turbulence modelling approaches. The considered target geometry is the one with the final part of the guide tube slanted at an angle of about 9 degrees. The Pb-Bi flow in the last 2150 mm of the target have been simulated, including the calculation of the thermal field in all the solid structures (window, hull and <b>flow</b> <b>guide).</b> Due to geometrical symmetry, only half of the real domain was considered. Turbulence was simulated using a Chen k-ε model, combined with a Two-layer model in the most critical near-wall regions (window and <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> in the spallation region) and with Wall Functions along the riser and the down-comer. Modified wall functions for low Prandtl number fluids were implemented. Results are presented for both cases with the beam footprint major axis parallel (benchmark M 1. 0) and normal (benchmark M 1. 1) to the guide-tube slant. In order to estimate the effect of the variation of the turbulent Prandtl number on the heat exchange, two calculation have been performed, one with Prt = 0. 9 and one using a relationship Prt = f(Ret, Pr), yielding a locally variable turbulent Prandtl number. Results show a very complex flow pattern in the spallation region, with 3 D vortex structures being generated in the reversing region and dragged along the rising duct. In case M 1. 0 with Prt = 0. 9, results show maximum window temperatures of 521 °C and 487 °C in the external and internal side respectively, with a maximum Pb-Bi temperature of 486 °C located nearby the window centre. The maximum flow velocity is 1. 35 m/s. A significant heat exchange takes place across the 1. 5 mm thick <b>flow</b> <b>guide,</b> causing a mean temperature increase along the down-comer of about 34 °C. Due to the high Reynolds number of the flow, the effect of using a variable Prt is limited to near wall regions, where the heat exchange is slightly reduced. The combination of a lower heat exchange across the <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> (resulting in a lower temperature increase of the Pb-Bi along the down-comer) and a worse window cooling yielded a maximum window temperature of 524 °C, namely 3 °C more than in the case with Prt = 0. 9. In case M 1. 1, maximum window temperatures of 447 °C and 414 oC were found using Prt = 0. 9 with a maximum Pb-Bi temperature of 423 °C located in {{the central part of the}} spallation region.

40|$|Fundamental {{studies on}} a compact trapped vortex {{combustor}} indicate that cavity injection strategies {{play a major}} role on flame stability. Detailed experiments indicate that blow-out occurs for a certain range of cavity air flow velocities. An unsteady RANS-based reacting flow simulation tool has been utilized to study the basic dynamics of cavity vortex for various flow conditions. The phenomenon of flame blow-out at certain intermediate cavity air velocities is explained on the basis of transition from a cavity-stabilized mode to an opposed flow stagnation mode. A novel strategy is proposed for achieving flame stability at all conditions. This involves using a <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> vane {{in the path of the}} main flow to direct a portion of the main flow into the cavity. This seems to result in a desirable dual vortex structure, i. e., a small clockwise vortex behind the vane and large counterclockwise vortex in the cavity. Experimental results show stable flame at all flow conditions with the <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> vane, and pressure drop is estimated to be within acceptable limits. Cold flow simulations show self-similar velocity profiles for a range of main inlet velocities, and high reverse velocity ratios (- 0. 3) are observed. Such a high-velocity ratio in the reverse flow shear layer profile leads to enhanced production of turbulence imperative to compact combustors. Reacting flow simulations show even higher reverse velocity ratios (above - 0. 7) due to flow acceleration. The flame is observed to be stable, even though minor shear layer oscillations are present in the form of vortex shedding. Self-similarity is also observed in reacting flow temperature profiles at combustor exit over the entire range of the mainstream velocity. This indicates that the present configuration holds a promise of delivering robust performance invariant of the flow operating conditions...|$|E

To {{assess the}} pathophysiologic {{effects of the}} {{coronary}} sequelae of Kawasaki disease on coronary hemodynamic variables, we regionally evaluated the flow velocity dynamics and flow reserve in coronary vessels with lesions using an intracoronary Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> wire. Background. The pathophysiologic effects of the coronary sequelae of Kawasaki disease on coronary hemodynamic variables have not been completely clarified, and we previously reported some discrepancies between coronary angiographic findings and exercise stress tests in Kawasaki disease. Methods. Doppler phasic coronary flow velocity was determined using an 0. 018 -in. (0. 046 -cm) intracoronary Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> wire at rest and during the adenosine triphosphate–induced hyperemic response in 95 patients (75 male, 20 female, mean age 9. 8 ± 6. 2 years) with Kawasaki disease. Results. In 25 patients with coronary aneurysms in 29 vessels, the average peak velocity and diastolic to systolic velocity ratio were significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased in the moderate-sized and large-sized aneurysms. Significantly lower values in coronary flow reserve (CFR) were noted in 3 of 10 vessels with moderate aneurysms and in 4 of 7 vessels with large aneurysms. A significant positive correlation (y = 0. 53 x + 14. 6, r 2 = 0. 91) was observed between the percent diameter stenosis evaluated by angiography and that calculated from the flow velocity measurement. However, the percent diameter stenosis calculated from the flow velocity measurement was underestimated compared with that determined by angiography in the stenotic lesions of intermediate severity. A reduced CFR was noted in five of seven vessels with intermediate stenosis ranging from 50 % to 75 %, and also in three vessels with mild stenosis ranging from 30 % to 40 %. A reduced CFR was also observed in six of the eight angiographically normal vessels associated with the area of reduced perfusion on exercise thallium- 201 myocardial scintigraphy. Conclusions.

40|$|A new Trapped Vortex Combustor (TVC) {{concept has}} been studied for {{applications}} {{such as those in}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as it offers potential for superior flame stability and low pressure loss. Flame stability is ensured by a strong vortex in a physical cavity attached to the combustor wall, and low pressure loss is due to the absence of swirl. Earlier studies on a compact combustor concept showed that there are issues with ensuring stable combustion over a range of operating conditions. The present work focuses on experimental studies and numerical simulations to study the stability issues and performance optimization in this compact single-cavity TVC configuration. For performing numerical simulations, an accurate and yet computationally affordable Modified Eddy Dissipation Concept combustion model is built upon the KIVA- 3 V platform to account for turbulence-chemistry interactions. Detailed validation with a turbulent non-premixed CH 4 /H 2 /N 2 flame from literature showed that the model is sufficiently accurate and the effect of various simulation strategies is assessed. Transient flame simulation capabilities are assessed by comparison with experimental data from an acoustically excited oscillatory H 2 -air diffusion flame reported in literature. Subsequent to successful validation of the model, studies on basic TVC flow oscillations are performed. Frequencies of flow oscillations are found to be independent of flow velocities and cavity length, but dependent on the cavity depth. Cavity injection and combustion individually affect the magnitude of flow oscillations but do not significantly alter the resonant frequencies. Reacting flow experiments and flow visualization studies in an existing experimental TVC rig with optical access and variable cavity L/D ratio show that TVC flame stability depends strongly on the cavity air velocity. A detailed set of numerical simulations also confirms this and helps to identify three basic modes of TVC flame stabilization. A clockwise cavity vortex stabilized flame is formed at low cavity air velocities relative to the mainstream, while a strong anticlockwise cavity vortex is formed at high cavity air velocities and low L/Ds. At intermediate conditions, the cavity vortex structure is found to be in a transition state which leads to large scale flame instabilities and flame blow-out. For solving the flame instability problem, a novel strategy of incorporating a <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> vane is proposed to establish the advantageous anticlockwise vortex without the use of cavity air. Experimental results with the modified configuration are quite encouraging for TVC flame stability at laboratory conditions, while numerical results show good stability even at extreme operating conditions. Further design optimization studies are performed in a multi-parameter space using detailed simulations. From the results, a strategy of using inclined struts in the main flow path along with the <b>ﬂow</b> <b>guide</b> vane seems most promising. This configuration is tested experimentally and results pertaining to pressure drop, pattern factor and flame stability are found to be satisfactory...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the increase in myocardial 99 mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (sestamibi) retention in humans during pharmacologic vasodilation. Methods: For calculation of the increase in 99 mTc-sestamibi retention during hyperemia, baseline and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -induced hyperemic stress sestamibi studies were performed using a same-day rest-stress protocol. On the injection of sestamibi, left ventricular dynamic data were obtained for 90 s. The increase in sestamibi retention from baseline to hyperemia was calculated by the formula Cmh(t) ∫ 01 Cbb(τ) dτ/Cmb(t) ∫ 01 Cbh(τ) dτ, where Cmh(t) and Cmb(t) are myocardial counts on the tomographic image, and Cbb(τ) and Cbh(τ) are the left ventricular blood-pool counts during the first transit of sestamibi at baseline and during hyperemia, respectively. Coronary flow increase during intravenous ATP stress was measured using intracoronary Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> wire and compared with the scintigraphic results of 28 measurements in 22 patients. Results: Sestamibi retention increased as coronary flow velocity increased but plateaued at > 2. 5 - 3 times baseline flow velocity.

The behavior of both unbounded and bounded compressible plane mixing layers {{with respect to}} two- and three-dimensional, spatially growing wave disturbances is investigated using linear stability analysis. The mixing layer is formed by two parallel streams with different gases and the flow {{is assumed to be}} inviscid and non-reacting. For unbounded mixing layers, the effects of the free stream Mach number, velocity ratio, temperature ratio, gas constant (molecular weight) ratio and the ratios of specific heats on the linear spatial instability characteristics of a mixing layer are determined. A nearly universal dependence of the normalized maximum amplification rate on the convective Mach number is found for two-dimensional spatially growing disturbances. The effects of the mean flow profiles on the instability behavior of the mixing layers are also studied. It is shown that decreasing the thickness of the total temperature profile relative to the mean velocity profile, or adding a wake component in the mean velocity profile can make the normalized amplification rate decrease slower as the convective Mach number increases for both subsonic and supersonic convective Mach numbers. For an unbounded mixing layer with subsonic convective Mach numbers, there is only one unstable mode propagating with a phase velocity [ [...] . ] approximately equal to the isentropically estimated convective velocity of the large scale structures [ [...] . ]. As the convective Mach number approaches or exceeds unity, there are always two unstable spatial modes. One is with a phase velocity [ [...] . ] (slow mode and the other is with a phase velocity [ [...] . ] (fast mode). For the low supersonic convective Mach numbers, the fast mode is more unstable than the slow mode when the heavy gas is on the low speed side and the slow mode is dominant when the heavy gas is on the high speed side. The effect of parallel <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> walls on a spatially growing mixing layer is also investigated. It is shown that, in this case, if the convective Mach number exceeds a critical value of approximately unity, there are many supersonic unstable modes. The maximum amplification rates of mixing layers approach an asymptotic value and this maximum amplification rate increases to a maximum value and decreases again as the distance between the walls decreases. For a mixing layer inside parallel <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> walls, the growth rate of three-dimensional modes is larger than the corresponding two-dimensional mode at high convective Mach numbers. But the growth rate of two-dimensional supersonic instability waves has a larger value than their three-dimensional counterparts for a mixing layer inside a rectangular duct (Tam & Hu [1988], [1989]). Contour plots of the pressure perturbation fields for both unbounded and bounded mixing layers indicate that there are waves propagating outward from the mixing layer along the Mach angle, and that the walls provide a feedback mechanism between the growing mixing layer and this compression/expansion wave system. The bounded mixing layers are more unstable than the corresponding free mixing layers for supersonic convective Mach numbers. The streaklines of the flow confirm that the spreading rate of the mixing layer is unusually small for supersonic disturbances. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} reports optical {{diagnostic}} measurements of fuel-air mixing and vortex structure {{in a single}} cavity trapped vortex combustor (TVC). Specifically, the mixture fraction using acetone PLIF technique in the non-reacting flow, and PIV measurements in the reacting flow are reported {{for the first time}} in trapped vortex combustors. The fuel-air momentum flux ratio, where the air momentum corresponds to that entering the cavity through a specially-incorporated <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> vane, is used to characterize the mixing. The acetone PLIF experiments show that at high momentum flux ratios, the fuel-air mixing in the cavity is very minimal and is enhanced as the momentum flux ratio reduces, due to a favourable vortex formation in the cavity. Stoichiometric mixture fraction surfaces show that the mixing causes the reaction surfaces to shift from non-premixed to partially-premixed stratified mixtures. PIV measurements conducted in the non-reacting flow in the cavity further reinforce this observation. The scalar dissipation rates of mixture fraction were compared with the contours of RMS of fluctuating velocity and showed very good agreement. The regions of maximum mixing are observed to be along the fuel air interface. Reacting flow Ply measurements which differ substantially from the non-reacting cases primarily because of the heat release from combustion and the resulting gas expansion show that the vortex is displaced from the centre of the cavity towards the guide vane. Overall, the measurements show interesting features of the flow including the presence of the dual cavity structure and lead to a clear understanding of the underlying physics of the cavity flow highlighting the importance of the fuel-air momentum ratio parameter.

40|$|Establishing {{an optimal}} {{intercooled}} aero engine constitutes a coupled problem where the conceptual {{design of the}} intercooler and the engine has to be considered simultaneously. The heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics {{will depend on the}} choice of the intercooler architecture. Hence, to be able to optimize the performance of an intercooled aero engine, the performance characteristics of a given intercooler architecture has to be known in the parameter range anticipated for the aero engine optimization. In this thesis, several design concepts of a two-pass cross flow tubular intercooler for aero engine application have been analyzed by the use of computational fluid dynamics simulations and system level assessments. The work comprises 3 D coupled CFD analysis of the internal flow (in-flow, cross-over and out-flow duct) using porous media modelling for the tube stacks. Several design iterations on the internal flow configuration has been performed applying two splitter vanes and a <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> vane. A parametric study of the external heat transfer and pressure loss is included. Correlations for two configurations (straight tube and involute spiral tube) are provided for system level assessments of this intercooler concept. In addition to providing heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics, the correlations are set up to allow intercooler installation space constraints to be taken into account. The fuel burn benefits of the presented intercooled engine are attributed to the use of a variable geometry separate exhaust nozzle and to providing an adequate amount of intercooling. The amount of intercooling should be sufficient to enable the high OPR at take-off, and allow a compact engine design. In cruise, on the other hand, it is beneficial to reduce the intercooling to establish an optimum between intercooling and incurred pressure losses...|$|E
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} two-dimensional turbulence {{in a square}} container with no-slip walls is the spontaneous production of angular momentum due to flow-wall interactions, also known as spontaneous spin-up of the flow. In this paper we address the statistics of spin-up and discuss its likely origin. A signature of the spontaneous production of angular momentum {{is the development of}} a large-scale circulation cell. It is found that the global turnover time of the <b>flow</b> <b>guides</b> the spin-up process, which can be considered as a relaxation process of the macroscopic flow to an angular momentum containing state. The high turnover rate of the small-scale vortical structures emerging from the no-slip walls apparently has no significant effect on the spin-up rate. The presented data on the spin-up process strongly suggest that spin-up is not the net result of isolated vortex-wall interactions, with its associated pressure fluctuations on the domain boundaries, alone. The rapid spin-up of the flow clearly suggests the attraction to an angular momentum containing state...|$|R

The leads designed to carry 100 kA dc current. Each lead consists of a warm end, heat exchange section and a cold end. The warm end is a half moon plate and cylinder brazed together. The heat exchange section is made of 202 copper rods arranged in a staggered pattern. Each rod is 6. 35 mm in diameter and 1650 mm in length. The rods were soft-soldered into 12. 7 mm deep holes at both warm and cold ends. The helium gas <b>flow,</b> <b>guided</b> by anodized aluminum baffles along the lead length, allows for a relatively high heat transfer coefficient between the current carrying rods and cooling helium gas. As a result the current leads were successfully tested with a ramping current of up to 104 kA. The current lead design, assembly work and the test results are presented...|$|R

The technique was used {{to assist in the}} management of 27 patients with acute heart failure by helping to select appropriate treatment. Although the catheters were <b>flow</b> <b>guided,</b> insertion and positioning were facilitated by fluoroscopy. The procedure was safe, with one complication arising; technical difficulties occurred in eight cases. Prediction of cardiac output and left ventricular filling pressure by clinical assessment proved to be accurate in only 55 % of cases: in patients with acute heart failure there was a tendency to underestimate the cardiac output (25 %) and overestimate the left ventricular filling pressure (37 %), whereas in patients with chronic heart failure the filling pressure was more accurately estimated (71 %). Haemodynamic measurement was often invaluable in selecting and adjusting treatment, particularly in critically ill patients...|$|R
40|$|Syngas {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} {{a mixture of}} carbon monoxide, hydrogen and other diluents, is an important fuel for power generation applications since it {{can be obtained from}} both biomass and coal gasification. Clean coal technologies require stable and efficient operation of syngas-fired gas turbines. The trapped vortex combustor (TVC) is a relatively new gas turbine combustor concept which shows tremendous potential in achieving stable combustion under wide operating conditions with low emissions. In the present work, combustion of low calorific value syngas in a TVC has been studied using in-situ laser diagnostic techniques and numerical modeling. Specifically, this work reports in-situ measurements of mixture fraction, OH radical concentration and velocity in a single cavity TVC, using state-of-the art laser diagnostic techniques such as Planar Laser-induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Numerical simulations using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approaches have also been carried out to complement the experimental measurements. The fuel-air momentum flux ratio (MFR), where the air momentum corresponds to that entering the cavity through a specially-incorporated <b>flow</b> <b>guide</b> vane, is used to characterize the mixing. Acetone PLIF experiments show that at high MFRs, the fuel-air mixing in the cavity is very minimal and is enhanced as the MFR reduces, due to a favourable vortex formation in the cavity, which is corroborated by PIV measurements. Reacting flow PIV measurements which differ substantially from the non-reacting cases primarily because of the gas expansion due to heat release show that the vortex is displaced from the centre of the cavity towards the guide vane. The MFR was hence identified as the controlling parameter for mixing in the cavity. Quantitative OH concentration contours showed that at higher MFRs 4. 5, the fuel jet and the air jet stream are separated and a flame front is formed at the interface. As the MFR is lowered to 0. 3, the fuel air mixing increases and a flame front is formed at the bottom and downstream edge of the cavity where a stratified charge is present. A flame stabilization mechanism has been proposed which accounts for the wide MFRs and premixing in the mainstream as well. LES simulations using a flamelet-based combustion model were conducted to predict mean OH radical concentration and velocity along with URANS simulations using a modified Eddy dissipation concept model. The LES predictions were observed to agree closely with experimental data, and were clearly superior to the URANS predictions as expected. Performance characteristics in the form of exhaust temperature pattern factor and pollutant emissions were also measured. The NOx emissions were found to be less than 2 ppm, CO emissions below 0. 2 % and HC emissions below 700 ppm across various conditions. Overall, the in-situ experimental data coupled with insight from simulations and the exhaust measurements have confirmed the advantages of using the TVC as a gas turbine combustor and provided guidelines for stable and efficient operation of the combustor with syngas fuel...|$|E

40|$|A {{capacitive}} radiofrequency (RF) discharge at {{atmospheric pressure}} is studied {{by means of}} a time-dependent, two-dimensional fluid model. The plasma is created in a stationary argon gas <b>flow</b> <b>guided</b> through two perforated electrodes, hence resembling a shower. The inner electrode, the electrode facing the flow entrance, is powered with a frequency of 13. 56 MHz, and the outer electrode is grounded. The model solves the mass balance equations for the relevant active species and the electron energy balance equation in conjunction with the Poisson equation for the field sustaining the plasma. The mass balance equations of the active species are calculated using the drift-diffusion- convection approach, thus taking the bulk velocity into account. The velocity field is calculated with the Navier-Stokes module of the Plasimo toolkit. The plasma dynamics is studied in three connected regions; the space between the electrodes, the regions before the powered electrode and the extended region behind the grounded electrode. The effect of the shower holes and the recirculation gas flow on the plasma is examined. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{investigation}} of the Eurofer 97 corrosion by the MHD flow of the liquid eutectic alloy Pb- 17 Li is presented. The experimental data previously obtained in Riga are confirmed and an attempt to model this phenomenon is presented. The model {{is based on a}} thermodynamic analysis of the dissolution and electro-dissolution mechanisms, leading to a relevant boundary condition at the liquid-solid interface. Then, analyzing the MHD <b>flow,</b> <b>guiding</b> ideas and scaling laws are derived for the dissolution rate of the Hartmann wall. The results obtained in the regime, where the solid wall is assumed to remain planar, allow determining a plausible value for an important non-dimensional number, the dissolution number Di. A linear analysis leads to predictions on the mechanism responsible for the formation of streaks imbedded within the Hartmann layer and associated with the wall shape disturbance, {{as well as for the}} selection of the unstable mode. It is found that this mechanism is related to an additional contribution due to the electric current, based on an electro-dissolution number Ed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
