50|$|These {{motorcycles}} were lean, {{light and}} handled various road surfaces well. The most defining machine of the rocker heyday was the Triton, {{which was a}} custom motorcycle made of a Norton Featherbed frame and a Triumph Bonneville engine.

5000|$|The H-2 was {{comparison}} {{tested by}} Cycle magazine in 1973 against the Ducati 750, the Honda CB750, the Harley-Davidson Sportster 1000, the Kawasaki Z1, the Triumph Trident 750, and the Norton Commando 750. The competition consisted of acceleration, braking distance, and road race course lap-times. Each test was run several times including 10 attempts at a fastest road course time. The H2 was the fastest accelerating machine, posting the fastest 1/4 mile {{run on a}} drag strip. Experts were surprised at the other results. Despite an uncomfortable feel and slight front wheel hop under hard braking and not giving the sensation of stopping particularly fast it had the shortest stopping distance and highest braking G load of all the bikes. On the road course, despite what had been heard and written about its ill <b>handling,</b> <b>frame</b> flexing and the supposed tendency to speed wobble exiting high speed turns, it was tied for the fastest lap time with the Kawasaki Z-1 to the tenth of a second. Overall the Kawasaki H-2 750 had the lowest ET, second-highest quarter-mile speed, the fastest lap time, the strongest braking force, the highest torque and horsepower readings on the dynamometer, the highest power-to-weight ratio, the lowest price and scored by points for performance {{was by far the}} least expensive per unit displacement ...|$|E
5000|$|The United States Navy Air Development Center {{awarded a}} number of {{contracts}} to aerospace companies to find a method for ejected aircrew {{to escape from the}} scene of the crash. Kaman proposed a turbofan powered gyroplane it called the Stowable Aircrew Vehicle Escape Rotorseat or SAVER, it was a gyroplane with an unpowered rotor, the blades being telescopic and along with the turbofan engine would fold into the aircraft seat during normal use. When the pilot ejected the seat would leave the aircraft and a drogue parachute would slow the seat and deploy the blades within four seconds. After an additional two seconds, the turbofan would run up to full power and the seat would become a gyroplane. Kaman made over 1500 air drops to test the self-deploying rotor system and a full-scale unpowered SAVER was tested by NASA in the Ames Research Laboraatory wind tunnel in 1970. The SAVER was equipped with a ground <b>handling</b> <b>frame</b> for tests, which was a tricycle landing gear and support frame, also fitted with basic flight instruments. The SAVER first flew in a towed flight on 28 December 1971 and the following day made a free flight, although it was fitted with a 16 ft non-telescoping rotor. Fitted with the 14 ft telescopic rotor, it first flew 10 January 1972. The SAVER was fitted with a Williams WRC-19 turbofan which was too powerful for the seat but was available [...] "off the shelf."

50|$|Triumph {{launched}} {{the first new}} Bonneville for 15 years at the Munich Motorcycle Show in September 2000, with a 790 cc, 360-degree crank, parallel-twin engine. Triumph's development team had originally designed a prototype they called the 9O8MD project in April 1997, an 'entry-level' medium displacement motorcycle for the export market. Market research indicated that Triumph's heritage was an important factor for overseas buyers, so Export Manager Ross Clifford decided to develop a parallel engine layout that could combine the latest technology with classic engine architecture. By the Summer of 1997 the concept had been agreed and the chassis and engine design teams began development work. The styling of the new bike had to link the heritage look to a modern <b>handling</b> <b>frame.</b> The team began with a fully restored 1969 Bonneville T120 and worked on the design throughout 1998. By August 1998, the first styling review of a full size three-dimensional model was completed by sales and marketing as well as engineering departments. The first 'Bonneville' engine was tested on 15 December 1998. The prototype engines were run for {{extended periods of time}} before committing to tooling production. By the end of 1998, the chassis team had completed their work on the styling prototype. In March 1999, the new engine was run in the prototype chassis {{for the first time and}} full scale road testing began, with the first six development bikes built in July 1999. Four were mainly used for engine testing and the remaining two for chassis development work. By September 1999, the final review of the production Bonneville's styling and specification was completed by Triumph's sales and marketing teams and final testing was completed in July 2000, well in time for the dealership launch.|$|E

With the obtained tie points a bundle block adjustment will be carried out with software developed at the Technical University of Munich which will result in an improved exterior orientation of the camera.

This [...] "color" [...] is what is now known in the Ethernet frame as the IEEE 802.1Q header, or the VLAN tag.
