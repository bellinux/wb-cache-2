50|$|In November 1972, Moses, the {{recently}} created New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), and the MTA submitted {{the environmental impact}} statement (EIS) for the bridge. The statement specified that the project was to include the approaches to the bridge (I-287 and NY 135) and be a 16.5 mi project, as that was {{the distance from the}} interchange of I-287 and I-95 in Rye to the interchange of NY 135 and NY 25 in Syosset. The statement also explained how the highway would become an extended part of I-287. The bridge was to be constructed with four lanes, about 135 ft above the sound at maximum clearances and 55 ft on the minimum clearances. There would be 1200 ft of a center between the two towers along the cable span. These minimums reported by the two authorities and Moses were equal to those of the bridges crossing the East River in New York City. The main span would have a median divider separating the directional lanes, along with a <b>girder</b> <b>box</b> to allow for smooth passing.|$|E

Consequently, establishment of steel <b>box</b> <b>girders</b> were made and then validated with the classical beam theory. Failure mode of steel <b>box</b> <b>girders</b> with profiled webs starts with yielding followed by local buckling of the compression flanges.

The purpose of the <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> {{is to give the}} blade sufficient strength and stiffness, both globally and locally. Globally, the blade should be sufficiently stiff in order not to collide with the tower during operational loading. Locally, the <b>box</b> <b>girder,</b> together with the stiffness of the outer shell, ensures that the shape of the aerodynamic profile is maintained. The pressure and gravity load on the blade results in edgewise and flapwise bending, as well as torsional loading of the blade. The <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> primarily carries the flapwise and torsional loads, while the edgewise bending is carried mainly by strengthening the leading and trailing edges of the aerodynamic profile.

An elevated metro system is more preferred type of metro system due to ease of construction and also it makes urban areas more accessible without any construction difficulty. An elevated metro system has two major elements pier and <b>box</b> <b>girder.</b> The present study focuses on two major elements, pier and <b>box</b> <b>girder,</b> of an elevated metro structural system. Conventionally the pier of a metro bridge is designed using a force based approach. During a seismic loading, the behaviour of a single pier elevated bridge relies mostly on the ductility and the displacement capacity. It is important to check the ductility of such single piers. Force based methods do not explicitly check the displacement capacity during the design. The codes are now moving towards a performance-based (displacement-based) design approach, which consider the design as per the target performances at the design stage. Performance of a pier designed by a Direct Displacement Based Design is {{compared with that of}} a force-based designed one. The design of the pier is done by both force based seismic design method and direct displacement based seismic design method {{in the first part of}} the study.
