5|$|After {{his escape}} from Pekalongan, Soeprapto {{and his family}} first went to Cirebon. They then went to Yogyakarta, where Soeprapto became a judge at the high court. He later began work as a prosecutor, rising quickly through the ranks; several of his {{coworkers}} attributed it to the Kutil case, where Soeprapto demonstrated that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the supremacy of law.|$|E

In March 1918, Cotillo opposed the proposed prohibition of alcohol in the state. Although <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> temperance, he doubted if that would be achieved by prohibition; he advocated education and not infringing on civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|He {{was educated}} in the Episcopal Church, to which he always adhered; and my {{conviction}} is, that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as usually taught in that Church, according to his understanding of them; but without a particle of intolerance, or disrespect for the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, before George W. Bush appointees Roberts and Alito had {{had time}} to make an impact, Rossum wrote that Scalia had failed to win {{converts}} among his conservative colleagues for his use of originalism, whereas Roberts and Alito, as younger men with an originalist approach, greatly admired Scalia battling for what <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was a {{classical}} liberal in the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> individual freedom and responsibility and {{feared that the}} growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, {{the role of the}} state was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission, but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin {{was elected}} {{governor}} of Kentucky {{by a vote}} of 76,187 to 67,283 over Joshua Fry Bell, taking office on August 30, 1859. He supported states' rights and the institution of slavery. Although <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the right of states to secede from the union, he hoped to avoid this outcome by reaching an agreement between the southern and northern states. To that end, he wrote a circular letter to the governors of the slave states on December 9, 1860 detailing a plan to save the Union.|$|E

5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{exist that}} Bogdan-Pitești's {{politics}} were already a merger of opposite or hardly compatible doctrines. He respected Catholicism and Judaism {{as the most}} elevated religious cultures, rejected Orthodoxy, atheism and communism as ideologies for the mediocre, and depicted himself as a Catholic anarchist. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> craniometry, and took scientific racism at face value. At some stage during the late 1880s, Bogdan-Pitești became a supporter of General Boulanger, who attempted to gain power in France {{with support from the}} Orléanist, Bonapartist and socialist camps; he reputedly befriended the prominent Boulangist and Romantic nationalist thinker Maurice Barrès.|$|E
5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E

5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E
