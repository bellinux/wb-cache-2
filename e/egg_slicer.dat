40|$|Measurement of texture is {{a useful}} quality control test for mushrooms. Results of these studies suggest that texture {{differences}} in mushrooms may be divided into primary and secondary differences. the former refer to differences caused largely by variation in the dry matter content of mushrooms, the latter to differences caused by variation {{in the nature of}} the dry matter content. The shear press was used for measuring mushroom texture.

Taste panels were capable of detecting texture differences in cooked mushrooms which were also detected by the shear press...|$|E
