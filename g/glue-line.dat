40|$|This paper uses {{finite element}} {{analysis}} (FEA) to verify the results of previous experimental works conducted {{on the effect of}} <b>glue-line</b> thickness and rate of loading on pull-out behavior of glued-in GFRP rods in LVL. For this purpose, the materials were considered as orthotropic for the timber and the GFRP rod, and isotropic for epoxy resin. To determine the effects of thickness on pull-out, four glue-lines namely 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 mm were modelled. To examine the effects of rate of loading, three glue-lines 0. 5, 2 and 4 mm were modelled with different values of modulus of elasticity selected for the resin to simulate higher and lower rates of loading. Results showed that with an increasing thickness of <b>glue-line,</b> the concentration of Z-direction stresses declines across the <b>glue-line</b> thickness from the rod-adhesive interface towards the adhesive-timber interface and the magnitude of shear stresses, tXZ, increases to a maximum within the <b>glue-line</b> in a zone about 20 e 30 % into the resin layer and this is seen for all glueline thicknesses. Also, by changing values of elastic modulus for the resin in the FE model to simulate rate of loading, it was shown that thicker glue-lines are more sensitive to loading rate...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 In wood-based composites, the <b>glue-line</b> (interface) between wood-strands {{affects the}} stress {{transfer}} from one member to the next. The <b>glue-line</b> properties determine {{the rate of}} load transfer between phases and these properties depend on wood species, surface preparation, glue properties, glue penetration into wood cells, and moisture content of the wood. As a result, the strength and stiffness of the composites are significantly affected by the amount, distribution, and properties of the resin. In {{the first part of}} this research, the <b>glue-line</b> stiffness between wood strands was determined by experiments. The interfacial properties were calculated from experimental data on double lap shear (DLS) specimens.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is concerned with}} in situ bonded-in timber connection using pultruded rod; where the manufacturing of such joint requires adhesive which can produce thick <b>glue-lines</b> and does not allow any use of pressure and heat. Four types of thixotropic (for ease application) and room temperature cured epoxy based were used namely CB 10 TSS (regarded as standards adhesive), Nanopox (modification of CB 10 TSS with addition of nanosilica), Albipox (modification of CB 10 TSS with addition of liquid rubber) and Timberset (an epoxy-based adhesive with addition of micro-size ceramic particles). The quality of the adhesive bonds was accessed using block shear test in accordance with ASTM D 905. The bond strength depends on how good the adhesive wet the timber surface. Therefore the viscosity and contact angle was also measured. The nano- and microfiller additions increased the bond strength significantly. The viscosity correlates well with contact angle measurements where lower viscosities are associated with lower contact angles. However contact angle contradicts with measured strength and wettability...|$|R
40|$|Oriented strand board (OSB) is an {{important}} wood composite used in situations where fungal decay and termite attack can occur. To counter these threats, powdered zinc borate biocide is commonly added to OSB. The effectiveness of biocides depends on their even distribution within composites and resistance to leaching, but {{little is known about}} the distribution of zinc borate in OSB. Zinc is denser than wood and it should be possible to map its distribution in OSB using X-ray micro-CT. We test this hypothesis and chemically register zinc in OSB using SEM-EDX. Zinc borate particles aggregated at the wood-adhesive interface in OSB, creating interrupted lines of zinc oriented in the x-y plane. Zinc borate particles were also found in the lumens of wood cells. Zinc was distributed throughout OSB, although slightly less was present in the core of the composite than in surface layers. A network of zinc remained in OSB after leaching in water. The resistance of zinc to leaching may be due to its incorporation in <b>glue-lines</b> within OSB, in addition to its low water-solubility. We conclude that X-ray micro-CT is a powerful tool for studying the distribution of zinc in OSB and other wood composites containing zinc borate...|$|R

40|$|Research {{to improve}} {{dimensional}} stability of oriented strand boards (OSB) through thermal treatment has been done. It aims {{to reduce the}} higroscopicity of the wood particles {{as well as to}} relieve the compression stresses generated during pressing process. In spite of the advantages, the thermal treatment above 160 ºC can inactive the surface of the wood, reducing the penetration of the adhesive and, this way, reducing the quality of the adhesion. The sanding of the surface of OSB panels can remove this effect, increasing the quality of the adhesion and the glue line strength. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the thermal treatment on the <b>glue-line</b> shear strength of OSB panels and the effect of the sanding process on this strength, as well. Commercial OSB were thermally treated according to two temperature levels (190 and 220 ºC), three times (12, 16 and 20 minutes).

This study aimed to treat thermo-mechanically parica plywood and observe the effects on its physical and mechanical properties. Specimens were submitted to two treatments, 120 and 150 ºC, remaining under pressure for seven minutes and, subsequently, under zero pressure for 15 minutes. Results showed {{a significant increase in}} specific mass from 0. 48 g cm- 3 to an average of 0. 56 g cm- 3, and a compression ratio of about 31. 7 % on average. Physical properties also varied significantly and results showed that treated samples swelled and absorbed more water than those untreated, leading to a greater thickness non-return rate. This indicates the proposed thermal treatments did not release the internal compressive stress generated during panel pressing, not improving its dimensional stability as a result. On the other hand, mechanical properties were positively affected, leading to an increase of 27. 5 % and 51. 8 % in modulus of rupture after treatments at 120 and 150 ºC, respectively.

40|$|Light-weight {{materials}} {{based on}} wood for interior fittings and furniture {{have been of}} interest {{for at least the}} last fifty years, mainly for cost-reducing reasons. Today, the increasing care of the environment and the growing interest in the concept of a sustainable society provide further impulses for the development of light-weight materials. A common consequence of the reduction in weight of such materials is deterioration in the mechanical properties, e. g. strength, stiffness and shape stability, compared to those of solid wood. New solutions for e. g. connections and mountings are also needed. Today, new panel materials are required where the disadvantages of conventional light-weight materials are less prominent and with aesthetic and tactile properties close to those of natural wood. In this paper, a new type of light-weight panel is presented. The panel is cross-laminated in three layers and consists throughout of solid wood. The weight reduction is a consequence of the hollow middle-layer construction. The intention of the construction is to make it possible to mix species in the panel, e. g. a high-quality and high-density wood on the surface and a low-quality wood with low weight in the core, and thus to optimize the properties of the panel for a specific purpose and to keep costs down at the same time. In this first study, however, the whole panel is made of Scots pine. Bending tests show that the <b>glue-line</b> between the outer layers and the core is critical for the mechanical performance of the panel and this has to be developed further.
