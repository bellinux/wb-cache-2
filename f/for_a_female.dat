5000|$|Feminists have {{levelled}} complaints at {{this angle}} of criminology that assumes females {{are controlled by}} their biology and are incapable of thinking for themselves; feminists point out that while criminological thinking has surpassed the gloomy days of biological determinism and the predetermined actor model of crime, criminological explanations of female crime has not. Some criminologists suggest a link between [...] "hormonal changes in pregnancy, menstruation and female criminal behaviour" [...] and crime (Burke 2001:164). Furthermore, in criminal cases women have used defences such as post-natal depression {{as the reason for}} infanticide and other crimes. The reliance upon biological reasons <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>female's</b> criminality has reinforced societal views of the biologically criminal female. Society therefore, neglects to account for other reasons such as social and economic ones <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>female's</b> criminal act.|$|R
