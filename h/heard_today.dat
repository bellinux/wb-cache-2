Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold War years. Left over from the Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought to be used to broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be <b>heard</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|One {{criticism}} already {{prevalent in}} the late 19th century, and still sometimes <b>heard</b> <b>today,</b> is that an international language might hasten the extinction of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the benefits would outweigh the costs; another, that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are generally also proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages and cultures.|$|E
25|$|Sturges {{took the}} screwball comedy {{format of the}} 1930s to another level, writing {{dialogue}} that, <b>heard</b> <b>today,</b> is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations. It {{is not uncommon for}} a Sturges character to deliver an exquisitely turned phrase and take an elaborate pratfall within the same scene. A tender love scene between Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck in The Lady Eve was enlivened by a horse, which repeatedly poked its nose into Fonda's head.|$|E

However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum.

2500|$|Some pre-decimalisation coins or {{denominations}} became {{commonly known}} by colloquial and slang terms, {{perhaps the most}} well known being bob for a shilling, and quid for a pound.

Bob is still used in phrases such as [...] "earn/worth a bob or two", and [...] "bob‐a‐job week". The two shillings and sixpence coin or half-crown was a half dollar, also sometimes referred to as two and a kick. A value of two pence was universally pronounced [...] tuppence, a usage which is still <b>heard</b> <b>today,</b> especially among older people.

2500|$|Chorley {{wrote the}} English {{libretto}} for Gounod's Faust, {{for its first}} presentation in London in 1863 (at Her Majesty's Theatre). [...] During rehearsals, {{it was found that}} the lines were unsingable. [...] Both Sims Reeves and Charles Santley made strenuous and persistent complaints to Messrs. Chappell's, and new translations were made secretly, since no-one dared to tell Chorley. [...] The first he knew of it was at the first performance. [...] Chorley, as reviewer, waited to make his comment until the final announced performance, of which he wrote that it was [...] "seriously imperilled by a singular translation". Unfortunately for him, the final performance in question had not taken place, so the Musical World was able to compliment him on his poetic imagination. Nevertheless, Chorley's translations of several songs from Faust were published and widely performed, such as [...] "The Flower Song", [...] "When All Was Young" [...] and [...] "Glory and Love".

2500|$|Reforms continued, and in {{the early}} 2000s {{students}} and faculty at the Pace Law School's Securities Arbitration Clinic wrote about the long-term effects. In 2003, Professor Barbara Black reviewed cases and found that increasingly it was the brokerage firms trying to use the courts to break arbitration clauses. The clinic's associate director, Jill Gross, reviewed the reforms 20 years after the case and concluded that the process was fairer to investors. While she noted some unresolved issues, such as the [...] "paradox" [...] created by McMahon under which investors {{would have a hard time}} proving that securities arbitration procedures did not meet FAA standards if those same standards had been approved by the SEC, she noted that the McMahons would probably turn to arbitration anyway were their case <b>heard</b> <b>today</b> since changes to the 1934 Act had shortened the statute of limitations and made it harder to prove scienter. [...] "Instead, most customer arbitrations today are predicated on state securities acts and common law claims such as breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation and fraud, and draw heavily on principles of equity" [...] she wrote. [...] "The ultimate irony is that, even though the Supreme Court opened the door to securities arbitration, even without the McMahon decision, today’s customers would continue to pursue their claims in arbitration." ...|$|E
