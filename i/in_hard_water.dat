40|$|This study {{compared}} proximal femoral morphology {{in patients}} living <b>in</b> soft and <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> regions. The proximal femoral morphology of {{two groups of}} 70 patients living <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> and soft <b>water</b> regions {{with a mean age}} of 72. 29 (range: 50 to 87 years) was measured using an antero-posterior radiograph of the non-operated hip with magnification adjusted. The medullary canal diameter at the level of the lesser trochanter (LT) was significantly wider in patients living <b>in</b> the <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> region (mean width: 1. 9 mm wider; p = 0. 003). No statistical significant difference was found in the medullary canal width at 10 cm below the level of LT, Dorr index, or Canal Bone Ratio (CBR). In conclusion, the proximal femoral morphology does differ in patients living <b>in</b> soft and <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> areas. These results may have an important clinical bearing in patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery. Further research is needed to determine whether implant survivorship is affected in patients living <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> and soft <b>water</b> regions...|$|R

25|$|Pet stores market zeolites {{for use as}} filter {{additives}} in aquaria. In aquaria, zeolites {{can be used to}} adsorb ammonia {{and other}} nitrogenous compounds. However, due to the high affinity of some zeolites for calcium, they may be less effective <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> and may deplete calcium. Zeolite filtration is used in some marine aquaria to keep nutrient concentrations low for the benefit of corals adapted to nutrient-depleted waters.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula CaCO3. It {{is a common}} substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which contains both of those minerals) and is {{the main component of}} pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> react with carbonate ions to create limescale. It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|If the {{environment}} is controlled (especially in recirculating systems), corrosion inhibitors can often be added to it. These chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> (Roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits), chromates, phosphates, polyaniline, other conducting polymers and {{a wide range of}} specially-designed chemicals that resemble surfactants (i.e. long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).|$|E

5000|$|Fluoride accumulates in {{the bone}} tissues of fish and in the {{exoskeleton}} of aquatic invertebrates. The mechanism of fluoride toxicity in aquatic organisms is believed to involve the action of fluoride ions as enzymatic poisons. In soft waters with low ionic content, invertebrates and fishes may suffer adverse effects from fluoride concentration as low as 0.5 mg/L. Negative affects are less <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> and seawaters, as the bioavailability of fluoride ions is reduced with increasing water hardness [...] Seawater contains fluoride at a concentration of 1.3 mg/L.|$|R
25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|E
25|$|Citric acid is an {{excellent}} chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It {{can be used to}} treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> <b>water,</b> it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{problems}} can be avoided at the design stage, by maximising the amount of hot element in the liquid, thus reducing the watts density. This reduces the working temperature of {{the surface of the}} element, reducing the build up of limescale. Watts density should be 40W/in (...) or below <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> areas, but can safely be 60W/in (...) where hard water is not an issue.|$|E
5000|$|Film may be rinsed in a dilute {{solution}} of a non-ionic wetting agent to assist uniform drying, which eliminates drying marks caused by <b>hard</b> <b>water.</b> (<b>In</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> areas, a pre-rinse in distilled water {{may be required}} - otherwise the final rinse wetting agent can cause residual ionic calcium on the film {{to drop out of}} solution, causing spotting on the negative.) ...|$|R
40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HS) in naturally acidic waterways {{have been}} suggested to provide protection to aquatic organisms exposed to low pH conditions. Despite this, {{little is known about}} the ability of HS to increase survivorship of freshwater organisms as pH decreases in waters of varying hardness. This study explored the ability of HS in the form of Aldrich humic acid (AHA) to increase survivorship of the freshwater shrimp (Caridina sp. D) at low pH in artificial soft (represent-ative of naturally acidic environments) and <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> (artificial and natural Dee River water). Freshwater shrimp were exposed to pH treatments ranging from pH 7 to pH 3. 5, with and without 10 or 20 mg/L HS treatments. In low pH water, shrimp mortality was higher <b>in</b> artificial <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> (LC 50 at pH 4. 95) and natural <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> (LC 50 at pH 4. 74), compared with soft water (LC 50 at pH 4. 27). HS substantially decreased the threshold at which pH caused 50 % mortality to the freshwater shrimp, with that threshold shifting from 4. 95 to 4. 47 <b>in</b> artificial <b>hard</b> <b>water,</b> from 4. 74 to 4. 50 <b>in</b> natural <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> and from 4. 27 to 4. 18 in soft water. The results of this study are valuable in contributing to an improved understanding of the influence HS and water hardness has on the toxicity of low pH to freshwater biota and may have important implications for the management of acidified waterways...|$|R

40|$|I {{examined}} {{the activity of}} fungi associated with yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and white oak (Quercus alba) leaves in two streams that differed in pH and alkalinity (a <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> stream [pH 8. 0] and a soft water stream [pH 6. 7]) and contained low concentrations of dissolved nitrogen (< 35 microg liter(- 1)) and phosphorus (< 3 microg liter(- 1)). The leaves of each species decomposed faster <b>in</b> the <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> stream (decomposition rates, 0. 010 and 0. 007 day(- 1) for yellow poplar and oak, respectively) than in the soft water stream (decomposition rates, 0. 005 and 0. 004 day(- 1) for yellow poplar and oak, respectively). However, within each stream, the rates of decomposition of {{the leaves of the}} two species were not significantly different. During the decomposition of leaves, the fungal biomasses determined from ergosterol concentrations, the production rates determined from rates of incorporation of [(14) C]acetate into ergosterol, and the sporulation rates associated with leaves were dynamic, typically increasing to maxima and then declining. The maximum rates of fungal production and sporulation associated with yellow poplar leaves were greater than the corresponding rates associated with white oak leaves <b>in</b> the <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> stream but not in the soft water stream. The maximum rates of fungal production associated with the leaves of the two species were higher <b>in</b> the <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> stream (5. 8 mg g(- 1) day(- 1) on yellow poplar leaves and 3. 1 mg g(- 1) day(- 1) on oak leaves) than in the soft water stream (1. 6 mg g(- 1) day(- 1) on yellow poplar leaves and 0. 9 mg g(- 1) day(- 1) on oak leaves), suggesting that effects of water chemistry other than the N and P concentrations, such as pH or alkalinity, may be important in regulating fungal activity in streams. In contrast, the amount of fungal biomass (as determined from ergosterol concentrations) on yellow poplar leaves was greater in the soft water stream (12. 8 % of detrital mass) than <b>in</b> the <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> stream (9. 6 % of detrital mass). This appeared to be due to the decreased amount of fungal biomass that was converted to conidia and released from the leaf detritus in the soft water stream...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{occurrence}} of different harmful species in agricultural practice necessitates that different plant protection chemicals be applied {{at the same}} time (tank mix). Mix components differ in purpose, mode of action and/or formulation, while addition of nonpesticide components (complex fertilizers, adjuvants and wetting agents) is widely practiced today. However, data concerning the effects of water quality used for preparation of working liquids on the biological effects of pesticides is still scarce. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine insecticidal effects as depending on components used in mixes and water hardness. The effects of mixtures of thiametoxam (Actara 25 -WG 0, 07 kg/ha) with azoxystrobin (Quadris 0. 75 l/ha), mancozeb (Dithane M- 70 2. 5 kg/ha), a complex fertilizer (Mortonijc plus 3 kg/ha) and a wetting agent (Silwet L- 77), depending on the components and <b>water</b> hardness(slightly <b>hard</b> (15. 4 d°) - tap water from Novi Sad, and very hard (34. 7 d°) - well water from Adica, a Novi Sad suburb), were determined in a bioassay based on adult mortality rate of the first generation of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). The mixtures were applied by a flooding method. The trial was set up to include four replications. Insecticidal effects were determined 24 h and 48 h after exposure. Thiametoxam effectiveness 24 h and 48 h after application <b>in</b> slightly <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> was 100 % when the insecticide was applied alone and in double and triple mixes with the fungicides, complex fertilizer and wetting agent, showing no dependency on mix components. The tested adult population of Colorado potato beetle demonstrated high susmceptibility to thiametoxam, while the other components had no impact <b>in</b> slightly <b>hard</b> <b>water.</b> <b>In</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>water,</b> 24 h after application, the insecticidal effect had the same level of significance to thiametoxam in double and triple mixes, with an exception of thiametoxam+mancozeb+Mortonijc plus and thiametoxam+mancozeb+wetting agent combinations, which showed significantly lower efficacy. After 48 h, substantially lowereffectiveness, in comparison with the sole insecticide and other combinations, was only observed in thiametoksam+mancozeb+Mortonjic plus combination. Significantly lower efficacy of that combination is probably due to an incompatibility of the macozeb preparation and the complex fertilizer containing boron (B), which was evidenced only <b>in</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R
