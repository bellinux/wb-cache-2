5|$|The {{isotopes}} neptunium-235, -236, and -237 are {{predicted to}} be fissile; only neptunium-237's fissionability has been experimentally shown, with the critical mass being about 60kg, only about 10kg {{more than that}} of the commonly used uranium-235. Calculated values of the critical masses of neptunium-235, -236, and -237 respectively are 66.2kg, 6.79kg, and 63.6kg: the neptunium-236 value is even lower than that of plutonium-239. In particular 236Np also has a low neutron cross section. Despite this, a neptunium atomic bomb has never been built: uranium and plutonium have lower critical masses than 235Np and 237Np, and 236Np is difficult to purify as it is not found in quantity in spent nuclear fuel and <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to separate in any significant quantities from its parent 237Np.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{industries}} on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism, and research. In 2007, there were 484 {{people working in}} the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing {{is owned by the}} various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; {{there are only a few}} privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution.|$|E
5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus {{is just a}} very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences {{in the construction of}} the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E

5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E

Specifically, pressure rise (p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (ρ), diameter (D), viscosity (μ) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter.

25|$|These {{findings}} {{may be useful}} for aligning Schwann cells in a nervous system injury to promote the formation of bands of Bungner, which are crucial for maintaining the endoneurial tube that guides the regrowing axons back to their targets. It <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to align Schwann cells by external physical techniques; thus, the discovery of an alternative technique for alignment is significant.

25|$|Cracking of the {{concrete}} section <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and concrete mix design. Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a serviceability failure in limit state design. Cracking is normally {{the result of an}} inadequate quantity of rebar, or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.|$|E
25|$|Lens aberrations are ignored. Including {{the effects}} of aberrations <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible,</b> because doing so {{requires}} knowledge of the specific lens design. Moreover, in well-designed lenses, most aberrations are well corrected, and at least near the optical axis, often are almost negligible when the lens is stopped down 2–3 steps from maximum aperture. Because lenses usually are stopped down at least to this point when DOF is of interest, ignoring aberrations usually is reasonable. Not all aberrations are reduced by stopping down, however, so actual sharpness may be slightly less than predicted by DOF formulas.|$|E
