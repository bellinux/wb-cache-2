5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to <b>just</b> <b>run</b> down {{the clock to}} ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford took to the air, {{throwing}} a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two {{and a half minutes}} had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old Lad feels snubbed {{when the}} three-year-old Wolf does not {{invite him to}} join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and bull terrier mix, for a run in the woods. Later, Lad goes for a walk, {{following}} their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting Lad pass, Rex viciously attacks him. With his teeth dulled by old age, Lad is unable to really fight back. Refusing to <b>just</b> <b>run,</b> he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, half a mile away. Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, Lad manages to {{get close enough to}} the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had <b>just</b> <b>run</b> into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of the King Road Drag was that it firmed up dirt roads by leaving a crown in the middle, which caused rain water to <b>just</b> <b>run</b> off, keeping the road dry and firm. Its crowning virtue was that, unlike pressing stone into the mud road surface, it was very quick and very inexpensive. The method quickly caught on.|$|E
25|$|Play started 15 {{minutes early}} again on day 4, but Buttler lasted {{less than four}} overs into the day's play, stumped by Ramdin off Bishoo, but Root and Jordan managed a quick 39-run {{partnership}} for the eighth wicket before Jordan was deemed to have been <b>just</b> <b>run</b> out by Holder for 16, followed by Broad for a duck after a review found the ball brushed his glove on the way through to slip. Root continued to farm the strike opposite Anderson for the final wicket, only for the innings {{to be brought to}} an abrupt end when Anderson was run out, having failed to ground his bat behind the crease when he could have easily saved himself. The wicket denied Root the chance of a double-century, as he finished not out on 182, with England all out for 464. England made an early breakthrough yet again as the West Indies began their second innings, Anderson bowling Devon Smith for 2 runs, but a 142-run partnership between Brathwaite and Bravo restored the West Indies to 145/2 following the dismissal of Bravo by Broad. The home side were on 202/2 at stumps, helped by a century from Brathwaite, leaving them 37 runs ahead of England going into {{the final day of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|The {{first leg}} of United's quarter-final against Roma was played at the Stadio Olimpico on 1 April 2008. Ryan Giggs started the match on the bench, which meant that Rio Ferdinand was handed the {{captaincy}} and Park Ji-sung was given his first Champions League appearance of the season, while Michael Carrick {{was able to take}} his position in the midfield three despite having missed the team's training session the day before. The match started fairly evenly, but it was Roma who had the first meaningful attempt on goal, with Christian Panucci heading just over from a corner. On the half hour, United's defence suffered a major setback as Nemanja Vidić fell awkwardly after jumping for a header. His place in central defence was taken by John O'Shea. Nevertheless, with just five minutes of the half remaining, the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the right hand side of the Roma penalty area. With his options limited, he played a ball at head-height into the centre of the penalty area, where Cristiano Ronaldo, who had <b>just</b> <b>run</b> full speed from near the centre circle, was ready to power a header past Roma keeper Doni. Buoyed by the cushion of the away goal, United started the second half confidently, prising a desperate Roma side apart with crisp passing along the floor. On the hour mark, in response to a header on goal by Mirko Vučinić that brought about a world class save from Edwin van der Sar, Alex Ferguson called for his team to adopt a more conservative formation, bringing on Owen Hargreaves to replace Anderson. United seemed more comfortable playing in a 4–4–2 formation, and the change paid immediate dividends, as Rooney pounced on Doni's mishandling of Park's header to poke the ball home for 2–0. The Reds continued to threaten, but were forced to defend well to prevent Roma from taking any goals with them to Old Trafford. The match finished 2–0, putting United in a comfortable position going into the second leg on 9 April.|$|E

However, he had a problem with the scene in which one of the Syndicate members changes into an alien rebel, reasoning that this was because the effect had been created on such short notice.

500|$|Disney, {{which had}} no {{intention}} of producing a sequel, rejected Tribune's claim and gave Beatty back most of the rights in May 2005. That same month, Beatty filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles, California Superior Court seeking $30 million in damages against the Tribune and a declaration over the rights. Bertram Fields, Beatty's lawyer, said the original 1985 agreement with the Tribune was negotiated specifically to allow Beatty a chance to make another Dick Tracy film. [...] "It was very carefully done and they just ignored it," [...] he stated. [...] "The Tribune is a big, powerful company and they think they can <b>just</b> <b>run</b> roughshod over people.

500|$|Several {{important}} and unimportant Roman roads, {{such as the}} Via Cassia, overlie Etruscan precursors, but there are sufficient Etruscan sites that were neglected after their conquest to allow {{an understanding of the}} considerable Etruscan road system. Roads did not <b>just</b> <b>run</b> between cities, but out into the countryside to allow agricultural produce to be easily brought in. [...] While not as heavily engineered as Roman roads, considerable efforts went into creating a road surface that on major routes could be as wide as 10.4 metres, on a 12 kilometre stretch connecting Cerveteri with its port Pyrgi, made in the 5th century. [...] This had a gravel surface, between tufo edging-blocks, and a central drainage channel.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{began with}} a demo session at a small church in Woodstock, which was not {{intended}} to produce any official releases. During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums (Astral Weeks and Moondance), recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before ("Crazy Face" [...] and [...] "Give Me a Kiss"), as well as two instrumentals. Limited recording equipment was used, operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar, who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time.

She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her [...] "want to <b>just</b> <b>run</b> around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure {{that she needed to}} go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since [...] "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need {{to figure out a way}} to be different".|$|E
500|$|William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet {{inspired}} the lyrics for [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke {{wanted to work}} lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: [...] "I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't <b>just</b> <b>run</b> away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts." [...] Yorke compared {{the opening of the}} song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more [...] "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{gravity and}} other data suggest that near the {{southern}} tip of Whidbey Island the Crescent Formation contact may turn away from the SWIF, and may even be reentrant under north Seattle, forming the northwestern side of the Seattle Basin, and possibly connecting with the recently reported [...] "Bremerton trend" [...] of faulting running from the southern end of Hood Canal, through Sinclair Inlet (Bremerton), and across Puget Sound.
