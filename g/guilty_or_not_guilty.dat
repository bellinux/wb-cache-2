25|$|Much {{like other}} war {{crimes of the}} era, the {{verdicts}} were handed down in verdicts of either <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty.</b> In all cases, except for Meyer-Gerhards, the accused received punishment. In many of the cases, the sentences were reduced from their previous issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} with Nilsen being {{asked by the}} chief {{administrator}} of the court whether he entered a plea of <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> in relation to each charge. In response to each charge, Nilsen entered a plea of not guilty. Upon completion of his pleas, the jury was sworn into the courtroom.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} issues {{as to the}} {{capacity}} of Bonjon for the jury to consider: firstly, whether Bonjon {{had the capacity to}} enter a plea to the jurisdiction; and secondly, whether Bonjon had the capacity to enter a plea to the general issue, that is, a plea of <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Style Court (E! network, 2003-2004) The Style Network, sister {{network to}} E TV, {{produces}} Style Court, on which people haul their friends, neighbors and co-workers into court before style expert Judge Henry Roth. These defendants were tried for alleged crimes of fashion, trend misdemeanors and other style infractions. The judge hears the evidence, consults the jury, and hands down a verdict of <b>guilty</b> (makeover) <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> (no makeover). The series features Doug Llewelyn (former host of [...] "The People's Court") as commentator.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{cases can}} be {{disposed}} of {{without the need for}} a trial. [...] In fact, the vast majority are. [...] If the accused confesses his or her guilt, a shorter process may be employed and a judgment may be rendered more quickly. Some nations, such as America, allow plea bargaining in which the accused pleads <b>guilty,</b> nolo contendere <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty,</b> and may accept a diversion program or reduced punishment, where the prosecution's case is weak or in exchange for the cooperation of the accused against other people. This reduced sentence is sometimes a reward for sparing the state the expense of a formal trial. Many nations do not permit the use of plea bargaining, believing that it coerces innocent people to plead guilty in an attempt to avoid a harsh punishment.|$|R
25|$|At the Dachau Trials, {{the issue}} of whether the donning of enemy uniforms to {{approach}} the enemy without drawing fire was within the laws of war was established under international humanitarian law at the trial in 1947 of the planner and commander of Operation Greif, Otto Skorzeny. Skorzeny was found not guilty by an American military tribunal of a crime by ordering his men into action in American uniforms. He had passed on to his men the warning of German legal experts, that if they fought in American uniforms, they would be breaking the laws of war, but they probably were not doing so just by wearing American uniforms. During the trial, a number of arguments were advanced to substantiate this position and that the German and U.S. military seem to be in agreement on it. In its judgement, the tribunal noted that the case did not require that the tribunal make findings other than those of <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty,</b> so consequently, no safe conclusion could be drawn from the acquittal of all accused.|$|E
2500|$|The current Czech {{criminal}} {{legislation has}} implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether {{to find a}} defendant <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty)</b> and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting {{the extent of the}} punishment imposed). It has three levels, to wit: ...|$|E
2500|$|After this, Judge Willis put the {{question}} to the jury, who unanimously decided that Bonjon did not have the capacity to enter a plea to the jurisdiction. At Judge Willis' suggestion, and with the agreement of the parties, {{the question}} as to the general plea was put to the jury without recalling the witnesses: the jury decided that Bonjon had capacity to know whether he did or did not kill Yammowing, but not to plead <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty,</b> [...] "as murder is not always considered a crime with the Aborigines".|$|E
5000|$|To this {{indictment}} he {{has pleaded}} <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> {{and it is}} your charge to say, having heard the evidence, whether he be <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Judge Willis however {{considered}} that Bonjon [...] "is not so totally wanting intellect as <b>not</b> to say <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty", and thus {{decided that the}} case could proceed {{to the question of}} jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Schneider: Okay. Are {{you saying}} <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> meaning they couldn’t prove it <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> meaning {{that you were}} {{innocent}} of it? It's different.|$|R
2500|$|A jury is a sworn body {{of people}} convened to render an {{impartial}} verdict (a {{finding of fact}} on a question) officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. Modern juries tend {{to be found in}} courts to ascertain the guilt, or lack thereof, in a crime. [...] In Anglophone jurisdictions, the verdict may be <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> (not proven; a verdict of acquittal, based on the state's failure to prove guilt rather than any proof of innocence, is also available in Scotland). The old institution of grand juries still exists in some places, particularly the United States, to investigate whether enough evidence of a crime exists to bring someone to trial.|$|E
2500|$|Tuckfield was {{the next}} witness called, and he testified that Bonjon [...] "entertains some ideas of a Supreme Being", but that his ideas were [...] "very {{imperfect}} and indistinct notions, not sufficient for him {{to understand the nature}} and obligations of an oath." [...] Justice Willis explained to Tuckfield the nature of a plea to the jurisdiction, after which Tuckfield added that he did not think Bonjon could enter such a plea, although he was satisfied Bonjon could plead <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty.</b> On cross-examination by Croke, Tuckfield testified that [...] "urder is considered a crime amongst the Aboriginals, but under all circumstances I do not think they would consider it as such, there are some exceptions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{areas where}} two values {{is a good}} choice are the law and mathematics. In {{everyday}} relaxed conversation, nuanced or complex answers such as [...] "maybe" [...] or [...] "only on the weekend" [...] are acceptable. In more focused situations such as a court of law or theorem-based mathematics however it is deemed advantageous to frame questions so as to admit a simple yes-or-no answer—is the defendant <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty,</b> is the proposition true or false—and to disallow any other answer. However much of a straitjacket this might prove in practice for the respondent, the principle of the simple yes-no question has become a central feature of both judicial and mathematical logic, making two-valued logic deserving of organization and study in its own right.|$|E
