40|$|In {{order to}} explicate the {{relevance}} of the island dimension for political categories, for each of seven political institutions, a series of four comparisons are conducted on a global basis. The first is between small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> and all other states, the second is between small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> and larger <b>island</b> <b>states,</b> the third is between small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> and small mainland states, and the fourth is between <b>island</b> <b>states</b> and mainland states, regardless of size. The finding is that islandness links in many instances to the choice of institutional settings. Political scientists are therefore well-advised to include in their analyses islandness among the factors that shape institutional choices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{argues that}} the need for {{institutional}} capacity-building for development is essential for small <b>island</b> <b>states,</b> more so than larger ones, due mostly to the former’s high degree of exposure to exogenous shocks. Given that small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> tend to depend heavily on international trade, an appropriate institutional set-up for such states would need to be one that promotes competitiveness. Given also that small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> are highly exposed to external shocks, their institutional set-up should promote economic resilience. In addition, given that environmental concerns are so closely interlinked with economic development in small <b>island</b> <b>states,</b> it is essential that the institutional set-up in these states promotes sustainable development. However, the paper also recognises that weaknesses in institutional capacities is a common constraint shared by small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> and this poses a major challenge in responding to the changing international trade environment...|$|R

40|$|Aid is an {{important}} resource for developing countries. Many small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> (including those in the Pacific) are highly reliant on aid to supplement meagre government resources and other foreign capital inflows.

5|$|M-185 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan that circles Mackinac Island, a popular tourist destination on the Lake Huron side of the Straits of Mackinac, along the island's shoreline. A narrow paved road of , it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the Upper and the Lower peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and Michigan. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The City of Mackinac Island, which shares jurisdiction over the island with the Mackinac <b>Island</b> <b>State</b> Park Commission (MISPC), calls the highway Main Street within the built-up area on the island's southeast quadrant, and Lake Shore Road elsewhere. M-185 passes by several important sites within Mackinac <b>Island</b> <b>State</b> Park, including Fort Mackinac, Arch Rock, British Landing, and Devil's Kitchen. Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water's edge and woodlands outside the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|As a {{circular}} highway, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted {{starting point is}} at the mile0 marker {{placed in front of}} the Mackinac <b>Island</b> <b>State</b> Park Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these signs are erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard state highway reassurance markers along this roadway. M-185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-154 on Harsens Island. No part of M-185 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year.|$|E
5|$|Bordering to {{the north}} of Blue Spring State Park is Hontoon <b>Island</b> <b>State</b> Park, {{accessible}} only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare Timucua totem representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island. The figure may signify that its creators were part of the owl clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge {{at the bottom of the}} river. River otters (Lutra canadensis) can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of human contact.|$|E

5|$|Further to the southwest, at {{the mouth}} of the Aransas River, the town of Black Point was {{established}} in the 1840s. The site was attacked by Indians several times before the settlement was abandoned. However, it was reestablished in the early 20th century as the present-day city of Bayside. Bayside developers aimed to attract fruit and vegetable growers to the plots made available and advertised nationwide, but large amounts of land were purchased by speculators, raising demand and forcing further annexation. The 2000 census reported that 360 people lived in the city. The cities of Fulton and Rockport were established on Aransas Bay in the late 19th century, and later expanded development along most of the eastern shore of Copano Bay. Such developments include Copano Village, which registered 210 residents in 2000, and the 1,000 resident Holiday Beach community just west of Goose <b>Island</b> <b>State</b> Park on Lamar Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Midway between Fulton and the Minetto {{hamlet of}} the same name, NY48 serves Battle <b>Island</b> <b>State</b> Park, named for a small island in the Oswego River a short {{distance}} to the north. NY48 presses onward {{along the edge of}} the Oswego to the hamlet of Minetto, where it intersects CR24, formerly NY48A. North of the hamlet, NY48 passes by the Oswego Country Club as it enters the Oswego city limits. Once in the City of Oswego, NY48 becomes West First Street. At Utica Street, NY48 briefly turns west before turning back north at West Fifth Street and terminating at NY104 (Bridge Street). West First Street continues north for an additional six blocks to the Lake Ontario shoreline. NY48 is city-maintained within the cities of Fulton and Oswego; the rest of the highway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E
5|$|The Meadowbrook State Parkway {{was first}} envisioned in 1924 {{as part of}} the Long <b>Island</b> <b>State</b> Park Commission (LISPC) and Robert Moses's system to connect several parks in Nassau and Suffolk counties. One park {{included}} in the proposal was Jones Beach State Park, which opened along with the Ocean Parkway in 1929. Construction of the Meadowbrook and Loop causeways began in July 1933, and was slated for completion in January 1935. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation loaned $5,050,000 toward the project, which was completed in October 1934. Nassau County acquired the right-of-way for an extension to the Northern State Parkway in 1936, and the highway was originally intended to be finished for the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The start of construction was ultimately delayed until December 1953, and the $10million (1953 USD) highway was completed in October 1956.|$|E
5000|$|Cooperation {{among the}} small <b>island</b> <b>states,</b> the {{scientific}} community, {{and the environmental}} community on this scale would be historically unprecedented, {{but it would not}} be the first time the small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> have mobilized politically and became powerful agents of environmental change. In fact, a concerted effort by a group of small <b>island</b> <b>states</b> put climate change on the UN agenda back in 1988, when Malta persuaded the General Assembly to recognize the potential for [...] "severe economic and social consequences" [...] from climate change. The Republic of Maldives followed suit by hosting the 1989 Small States Conference on Sea Level Rise, which resulted in the [...] "Malé Declaration on Global Warming and Sea Level Rise". The Conference also saw the creation of an Action Group on climate change consisting of more than 30 small <b>island</b> <b>states,</b> later to become the Alliance of Small <b>Island</b> <b>States</b> (AOSIS). This momentum continued through the 1992 [...] "Earth Summit" [...] in Rio de Janeiro, where AOSIS, aided by the Foundation for Environmental Law and Development (FIELD) and other NGOs, successfully lobbied for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It was thus fitting that the Maldives became the first signatory to the third protocol of the UNFCCC, also known as the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R
