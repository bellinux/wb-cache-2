5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} {{can be found}} in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.|$|E

These improvements were mainly backed by foreign capital and were done to benefit his close supporters and foreign investors. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> he showed less concern for the common Mexican people. During 1883-1894, laws were passed to give fewer and fewer people large amounts of land. Land was taken away from people by bribing local judges to declare them vacant. Díaz's friend obtained 12 million acres of land in Baja California by bribing local judges. Those who opposed were killed or captured and sold as slaves to plantations.|$|E
25|$|The rosary was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima reported by three Portuguese children in 1917.

According to Lucia Santos (one of the three children) in one of the apparitions the Virgin Mary has a rosary {{in one hand and a}} Brown scapular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> Reports of the Fatima apparitions helped spread rosary devotions and a Fatima prayer is now often added to the end of rosary recitations.

Against Stosur, Sharapova has a perfect record of 9–0 including 3 straight set wins in the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson Open, the final of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, and the quarterfinal of the Western & Southern Open. Azarenka, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> has a mixed record against Li and Stosur.

However, against Stosur, Azarenka has never lost a match and a set winning their four encounters, with their last meeting coming in semifinal of the 2010 Bank of the West Classic with the Belorussian winning 6–2, 6–3. In the match-up between Slam champions Li and Stosur, despite Stosur having lost all matches against Sharapova and Azarenka, she has never lost to Li winning their 5 matches including 3 in 2011 in the semifinal of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the third rounds of Rogers Cup and Western & Southern Open.|$|E

500|$|The novel also {{deals with}} the issue of globalisation. Courteau {{observed}} that although Little Bee learns English from newspapers she acquires at the English detention centre, her reference points are still Nigerian, and thus through her narrative voice Cleave [...] "illustrates the forcible dislocations of a globalized world." [...] Cleave chose to explore the issue <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Hand</b> as he believes that, although globalisation is frequently discussed, people rarely consider its meaning. He explained: [...] "money can move freely across national borders, but people can't. They're actively prevented from going where the money is. Capital is global, but labour isn't. I believe that's the cause of two major crises that we're involved in as a species – one is a financial crisis and one is a refugee crisis. Imagine a world where money can't move, where capital is stuck in its country of origin, but people can freely move where the work is! That's an alternate interpretation of globalization that would solve a lot of problems." [...] Although Cleave did not intend for the novel to be heavily political, he felt it was important to raise the issue, given the refugee subject matter of The Other Hand.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{characters}} <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Hand</b> are Little Bee, a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah, {{a middle-class}} Englishwoman. Critics {{have focused on}} the contrast between the two, with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear [...] "insipid" [...] to readers, and that when juxtaposed with Little Bee, she seems [...] "unsympathetic, even tiresome". Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah [...] "batty, bizarre and inconsistent, and despite the tragedy she has suffered, unsympathetic", while writing that in contrast: [...] "Goodness peppers every atom of [...] being." [...] Other reviewers took an opposite stance. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee's characterisation problematic, writing: [...] "Sometimes she's not convincing, and sometimes she tries too hard to convince. It's too often apparent that Little Bee is not real. This doesn't do justice to her story, and puts the burden back on the author to show that he's representing her, rather than exploiting her." [...] Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Bee's arch reasonableness and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too-cute cipher", and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character.|$|E
500|$|Christina Lee, {{an editor}} for Idolator, {{noticed that the}} song [...] "sounds like Zayn asked 'Channel Orange' {{producer}} Malay for {{his own version of}} Frank Ocean’s 'Bad Religion,' though it suffers because his writing and singing aren’t nearly as gripping." [...] Sam Richards of NME agreed, noting that [...] "the beginning of ‘It’s You’ sounds like that album’s ‘Bad Religion’, with its melancholy jazz chords and confessional vocals – though it’s debatable how much Zayn is ready to confess." [...] Michael Cragg of The Guardian also saw similarities, expressing that [...] "Zayn [...] "showcases his Frank Ocean-esque falsetto on the sad-eyed, organ-drenched [...]" [...] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times also perceived influences of Ocean. Sarah Murphy of Exclaim! thought that the track worked for showing a [...] "more mature content and a sleeker, less bubblegum-y pop sound" [...] and credited Malay for the feat. Spins Andrew Unterberger also praised the producer for [...] "serving up most of the LP’s highlights," [...] which included [...] "the lightly quaking Beach House gauze" [...] song. He also praised Zayn's voice for [...] "floating like a paper airplane above the tremors." [...] While selecting as a [...] "standout" [...] track, Daniel Bromfield of Pretty Much Amazing called it [...] "theatrical." [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone called it a [...] "tepid ballad." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Astrologer's {{instruments}} (horologium and palm) are a {{plumb line}} and sighting instrument.

The latter was held close to the eye, the former <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> perhaps at arms length.

2500|$|His {{nickname}} [...] "Pipette" [...] was {{a reference}} to his smoking habits, which at several stages saw him smoking on the field. Quite famously {{in a game against}} Wigan (which was played in a snowstorm), he actually caught the ball with one hand while holding a cigarette <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> While he often had unusual habits for a sportsman, there was no denying his talent, he was a master at kicking in play and in overall attack he was both unorthodox and unpredictable. Aside from his playing skill, he developed a reputation based on his somewhat eccentric attitude or charismatic manner. He was known to not tackle a player if he believed it would demonstrate the fault of his team-mates for not previously making the tackle, a cause of some controversy during his career.|$|E
