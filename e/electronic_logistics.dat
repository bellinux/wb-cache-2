40|$|As B 2 B {{e-business}} {{shifted to}} the Internet, Electronic Marketplaces (EMs) have grown rapidly in usage (Rask & Kragh, 2004). Definitions of an EM are diverse. One of the earliest and broadest definitions is offered by Bakos (1991), who referred to an EM as “an inter-organizational system that allows the participating buyers and sellers to exchange information about price and product offerings”. In the context of logistics, EMs can be termed <b>Electronic</b> <b>Logistics</b> Marketplaces (ELMs), referring to an electronic hub using web-based systems that link shippers and carriers together {{for the purpose of}} collaboration and/or trading (Wang, Potter, & Naim, 2007 a). ELM is a context specific type of EM, which facilitates the provision of logistics services. Traditional forms of communication between a shipper and a carrier are rather fragmented when a shipper has a number of carriers to manage. Such one-toone exchanges can be costly and sometimes very time-consuming. Communicating through an ELM allows the connection of a number of shippers and carriers using a single interface, normally a Webbased system. This has brought advantages to organizations in terms of low cost inter-organization information connectivity, (near) real time visibility, and flexible partnership configurations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} <b>electronic</b> <b>logistics</b> marketplaces (ELMs), especially closed systems based on long-term relationships between shippers and carriers. It aims to establish likely operational models and investigate their relationship with tailored logistics. Design/methodology/approach – Multiple case-studies with shippers, carriers and technology providers, involving interviews, process mapping, work-shops and system demonstrations. Findings – Key attributes in relation to processes, relationships and technology are identified. Finding reveal that the ELM business model is still at its infancy stage but with huge potential for growth in optimizing supply chain networks, and enabling the provision of tailored logistics. Practical implications – Business-to-business electronic marketplaces are becoming more common in practice. By characterizing the different operational models, decision makers in logistics can identify which structure is best suited for their particular application. The paper confirms the existence of three distinct ELM structures, while also specifying their key attributes. It provides a foundation for future research in this developing field. Originality/value – Research on ELMs is scarce.

40|$|Since the 1990 s {{there has}} been a rich {{literature}} on business-to-business electronic marketplaces. While many aspects of supply chain management have been considered, {{there are only a few}} studies which investigate the development and application of these electronic marketplaces in logistics.

The paper aims to understand the rationale behind a particular type of ELM, termed ‘collaborative ELM’, and evaluates the impact of introducing such an ELM. To do this, an in depth case study in the UK fast moving consumer goods industry is used. Data has been collected from shippers, transport companies and the technology provider using a range of tools, including interviews, quantitative data analysis and process mapping. The research reveals that the collaborative ELM is still a relatively new business model. It has potential for growth in optimizing supply chain networks and enabling not only vertical collaboration between shippers and carriers but also horizontal collaboration between shippers and/or between carriers. It identifies the motives behind a collaborative ELM, and demonstrates how such a system is implemented through the configurations of information system, process and collaborative arrangements. The impact on the different participating parties is also examined. Finally the necessary conditions for a successful implementation are derived in the light of the research findings...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the role of {{e-business}} as a fundamental element that links organisations of the supply chain into a unified and coordinated system has been increasingly recognised in the literature. Recent technological advances enable a proliferation of B 2 B e-business systems in supporting interorganisational e-business integration, but also create more complexities for organisations in determining what form of electronic linkage and relationship configurations should be forged with what kind of business partner(s). At the same time, as customers become more demanding, there is a trend towards providing tailored logistics provisions {{in order to satisfy}} different customers' needs. Consequently, careful design of information flows within and between the organizations is required. In view of the aforementioned, there is need for a design of an overall e-business architecture which governs and specifies the different inter-organisation information coordinate and control (ICC) mechanisms for different logistics scenarios, referred to here as a B 2 B e-business reference architecture (ERA). Historically this research area has not received due attention from researchers or practitioners. Therefore, the primary aim of this thesis is to develop such an ERA and substantiate it through empirical research, focusing its application on an emerging e-business model termed an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Logistics</b> Marketplaces (ELM). The first part of this research is analytical, developing the B 2 B ERA through the synthesis of literature and the use of secondary case examples. Four architectures are proposed with detailed characterisation: Centralised Market, Traditional Hierarchical Coordination. Modified Hierarchical Coordination, and Heterarchical Network. The second part of the research is empirical, since it validates the conceptual model developed through six case studies. It shows that one size does not fit all, and there should be different architectures for different logistics scenarios. The study also establishes a fundamental understanding of closed ELMs which have not been studied in-depth and systematically. Through analysis of three key elements, namely, technology, collaboration and process, the likely operational models and the relationship between ELMs and tailored logistics are established. Reasons for using closed ELMs are also identified through the exploration of motives, barriers, costs and benefits. A major case study is conducted to investigate the Heterarchical Network type of ELM, later after being termed as 'collaborative ELM'. Reasons for the formation of this type of ELM, and the impact it brings to the supply chain are examined in detail, providing significant insights considering its rarity and novelty in practice. Finally the thesis summarises the research findings and their practical implications are discussed. Study limitations are acknowledged and possible future research directions are suggested.

40|$|The {{provision}} of logistics services {{relies heavily on}} effective intra- and particularly inter-organisational information exchange and communication to which ICT {{is seen as a}} key enabler. Effective communication among shippers (consignors), carriers and customers (consignees) helps to foster collaborative relationships, reduce uncertainties and performance-related errors, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and customer responsiveness. Innovative logistics practices that are based {{on the use of the}} state-of-art technologies are often referred to as 'smart logistics', i. e. flexible and able to cope with uncertainties. The proposed research is about understanding how increased connectivity and visibility enabled by recent advances in ICT, particularly the Internet, could be harnessed for innovative logistics provisions ('smart logistics') through the lens of defining and measuring communication flexibility. Even though much attention has been focused on the logistics flexibility concept in recent years, one critical dimension is missing - namely, communication flexibility. While the profound effect of ICT in supporting flexible operations, be it at supply chain level or manufacturing level, is well recognised, academic researchers need a more rigorous approach in assessing inter-organisational communication within the logistics context. This is the major driver and novelty of this proposal. Inter-organisational communication flexibility here is defined as the extent to which the firms are able to configure and reconfigure their information linkages in responding to the changing environment. The main objectives are to develop a conceptual model capturing the key indicators of communication flexibility and subsequently validate the model using a large scale survey. As a result, an appropriate method for assessing the level of communication flexibility and its impact to logistics performance will be established, thus laying the foundation for this important yet largely overlooked subject. The data required for this research will be acquired through three focus group discussions, six case studies and a survey of seven hundred plus companies targeting shippers, carriers and ICT providers in the UK. The proposed research is also timely; as it investigates and consolidates the key emerging technologies in the logistics field for instance real time tracking technologies using Global Positioning System (GPS) and <b>electronic</b> <b>logistics</b> marketplaces based on cloud computing solutions. Used separately or in combination they will facilitate interorganisational communication at different levels. Such technologies only emerged recently and therefore by incorporating them, this study advances and updates our knowledge towards the use of ICT in the logistics field. Consequently this research is of great value to practitioners as it will guide them to make sense out of and leverage such emerging technologies for competitive advantages...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assess the current status of information and communication technologies (ICT) initiatives on carbon emission reduction and in particular, investigate the potential effect of a recent advance in technology, i. e. <b>electronic</b> <b>logistics</b> marketplaces (ELMs) on environment sustainability. Given that the UK’s food and grocery industry is well known for its reputation in technological and business innovations for efficiency gains and cost saving, it is selected as an exemplar sector for study Research Approach: The research adopts a case-study based on both secondary and primary data. Two leading retailers conducted within the UK’s grocery sector have been selected as case examples in assessing the current ICT developments in carbon emission reduction. A collaborative ELM is chosen as the third case example in order to study its potential on environment sustainability Multiple data collection techniques are adopted including interviews, system demonstrations, site observation and the use of archival documents. Findings and Originality: In the UK’s grocery industry, the negative environmental impact of distribution activities is seem as a major challenge to the manufacturers and retailers (Fernie and Sparks 2009). Logistics is the third highest source of direct carbon emission in grocery sector (Hollingsworth, 2004). Through a systematic review of the current ICT practices in the UK’s grocery sector and a study of two leading retailers, {{this research}} finds that the deployment of telematics based technologies has delivered tangible economic and environmental benefits. This is mainly achieved through the change of drivers’ behaviours and a better scheduling and routing of vehicles. The sector sees the practice of using ELM to facilitate transport collaboration between companies but its full potential is yet to be explored. The analysis of the third case example, i. e. a collaborative ELM has demonstrated that the adoption of ELMs plays a significant role in facilitating efficient freight logistics provision by enabling horizontal (between shippers) and vertical (between shippers and carriers) collaborations between organisations, which then leads to a positive impact on reducing carbon footprint. The change of ownership model at the latter stage implies that there are significant barriers for a collaborative ELM to sustain in a long term. Those barriers include the lack of incentives for collaboration, technology immaturity and lack of unified performance measures for carbon footprint. Research Impact: This study advances our understanding about the role of ICT in carbon emissions reductions and lays a basis for further investigation, as currently there is limited research which attempts to address this issue. Further ELMs have seen rapid developments in recent years but still far from being settled. In particularly the study of ELM’s impact on environment sustainability has been very limited. This study presents interesting implications for academics. Practical Impact: The research provides valuable insights to practitioners on how to leverage the existing and emerging information technologies for environmental and economic benefits. Being aware of how ELMs impact on carbon emission reduction enables companies to attain both economic and environmental competitive advantages and avoid potential problems when using ELMs for logistics provisions...|$|E
