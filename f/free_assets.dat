We propose a robust portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio when the risk <b>free</b> <b>asset</b> is unknown, but is within a given interval. To compute the best Sharpe ratio portfolio all the Sharpe ratios for any risk <b>free</b> <b>asset</b> are considered and compared by using the so-called cross-efficiency evaluation.

40|$|It is {{standard}} in economics {{to assume that}} assets are normal goods and demand is downward sloping in price. This view has its theoretical foundation in the classic single period model of Arrow with one risky asset and one risk <b>free</b> <b>asset,</b> where both {{are assumed to be}} held long. However when short selling is allowed, we show that the risk <b>free</b> <b>asset</b> can not only fail to be a normal good but can in fact be a Gi¤en good even for widely popular members of the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) class of utility functions. Distinct regions in the price-income space are identi?ed in which the risk <b>free</b> <b>asset</b> exhibits normal, inferior and Gi¤en behavior. Moreover for uility functions with decreasing relative risk aversion, such as the weighted average constant relative risk aversion (WACRRA) class introduced in this paper, the risk <b>free</b> <b>asset</b> can become a Gi¤en good only when it is held long. Examples are provided in which Gi¤en behavior occurs over multiple ranges of income. The analysis is also extended to a two period setting...|$|R

50|$|On 11 March {{the court}} heard {{testimony}} from Opes Prime's erstwhile head of operations. She had {{carried out a}} number of transactions at Emini's behest to bolster the margin positions of a number of accounts including Riqueza, those of Chris Murphy and also others. She indicated that the first such transaction occurred on 27 June 2006 when Emini had used $17.4 million worth of Norm Seckold's shares (from Emini's and Smith's company Leveraged Capital) to support the margin position of Riqueza. By early March 2008 this approach saw $95 million of Norm Seckold's holding of Coeur d'Alene Mines being held as collateral by Opes Prime for borrowings by Riqueza and accounts associated with Riqueza. This would suggest that Emini had transferred shares owned by Leveraged Capital to Riqueza to be lodged with Opes Prime as collateral for Riqueza's borrowings. Opes Prime had in turn lodged these shares with ANZ Bank to support its borrowing position. The problem with this transaction was that although the shares were owned by Leveraged Capital, they were in reality collateral for Norm Seckold's borrowings rather than <b>free</b> <b>assets</b> of Leveraged Capital.|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{evidence on the}} determinants of the outcomes of bankruptcy petitions using Korean firms for the period from 1977 to 1994. We hypothesize that a firm with more <b>free</b> <b>assets,</b> less liquid assets, longer existing period, larger size, lower operating risk, and more goodwill would have higher survival prospects from the bankruptcy petition. The results from logit estimation confirm this hypothesis. The <b>free</b> <b>assets,</b> existing period, firm size, and goodwill have positive influence on the probability of reorganization, while the liquid assets, and operating risk are negatively related to the probability of reorganization. Among these variables, the <b>free</b> <b>assets</b> percentage {{is the most significant}} at the one percent level in determining the outcomes of bankruptcy petitions. This reveals that a bankrupt firm with more <b>free</b> <b>assets</b> tends to be reorganized because {{it would be easy to}} obtain additional financing needed for the successful reorganization. The liquid assets and existing period are also significant at the five percent level. We conclude that a firm with more <b>free</b> <b>assets,</b> less liquid assets, and longer existing period would have higher survival prospects in Korea.
