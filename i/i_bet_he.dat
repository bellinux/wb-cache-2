2500|$|The show also {{contained}} numerous meta references: {{an awareness that}} the viewer was actually watching a parody. Unlike many parodies that are done in a straightforward manner for effect, French and Saunders uses the viewer's awareness {{of what is going}} on to further stretch out the joke. For example, in their parody of Peter Jackson's fantasy film epic The Lord of the Rings, an encounter between Frodo and Galadriel are thrown off when Saunders delivers her line: [...] "I have passed the test, and now I will diminish, and go to the West and remain Galadriel", in which French responds: [...] "You will what, sorry?", and Saunders replies: [...] "I will diminish... I don't understand, it's in the book". Other characters that make a recurring appearance are the bald, fat, perverted old men ("Begging for it, she is!"); Star Test (most memorable character is Sonia, played by French: [...] "What car do you drive?" [...] "Brookside"); and Star Pets ("What a lovely dog Lady Fortescue <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he</b> dos {sic} tricks").|$|E

5000|$|In a 1978 BBC Radio 1 interview, Lydon {{alluded to}} the sordid conduct by Jimmy Savile, {{as well as the}} {{suppression}} of negative information about Savile by mainstream social forces many decades in advance of it becoming a public scandal. Lydon stated: [...] "I'd like to kill Jimmy Savile; I think <b>he's</b> a hypocrite. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he's</b> into all kinds of seediness that we all know about, but are not allowed to talk about.

6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] said Mr. Mariner. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he</b> doesn't {{have the}} trouble with help that we have here.

5000|$|Liane Bonin Starr of HitFix {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, saying [...] "Things {{are now at}} their darkest, but somehow this {{in-between}} episode was still frustrating. Rumple was dismissed too quickly, Wendy spat out some exposition and then receded into the background, and Henry's bad decision didn't feel particularly well-played. I realize that Henry needed to commit fully to Pan, but I didn't feel Pan's case was ever entirely convincing -- not for a kid who only recently found his [...] "real" [...] parents. I guess Henry, being the good kid that he is, {{just wanted to do}} the right thing—even as his parents had tiny heart attacks watching him do it. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he's</b> getting grounded when they all get back to Storybrooke!" ...|$|R
5000|$|O’Neill {{recalled}} that Kara had nudged him and said, [...] "Years from now, historians will wonder {{what was on}} the young man’s mind as he strode to take his oath of office. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he’s</b> asking himself how George Kara got such a good seat." [...] That night, O’Neill and his wife danced over to the president’s box at the ball in the Mayflower Hotel to congratulate him, and sure enough, Kennedy asked, [...] "Was that George Kara sitting beside you?" [...] O’Neill told Kennedy what Kara had said, and J.F.K replied, [...] "Tip, you’ll never believe it. I had my left hand on the Bible and my right hand in the air, and I was about to take the oath of office, and I said to myself, 'How the hell did Kara get that seat?'" ...|$|R

Why, it'll be {{a couple}} of years before the ship is paid off, and by then he'll have {{forgotten}} all about her. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he</b> was pretty mad when he woke up and found he'd been shanghaied, and I shouldn't wonder but he wanted to fight somebody.

6000|$|... "How could he? I don't drink very much, and {{you know}} it. I don't hardly touch a drop, except maybe just for sociability. God! this temperance wave gets my goat!

6000|$|He {{went to the}} window, and, {{lifting a}} corner of the blind, looked out. [...] "There he is, still staring at the sea and the sky, and there I daresay he will be till dawn. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he</b> has {{forgotten}} all about Mary now, and is thinking of his electrical machine. What a curiosity! Good heavens; what a curiosity! Ah, I wonder what they would have made of him in my old mess five and thirty years ago?" [...] And quite overcome by this reflection, the Colonel shook his grizzled head, put out the candle, and retired to rest.|$|E

2500|$|Former Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd vocalist John Lydon {{alluded to}} sordid conduct by Savile, {{as well as}} {{suppression}} of widely held knowledge about such activity, in an October 1978 interview recorded for BBC Radio 1.

[...] As predicted, the comment was edited out by the BBC prior to broadcasting, but the complete interview was included as a bonus track on a re-release of Public Image Ltd's 1978 debut album [...] in 2013, after Savile's death. In October 2014, Lydon expanded on his original quote, saying: [...] "By killed I meant locking him up and stopping him assaulting young children... I'm disgusted at the media pretending they weren't aware." ...|$|R

'So he had his griego wrapped close round him, and I judged he was not dry-handed; so I thought {{it was best to}} speak proper, and so he believed I was a Manks man, and I kept ay between him and her, for fear she had whistled. And then we began to drink about, and then <b>I</b> <b>betted</b> <b>he</b> would not drink out a quartern of Hollands without drawing breath, and then he tried it, and just then Slounging Jock and Dick Spur'em came in, and we clinked the darbies on him, took him as quiet as a lamb; and now he's had his bit sleep out, and is as fresh as a May gowan, to answer what your honour likes to speir.' This narrative, delivered with a wonderful quantity of gesture and grimace, received at the conclusion the thanks and praises which the narrator expected.|$|R

[...] "I tell you, Gallon, he was a genuine {{surprise}} to me. I knew the big ones had to be like that, but I had to see him to really know it. He's one of the fellows that does things.

6000|$|... "But wait a minute," [...] {{said the}} detective, Prince, quietly. [...] "In that case {{there seems to}} be {{something}} of a mystery. A murderer might somehow have managed to throw the statue down on him, as he seems to have done. But <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he</b> couldn't easily have lifted it up again. I've tried; and I'm sure it would want three men at least. Yet we must suppose, on that theory, that the murderer first knocked him down as he walked past, using the statue as a stone club, then lifted it up again, took him out and deprived him of his coat, then put him back again in the posture of death and neatly replaced the statue. I tell you it's physically impossible. And how else could he have unclothed a man covered with that stone monument? It's worse than the conjurer's trick, when a man shuffles a coat off with his wrists tied." ...|$|E

40|$|I lay {{tucked in}} bed. The down {{comforter}} clung and wrapped itself around me, encasing me in a cocoon {{of pink and}} blue, protection from the cold of my room and the world beyond it. I allowed myself to sink {{deeper and deeper into}} the protective layers of blankets, hearing but not hearing the sounds of life going on around me. In one hand I held a romance novel. I read the same lines over and over again. He held her in his arms, and in that moment he realized {{that there would be no}} one else. I wonder what he's doing now.

No, not again. I will not cry. I will not cry. Damn it. I closed my eyes and felt the hot tears spill over and roll down the side of my face. "Danaaaahh!" Something landed on my bed. The springs popped me up. If I wasn't already so used to my roommates, I would have fallen off. When the bed stopped shaking, I felt someone crawl onto my back. Soon Sadie's face came into view. Another earthquake-Maria. Her face also appeared...|$|R

I read one of his early reports home; and if the others were {{anything}} like it his life must have been exciting enough, even for him. His station was a small island of civilisation, as one may say, {{in the middle of}} a sea of savages. Before he had been there a month the place had been attacked twice. On the first occasion Joe's 'flock' had crowded into the Mission House, and commenced to pray, that having been the plan of defence adopted by his predecessor. Joe cut the prayer short, and preached to them from the text, 'Heaven helps them as helps themselves'; after which he proceeded to deal out axes and old rifles. In his report he mentioned that he had taken a hand himself, merely as an example to the flock; <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>he</b> had never enjoyed an evening more in all his life. The second fight began, as usual, round the Mission, but seems to have ended two miles off. In less than six months he had rebuilt the school-house, organised a police force, converted all that was left of one tribe, and started a tin church. He added (but I don't think they read that part of his report aloud) that law and order was going to be respected, and life and property secure in his district so long as he had a bullet left.|$|E

But he used to be in a tailor shop in Minneapolis (they do say he's a smart needle-pusher, at that) and he tries to let on that he's a regular city fellow. They say he tries to make people think he's a poet--carries books around and pretends to read 'em. Myrtle Cass says she met him at a dance, and he was mooning around all over the place, and he asked her did she like flowers and poetry and music and everything; he spieled like he was a regular United States Senator; and Myrtle--she's a devil, that girl, ha! ha!--she kidded him along, and got him going, and honest, what d'you think he said? He said he didn't find any intellectual companionship in this town. Can you BEAT it? Imagine! And him a Swede tailor! My! And they say he's the most awful mollycoddle--looks just like a girl.
