5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> to flower from seed. Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, {{and it is a}} potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|In Antananarivo and {{throughout}} the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> {{after the death of}} a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's lamba-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends and neighbors are invited {{to take part in the}} music, dancing and feasting that accompanies the event. The famadihana is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.|$|E
5000|$|Beat Bugs is {{a series}} aimed at <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> olds, set in an {{overgrown}} suburban backyard, which serves as an environment that five young bug friends regularly explore. To the bugs, the backyard is known as [...] "Village Green". Songs by the Beatles, such as [...] "Come Together" [...] and [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", are interwoven into the narrative of the episodes. These versions are performed by popular recording artists such as Pink and Sia. The songs often influence the life lessons that the young bugs learn.|$|R

30|$|Because of the {{increased}} intensity of performance reviews and in-class evaluations during the tenure evaluation year, {{as well as the}} saliency of the process, we might expect an increase or “spike” in teacher effort and activities during that year. Primary and secondary tenure operates differently than university tenure. For example, Singell and Lillydahl (1996) find that assistant professors spend more time on teaching and research compared to full professors, but there is no difference in time allocation within the rank of assistant professor. Link et al. (2008) find similar results. Earning tenure in a university environment requires consistent and persistent efforts over a <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> period of time.|$|R
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants are dark greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can be heavily pruned if necessary, as new growth can arise from the lignotuber. Although it is readily propagated by seed, experiments with in vitro propagation found Banksia menziesii {{to be more difficult}} than other species trialled.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> {{of age in}} {{that they}} are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|PRSA members receive {{access to}} a suite of tools that fosters {{professional}} development and career growth. PRSA hosts an accreditation program called APR (accreditation in public relations) that evaluates a PR professional in four categories: research, planning, implementation and evaluation. Accreditation is usually granted to candidates with <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> of experience upon completion of written and oral examinations. About 20 percent of PRSA's members are accredited. PRSA hosts the Anvil awards, which are issued based on four components: research, planning, execution and evaluation. The Gold Anvil is awarded to individuals. The Silver Anvil is awarded for strategy and the Bronze for tactics. It also issues awards such as Grand Gold Pick, Rookie of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and PR person of the year.|$|E

40|$|The Narrative Elaboration Technique (NET) is a {{forensic}} interview technique {{that has been}} shown {{to increase the amount of}} information provided by children in open-ended recall. Efforts have been made to streamline the technique for use in real-world settings. The present study examined the effectiveness of two streamlined NET interviews with three <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> old children. It is the first study to completely omit the NET training session, without substituting a rapport building session, and to test the effectiveness of NET verbal prompts with children younger than six years old. Although NET was not found to be effective at increasing open-ended recall with the younger children in the sample, the streamlined NET interview with verbal prompts proved to be as effective as the full NET interview with <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> old children. These verbal prompts could be readily incorporated into forensic interviews...|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> intervals.|$|R
5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the development of}} sight word reading in young children by examining changes in their self-reported reading strategies over time. A sample of 65 <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> olds were asked to read 40 real word items, all carefully matched for letter length and word frequency, on three separate occasions. Changes in the children’s word identifications were measured using immediately retrospective verbal self-reports. Overall, the results showed some variability in the children’s self-reported reading strategies. Over time the children relied less on phonological strategies and moved towards reliance on directly retrieving words from memory. This change was most evident in the older children; while both year groups showed similar patterns of shifting reliance from explicit phonological strategies to retrieval, this shift was simply less frequent among the younger children. An analysis of word-specific changes in reading strategies showed that the older children had a better sight vocabulary for more complex word items. These findings provide further support for Ehri’s mediated phase theory in explaining children’s development in learning to read...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the ‘See the Science’ Project funded by the Primary Science Teaching Trust {{that took place in}} South West England in 2012 - 13. It aims to {{illuminate}} the process of transforming a curriculum document into a valuable learning experience for children through the use of classroom talk. The project was grounded in concerns that the increased use of thematic, ‘creative’ curricula in England was leading to a loss of scientific learning for children in the early <b>years</b> (<b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> olds). It presents our findings that {{in the context of the}} twelve primary schools with which we worked, the type of curriculum used (e. g. thematic, cross-curricular) had less impact on teaching than we anticipated, whereas the teacher’s immediate responsiveness to children’s ideas and interests and their development of a ‘repertoire’ of different forms of talk for different purposes in learning science was crucial. Through the development of case studies using qualitative approaches including transcription and analysis of classroom talk we examine how teachers have developed their practice and we argue that ‘sustained scientific dialogues’ play a key role in the development of creative pedagogies...|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} Irish settlers {{began arriving}} in the early 18th century. Initially they were indentured servants who came to work in Boston and New England for <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> before gaining their independence. They were mainly individuals and families, and {{they were forced to}} hide their religious roots since Catholicism was banned in the Bay Colony. Then in 1718, congregations of Presbyterians from Ulster in the north of Ireland began arriving in Boston Harbor. They were referred to as Ulster Irish but later were referred to as Scots-Irish because many of them had roots in Scotland. The Puritan leaders initially sent the Ulster Irish to the fringes of the Bay Colony, where they settled places like Belfast, Maine, Londonderry and Derry, New Hampshire, and Worcester, Massachusetts. But by 1729 they were permitted to set up a church in downtown Boston.|$|E
25|$|CFCs {{were invented}} by Thomas Midgley, Jr. in the 1920s. They {{were used in}} air {{conditioning}} and cooling units, as aerosol spray propellants prior to the 1970s, and in the cleaning processes of delicate electronic equipment. They also occur as by-products of some chemical processes. No significant natural sources have ever been identified for these compounds—their presence in the atmosphere is due almost entirely to human manufacture. As mentioned above, when such ozone-depleting chemicals reach the stratosphere, they are dissociated by ultraviolet light to release chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms act as a catalyst, and each can break down {{tens of thousands of}} ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere. Given the longevity of CFC molecules, recovery times are measured in decades. It is calculated that a CFC molecule takes an average of about <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> to go from the ground level up to the upper atmosphere, and it can stay there for about a century, destroying up to one hundred thousand ozone molecules during that time..|$|E
