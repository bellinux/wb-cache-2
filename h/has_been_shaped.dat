5|$|Culture in German states <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> {{by major}} {{intellectual}} and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular.

5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several factors contribute to this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava flows and pyroclastic masses, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 years past and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been generated on the north and east flanks of the volcano.|$|E
5|$|The view of Jinnah in the West <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> to {{some extent}} by his {{portrayal}} in Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, Gandhi. The film was dedicated to Nehru and Mountbatten and was given considerable support by Nehru's daughter, the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi. It portrays Jinnah (played by Alyque Padamsee) in an unflattering light, who seems to act out of jealousy of Gandhi. Padamsee later stated that his portrayal was not historically accurate.|$|E

5|$|Transport in the North <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by the Pennines, {{creating}} strong north-south axes along each {{coast and}} an east-west axis across the moorland passes {{of the southern}} Pennines. Northern England is a centre of freight transport and handles around one third of all British cargo. Both passenger and freight links between Northern cities remain poor, which is a major weakness of the Northern economy.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{cultural}} history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), {{the foundations of}} Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by various historical schools of thought, {{including those of the}} Upanishads, the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> to a {{large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its history, Banff National Park <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by {{tension between}} {{conservationist}} and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, {{in response to}} conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who {{had the right to}} develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that {{looking at a}} wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between war and Australian society <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> {{by two of}} the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, this pattern of bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.|$|E

25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{landscape of}} the Swiss Plateau <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by the ice age glaciers. During all the known alpine glaciations (Günz glaciation, Mindel glaciation, Riss glaciation and Würm glaciation), huge glaciers penetrated the Swiss Plateau. During the warm interglacials, the glaciers receded to the high alps (sometimes more than today) and subtropical vegetation spread in the plateau.|$|E
