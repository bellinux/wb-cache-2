40|$|Malaria is a {{major public}} health problem in India and its {{dynamics}} vary {{from place to place}} 1. In central India malaria is complex because of vast tracts of forest with tribal settlement. According to a 1987 estimate, 54 million tribals of various ethnic origins residing in forested areas and accounting for 8 % of the total population contributed 30 % of total malaria cases, 60 % of total Plasmodium falciparum cases and 50 % of malaria deaths in the country 2. Keeping this in view a new malaria control strategy named Enhanced Malaria Control Project (EMCP) was introduced in 1998 by the National Anti Malaria Programme (NAMP) in seven peninsular states of India with World Bank assistance 3.

Objective: The study objective was {{to find out the}} practices of mosquito <b>control</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> measures observed at household level and the acceptance of vector control measures under malaria control programme. Methods: A Community based cross-sectional study was undertaken from June 2009 to May 2010 and 150 tribal and 150 non-tribal head of the households interviewed. Data was collected on socio-demographic characteristics, factors related to mosquito breeding and its prevention practice, <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> measures, DDT spray status of their houses. Data was analyzed by Epi Info Version 7. Results: The overall coverage of DDT was low (25. 3 %). Coverage was slightly better among tribal households (31. 3 %) compared to non-tribal population (19. 4 %). The acceptance of DDT spray was found to be significantly associated with knowledge about mode of transmission of malaria and type of house. Room-wise coverage was not as per norms. Refusal of DDT was seen more among non-tribal communities. Commercial <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> practices like mosquito repellants, mats and coils were lesser among the tribal counter parts and it was associated with level of income. Majority of tribal and non-tribal respondents were not having knowledge of the new insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) and LLINs.

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria and Tuberculosis (TB) are {{important}} causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} in Africa. Malaria prevention reduces mortality among HIV patients, pregnant women and children, but its role in TB patients is not clear. In the TB National Reference Center in Guinea-Bissau, admitted patients are in severe clinical conditions and mortality during the rainy season is high. We performed a three-step malaria prevention program to reduce mortality in TB patients during the rainy season. Methods Since 2005 Permethrin treated bed nets were given to every patient. Since 2006 environmental prevention with permethrin derivates was performed both indoor and outdoor during the rainy season. In 2007 cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was added during the rainy season. Care was without charge; health education on malaria prevention was performed weekly. Primary outcomes were death, discharge, drop-out. Results 427, 346, 549 patients were admitted in 2005, 2006, 2007, respectively. Mortality dropped from 26. 46 % in 2005 to 18. 76 % in 2007 (p-value 0. 003), due to the significant reduction in rainy season mortality (death/discharge ratio: 0. 79, 0. 55 and 0. 26 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively; p-value 0. 001) while dry season mortality remained constant (0. 39, 0. 37 and 0. 32; p-value 0. 647). Costs of malaria prevention were limited: 2 €/person. No drop-outs were observed. Health education attendance was 96 - 99 %. Conclusions Malaria prevention in African tertiary care hospitals seems feasible with limited costs. Vector <b>control,</b> <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis seem to reduce mortality in severely ill TB patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVETo {{describe}} the epidemiologic and clinical syndromes associated with pediatric neuroinvasive arboviral infections among {{children in the}} United States from 2003 through 2012. METHODSWe reviewed data reported by state health departments to ArboNET, the national arboviral surveillance system, for 2003 through 2012. Children (< 18 years) with neuroinvasive arboviral infections (eg, meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis) were included. Demographic, clinical syndrome, outcome, geographic, and temporal data were analyzed for all cases. RESULTSDuring the study period, 1217 cases and 22 deaths due to pediatric neuroinvasive arboviral infection were reported from the 48 contiguous states. La Crosse virus (665 cases; 55 %) and West Nile virus (505 cases; 41 %) were the most common etiologies identified. Although less common, Eastern equine encephalitis virus (30 cases; 2 %) resulted in 10 pediatric deaths. La Crosse virus primarily affected younger children, whereas West Nile virus was more common in older children and adolescents. West Nile virus disease cases occurred throughout the country, whereas La Crosse and the other arboviruses were more focally distributed. CONCLUSIONSNeuroinvasive arboviral infections were an important cause of pediatric disease from 2003 through 2012. Differences in the epidemiology and clinical disease result from complex interactions among virus, vector, host, and the environment. Decreasing the morbidity and mortality from these agents depends on vector <b>control,</b> <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> to reduce mosquito and tick bites, and blood donor screening. Effective surveillance is critical to inform clinicians and public health officials about the epidemiologic features of these diseases and to direct prevention efforts.

40|$|AbstractFrom time immemorial, vector-borne {{diseases}} have severely reduced the fighting capacity of armies and caused suspension or cancellation of military operations. Since World War I, infectious diseases have no longer {{been the main}} causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} among soldiers. However, most recent conflicts involving Western armies have occurred overseas, increasing the risk of vector-borne disease for the soldiers and for the displaced populations. The threat of vector-borne disease has changed with the progress in hygiene and disease control within the military: some diseases have lost their military significance (e. g. plague, yellow fever, and epidemic typhus); others remain of concern (e. g. malaria and dengue fever); and new potential threats have appeared (e. g. West Nile encephalitis and chikungunya fever). For this reason, vector <b>control</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> strategies are always major requirements in ensuring the operational readiness of armed forces. Scientific progress has allowed a reduction in the impact of arthropod-borne diseases on military forces, but the threat is always present, and a failure in the context of vector control or in the application of <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> measures could allow these diseases to have the same devastating impact on human health and military readiness {{as they did in the}} past...|$|R

They are a primary information resource used by health, safety, and environmental professionals in communicating the hazards of chemicals and in making risk management decisions. Engineered nanomaterials represent a growing class of materials being manufactured and introduced into multiple business sectors. MSDSs were obtained from a total of 44 manufacturers using Internet search engines, and a simple ranking scheme was developed to evaluate the content of the data sheets. The MSDSs were reviewed using the ranking scheme, and categorized on the quality and completeness of information as it pertains to hazard identification, <b>exposure</b> <b>controls,</b> <b>personal</b> protective equipment (PPE), and toxicological information being communicated about the engineered nanomaterial. The ranking scheme used to evaluate the MSDSs for engineered nanomaterials was based on the determination that the data sheet should include information on specific physical properties, including particle size or particle size distribution, and physical form; specific toxicological and health effects; and protective measures that can be taken to <b>control</b> potential <b>exposures.</b> The first MSDSs for nanomaterials began to appear around 2006, so these were collected in the time period of 2007 - 2008.

40|$|Zika is a flavivirus {{transmitted}} to humans through either the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes or sexual transmission. Zika {{has been linked}} to congenital anomalies such as microcephaly. In this paper, we analyze a new system of ordinary differential equations which incorporates human vertical transmission of Zika virus, the birth of babies with microcephaly and asymptomatically infected individuals. The Zika model is locally and globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Our model shows that asymptomatic individuals amplify the disease burden in the community, and the most important parameters for ZIKV spread are the death rate of mosquitoes, the mosquito biting rate, the mosquito recruitment rate, and the transmission per contact to mosquitoes and to adult humans. Scenario exploration indicates that personal-protection is a more effective control strategy than mosquito-reduction strategy. It also shows that delaying conception reduces the number of microcephaly cases, although this does little to prevent Zika transmission in the broader community. However, by coupling aggressive vector <b>control</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> use, it is possible to reduce both microcephaly and Zika transmission. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classifications: 92 B 05, 93 A 30, 93 C 15.

Dengue, a potentially fatal mosquito-borne viral disease, is spreading rapidly including in previously unaffected areas in the southern United States. Public health officials consider vector <b>control</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> the best ways to control the spread of dengue in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine. Children are especially vulnerable to the severe complications of dengue and must be educated about the disease. Methods.

40|$|Abstract Background Neither indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) nor long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) {{are able}} to fully interrupt transmission in holoendemic Africa as single interventions. The combining of IRS and LLINs presents an opportunity for improved control and management of pyrethroid resistance through the simultaneous presentation of unrelated insecticides. Method Chlorfenapyr IRS and a pyrethroid-impregnated polyester LLIN (WHO approved) were tested separately and together in experimental huts in southern Benin against pyrethroid resistant Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus. The bed nets were deliberately holed with either six or 80 holes to {{examine the effect of}} increasing wear and tear on protectiveness. Anopheles gambiae were genotyped for the kdr gene to assess the combination's potential to prevent the selection of pyrethroid resistance. Results The frequency of kdr was 84 %. The overall mortality rates of An. gambiae were 37 % and 49 % with the six-hole and 80 -hole LLINs, respectively, and reached 57 % with chlorfenapyr IRS. Overall mortality rates were significantly higher with the combination treatments (82 - 83 %) than with the LLIN or IRS individual treatments. Blood feeding (mosquito biting) rates were lowest with the 6 -hole LLIN (12 %), intermediate with the 80 -hole LLIN (32 %) and highest with untreated nets (56 % with the 6 -hole and 54 % with the 80 -hole nets). Blood feeding (biting) rates and repellency of mosquitoes with the combination of LLIN and chlorfenapyr IRS showed significant improvement compared to the IRS treatment but did not differ from the LLIN treatments indicating that the LLINs were the primary agents of <b>personal</b> <b>protection.</b> The combination killed significantly higher proportions of Cx. quinquefasciatus (51 %, 41 %) than the LLIN (15 %, 13 %) or IRS (32 %) treatments. Conclusion The chlorfenapyr IRS component was largely responsible for controlling pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes and the LLIN component was largely responsible for blood feeding inhibition and <b>personal</b> <b>protection.</b> Together, the combination shows potential to provide additional levels of transmission <b>control</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, thereby justifying the additional resources required.

40|$|Background & objectives: Evidence on the {{community}} knowledge and perceptions on malaria are crucial todesign appropriate health communication strategies for malaria control. Orissa, an Indian state with a largeproportion of indigenous populations and hilly terrains contributes to the highest malaria burden in India. Astudy was undertaken to assess the knowledge on malaria among community members who had experiencedfever and chills in the endemic district of Boudh in Orissa. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based survey was carried out with respondents (n= 300) who had feverwith chills within two weeks prior to data collection through a multi-stage sampling and interviewed themusing a pre-tested, structured interview schedule. Results : About 90 % of respondents recognized fever as a common symptom of malaria, 72. 3 % said mosquitobites cause malaria, 70. 3 % of respondents reported mosquito <b>control</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> to be the methodof malaria prevention, and 24. 6 % identified chloroquine as the drug used for treatment.

40|$|Most high-income {{countries}} implement tuberculosis (TB) {{infection control}} programs {{to reduce the}} risk for nosocomial transmission. However, such control programs are not routinely implemented in India, the country that accounts for the largest number of TB cases in the world. Despite the high prevalence of TB in India and the expected high probability of nosocomial transmission, little is known about nosocomial and occupational TB there. The few available studies suggest that nosocomial TB may be a problem. We review the available data on this topic, describe factors that may facilitate nosocomial transmission in Indian healthcare settings, and consider the feasibility and applicability of various recommended infection control interventions in these settings. Finally, we outline the critical information needed to effectively address the problem of nosocomial transmission of TB in India. The risk that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be transmitted from patients with active tuberculosis (TB) to other patients and healthcare workers has been recognized for many years (1). The level of risk varies by setting, occupation, patient population, and effectiveness of TB infection control measures (2 – 5) but is higher in facilities that manage large numbers of smear-positive TB patients who do not receive rapid diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, particularly in the absence of other infection control measures (2 – 5). A hierarchy of control measures, including administrative, engineering, and environmental <b>controls</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> measures, has been recommended to reduce nosocomial TB risk (2, 3, 5, 6).
