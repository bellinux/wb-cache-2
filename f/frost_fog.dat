40|$|Dew point {{temperature}}, {{the temperature}} at which water vapor condenses, {{is an important}} weather variable used to estimate <b>frost,</b> <b>fog,</b> rain, snow, dew, evapotranspiration, near-surface humidity, and other meteorological variables. Dew point temperature directly or indirectly contributes to productivity of plants, crop damage during freezes, human comfort levels, {{and the loss of}} human life during heat waves. Although estimation of dew point temperature is common, short term prediction is not. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a robust computational tool useful for prediction. The goal of this research was to develop artificial neural networks that after being trained on historical Georgia statewide weather data can make dew point temperature predictions for up to 12 hours. This system can then be implemented to predict dew point temperature for any location in Georgia, United States {{as a part of a}} decision support system. INDEX WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The Odyssey {{spacecraft}} {{has been}} in Mars orbit since October 24, 2001 and has nearly completed 61, 490 orbits. Navigation operational objectives include the following: Control the local mean solar time for science observations; {{for most of the}} mission, this varied from 3 : 45 pm to 5 : 20 pm. Currently, an orbit trim maneuver planned for November 10, 2015 will place Odyssey at 6 : 45 pm/ 6 : 45 am at equator crossings in order to observe early morning ground <b>frost,</b> <b>fog</b> and clouds. Initially, Odyssey was late by 42 minutes for an over-flight of the critical seven minutes of Phoenix's entry, descent and landing (EDL). Odyssey was successfully positioned for this over-flight using the Delta V from angular momentum desaturations (AMD). Similar results for the Mars Science Laboratory's EDL and Comet Siding Spring's minimum risk location will be presented. Odyssey has and continues to relay significant quantities of rover data. Navigation successfully models frequent AMD Delta Vs in order to generate accurate sixty-day trajectory predictions; a typical timing error is 25 seconds after 60 days. However, unexpected events, such as safe-mode entries with their larger and more frequent thrusting, severely impact that trajectory accuracy. Impacted trajectories can have timing errors ranging from a few minutes to ten-to-fifteen minutes after sixty-days. Other analyses (briefly stated) include: a) the offset of the orbital ground track pattern after an initial cycle of 30 days or 362 orbits and b) an operations environment of continuous thrusting if/when one of the three remaining reaction wheels fails...|$|E

2500|$|For FM {{broadcasting}} (and the {{few remaining}} low-band TV stations), weather is the primary cause for changes in VHF propagation, along with some diurnal changes when the sky is mostly without cloud cover. [...] These changes are most obvious during temperature inversions, {{such as in the}} late-night and early-morning hours when it is clear, allowing the ground and the air near it to cool more rapidly. [...] This not only causes dew, <b>frost,</b> or <b>fog,</b> but also causes a slight [...] "drag" [...] {{on the bottom of the}} radio waves, bending the signals down such that they can follow the Earth's curvature over the normal radio horizon. [...] The result is typically several stations being heard from another media market [...] usually a neighboring one, but sometimes ones from a few hundred kilometers away. [...] Ice storms are also the result of inversions, but these normally cause more scattered omnidirection propagation, resulting mainly in interference, [...] often among weather radio stations.

The demand for extra service throughout the country began to exercise a reflex influence on the great centre. Mails came from the country in some instances with the letters unsorted, thus increasing the difficulties of the situation.

To meet the emergency, at least in part, the despatch of the usual eight o'clock mail was delayed for that night fifty minutes.

He shows there that even in Greenland peaks and crags are left free enough from ice to support a vegetation of between three hundred or four hundred species of flowering plants; and, therefore, he well says, we must be careful to avoid concluding that the plant and animal life on the dreary shores or mountain-tops of the old glacial Scotland was poor. The same would hold good of our mountains; and, if so, we may look with respect, even awe, on the Alpine plants of Wales, Scotland, and the Lake mountains, as organisms, stunted it may be, and even degraded by their long battle with the elements, but venerable from their age, historic from their endurance.
