5|$|Visual scene {{displays}} are {{a different}} method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture,</b> photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience. They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary {{that is associated with}} specific activities or routines. For example, a photo of a child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication. Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November 1892 the {{deviation}} line between Haworth and Oakworth through Mytholmes Tunnel was {{opened and the}} original route abandoned. The deviation was built {{as a condition of}} the buy out of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway by the Midland Railway. The need for {{the deviation}} was to avoid a large wooden trestle viaduct that crossed a mill pond, as the locals believed the viaduct was unsafe, and supposedly many alighted at Oakworth and continued on foot to Haworth to avoid crossing the viaduct. The original design for the deviation was to skirt the mill pond then through a cutting to rejoin the original formation. However, during construction the material in the cutting proved to be unstable, resulting {{in the construction of the}} short Mytholmes Tunnel. The original trestle viaduct can be seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> hanging in the booking hall of Oakworth station.|$|E

25|$|Evans & Treisman (2005) {{proposed}} a hypothesis that humans rapidly detect disjunctive sets of unbound features of target categories {{in a parallel}} manner, and then use these features to discriminate between scenes that do or do not contain the target without necessarily fully identifying it. An {{example of such a}} feature would be outstretched wings {{that can be used to}} tell whether or not a bird is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture,</b> even before the system has identified an object as a bird. Evans & Treisman propose that natural scene perception involves a first pass through the visual processing hierarchy up to the nodes in a visual identification network, and then optional revisiting of earlier levels for more detailed analysis. During the 'first pass' stage, the system forms a global representation of the natural scene that includes the layout of global boundaries and potential objects. During the 'revisiting' stage, focused attention is employed to select local objects of interest in a serial manner, and then bind their features to their representations.|$|E

The film received positive reviews from trade publications including The Moving Picture World, which praised the acting and the execution of the film as an education for audiences by exposing them to literary masterpieces.

500|$|Ned meets up {{with the}} church council to suggest {{promotion}} of creationism. The next day, he and Reverend Lovejoy blackmail Principal Skinner into introducing creationism in the school. Lisa is perturbed by this, and at a town meeting asks everyone {{to make a choice}} between creationism and Darwinism, as there is only one truth. The townspeople vote for creationism, much to her chagrin, and the act of teaching or learning Darwinism and evolution is made illegal. Lisa therefore decides to start holding secret classes for people interested in evolution. However, just as the first lesson is about to begin, she is arrested by Chief Wiggum. She asks why she's being arrested when there are far worse crimes out there, and embarrassed he tells her they only have enough manpower to enforce the last three laws passed, even stating that it's the worst law system there is. Lisa is brought to trial, which is dubbed Lisa Simpson v. God. Representing her is Clarice Drummond, a despised American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer, while on God’s (i.e., Ned's) side is Wallace Brady, a beloved, overweight, southern lawyer. The trial does not go smoothly for Lisa, as Professor Frink (called by Clarice) gives ambiguous answers regarding God's existence, while a creationist scientist says that evolution cannot be real, as there is no proof of a [...] "missing link" [...] (depicted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> as a savage hominid, holding a rock over his head).|$|E

500|$|Honey pays {{homage to}} some of Nagai's other creations, such as the Mazinger and Devilman series; the first two episodes alone include many cameos. [...] The first shows Mayor Light and Chokkei <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> with {{characters}} from Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen, Iyahaya Nantomo, and Oira Sukeban, while Devilman titular character appears as a gargoyle. In the second, a scene in a downtown market in Cosplay City has cameos from Hige Godzilla from Harenchi Gakuen and Naojiro Abashiri from The Abashiri Family; a scene in Honey's bedroom shows a bust of Mazinger Z and a framed picture of her father, Dr. Kisaragi; and several scenes show Mazinger Z Sayaka Yumi, The Abashiri Family Kikunosuke, and an unnamed character from Kekkō Kamen as they get turned into plastic-coated statues. Cutie Honey's skin-tight, full-body costume uses the same design and tricolor (blue, black, and red) scheme as that of Nagai's original manga, but its chest opening—with rounded side edges—resembles the one in her 1973 anime attire. The opening sequence used {{in the first four}} episodes shows versions of Honey's original seven forms in the TV series: Kisaragi, Hurricane, Misty, Idol, Flash, Fancy, and Cutie. Danbei's techniques parody those of Nagai's super robots Mazinger Z and Grendizer. Later episodes feature appearances by Akira Fudo of Devilman and Professor Kabuto of Mazinger Z. In episode 7, Honey transforms herself into Kouji Kabuto. The title sequence of episodes 5 through 8 features Sirene, Devilman's nemesis, and Akira Fudo of Devilman along with Mazinger Z's Juzo Kabuto. Devilman can be briefly seen as one of the back-up guitarists for the one-time antagonist Saline in episode 3.|$|E

Applications are no longer added to the Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The app snapping system has also been extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and {{can also be used}} on any display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> viewer snapped to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends and events.
