40|$|A rapid {{degradation}} of wet adhesion {{is the key}} factor controlling coating lifetime, for the organic coatings under marine hydrostatic pressure. The mathematical models of wet adhesion have been studied by Grey System Theory (GST). Grey models (GM) (1, 1) of <b>epoxy</b> <b>varnish</b> (EV) coating/steel and epoxy glass flake (EGF) coating/steel have been established, and a lifetime prediction formula has been proposed {{on the basis of}} these models. The precision assessments indicate that the established models are accurate, and the prediction formula is capable of making precise lifetime forecasting of the coatings...|$|E
40|$|The first {{screening}} results {{concerning the}} corrosion behaviour (Ni 2 + release) of an industrial Ni-Ag arm series treated with two different galvanic coatings [Ni bright + flash of Au 23 kt - Ni bright + flash Gun (Ni-Sn) ], and then finished {{with three different}} final treatments (a coating of diluted epoxy varnish; a coating of standard epoxy varnish; a coating of standard <b>epoxy</b> <b>varnish</b> spread on an electrophoretic primer) was reported. The samples were analyzed {{by means of a}} technique - the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) - that gives some detailed indications not only on the corrosion rates, but also on the start and the mechanism of the corrosion process. First results, obtained by applying the EIS technique to a monitoring system meant to optimizing a pass or fail test, seem to be through-and-through promising: notwithstanding the sample immersion on the synthetic swear solution is a too drastic treatment in comparison with the common use of the metallic glass parts - which foresee in any case an occasional and/or preserved contact with the skin - the EIS technique is able to distinguish the sample that release or not Ni 2 + below of 0. 5 µg/cm² week. Before proposing to standardize the method, the obtained results will require the repeatability and reproducibility evaluation of data obtained until now...|$|E
50|$|Alec Andon, known professionally as Alec Monopoly, is a {{graffiti}} artist, {{originally from}} New York City. The artist {{has worked in}} the urban environments of New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Europe, Mexico and throughout Asia using varied materials (including stencils, spray paint, <b>epoxies,</b> <b>varnishes</b> and newspapers) to subversively depict various iconic pop culture characters. He also is a brand ambassador with Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer and created a mural live, on red carpet for the 2013 film, Justin Bieber's Believe. Monopoly's work has been purchased by Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen, Adrien Brody and Iggy Azalea.|$|R
5000|$|After being applied, the {{film-forming}} {{substances in}} varnishes either harden directly, {{as soon as}} the solvent has fully evaporated, or harden after evaporation of the solvent through curing processes, primarily chemical reaction between oils and oxygen from the air (autoxidation) and chemical reactions between components of the varnish. Resin varnishes [...] "dry" [...] by evaporation of the solvent and harden almost immediately upon drying. Acrylic and waterborne varnishes [...] "dry" [...] upon evaporation of the water but will experience an extended curing period. Oil, polyurethane, and <b>epoxy</b> <b>varnishes</b> remain liquid even after evaporation of the solvent but quickly begin to cure, undergoing successive stages from liquid or syrupy, to tacky or sticky, to dry gummy, to [...] "dry to the touch", to hard. Environmental factors such as heat and humidity play a very large role in the drying and curing times of varnishes. In classic varnish the cure rate depends on the type of oil used and, to some extent, on the ratio of oil to resin. The drying and curing time of all varnishes may be sped up by exposure to an energy source such as sunlight, ultraviolet light, or heat.|$|R
5000|$|Pastorius used <b>epoxy</b> {{rather than}} <b>varnish</b> {{to obtain a}} glass-like finish {{suitable}} {{for the use of}} roundwound strings, which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have [...] "fret line" [...] markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks {{on the side of the}} neck. Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so that the metal string windings do not wear down the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have epoxy-coated fingerboards to increase durability, enhance sustain, and give a brighter tone. Though most fretless basses have four strings, five-string and six-string fretless basses are also available. Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as [...] "boutique" [...] or custom-made instruments.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} thermal {{management}} aspects of electric machinery used in high-performance  applications  with  particular  focus put  on electric machines designed for {{hybrid electric vehicle}} applications. In {{the first part of}} this thesis,  new thermal models of liquid (water and oil) cooled electric machines are proposed.   The proposed thermal models are based on a combination of lumped parameter (LP)   and numerical methods. As  a first  case study,  a permanent-magnet  assisted  synchronous reluctance machine (PMaSRM) equipped with a housing water jacket is considered.   Particular focus is put on the stator winding and a thermal model is proposed that divides the stator slot into a number of elliptical copper and impregna- tion layers.   Additionally, an analysis, using results from a proposed simplified thermal finite element (FE)   model representing only a single slot of the sta- tor and its corresponding end winding, is presented in which the number of layers and the proper connection between the parts of the LP thermal model representing the end winding and the active part of winding are determined. The approach is attractive due to its simplicity  and the fact  that it closely models the actual temperature distribution for common slot geometries.   An oil-cooled induction machine where the oil is in direct contact with the stator laminations  is also considered.   Here, a multi-segment structure is proposed that  divides  the  stator,  winding and cooling  system  into  a number  of an- gular  segments.    Thereby,  the  circumferential  temperature  variation  due to the  nonuniform distribution  of the  coolant  in the  cooling  channels  can be predicted. In the  second part  of this  thesis,  the  thermal  impact  of using  different winding impregnation  and steel  lamination  materials  is  studied.    Conven- tional <b>varnish,</b> <b>epoxy</b> and a silicone based thermally conductive impregnation material are investigated and the resulting temperature distributions in three small induction machines are compared. The thermal impact of using different steel lamination materials is investigated by simulations using the developed thermal  model  of the water  cooled  PMaSRM. The  differences  in alloy con- tents and steel lamination thickness are studied separately and a comparison between the produced iron losses and the resulting hot-spot temperatures is presented. Finally, FE-based approaches  for  estimating  the  induced  magnet  eddycurrent losses in the rotor of the considered PMaSRM are reviewed and compared in the  form  of a case  study  based on simulations.    A  simplified three-dimensional  FE model  and an analytical  model,  both  combined  with time-domain 2 D FE analysis, are shown to predict the induced eddy current losses with a relatively good accuracy compared to a complete 3 D FE based model.   Hence, the two simplified approaches are promising which motivates a possible future experimental verification.
