40|$|Abstract. Business Intelligence solutions, {{encompassing}} {{technologies such}} as multi-dimensional data modeling and aggregate query processing, are being applied increasingly to non-traditional data. This paper extends multi-dimensional aggregation to apply to data with associated interval values that capture when the <b>data</b> <b>hold.</b> In temporal databases, intervals typically capture the states of reality that the data apply to, or capture when the data are, or were, part of the current database state. This paper proposes a new aggregation operator that addresses several challenges posed by interval data. First, the intervals {{to be associated with}} the result tuples may not be known in advance, but depend on the actual data. Such unknown intervals are accommodated by allowing result groups that are specified only partially. Second, the operator contends with the case where an interval associated with data expresses that the <b>data</b> <b>holds</b> for each point in the interval, as well as the case where the <b>data</b> <b>holds</b> only for the entire interval, but must be adjusted to apply to sub-intervals. The paper reports on an implementation of the new operator and on an empirical study that indicates that the operator scales to large data sets and is competitive with respect to other temporal aggregation algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|Storage {{components}} {{are a major}} source of energy dissipation in modern superscalar microprocessors. As the instruction windows get larger with each generation of processors, register files and other structures that hold intermediate data become larger and dissipate more power. Therefore it is important {{to find new ways to}} reduce the energy dissipation of <b>data</b> <b>holding</b> components. Many values written to and read from these storage {{components are}} known to require fewer bits than is provided by the storage space. Upper order bits of these values are unnecessary and energy savings can be achieved by not writing and reading these bits. Floating value data has different characteristics and offer special energy savings opportunities. In this paper we analyze the bit-level statistics of data values and propose simple modifications to <b>data</b> <b>holding</b> components that save significant energy inside the processors. Our results show that by using simple modifications on the storage components it is possible to achieve 40 % reduction in the integer register file energy dissipation and up to 60 % reduction in the immediate field of the issue queue. We also show that energy dissipation can be reduced by half for some floating point benchmarks by identifying values that indicate a zero operand...|$|E
