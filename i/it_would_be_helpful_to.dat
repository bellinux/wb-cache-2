It {{seems that}} those who practice them are particularly close to Christianity, and among them, the Church's missionaries also {{find it easier to}} speak a common language. Is there, perhaps, in this veneration of ancestors a kind of preparation for the Christian faith in the Communion of Saints, in which all believers—whether living or dead—form a single community, a single body? [...] There is nothing strange, then, that the African and Asian animists would become believers in Christ more easily than followers of the great religions of the Far East.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} 1816, a {{pamphlet}} titled [...] "A Narrative of Five Youths from the Sandwich Islands" [...] was published {{to raise funds for}} the mission board. It included portraits of each of the five students drawn by Samuel F. B. Morse, Jedidiah's son. The U.S. Navy at this point claimed that George had not been properly discharged, so proposed sending him to West Point Military Academy. The missionaries thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> them if he went, but George {{did not want to go}} to West Point. George's letter to his father was published, and when Samuel Cotting read it, he wanted to cash in on the celebrity by claiming he was owed money for the boy's care. George, basking in the attention, wrote a furious letter complaining about Cotting's treatment. Among the insults: [...] "If I am worthy of the title of a Prince I am not going to be trodden under foot by such a dirty scoundrel as you are." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between risk perception and behavior is multifaceted. [...] Risk management {{is most effective}} once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood. [...] There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste {{according to a study}} conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001. [...] This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public’s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions. [...] It is advised to take careful measures to inform the public {{in a way that does}} not impart guilt but rather public awareness. [...] For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003) [...] that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars. [...] Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation. [...] Thus, the goal of Bound’s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, in 2003 air {{historian}} Andy Saunders {{wrote a book}} Bader's Last Flight, {{following up}} with a Channel 4 documentary Who Downed Douglas Bader?, which first aired on 28 August 2006. Saunders' research now suggests that Bader {{may have been a}} victim of friendly fire, shot down by one of his fellow RAF pilots after becoming detached from his own squadron. RAF combat records indicate Bader may have been shot down by Flight Lieutenant [...] "Buck" [...] Casson of No. 616 Squadron RAF, who claimed a Bf 109 whose tail came off and the pilot bailed out, before he himself was shot down and captured. Casson also mentioned that for a while he watched as the pilot struggled to bail out. Bader was flying {{at the rear of the}} German fighter formation, alone, and his squadron were the opposite side of the Germans. [...] "Buck" [...] had only a few seconds in which he saw Bader and mistook his Spitfire for a Bf 109. In a letter to Bader on 28 May 1945, Casson explained the action. While this source made it into the public domain, it was severely edited. The nature of the letter, that it was from Casson to Bader, was removed. Crucially, an entire paragraph, which mentioned specifically the tail coming off [...] "a Bf 109" [...] and the pilot struggling to get out of the cockpit, was completely omitted from the original source, still in the Casson family's possession. Saunders stated that this was not absolute proof, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> find the [...] "Bader Spitfire".|$|E
2500|$|Booker is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Elizabeth is voiced by actress Courtnee Draper. Baker and Draper's {{participation}} in the development process was atypical for most video games; instead of just coming in to record their lines, Levine considered them as collaborators on the story development process. The three spent {{a significant amount of}} time in the recording studio, improvising scenes and working on repeated recordings to try to find the right tone to present scripted dialog; such changes were then reflected appropriately in the game's story and dialog. Levine favorably contrasted Baker and Draper as [...] "the genius and the novice" [...] respectively; Baker had several previous roles in video game voice-overs, while Draper had none; the different levels of experience between the two helped to tighten the performances, the combination a [...] "potent mix" [...] according to Levine. Levine explained one case where Draper was struggling to give a convincing tearful performance when Elizabeth is having difficulty using her powers. Both Draper and Levine believed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> have Baker provide Booker's loud, berating dialog alongside Draper to help Draper find the right emotional response to deliver for the scene. Levine considered the input of both actors of critical importance to be able to deliver a lot of information, both in words and emotion, in only a few lines of dialog. Levine also worked with the actors directly to script out specific scenes once they had gotten to know their characters before recording their voices. Despite working closely with Baker and Draper on characterization and creating dialog on the fly, Levine did not provide the actors with full knowledge of their characters' backstory or the overarching plot of the game prior to recording; according to Levine, this helped the actors to create the in-game connection between Booker and Elizabeth in a much more natural manner than reading with full knowledge of the script. Similarly, Levine has not told the developers on his team the whole story of BioShock Infinite, using the reveals to gauge their reactions and adjust the story as needed; this had created some strife in the team, as they would prefer working with full knowledge of the script, but Levine noted [...] "that's not the way we present stuff to the gamer".|$|E

It is, I think, reasonable for Americans to ask the great political personages of America, the president and so forth, for example: whether they think the United States will stand alone in twenty-five years' time as they stand alone now? Or whether they {{think that there will}} be a greater United States--of all America--or of all the world? They must know their own will about that. And it is equally reasonable to ask the great political personages of the British Empire: what will Ireland be in twenty-five years' time? What will India be? There must be a plan, an intended thing. Otherwise these men have no intentions; otherwise they must be, in two words, dangerous fools. The sooner we substitute a type of man with a sufficient foresight and capable of articulate speech in the matter, the better for our race.|$|E
