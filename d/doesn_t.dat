40|$|We {{agree with}} Coulter and colleagues that patient {{experience}} data {{should be used}} more effectively, but introducing another NHS data collating/analysing body could be counterproductive if the implicit assumption is that all data are (more or less) equally valid. Poorly collected data detract from scientifically valid data. The recent proliferation of 1 Crapid 1 D patient feedback focuses attention on quick fixes {{at the expense of}} tackling long term problems. Annual national patient surveys from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) conform to recognised methodological standards. Samples are representative of the patient population; reminders to non-responders maximise response rates; good response rates are achieved from ethnic minorities and elderly patients; questions are pre-tested for comprehensibility; patients may add their own comments; and data are not collected by ward staff. Many other methods of gathering patient experience data (such as the friends and family test) meet few of those criteria. The CQC 19 s surveys could be improved if they were ward specific (to counter 1 Cthat <b>doesn</b> 19 <b>t</b> happen on my ward 1 D), but, in common with other methods, their main failing is too little emphasis on actively feeding back findings to the people responsible for delivering day to day care. Our recent pilot randomised controlled trial showed that facilitated meetings with nurses to discuss their own ward specific patient survey results had a highly significant impact on survey scores, whereas written survey results alone had no impact. The meetings often entailed difficult conversations: some nurses were reluctant to believe negative feedback; others were hurt, defensive, or critical of patients in return. Patients 19 comments were more effective than statistics in capturing nurses 19 interest, but concomitant descriptive statistics were needed to distinguish isolated incidents from general problems. Our main point is that, whereas Coulter and colleagues recommend collating and triangulating data, we advocate further trials to test methods of using patient feedback {{to improve the quality of}} care...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} oxygen ions {{irradiation}} to generate controlled structural disorder in thin manganite films. Conductive {{atomic force microscopy}} CAFM), transport and magnetic measurements were performed to analyze {{the influence of the}} implantation process in the physical properties of the films. CAFM images show regions with different conductivity values, probably due to the random distribution of point defect or inhomogeneous changes of the local Mn 3 +/ 4 + ratio to reduce lattice strains of the irradiated areas. The transport and magnetic properties of these systems are interpreted in this context. Metal-insulator transition can be described in the frame of a percolative model. Disorder increases the distance between conducting regions, lowering the observed TMI. Point defect disorder increases localization of the carriers due to increased disorder and locally enhanced strain field. Remarkably, even with the inhomogeneous nature of the samples, no sign of low field magnetoresistance was found. Point defect disorder decreases the system magnetization but <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> seem to change the magnetic transition temperature. As a consequence, an important decoupling between the magnetic and the metal-insulator transition is found for ion irradiated films as opposed to the classical double exchange model scenario.

They thereby conclude that there is no moral diﬀerence between active euthanasia and passive euthanasia, and that active euthanasia is also morally acceptable. I argue two points. First, they give counterexamples for a moral principle “All killings are morally wrong. ” This <b>doesn.</b> <b>t</b> justify individual actions such as giving lethal injection, withholding life support treatment.

When we evaluate an action using a moral principle, it is not always the case that “the moral symmetry principle” by itself takes precedence over other moral principles. To support the idea, some additional justiﬁcation is required to “the moral symmetry principle” used in case of euthanasia.

Every open source license model requests at least some parts of the code to be public, which is the defining character of the software model.

First, it analyses {{the use of the word}} ecclesia in the Greek and the Jewish environment and the way that the Apostle Paul uses it. Further there are described different images of the church, appearing in the Paul s Epistles, and an interpretation of their importance for the understanding of Paul s vision of the church. The thesis aims attention at the beginnings of the church s institutionalization and the early hierarchy, which has been shaping during Paul s life. The work also depicts Paul s relationship with the Christian communities he founded, the authority and the requirements for daily life he represented for the early Christians. In the final chapter, which represents the core of the thesis, the author summarizes the basic fundamental characteristics of Paul s concept of the church and notices these ideas constitute also the basics of the current ecclesiology.

40|$|Conquanto a expectativa comum da igreja cristã seja a ressurreição dos mortos para redenção plena dos que crêem em Cristo, entre os grupos católico-romano e protestante-reformado há divergência sobre o que ocorre durante o estado intermediário. O católico-romano crê nas doutrinas do purgatório e da intercessão pelos mortos razão pela qual reza para que a Santa Maria interceda na hora da morte e entrega-se a São José, o padroeiro da boa morte; participa da eucaristia, dá esmola, pratica obras de misericórdia, faz orações e oferece sufrágios em benefício das almas no purgatório; reza para que as almas {{dos santos}} defuntos intercedam por eles diante de Deus; louva à virgem Maria como a primeira, dentre todos os remidos, a ser ressuscitada dentre os mortos; e pratica boas obras para atenuar sua situação no dia do juízo final (em razão de crerem que a salvação é alcançada pela fé em Cristo e pelas boas obras). O protestante-reformado crê que enquanto a alma do justo está gozando da comunhão com Cristo, a alma do ímpio está sofrendo afastada de Cristo. Essa situação é temporária, pois ambos aguardam a ressurreição dos mortos e julgamento final para que tanto o justo possa desfrutar da salvação integralmente (no corpo e na alma) assim como o ímpio possa receber o justo juízo integralmente (no corpo e na alma) razão pela qual não intercede pelos mortos (nem mesmo tem o hábito de visitar os túmulos) e nem pede a intercessão dos santos defuntos; não pratica boas obras com vistas à salvação (nem mesmo procura ocasião para as boas obras); não pratica a extrema unção (mas evangeliza o moribundo no leito da morte); e mantém uma visão polarizada do status pós-morte: céu ou inferno. O cristão protestante-reformado tem a firme convicção de sua salvação (conforme doutrina da perseverança dos santos). Essa é a razão pela qual enfrenta serenamente o luto e a idéia de sua própria morte. Although the expectative common of the Christian church is the resurrection ofthe dead for the {{absolute}} redemption {{of those who}} have faith in Christ, among the catholic-roman and protestant-reformed groups there is divergence about what happens during the intermediate state. The catholic-roman has the faith in the doctrine of the purgatory and interception for the dead reason for the which pray for Mary, Jesus Christ mother s, to intercede in the hour of the death and surrenders himself to St. Joseph, the patron of the good death; he participles of the Sacrament of Eucharist, gives alms, practices mercy works, makes prayers and offers suffrage in benefit of the souls of the purgatory; he prays for souls of the dead saints intercede to him before God; he praises to the virgin Mary as the first, among the redeemed, to be resurrected among the dead s; and he practices good works to attenuate his situation in the day of the final judgment (in reason of believe that the salvation is reached by the faith in Christ and the good woks). The protestant-reformed believes that while the soul of the fair is enjoying of the communion with Christ, the heretic s soul is suffering faraway from Christ. That situation is temporary, because both wait for the resurrection of the dead and the final judgment in order to the fair can to enjoy of the salvation integrally (in the body and in the soul) and heretic can to receive the fair judgment integrally (in the body and in the soul) reason for the which <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> intercede for the dead s (not even has the habit of visiting the graves) and nor asks for the dead saint s intercession; he <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> practice good works with views the salvation (not even look for occasion for the good works); he <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> practice the extreme unction (but evangelizes the dying in the bed of death); and he maintains a polarized vision of the status powder-death: heaven or hell.

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) is an {{emerging}} technology, encompassing {{a wide spectrum}} of applications related to industrial control, smart metering, home automation, agriculture, eHealth and so on. For these applications to run autonomously, the IoT devices are required to survive for months and years under strict energy constraints. When developing such applications, {{it is important for the}} application to know about its own energy consumption. In this work, we propose and evaluate an energy consumption estimation approach for periodic sensing applications running on the IoT devices. Our approach is based on three phases. In the first phase, we identify the distinct activities such as sleep, transmit, sense and process in a sensing cycle. In the second phase, we measure the power consumption of these activities before the IoT device has been deployed in the network. The third phase takes place at run-time once the IoT device has been deployed, with the purpose of delivering the energy consumption of a sensing cycle. The energy consumption is calculated by using the activities power consumption and their durations obtained at run-time. The proposed approach is simple and generic because it <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> involve any complex hardware for runtime power measurement.

40|$|Graphite epoxy {{composite}} (GEC) {{materials are}} used in the construction of rocket fairings, nose cones, interstage adapters, and heat shields due to their high strength and light weight. However, they absorb moisture depending on the environmental conditions they are exposed to prior to launch. Too much moisture absorption can become a problem when temperature and pressure changes experienced during launch cause the water to vaporize. The rapid state change of the water can result in structural failure of the material. In addition, heat and moisture combine to weaken GEC structures. Diffusion models that predict the total accumulated moisture content based on the environmental conditions are one accepted method of determining if the material strength has been reduced to an unacceptable level. However, there currently <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> exist any field measurement technique to estimate the actual moisture content of a composite structure. A multi-layer diffusion model was constructed with Mathematica to predict moisture absorption and desorption from the GEC sandwich structure. This model is used in conjunction with relative humidity/temperature sensors both on the inside and outside of the material to determine the moisture levels in the structure. Because the core materials have much higher diffusivity than the face sheets, a single relative humidity measurement will accurately reflect the moisture levels in the core. When combined with an external relative humidity measurement, the model can be used to determine the moisture levels in the face sheets. Since diffusion is temperaturedependent, the temperature measurements are used to determine the diffusivity of the face sheets for the model computations...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a sketch of}} a reading of Wittgenstein s Philosophical Investigations as {{a search for the}} essence of human language. Chapter 1 explores what seems like a {{positive}} and what looks like a negative conclusion in the last two sections of the work. The former is a criterion for how to judge whether someone meant such-and-such, and the latter is an exclamation that nothing is more wrong-headed than calling meaning a mental activity. Chapter 1 thus explores why it is wrong to call meaning a mental activity, and tries {{to make sense of the}} seemingly absurdly strong criterion in the penultimate section. This amounts to an investigation into why Wittgenstein seems to be preoccupied with mental activities, and into his notion of a criterion. According to Wittgenstein, it is a mistake to make philosophy explanatory. Chapter 2 looks into this, and explores what the description that is to take the place of explanation may be. Chapter 3 gives an account of the rejection of the so-called Augustinian concept of the meaning of a word (i. e. the object for which the word stands) as the essence of human language. The major flaw in the so-called Augustinian concept is that it amounts to a sublimation of logic and thus makes it appear as if one <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> have criteria, e. g. of exactness. Wittgenstein s approach to the matter is then sketched, and it seems clear that a purely descriptive and non-dogmatic philosophy, according to him, only give particular reminders of one s everyday criteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{language}} teaching has undergone deep changes {{during the last}} 30 to 40 years, following this perception; I decided to do this research, following the direction and support of my tutors and based on my academic preparation in the Army Polytechnic School. First of all, I selected the subject to be investigated, because I work as policeman in the Horsemanship and Remount School where I have had experience, so I would like to apply my English knowledge in this research. I found that during the training course for policemen the English subject {{is not included in}} the curriculum, and with the suggestions of some policemen and even some applicants, I found the necessity to include this important subject in the curriculum of policemen´s training course. The main problem is that the Horsemanship and Remount School in the curriculum of the policemen´s training course <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> include the English language as subject, and in the daily activities the new police officers really needs to know English to make an efficient work for the society, but especially with the migration police services, tourism police services where they really need a good English level. Once identified the main problem I started to work in the theorical framework in which I will support my research. Finally I collected the necessary information to carry out this project, and I am sure that this research will help the new applicants of the Horsemanship and Remount School to get a good English level...|$|E
40|$|Work {{satisfaction}} is {{a component of}} life satisfaction, {{so that it would}} be important to be attention. Since if worker <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> get satisfaction from their work, their morale would be low, absence and lateness would be increased and it would be harder to cooperate with them or make an important change, also it would increase worker s turnover. It showed that work satisfaction would be a consideration factor in a company s operational. One of the work satisfaction factor is work condition. Where work condition is a factor related with physical work environment. Employee would be care about good work environment whether for personal comfort or working task, and also able to make employee work in better condition. The research is a correlational research. Population in this research was employee of National Land Institution consisted of 47 people. Perception data collection about physical work environment and work satisfaction used Likert scale, that was perception scale about physical work environment and work satisfaction. Data analysis method used to find out relation of perception about physical work environment with work satisfaction used product moment correlation from Karl Pearson assisted by SPSS 13. 00 for Windows program. According to data analysis, there found a positive and significant relation (r = 0, 429; p = 0, 003) between perception about physical work environment and work satisfaction. It means that employee who had positive perception about physical work environment would had high work satisfaction and also with employee who had negative perception about physical work environment, the work satisfaction would be low. Effective contribution about perception from physical work environment and work satisfaction was 18...|$|E

When David Rajaonson returned home to Madagascar, an unexpected niche opened up for him, in the form of low production of geraniums in neighbouring Réunion. How about growing geraniums? OK, why not? He could get his hands on 50 hectares of agricultural land outside the capital Antananarivo. He teaches himself agriculture, and off he goes. For 13 years his company, with its 60 agricultural workers, plants, gathers, distils and, in the end, exports essential oils from geraniums and other aromatic plants. And then one sad day an uncontrollable disease decimates his entire plantation. 'Being a farmer is the most difficult profession of all, David nods. A farmer has to deal with natural disasters, insects, shortages of fertiliser, not to mention the motivational problems of your personnel The international agencies will send no end of experts to study the problem but they contribute nothing new. All you see is a dribble of funding which <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> get the results you expect. You know, the Malagasy farmer knows how to plant, and he knows his land. All he needs is the means. If you added up all the money spent over the decades on international expertise, you would have enough to pay for improved seed varieties, fertilisers, tractors, dams.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} among corporate ownership, the level of board compensation, and firms future performance within Italian listed companies. Board compensation {{could be related to}} corporate ownership characteristics, like type of controlling shareholder, ownership concentration, the separation between cash flow and voting rights, and the presence of shareholders agreements. The evidence of high levels of board compensation associated with certain governance characteristics could signal, in a principal-agent framework, rent extraction by entrenched managers or by controlling shareholders versus minority shareholders; high board compensation, however, could be related to the need to hire directors with higher professional standing and also to the desire to create a network with other companies through the enlargement of the board, according to a social network view. In this paper we disentangle this issue showing the relationship between excess board compensation and future performance: examining firms listed on the Milan Stock Exchange over the period 1995 - 2002, we show that board compensation is linked to many governance characteristics, but excess compensation is never positively related to future performance. For founder Family firms, in particular, high board compensation is associated with a) smaller board size; b) a higher proportion of family members on the board; c) lower future performance. The whole evidence therefore <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> support the hypothesis suggested by the social network view, but is consistent with a rent extraction hypothesis. These results could add new empirical evidence to the recent debate on the need for global remuneration reform. According to our results, some control mechanism or an increase in transparency of executive compensation schemes could be appropriate...|$|E
