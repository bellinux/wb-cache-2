40|$|This article {{draws from}} {{a pilot study}} {{examining}} people&# 039;s use of portable <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> and USB sticks in Melbourne, Australia - an important initial step in identifying {{the ways in which}} USB portable <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> hold enduring personal, social, and economic significance. We explore this significance through reluctances to dispose of USB portable <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> partly for environmental reasons, but also because of concerns over the data stored on them. In direct tension to these concerns is an ephemeral sense of ownership, where USB portable <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> are always disposable from the moment of acquisition. We also explore views on, and negotiations of, these paradoxical issues in regards to the disposability of USB portable <b>hard</b> <b>drives...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Mac Pro also {{supported}} Serial ATA solid-state drives (SSD) in the 4 <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled adapter (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused PCIe slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD drive capacities and configurations were available as options.|$|E

Backblaze, which normally used HGST 3 TB <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> were only able to find Seagate 3 TB drives in [...] "decent quantity". Backblaze noted that the failure rates of the ST3000DM001 did not follow a bathtub curve typically followed by <b>hard</b> disk <b>drive</b> failure rates, instead having 2.7% failing in 2012, 5.4% failing in 2013, and 47.2% failing in 2014. Other 3 TB <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> that Backblaze placed in service in 2012, which were operated in a similar environment as the Seagate drives, did not show signs of increased failure.|$|R
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E
5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> of large capacity to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E

50|$|Western Digital also ships WD Smartware {{with many}} of its drives for use as backup drives, with an {{exception}} for its Touro Mobile <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> which is a HDD brand from its HGST division. Additionally, this software does not detect any HGST-produced <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> {{in contrast with the}} automatic detection of Western Digital's My Passport or My Passport Ultra <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> once the user plugs it in a computer where WD Smartware is installed. This software backs up all Documents, Pictures, Movies, Emails, and more on the drive, and continually checks for changes to drive locations. This means that regular backup takes place. The software appears to detect particular hard drives' brand and differs Western Digital <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> from another <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> a similar way to Seagate's SeaTools software.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} announced {{that there would}} be a simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows as well as concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested. Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001.|$|E
