[...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife. He said that The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects that you have to decide which format to use each week. He compared it to Awake, saying, then, [...] "What makes an Awake episode?" [...] "Pilot" [...] was written by Killen, and directed by David Slade.|$|E

500|$|Schwimmer {{made his}} directorial feature {{debut in the}} 2007 British comedy film Run Fatboy Run. The film stars Simon Pegg {{as a man who}} signs up for a {{marathon}} (he is out of shape) to convince his former fiancée and five-year-old son that he has turned his life around. When asked why he decided to direct the film, Schwimmer said: [...] "As a director, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> challenge that I thought the script presented, which was that it was kind of three films in one. You had some great, big physical comedy, and I thought funny dialogue and characters. And then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect". Run Fatboy Run garnered mixed reception, with the New York Daily News rating it one-and-a-half out of five stars and writing, [...] "Most disappointing is how Schwimmer—who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters—manages to bumble 'Fatboy's' tender moments". USA Today, however, was favorable towards Schwimmer, reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse [...] "having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera". For his directorial work, he was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Debut Director.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{works for}} the theater were a score for Euripides' The Bacchae (2009, {{directed}} by JoAnne Akalaitis), and Kepler (2009), yet another operatic biography of a scientist or explorer. The opera {{is based on the}} life of 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler, against the background of the Thirty Years' War, with a libretto compiled from Kepler's texts and poems by his contemporary Andreas Gryphius. It is Glass's first opera in German, and was premiered by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and Dennis Russell Davies in September 2009. LA Times critic Mark Swed and others described the work as [...] "oratorio-like"; Swed pointed out the work is Glass's [...] "most chromatic, complex, psychological score" [...] and [...] "the orchestra dominates (...) <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> muted, glowing colors, the character of many orchestral solos and the poignant emphasis on bass instruments".|$|E
2500|$|Bellairs {{undertook}} The Face in the Frost {{while living}} in Britain and after reading J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, {{but it is not}} much like that book, apart from sharing the idea of a wizard who is palpably human and not a literary stereotype. Bellairs said of his third book: [...] "The Face in the Frost was an attempt to write in the Tolkien manner. I was much taken by The Lord of the Rings and wanted to do a modest work on those lines. In reading the latter book <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Gandalf was not much of a person—just a good guy. So I gave Prospero, my wizard, most of my phobias and crotchets. It was simply meant as entertainment and any profundity will have to be read in." [...] Writing in 1973, Lin Carter described The Face in the Frost as one of the three best fantasy novels to appear since The Lord of the Rings. Carter stated that Bellairs was planning a sequel to The Face in the Frost at the time. An unfinished sequel titled The Dolphin Cross was included in the 2009 anthology Magic Mirrors, which was published by the New England Science Fiction Association Press.|$|E
2500|$|The cabinet which Papen formed {{was known}} as the [...] "cabinet of barons" [...] or as the [...] "cabinet of monocles" [...] and was widely {{regarded}} with ridicule by Germans. Papen had virtually no support in the Reichstag; the only parties committed to supporting him was the far-right/national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and German People's Party. However, Papen became very close to Hindenburg. The French Ambassador André François-Poncet reported to his superiors in the Quai d'Orsay about Papen's influence on Hindenburg that [...] "It's he [...] who is the preferred one, the favorite of the Marshal; he diverts the old man through his vivacity, his playfulness; he flatters him by showing him respect and devotion; he beguiles him with his daring; he is in [...] eyes the perfect gentleman." [...] Papen first met Hitler in June 1932, and found him a ridiculous figure. Papen always spoke his German with an aristocratic, Westphalian accent and found Hitler with his lower-class Austrian accent of German to be an absurd man, deserving only of contempt. Papen wrote about his meeting with Hitler:"I found him curiously unimpressive. I could detect no inner quality which might explain his extraordinary hold on the masses. He was wearing a dark blue suit and seemed the complete petite-bourgeous. He had an unhealthy complexion, and with his little moustache and curious hair style had an indefinable bohemian quality. His demeanor was modest and polite, and although I had heard much about the magnetic quality of his eyes, I do not remember being impressed by them...As he talked about his party's aims <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fanatical insistence with which he presented his arguments. I realized that the fate of my Government would depend to a large extent on the willingness of this man and his followers to back me up, and that this would be the most difficult problem with which I should have to deal. He {{made it clear that he}} would not be content with a subordinate role and intended in due course to demand plenary powers for himself. 'I regard your Cabinet only as a temporary solution, and will continue my efforts to make my party the strongest in the country. The Chancellorship will then devolve on me', he said".|$|E
