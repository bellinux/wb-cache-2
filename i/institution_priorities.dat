40|$|Background:Outpatient {{scheduling}} has {{a significant}} impact on the perceived quality of service by the users and the efficient use of resources in the health system. There are mathematical methods that assist in solving this problem, but are seldom applied. Aim: To propose decision rules that are based on the own conditions of each institution and indicate which appointment system is the most suitable for the decision makers. Material and Methods: Through computer simulation, the effect of a wide range of decision and environmental factors over the appointment systems performance was assessed, in order to determine how these factors affect them. Re-suits: Consideringperformance indicators associated to the patient's satisfaction and resources utilization, scheduling shorter length patients (e. g. check-up patients) in the beginning of the working day resulted to be in the efficient solutions frontier, as well as scheduling patients in one person blocks (shifting to multiple patient blocks only if resources utilization indicators are prioritized). Conclusions: Performance indicators are more sensitive to the sequence used to schedule different length patients, rather than the number of patients scheduled per block. Moreover, decision rules based on the <b>institution</b> <b>priorities</b> are proposed, which are quite robust to environmental factors...|$|E

40|$|Solution-processed {{semiconductors}} such as conjugated polymers {{have great}} potential in large-area electronics. While extremely appealing {{due to their}} low-temperature and high-throughput deposition methods, their integration in high-performance circuits has been difficult. An important remaining challenge is the achievement of low-voltage circuit operation. The present study focuses on state-of-the-art polymer thin-film transistors based on poly(indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole) and shows that the general paradigm for low-voltage operation via an enhanced gate-to-channel capacitive coupling is unable to deliver high-performance device behavior. The order-of-magnitude longitudinal-field reduction demanded by low-voltage operation plays a fundamental role, enabling bulk trapping and leading to compromised contact properties. A trap-reduction technique based on small molecule additives, however, is capable of overcoming this effect, allowing low-voltage high-mobility operation. This approach is readily applicable to low-voltage circuit integration, as this work exemplifies by demonstrating high-performance analog differential amplifiers operating at a battery-compatible power supply voltage of 5 V with power dissipation of 11 µW, and attaining a voltage gain above 60 dB at a power supply voltage below 8 V. These findings constitute an important milestone in realizing low-voltage polymer transistors for solution-based analog electronics that meets performance and power-dissipation requirements {{for a range of}} battery-powered smart-sensing applications.

40|$|When {{the doors}} of a science center open, so do {{opportunities}} to step into oversized bubbles or unearth fossils in a dig site {{the size of a}} football field. Are those experiences educationally meaningful or merely novel? To address this question, I gathered evidence and interpretations in three separate yet connected studies on the design features of a quality science exhibit in three separate studies. In the first study, I conducted a literature review on exhibit design features that had a moderating effect on learning. Each of the 19 studies in the sample was an empirical investigation. I used the findings from this review to (a) generate a research-based exhibit design resource and (b) highlight exhibit elements that need clarification. In study two, I interviewed six veteran exhibit designers from nationally recognized institutions to clarify the role of authenticity in the exhibit design process. Findings from a constant comparative analysis of their interview data indicated that science exhibits needed to be authentic to the (a) institution, (b) learner, and (c) science as a field of study. ?Scale? and ?role-play? were two unique factors that shaped immersive environments in informal science education institutions. My focus on the exhibit as a learning environment predicated the need to investigate how authenticity is expressed across a larger sample of exhibits. In the third study, I used four expressions of authenticity as pre-determined categories for a content analysis on 106 exhibit descriptions from summative evaluations in the Building Informal Science Education network database. The findings from this study affirmed the effect of an <b>institution?s</b> <b>priorities</b> on the presence of authentic artifacts (e. g., natural history museums) over hands-on experiences (e. g., science centers).

40|$|From a {{normative}} perspective, conventional economic analysis {{is often used}} to establish a framework in which social objectives can be built into the decision-making process. The health economics literature, however, tends to overlook the positive analysis of decision making [...] often assuming particular social objectives {{that may or may not}} correspond with reality. This perhaps explains why exercises in health economics priority setting on occasions break down. This study is a positive analysis of group decision making. It examines the process of deliberating upon proposed changes to funding arrangements across Divisions of General Practice in Queensland, Australia. Existing levels of funding had, for a number of years, largely been determined by an allocation formula. The motivation for this study was a perceived inequity created by the long-term under-funding of smaller (resource poor or 'marginal') Divisions. The challenge in this project was that any change in funding arrangements required the support of all the Divisions but also would potentially create 'winners' and 'losers'. Decision making within such an institutional context was rendered a zero sum game. This paper documents a consultative process whereby the relevant stakeholders, with clear interests in any decision, were asked to participate in deliberations as to how such a problem should be tackled. The objective was, in the face of adverse incentives, to derive recommendations for addressing existing shortfalls experienced by some of these Divisions. The process involved encouraging relevant players to take into consideration the global allocation issues and to move beyond their localised interests. The results indicate that such a process can be effective in not only generating the necessary goodwill to enable such group decision making, but also in establishing a more realistic set of policy recommendations. <b>Institutions</b> <b>Priority</b> setting Decision making Political economy Health policy Australia...|$|R

40|$|Economists {{included}} knowledge their {{models to}} improve their explanatory accuracy. A major step was to describe the production of knowledge {{as well as its}} exploitation as an internal part of economic models. Politicians prefer to talk about a new kind of economy so they can sustain the myth of progress. Rather than explain economies using a new model they try to leave economic history intact while describing the future using the new and different model. Once the knowledge economy became a progressive new entity and embedded in political rhetoric at the highest level, institutions competing for resources have to adopt the vocabulary and redefine themselves as knowledge organisations. As more and more professions, firms and organisations described their activities in terms of the new knowledge economy, so performatively the knowledge economy became part of political reality. Knowledge is metaphysical. If it has any kind of existence then it is embodied and projected through the skills of the knowers. Since technology connects with all human activity, the reformulation of <b>institutions</b> and <b>priorities</b> demands changes to descriptions of what technology is.
