AimTo {{determine whether or}} not graphic angle measurement is sensitive and specific to Menière's disease laboratorial diagnosis and if there is an increase in the electrocochleography's sensitivity and specificity when graphic angle measurements are associated with Summating Potential-Action Potential ratio (SP/AP ratio). MethodsElectrocochleography's was used to analyze 71 ears from 55 subjects: 41 patients with clinical diagnosis of Menière's disease (MD group), and 14 healthy individuals as control (Group C). Graphic results were analyzed initially to obtain the SP/AP ratio; afterwards, through another program graphic angle measurements were calculated. ResultsSensitivity and specificity values of angle measures, SP/AP ratio, and the association between them varied according to the cutoff point, the highest equilibrium between sensitivity and specificity was observed with the values of 166. 25 for angle measurement and 27 % for SP/AP relation; 62. 79 % / 60. 71 % and 74. 42 % / 67. 86 %, respectively. The association between measurements showed a sensitivity increase due to the specificity decrease; 88. 37 % and 50 %, respectively.

40|$|The article {{suggests}} the diagnostics of air circulation in the hive. The ventilation of enclosed space {{is achieved by}} the constant movement of the worker bees’ wings with variable intensity, and hence with a modified air flow. The main place of air flow is notches on which the bees are located, and their flapping wings intensify pressure air circulation. Thus, the air pressure allows creating ventilation in the hive. The possibilities of controlling {{the temperature in the}} enclosed space are investigated. The theoretical studies and the analysis of scientific papers, as well as confirmations by practicing beekeepers of the Karachay-Cherkess Republic and Stavropol Territory have proved the correlation between the temperature regime of the hive confined space and the presence of carbon dioxide during winter. In the second half of winter, the correlation coefficient is reduced. This is due to the change in the physiological state of bee colonies, the appearance of larvae and, as a consequence, of oxygen consumption. Hence, there is need in hive ventilation and maintaining the stable temperature, especially in the areas of brood. The authors synthesized the sensor array device of temperature regulation. The use of this sensor improves the quality of sectoral diagnostics of the hive, and the evaluative zone allows to specify displacement estimation characteristics. The temperature control zone was determined. The possibility of temperature monitoring with the construction of the <b>graphic</b> <b>measurements</b> was realized...|$|R

For linear measurements, points in cusps tips of left central incisor and second premolars and molars were marked {{in one of the}} prostheses with graphite and transferred to the others using an acrylic resin guide. The prostheses were scanned after waxing, polymerization and treatments and the images were exported to “AutoCad 2002 Today®” software for measurements. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in changes of each segment for each group and between the phases evaluated after polymerization and thermocycling. In groups I and III, the values after polymerization are higher than those after treatment, which suggests shrinkage while the prostheses in group II have expanded. Conclusion: The three groups exhibited artificial teeth movement after tests in comparison to the polymerized prosthesis. The prostheses submitted to water storage in kiln at 36 ºC during seven days showed different behavior than the other groups. Utilizando a metodologia da mensuração por computação gráfica, a proposta do presente trabalho é verificar se ocorrem alterações dimensionais das bases de resina acrílica, modificando a posição dos dentes artificiais, quando as mesmas são submetidas à imersão direta em água por tempos predeterminados e à simulação de uso por termociclagem. A partir de uma prótese total maxilar construída previamente, foram obtidas 24 réplicas em cera. Para as mensurações lineares, foram demarcados pontos nas pontas de cúspides dos segundo molares e pré-molares e incisivo central esquerdo em uma das próteses, evidenciados com grafite e transferidos para as outras através de um guia de resina acrílica.

Material and Methods: Seventeen clubfeet in 12 children were sequentially scanned by 2 examiners and repeat assessments {{were carried out}} independently. Three well-defined imaging planes were chosen to evaluate navicular displacement: the medial malleolus-navicular (MM-N) distance, soft tissue thickness, talar deformity and the calcaneocuboid (C-C) distance. Intra- and interobserver agreement was analysed using Cohen's kappa for the discrete variables and by Bland-Altman's <b>graphic</b> technique for <b>measurements.</b> Results: Kappa values for intra-observer agreement were 0. 82 for navicular displacement, 0. 93 for "talar head pointing laterally", and 0. 70 for medial deviation of the talar neck. The corresponding interobserver kappa values were 0. 70, 0. 68, and 0. 36.

In general, high-resolution methods for solving the ideal MHD equations are computationally expensive and Beowulf clusters or even supercomputers are often used to run the codes that implemented these methods. With the advent of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), modern graphics processing units (GPUs) provide an alternative approach to parallel computing for scientific simulations. In this paper we present, to the author's knowledge, the first implementation of MHD simulations entirely on GPUs with CUDA, named GPU-MHD, to accelerate the simulation process. GPU-MHD supports both single and double precision computation. A series of numerical tests have been performed to validate the correctness of our code. Accuracy evaluation by comparing single and double precision computation results is also given. Performance measurements of both single and double precision are conducted on both the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 (GT 200 architecture) and GTX 480 (Fermi architecture) <b>graphics</b> cards.

On the basis of the author's method of multiple comparisons, we develop the new approach of studying in one problem of statistical dependences of the various form, in which is used a method of multiple comparisons for quintile splitting’s (a triad, a quart, a quint) of the data on each parameter. The method of multiple comparisons based on pair comparisons and revealing of authentic differences: between groups of examinees for all parameters; between parameters for all studied groups; between all ordered pairs "group – parameter", is a structural component of our statistical approach developed for a construction of psychological typologies. For classification are defined kinds of dependences: 11 for triads and 28 for quarts. The basic types of dependences: dependence with a maximum and a minimum, increasing and decreasing, but it is far not linear, fluctuations max–min and min–max. In each type are included various quantity (from 2 to 9) of kinds of dependences (for triads less, it has more than quarts) which are defined by symmetry, the general increasing or decreasing tendency, shift to the left or to the right, uniformity of change.

This work aims to develop a new prototype desalination unit with thermal controllable operating parameters for operation in transient and steady states.

40|$|New Zealand's South Island is {{actively}} deforming {{as a result}} of oblique continental collision between the Pacific and Australian Plates. Within the central portion of the island, this results in reverse faulting, including earthquake rupture on the previously unreseached Lake Heron Fault. Because few of these faults have been studied, there is a major gap in knowledge on the paleoseismicity of the region. In this thesis, I use structural mapping, deformation analysis, geophysics, topo- <b>graphic</b> contouring, fault <b>measurements,</b> Monte Carlo simulations, and paleoseismic trenching, in conjuction with geochronologic approaches including Schmidt hammer exposure age dating, and radiocarbon dating to characterize the earthquake history and behavior of the Lake Heron Fault. Measurements of Pleistocene-Holocene displacement of discrete and distributed de- formation indicate that along the Lake Heron Fault, total vertical deformation is approx- imately 20 m since the Last Glacial Maximum. This deformation can be constrained, using Schmidt hammer exposure age dating, to the last 10 : 15 ± 2 : 95 ka, and is consistent across surfaces which could differ in age by up to 15 ka. This suggests that a period of quiescence was followed by increased activity, and using Monte Carlo simulations, a vertical slip rate of 2 : 25 ± 1 : 05 mm/yr was calculated. This is more than double pub- lished vertical uplift rates, though when the fault dip within bedrock (60 °) is integrated, net slip falls within published geodetic slip rates. While the fault was seen to dip 60 ° in bedrock, near surface dip measurements indicate a de ection and shallowing of fault dip by up to 80 % in some locations in Late Quaternary sediments. Further structural calculations indicate that while the Lake Heron Fault has a strike (200 °), preferential to pure dip-slip motion, which is seen on discrete fault scarps, mi- crotectonic measurements from crestal grabens show that along the fault, near-surface stress and localized surface rupture is not representative of the regional stress or the structure at depth. From paleoseismic trenching, evidence of 2 - 3 earthquakes was discovered, and using radiocarbon dating, the timing of the last events is constrained to the last 2. 6 ka, with the most recent event occurring approximately 0 : 6 ± 0 : 2 ka. Large single event displacements (2 : 75 ± 0 : 25 m), earthquake magnitudes (Mw 7 : 4 ± 0 : 3), and a short recurrence interval (1 : 45 ± 0 : 42 ka) indicate that the Lake Heron Fault has been highly active in the Holocene. Results of this study in conjunction with others also show there is a possibility the Lake Heron and Forest Creek fault represent an 80 km long, segmented reverse fault, capable of generating Mw 7. 7 earthquakes. However, because of variability in the timing of paleoearthquakes, the structures more frequently ruptures independently in magnitude 7. 0 + earthquakes. Lastly, I propose that changing crustal stress provides a possible mechanism for apparent temporal variability in the earthquake recurrence on the Lake Heron Fault...|$|R
