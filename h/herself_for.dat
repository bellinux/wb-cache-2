5|$|Natasha begins {{looking for}} {{information}} about her mother, Helena, and learns that her aunt Emilia lives in Australia. Without revealing her identity, Natasha meets Emilia at a fashion shoot. Emilia works out Natasha is her niece and comes to Erinsborough to talk to her. Natasha learns her mother drowned and she demands the truth about her death. Michael reveals that Helena was not a strong swimmer, but {{she went into the}} sea to save Natasha. When he became aware of what was happening, he could only save one of them. Michael reassures Natasha that Helena's death was not her fault. Michael collapses and undergoes surgery for a perforated stomach ulcer, causing Natasha to blame <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> his condition. However, she learns that Michael caught Summer cheating on her exam the day he collapsed and falls out with her friends, as they let her blame <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> what happened. After receiving her exam results, Natasha decides to study Contemporary Arts at university.|$|E
5|$|Cool World marked Bakshi's {{return to}} feature films after nine years. The film was {{originally}} pitched as an animated horror film about an underground cartoonist who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, who hates <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> {{what she is}} and tries to kill him. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was scrapped by producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. and heavily rewritten by Michael Grais and Mark Victor in secret. Reviews praised the film's visuals, but criticized the story and characters, {{as well as the}} combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film would eventually gross only half its production budget.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Prince Nicholas eloped with Ioana Doletti, a {{divorced}} woman. Marie strongly disapproved of her son's actions and felt hurt by Doletti's repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother. Although she blamed {{the women in}} her sons' lives for a while, she also came to blame <b>herself,</b> <b>for</b> failing to educate them properly. However, she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu, even after Carol's pleas. Until her last years, Marie seldom even mentioned Lupescu's name.|$|E

She isn't interested in dressing like a man; she’s not using her clothes to get anything from anybody else - it's not a device. She's dressing <b>for</b> <b>herself.</b> She has good taste - you can just tell. I don't know how, it’s hard to say - but you can tell from the page somehow how she takes care of <b>herself.</b> But it’s <b>for</b> <b>herself</b> and <b>for</b> <b>herself</b> alone." ...|$|R

5|$|Paine {{traveled}} through Maine, {{where she had}} difficulty establishing <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> want of connections that she had relied upon in the past, so she returned to Providence {{and for the first}} time established herself in a highly respectable commercial building with, aside from herself, only male occupants. She struggled professionally and, because of the loss of her mother, she suffered personally. The career that she relied upon kept her forever traveling, which had made it difficult to establish long-standing relationships. Her relationship with her mother was the only close one of her life.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in October 1889, Eddy {{closed the}} Massachusetts Metaphysical College; {{according}} to Bates and Dittemore, {{the state attorney}} was investigating colleges that were fraudulently graduating medical students. She also foreclosed the mortgage on the land in Boston the church had purchased, then purchased it <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> $5,000 through a middle man, though it was worth considerably more. She told the church they could have the land for their building on condition they formally dissolve the church; this was apparently intended to quash internal rebellions that had been bothering her. The following year she dissolved the National Christian Science Association. Wilson writes that the dissolutions allowed her to create a central church controlled by a five-person board of directors that answered only to her, which gave the church a stability that helped it survive her death.|$|E
5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered apocryphal, had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for her hand in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E

5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> marriage.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Following her fiftieth {{birthday}} in May 1767, Maria Theresa contracted smallpox from her daughter-in-law, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. She survived, {{but the new}} empress did not. Maria Theresa then forced her daughter, Archduchess Maria Josepha, to pray {{with her in the}} Imperial Crypt next to the unsealed tomb of Empress Maria Josepha. The Archduchess started showing smallpox rash two days after visiting the crypt and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined bride of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. Maria Theresa blamed <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> her daughter's death {{for the rest of her}} life because, at the time, the concept of an extended incubation period was largely unknown and it was believed that Maria Josepha had caught smallpox from the body of the late empress.|$|E

5|$|Queen Adelaide {{attended}} the dying William devotedly, {{not going to}} bed <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> more than ten days. William IV died {{in the early hours}} of the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent, the only child of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, George III's fourth son. Under Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan. Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, author and statesman Duff Cooper, and the first Duke of Fife, who married Queen Victoria's granddaughter Louise.|$|E
5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E

He warns Sudeshna of dire consequences if Sairandhri does not willingly submit <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> unison. As Kichaka is the supreme power of Matsya, Virata and Sudeshna do not dare to oppose. Sairandhri warns and pleads Kichaka several times which bear no result. One night, Valala disguises {{himself as a}} woman and waits in the dance hall. Believing the woman to be Sairandhri, Kichaka enters the hall and is killed by Valala. Valala also kills Kichaka's hundred brothers who attempt to kill Sairandhri by making her perform Sati with Kichaka's corpse.|$|E
5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly very sensitive and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does not think so. She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels {{she could have been}} great friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Experiment {{kept her}} gunports closed and passed herself {{off as a}} merchantman, while the Haitians sailed closer to the convoy {{with the intent of}} {{boarding}} and capturing all five vessels. Once the Haitians were in musket range of the American vessels they opened fire on them, and Experiment returned the fire. Grapeshot from the Americans wreaked havoc among the Haitian barges and they were forced to withdraw. They stood off the American convoy for thirty minutes before beaching at the nearby island of Gonâve to land their wounded and gather reinforcements. With three more barges and fresh crews, the picaroons set off to assault the American convoy once more. They divided themselves into three squadrons of four barges each and set course to attack Experiment. The lead and centermost divisions attacked the sides of the American warship while the rear division assaulted the stern. During the lull in fighting Experiment had readied <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> the picaroons' next assault by positioning musketeers in defensive positions, loading her main guns, and raising boarding nets. Thus, when the Haitians attacked the American warship again she was well prepared to repulse any attempt at boarding her.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{enters the}} cave and is locked in. He escapes through another exit, and discovers a place used by Brian to escape his father. Henry goes deeper into the cave with the {{climbing}} equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's corpse {{at the bottom of}} a cavern, piled under rocks. Delilah is upset, blaming <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> allowing Brian to stay. The next day, a conflagration grows uncontrollably and an emergency evacuation order is given out to all lookouts. As Henry prepares, he follows the tracking device's signal to a cassette tape from Ned, who claims that Brian's death was because of climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society, Ned admits to living in the wilderness and is trekking deeper, advising against following him. Henry finds Ned's camp with items from the watchtowers, camp and the teenage girls, whom Delilah confirms are safe and sound. The government camp was studying wildlife, with Ned using radio equipment to deter Henry. Delilah states that a rescue helicopter is waiting for him at Thorofare Lookout and he treks there to find Delilah gone, having taken another helicopter. Using the radio equipment, he contacts her one final time and asks when he will see her again. She tells him to go back to his wife and Henry boards a helicopter heading home.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{then joined}} the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, {{weakened}} Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus {{used to kill}} Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by the Titan Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, {{who are capable of}} returning him to the moment of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless—in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} <b>herself</b> <b>for</b> her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
5000|$|The Virgin Mary {{was found}} obedient, Eve disobedient. While Eve was a virgin, {{she did not}} obey, {{becoming}} {{the cause of death}} to herself and humanity, so Mary, being obedient became <b>for</b> <b>herself</b> and all of humanity the cause of salvation. (St. Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses) Irenaeus of Lyons is one of many Church Fathers to give insight on the Eve-Mary parallel when he states: “Even though Eve had Adam for a husband, she was still a virgin…by disobeying, she became the cause of death <b>for</b> <b>herself</b> and <b>for</b> the whole human race. In the same way, Mary, though she also had a husband, was a still a virgin, and by obeying, she became the cause of salvation <b>for</b> <b>herself</b> and <b>for</b> the whole human race…the knot of Eve’s disobedience was untied by Mary’s obedience.

He states, [...] "even though Eve had Adam for a husband, {{she was still a}} virgin... By disobeying, Eve became the cause of death <b>for</b> <b>herself</b> and <b>for</b> the whole human race. In the same way Mary, though she had a husband, was still a virgin, and by obeying, she became the cause of salvation <b>for</b> <b>herself</b> and <b>for</b> the whole human race.|$|R
