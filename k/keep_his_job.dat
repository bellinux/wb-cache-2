5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He {{has no idea what}} to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown even though there was no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E

50|$|Rose Lawrence (Lindsay Pulsipher) is Ellis's neighbor, {{with whom}} he shares a romantic relationship. A law student, she is sharp enough to spot {{something}} odd about Ellis (who <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> a closely guarded secret) and takes the relationship slowly.|$|R
50|$|Ross {{manages to}} contact the store's {{frequently}} absent owner, Commodore Franklin Monroe, and gets his proxy {{just in time for}} the vote of the board of 40 directors.

5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} in the Second Division in 1954–55 brought them an 11th-place finish. During this season the club {{suffered}} the biggest defeat in its history, a 9–1 loss to Birmingham City. Although in the following season they improved to third place, {{it was not enough}} for Welsh to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> and he was sacked {{at the end of the}} season. His replacement was Phil Taylor, a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff. Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and Jimmy Melia, who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come, but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division. The Liverpool board persisted with him, despite the club's loss to non-League side Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959. His tenure ended during the 1959–60 season; after a good start, their form began to tail off mid-season, and after a defeat to Huddersfield Town, Taylor resigned. The man who replaced him was Huddersfield's manager, Bill Shankly.|$|E
25|$|After the big win, Nemechek posted {{five other}} Top 10 finishes, but {{finished}} 25th in points. It wasn't enough for Nemechek to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> at Hendrick, {{and at the}} end of the season was released from his contract.|$|E

5|$|After {{discovering}} that Tracy {{is still in}} contact with NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Jack realizes that their relationship {{is the key to}} bringing Tracy back to TGS. Jack, therefore, orders Kenneth to break off all contact with Tracy, although this fails because of Kenneth's relationship with Tracy. Seeing an opportunity, Jack states that since Kenneth's duties were primarily taking care of Tracy, and Tracy no longer works at NBC, Kenneth is no longer needed. Not wanting Kenneth to lose <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> Tracy agrees to return on the stipulation that Kenneth <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b>|$|R

The directors confirmed that McLeish would <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> and would be expected to return the club to the Premier League at the first opportunity. McLeish however opted to quit Birmingham City on 12 June 2011 by email.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and after}} World War II, various {{circumstances}} intertwined {{the careers of}} Cherniss and his friend Robert Oppenheimer, {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project that developed the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The couple evangelized widely, starting a campus church and secret bible school in Fangshan District, Beijing. On May 9, 1996, the couple was detained for running a Christian training center in Fangshan District, Beijing and for illegal evangelizing. On July 8, they left detention in good health, having been reportedly treated well but warned not to engage with foreigners.

25|$|During {{the preseason}} of 2001, Eskimos head coach Don Matthews {{was fired in}} a famously messy separation, {{allegedly}} for health reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Tom Higgins. Higgins would later develop a reputation for changing quarterbacks frequently, and although the flashy Greene had been the starter in Edmonton for two years, his spotty arm was beginning to draw criticism from fans. The door was wide open for the two backups, Crowley and Maas, to show that they could take the reins from the faltering Greene. Crowley was strong and Greene fought valiantly to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> but by Week 7 it was Maas who had taken the starting quarterback spot that he would keep {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Strom wrote {{a weekly}} column for {{newspapers}} near Pottstown which provided a {{perspective of the}} life of an NBA referee. In the spring of 1979, Strom criticized Chicago Bulls team management, in particular president Jonathan Kovler, over the firing of head coach Larry Costello after 56 games. While this incident was occurring, shortly after, Strom was involved in a shoving match with a fan and security officer following a game played in Phoenix, Arizona. These incidents led to Strom being suspended the remainder of the 1979 NBA Playoffs and was required to apologize to Kovler. In order to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> Strom assured the league {{that there would be no}} animosity directed towards the Bulls and decided to discontinue writing his weekly column.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Carlson is a well-meaning, bumbling, childlike {{man who is}} {{completely}} {{out of touch with}} the changes that have occurred in the radio and music business. He <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> as general manager of WKRP only because his mother, Lillian Carlson, better known as [...] "Mama Carlson", owns the station.

25|$|Following {{his defeat}} at Atlanta, General Hood regrouped his army at Lovejoy's Station, {{following}} which {{they moved to}} Palmetto, Georgia. Here they were reviewed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, {{who had come to}} speak with Hood about his next move. Even after the disaster at Atlanta, Hood still retained a formidable force of 39,000 men, and though Davis expressed disappointment in the way he had fought in Georgia and spoke of relieving him from command, he ultimately decided that Hood would <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> Davis did order Lieutenant General Hardee, the 33rd's longtime corps commander, to a new assignment, replacing him with Frank Cheatham. Hoping to draw Sherman away from Atlanta, Hood and Davis decided that the Army of Tennessee would move north toward Chattanooga, seeking to damage Federal supply lines and force Sherman to do battle on terrain favorable to the Confederates.|$|E
25|$|It {{was widely}} known that Griffin hoped to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> under President Barack Obama so that Constellation and NASA's other {{programs}} could maintain their steady progress. In {{a phone call}} {{on the day after}} the election, Senator Bill Nelson (D, FL) requested of Lori Garver, who led the incoming Obama Administration's Transition Team, that the Administration allow Griffin to remain as NASA Administrator to provide programmatic and management continuity. However, his resignation (required of and offered by all agency heads due to an incoming President) was accepted. In part, this was because of disagreements between Griffin and Garver over the state of Project Constellation. Griffin gave a farewell address to NASA on 16 January 2009, in which he praised NASA for its recovery from the Columbia disaster and urged employees to support the new administrator, whoever it may be. He left office the day President Obama was inaugurated.|$|E
25|$|After the 2008 season, turmoil emerged when A. J. Allmendinger and Reed Sorenson {{were signed}} to drive for the team, while Elliott Sadler was {{released}} from his ride in the 19 car and planned to sue the team to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> In {{the midst of a}} struggling economy, in January 2009 GEM merged with fellow Dodge team Petty Enterprises, which could no longer find sponsors for any of its cars, thus expanding the team to four cars. The organization was renamed Richard Petty Motorsports in the process. Ray Evernham was not involved in the merger negotiations, and both he and Richard Petty only maintained minority shares in the new team. Near the end of the season, the team announced its departure from the Dodge banner after being its flagship team since 2001. The team switched to Ford and would merge with Yates Racing, owned by Ford head engine builder Doug Yates, which had fielded several successful NASCAR drivers including Davey Allison, Ernie Irvan, Dale Jarrett, and Ricky Rudd.|$|E

I look not at how the popular vote changes with economic conditions, but how the electoral vote changes.

25|$|The {{episode of}} History Detectives, which aired on July 2, 2014, {{reviewed}} the known evidence, thoroughly disputing the sabotage theory, and then {{focused on the}} question of why the steamboat was allowed to be crowded to several times its normal capacity before departure. The report blamed quartermaster Hatch, an individual with a long history of corruption and incompetence, who was able to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> due to political connections: he was the younger brother of Illinois politician Ozias M. Hatch, an advisor and close friend of President Lincoln. Throughout the war, Reuben Hatch had shown incompetence as a quartermaster and competence as a thief, bilking the government out of thousands of dollars. Although brought up on courts-martial charges, Hatch managed to get letters of recommendation from such noted authorities as President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and General of the Army Ulysses S. Grant. The letters reside in the National Archives in Washington DC. After the disaster, Hatch refused three separate subpoenas to appear before Captain Speed's trial and give testimony. Hatch died in 1871, having escaped justice due to his numerous highly placed patrons—including two presidents.|$|E
25|$|Carpentier, who was 36 {{years old}} at the time, became the {{full-time}} driver for 2008, part of a unique rookie class stacked with open wheel veterans all trying to emulate the success found by Juan Pablo Montoya the previous year. This included IndyCar Series Champions Dario Franchitti and Sam Hornish, Jr., and CART and Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve, as well as DEI development drivers Regan Smith and Aric Almirola. With Valvoline taking a backseat role in 2008 and Stanley Tools moving to the No. 19 car, GEM signed LifeLock for eight races, an identity security company making a large entrance investment into NASCAR. Charter Communications and Auto Value/Bumper to Bumper also sponsored several races. Carpentier won the pole at Loudon but otherwise struggled, as did his fellow open-wheel counterparts. He had no Top 10s, missed five races — including the Daytona 500 — and was out of the Top 35 in points when he was released after Kansas. Second-year driver A. J. Allmendinger replaced Carpentier, after being released from Red Bull Racing in favor of Scott Speed. In his five races for GEM, Allmendinger was impressive, posting three Top 15's and often outrunning his teammates. Allmendinger was initially rewarded with a full-time ride in the No. 19 car, replacing Elliott Sadler. This was derailed when Sadler intended to sue the team and Allmendinger to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> when Reed Sorenson was signed as a third driver, and when several sponsors threatened to leave the team in response to the recent moves.|$|E
