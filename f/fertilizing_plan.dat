40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} agronomic factors, and that of their interactions, on wheat protein {{percentage}} has been studied. The analysis {{is based on the}} data collected on the wheat cultivation of Bologna and Modena provinces in the year 1999 - 2000 and considers the main agronomic variables. Interesting conclusions about interactions of climatic, soil and cultivation aspects have been drawn by employing the method of nonparametric regression known as regression trees. In particular, the importance of manuring has emerged: a right <b>fertilizing</b> <b>plan,</b> with respect both to the dosage time and to the dosage intensity, seems to damp the consequences of heavy rainfalls or bad previous cultivations...|$|E
50|$|On October 1, 2006, Tent City was in {{the process}} of being revived by {{students}} when they ran into problems. Campus workers had put down a highly concentrated liquid fertilizer called Earth Juice. The administration claimed that the <b>fertilizing</b> was <b>planned</b> months in advance. The next day, the Tent City was revived to protest the 9th president selection. Eventually the students seized the Hall Memorial Building (HMB), and locked it down in order to prevent any classes from resuming and force the university administration to the negotiation table.|$|R
50|$|Back in Harmony, Gwen's mother Rebecca {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} take Little Ethan {{away from}} Theresa while Ethan and Gwen {{decided to have a}} baby using a surrogate mother. Little Ethan was eventually adopted by Ethan and Gwen. To get her son back, Theresa drugged and kidnapped Ethan and Gwen's surrogate and had herself implanted with Gwen and Ethan's <b>fertilized</b> embryo, <b>planning</b> to trade the baby for Little Ethan. Later, Theresa believed she had miscarried the baby, and tried unsuccessfully to get Fox Crane to impregnate her. Knowing she had only a limited window of time to replace the fetus, she stole a date rape drug (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) from Eve Russell and slipped it into Ethan's wine, then dressed up like Gwen and sneaked into his bed resulting in Theresa getting pregnant with a second baby.|$|R
25|$|Crops do not end {{up using}} all of the {{synthetic}} fertilizer it is fed. The remainder ends up polluting surrounding land. Some of it will evaporate into the air where it will acidify the rain and produce greenhouse gases. It will also seep into the groundwater or run off into nearby bodies of water, thus polluting the drinking water of nearby communities. Poor soil health resulting from overproduction, excessive fertilizer use and inappropriate application of fertilizer causes runoff and leaching. Runoff into forests or marine areas can alter the ecosystem by <b>fertilizing</b> some <b>plan</b> species and poisoning others. The result of toxic runoff from commodity agriculture surrounding the Mississippi River {{can be seen at}} the hypoxic zone where the river meets the Gulf of Mexico. Here, algae grow rampant as a result of nitrogen fertilizer runoff thereby suffocating the animal life. This area has not reduced in size despite previous action plans for reduction made by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. This hypoxic zone threatens the $2.8 billion fishing industry that depends on {{the northern part of the}} Gulf, which could affect the economy at large.|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the hatching experiments in the incubation channels in 1994. Eggs and sperms were obtained from the mature adults collected in the Nagara River. Following the artifical insemination, one hundred million <b>fertilized</b> eggs were <b>planned</b> to be cultured up to the eyed eggs and transferred to the incubation channels. Theur survivals were to be monitored until their release. Hatching rates under the natural and experimental conditions were both suggested to be around 0. 5, and those adjusted by the survival curves were thought to be 0. 6. Instead of the one hundred million fertilized eggs to be collected, 33 million eggs were obtained as results of delayed spawning due to the limited experimental period caused by the increased water flow in the river. The overall average of the hatching rates was around 0. 5, and it is suggested that some 16. 5 million Ayu-fries have hatched out from about 33 million artificially fertilized eggs. It is shown that the Ayu-fries have hatched out from 5 p. m. to 9 p. m., especially around 6 p. m...|$|R
