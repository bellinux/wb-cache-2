One of the <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this chord (as {{described}} by Pedler) is how McCartney's high bass note reverberates inside the soundbox of Lennon's acoustic guitar {{and begins to}} be picked up on Lennon's microphone or pick-up during the sounding of the chord. This gives the chord its special [...] "wavy" [...] and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a [...] "virtual pull-off".|$|E

She later remarked: [...] "It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, and I {{thank him for}} the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> cricket {{is the fact that}} a major section of the game, fielding, has little or no {{statistical}} data to call upon when selecting players, or making tactical adjustments. This had always puzzled Fountain, as he had extensive experience of baseball where all elements of the game, fielding included, are recorded. In 2010, Fountain's groundbreaking [...] "Fielding Analysis System" [...] for cricket was put into a software package, to allow every aspect of cricket fielding to be scored and analysed, giving a complete picture on a team or individuals performance. The system was first used by Fountain during his early stints with the West Indies on the 2000 / 2001 tour of Australia, and has been 10 years in development. Since that time various people have tried to imitate or copy it, including certain well known TV companies.|$|E

[...] Lenny Kaye, writing in Jazz & Pop magazine, praised the album, noting that [...] "One of the more <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Preflyte is the consistency of The Byrds sound, especially when compared with their later post-Tambourine Man days." [...] In more recent years, Classic Rock reviewer Rob Hughes praised [...] "the purring harmonies, the extraordinary songcraft of frontman Gene Clark and the smooth exhalations of what became the California folk-rock sound", {{despite the fact that}} The Byrds had [...] "yet to become competent musicians".

Uncle Jim was childish now, and he had a great pride in his nephew. He wanted to hear of all of Duane's exile. And if there was one thing more than another that pleased him it was to talk about the bullets which Duane carried in his body.|$|E

He told how the Indians came through the great forest on big webbed shoes, that kept them from sinking into the snow, and hunted for Lightfoot the Deer, and how they never bothered Prickly Porky, but always treated him with the greatest respect. He told so many, many <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the great North Woods, that all the little meadow people and forest folk gathered close around to listen, but every few minutes, while he was talking, he would shake his thousand little spears, and then every one would smile.|$|E
