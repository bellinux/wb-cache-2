40|$|A <b>damping</b> <b>control</b> {{design for}} {{electric}} power systems with multiple operating points is discussed. The <b>damping</b> <b>control</b> design {{problem of a}} multimodel system can be described by nonlinear matrix inequalities (NMI). In the past, LMI approaches have been proposed to solve the <b>damping</b> <b>control</b> design on a nominal model (or single model) through suitable parameterisation and transformation of the original NMI into LMI problems. However, nominal model based LMI approaches and associated parameterisation and transformation techniques are not applicable to the NMI for a multimodel system. A two-step based LMI approach for output feedback <b>damping</b> <b>control</b> design for a system with multiple operating points or a multimodel system is presented, applicable to a general linear model with matrices (A, B, C, D). In particular, the incorporation of regional pole placement in a STATCOM damping controller for a multimodel system is presented and <b>damping</b> <b>control</b> design is demonstrated on both a single-machine infinite bus and a multimachine power system. Numerical results show the proposed damping controller can ensure simultaneous stability and adequate damping for multiple operating points...|$|R

40|$|Aiming at {{the fact}} that {{large-scale}} penetration of wind power will to some extent weaken the small signal stability of power systems, in this paper, the dynamic model of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is established firstly, to analyze the impact of wind generation on power oscillation damping.

To achieve best performance, parameters of the <b>damping</b> <b>control</b> are tuned by using a genetic algorithm. Results of eigenvalue analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of supplementary <b>damping</b> <b>control</b> with fixed wind speed.

40|$|The {{non-linear}} behaviour of electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) dampers {{makes it}} difficult to design effective control strategies, and as a consequence a wide range of control systems have been proposed in the literature. These previous studies have not always compared the performance to equivalent passive systems, alternative control designs, or idealised active systems. As a result it is often impossible to compare the performance of different smart <b>damper</b> <b>control</b> strategies. This article provides some insight into the relative performance of two MR <b>damper</b> <b>control</b> strategies: on/off control and feedback linearisation. The performance of both strategies is benchmarked against ideal passive, semi-active and fully active damping. The study relies upon a previously developed model of an MR damper, which in this work is validated experimentally under closed-loop conditions with a broadband mechanical excitation. Two vibration isolation case studies are investigated: a single-degree-of-freedom mass-isolator, and a two-degree-of-freedom system that represents a vehicle suspension system. In both cases, a variety of broadband mechanical excitations are used and the results analysed in the frequency domain. It is shown that although on/off control is more straightforward to implement, its performance is worse than the feedback linearisation strategy, and can be extremely sensitive to the excitation conditions...|$|E

However, most {{algorithms}} require not only extremely detailed models of the plant but also wave prediction, leading to difficulties when implementing these algorithms in reality. This paper investigates the use of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control – a simple gradient-ascent algorithm well developed for solar and wind energy – on a novel wave energy converter comprising a fully submerged oscillating buoy and a tether coupled hydraulic power-take-off (PTO) unit. A study of the sensitivity of control to irregular wave fluctuations/variability was proposed to systematically determine the step size and update rate of MPPT controller. The world’s first commercial scale fully submerged wave energy converter (WEC), Carnegie’s CETO system, was used as a test case to assess the proposed methodology under passive <b>damping</b> <b>control.</b> Optimization was done on the CETO system based on typical Australian sea sates in order to benchmark the performance of MPPT control.
