5|$|Christian Hendrik Persoon {{named the}} species Peziza nigrella in his Systema Mycologia in 1801, {{and it was}} sanctioned under this name in Elias Magnus Fries' Systema Mycologicum in 1821. In 1870, German mycologist Fuckel {{transferred}} it to <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> described genus Pseudoplectania, and made it the type species. The species was ulteriorly placed in Crouania by Friedrich August Hazslinszky von Hazslin, and in Plectania by Petter Karsten (1885), but neither placement is considered correct.|$|E

5|$|Low, using <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> {{captured}} ship, lay in wait on {{the popular}} shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm.

5|$|Macbeth {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Banquo {{can no longer}} be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered. Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween night, Scarecrow {{threatens the}} city with <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> created strain of fear toxin and bombs planted {{throughout}} Gotham, forcing the evacuation of the city's six million civilians.

60|$|Hal {{restrained}} {{himself with}} difficulty {{enough to take}} a courteous leave of his mother's husband, to whose prudence and forbearance he was really much beholden; though, with <b>his</b> spirit <b>newly</b> raised and burning for his King, {{it was hard to}} have patience with neutrality.|$|R
5|$|The 20-year-old {{king was}} inexperienced and {{considered}} ill-served amidst {{what has been}} called the anarchy in the nation. He dedicated autumn in <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> formed camp in Scania to arm the Swedish nation for battle in the Scanian War. The Swedish soldiers in Scania were outnumbered and outequipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded Scania, taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohuslän towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up quickly. He suddenly found himself alone and under great pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the British billionaire financier and tycoon Sir James Goldsmith set up Seawise & Titanic Salvage Ltd. {{with the}} involvement of underwater diving and photographic experts. His aim was to use the publicity of finding Titanic to promote <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> established magazine, NOW!. An expedition to the North Atlantic was scheduled for 1980 but was cancelled due to financial difficulties. A year later, NOW! folded after 84 issues with Goldsmith incurring huge financial losses.|$|E

5|$|Whereas Hecatompylos {{had served}} as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates {{established}} royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, Ctesiphon and <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> founded city, Mithradatkert (Nisa, Turkmenistan), where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained. Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty. Ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of Gotarzes I of Parthia (r. c.90–80BC). It became {{the site of the}} royal coronation ceremony and the representational city of the Arsacids, according to Brosius.|$|E
5|$|Working {{alongside}} Gemma whilst {{they were}} producing the globes, Mercator would {{have witnessed the}} process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> learned talents {{to work in a}} burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a map of the Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E

50|$|The {{existence}} of his obituary {{is thought to}} denote <b>his</b> profession's <b>newly</b> acquired respectability, as {{there are very few}} direct references to professional musicians in Ireland prior to his lifetime. Nevertheless, musicians would never hold the same esteem as poets, lawyers and historians in Gaelic culture.|$|R
5|$|At first, most of {{the newly}} settled Normans kept {{household}} knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, {{a process known as}} subinfeudation. William also required <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.|$|E
5|$|From 1970 onward, {{increasing}} numbers of books teaching readers how to become Pagan Witches were published; the earliest was Paul Huson's Mastering Witchcraft (1970), which made no reference to Wicca. This was followed by Raymond Buckland's The Tree: The Complete Book of Saxon Witchcraft, in which he propagated <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> developed tradition of Seax-Wica; utilising Wica as {{the name of the}} tradition, he also referenced the Wicca as the name of the religion as a whole. Contrastingly, during the 1970s the term Wicca was rejected by feminist Pagan Witchcraft groups in the United States, in particular the Dianic tradition; the term does not appear in the early works of Zsuzsanna Budapest and Starhawk, although the latter would adopt it by the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|From <b>his</b> <b>newly</b> {{established}} command post, in {{the trenches}} on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge, Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken. Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges had been prepared for demolition, the explosives had not been attached. Howard ordered his signalman to transmit the code words 'Ham' and 'Jam' then brought Fox's platoon across the canal bridge, positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company's forward platoon.|$|E
25|$|With his rising {{popularity}} {{with the common}} man MGR fell into controversy by referring to K. Kamaraj, the Congress leader, as My leader. MGR resigned as a Member of Legislative Council.

50|$|Shogun Yoshitane {{adopted the}} son of a cousin, Yoshizumi, and he {{designated}} Yoshitsuna as his heir and as his anticipated successor as shogun.
