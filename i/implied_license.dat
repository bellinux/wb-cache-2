25|$|For {{this reason}} {{the scope of}} implied {{licenses}} is strictly limited in New Zealand. The Supreme Court has said an <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> is unlikely to exist if {{the purpose of the}} entry was not to make a reasonable inquiry or if it cannot be assumed that the occupier would have consented to the police entering had they known the particular purpose for the entry. An <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> can extend to allow entry into a private premises in certain circumstances but this will be in the minority of cases and there will generally be no right of access even where, for example, the door to the premises is open. An <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> can be revoked by the occupier through a clear unequivocal revocation, further, the existence of gates or signs may amount to a physical revocation.|$|E
25|$|LGE {{points out}} that the License Agreement {{specifically}} disclaimed any license to third parties to practice the patents by combining licensed products with other components. But the question whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> but on exhaustion. And exhaustion turns only on Intel’s own license to sell products practicing the…patents.|$|E
25|$|Joint authorship of articles, {{in which}} {{different}} users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, {{can also cause}} editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, {{making it impossible to}} republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing. However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable. Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership. Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an open content license. Version 2 of the GNU Free Documentation License includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing; Creative Commons licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of business necessity and the inherent nature of a wiki, although the legal basis for such an <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> may not exist in all circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Hayes states that, {{although}} licensees' {{benefits are}} limited, the licenses reduce reliance on fair use regarding machinima. In turn, this recognition may reduce film festivals' concerns about copyright clearance; {{in an earlier}} analogous situation, festivals were concerned about documentary films until best practices for them were developed. According to Hayes, Microsoft and Blizzard helped themselves through their licenses because fan creations provide free publicity and are unlikely to harm sales. If the companies had instead sued for copyright infringement, defendants could have claimed estoppel or <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> because machinima had been unaddressed for a long time. Thus, these licenses secured their issuers' legal rights. Even though other companies, such as Electronic Arts, have encouraged machinima, they have avoided licensing it. Because of the involved legal complexity, they may prefer to under-enforce copyrights. Hayes believes that this legal uncertainty is a suboptimal solution and that, though limited and [...] "idiosyncratic", the Microsoft and Blizzard licenses move towards an ideal video gaming industry standard for handling derivative works.|$|E

5000|$|Justin Hughes {{also argues}} {{for use of}} an {{alternative}} doctrine. He maintains that <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> is a better tool than the fair use doctrine or merger doctrine in cases such as Veeck. The problem Hughes sees with fair use is that the fourth statutory fair use factor—effect on the plaintiff's market—has become dominant. That would tend to outlaw wholesale copying as occurred in Veeck. [...] "In contrast, the <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> doctrine may both cover the most important created fact cases and prompt {{a certain amount of}} self-selection on the question of copyright incentives." [...] Hughes argues that the facts of such cases typically support an <b>implied</b> <b>license</b> rationale: [...] "once the model code is written, the professional association effectively 'hands it over' to the government knowing that the government will reproduce and distribute the expression. In the case law, these are paradigmatic indicators of an implied license." ...|$|E

40|$|Technical standards, such as {{interface}} protocols or file formats, {{are extremely}} {{important in the}} “network industries” that add so much value to the world economy today. Under some circumstances, the assertion of patent rights against established industry standards can seriously disrupt these network industries. We have in mind two particularly disruptive tactics: (1) the “snake in the grass,” whereby a patentee intentionally keeps a patent “quiet” while a standard is being designed or adopted, and then later, after the standard is entrenched, asserts the patent widely {{in an attempt to}} capitalize on its popularity; (2) the “bait and switch” ploy where a patentee encourages adoption by offering royaltyfree use of standard-related patents, and then, after the standard has gone into widespread use, begins to enforce its patents against adopters of the standard. We propose to counteract these tactics with a simple solution: over time, adopters of a standard ought to build up a “reliance interest” in the standard. Under our approach—which we call “standards estoppel”—non-assertion of a patent right in the presence of widespread adoption should create immunity from patent infringement. The fundamental idea behind this doctrine is to prevent “strategic” assertions of patents that exploit the logic of network “lock-in. ” As we explain, though this is a simple doctrine based on deeply held common law principles, various gaps in the current doctrinal structure make this a necessary addition to the contemporary legal arsenal. In particular, “standards estoppel” plugs some dangerous conceptual holes in current rules relating to laches, waiver, estoppel, <b>implied</b> <b>licensing,</b> and patent misuse/antitrust. With this modest addition to the doctrinal fabric, patent law can more effectively guard against the risk of illegitimate leverage, thus more effectively fostering innovation in network industries...|$|R
