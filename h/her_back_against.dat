5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} Zidane and the Tantalus Theater Troupe {{attempting}} to kidnap Princess Garnet during her sixteenth birthday celebration {{in the city}} of Alexandria. Upon reaching her, they discover that Garnet, who is concerned about Queen Brahne's increasingly erratic behavior, had planned on escaping the city and is willing to be kidnapped, especially as their employer, Regent Cid of Lindblum, is who she wanted to run to. During the escape from the city, the troupe is joined by Vivi, who is looking to explore, and Steiner, who decides to travel with Garnet for her protection rather than take <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> her will. After the group flees the city and its guards, their damaged airship crashes, and Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Steiner travel on together. During their journey to Lindblum, Garnet takes the alias Dagger, and the group discovers a factory in the village of Dali that is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; {{no one had}} been in there since District Chief Farley's departure more than three hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E
60|$|Fan, {{covering}} {{her face with}} <b>her</b> hands, shrunk <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall, sobbing convulsively.|$|R
60|$|He {{had placed}} her upon the grass by now, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resting <b>against</b> {{the stem of}} a huge tree. At her {{question}} he stepped back where he could the better see her face.|$|R
60|$|And {{then her}} eyes closed. The {{voice of the}} Man from Nome had a monotony in its very earnestness. Besides, what dull talk was this of brooms and {{sweeping}} and dust? She leaned <b>her</b> head <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Korner rose. Miss Greene entered stealthily, and, {{closing the}} door, stood with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... [ANN {{shuts the}} street door and sets <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> it. The [...] rumble of the {{approaching}} van is heard outside. It ceases.] ...|$|E
6000|$|She, who was {{standing}} literally with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall, gave a little gulp, {{and that was all}} her answer. Soames went on: ...|$|E
60|$|For once startled {{out of her}} self-command, Elizabeth gave {{a little}} cry, while <b>her</b> father {{staggered}} <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall.|$|R
60|$|Slone strode toward <b>her.</b> Lucy <b>backed</b> <b>against</b> the cedar-tree {{and could}} go no farther. How white he was now! Lucy's heart gave a great, fearful leap, for she {{imagined}} Slone intended {{to take her}} in his arms. But he did not.|$|R
5000|$|Robyn Naismith - Victim of Ronnie Joe Waddell. She {{was killed}} {{with a single}} gunshot wound to her head, at her home by Ronnie Joe Waddell. She was naked, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> propped <b>against</b> the television. Bite marks were present on her body.|$|R
6000|$|... [ANN puts <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the door. CALWAY mounts {{the chair}} [...] dubiously, and raises his head cautiously, bending it more and [...] more downwards.] ...|$|E
6000|$|She leand <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wa, Says, [...] "Robin, let a' be; For it is a lady {{born and}} bred That's foughten sae well wi thee." ...|$|E

60|$|In the meanwhile, Madge had {{arranged}} herself for repose on the straw; but {{still in a}} half-sitting posture, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resting <b>against</b> {{the door of the}} hovel, which, as it opened inwards, was in this manner kept shut by the weight of the person.|$|R
60|$|Eight, {{nine and}} ten struck from the tower-clock far away: she heard these sounds as in a dream. Tired, cold and hungry her {{vitality}} {{at that moment}} was at its lowest ebb--and, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resting <b>against</b> the wall she fell presently into a torpor-like sleep.|$|R
60|$|And <b>her</b> head fell <b>back</b> <b>against</b> Dea Flavia's arm; her eyes, now veiled by {{the film}} of death gazed, sightless, up at the dome of blue.|$|R
6000|$|She stood, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the door, [...] And {{when her}} child drew near-- [...] 75 [...] 'Away! away!' the mother cried, [...] 'Ye shall not enter here.|$|E
6000|$|She leant <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> an aik, [...] Said--"Robin, let me be: [...] "For it is a ladye, bred and born, [...] "That {{has fought}} this day wi' thee." ...|$|E

60|$|Idella let <b>her</b> head fall <b>back</b> <b>against</b> Annie's breast, {{and began}} to finger the rings on the hand which Annie laid across her lap to keep her.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Whose Baby? was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. The Chicago Board of Censors cut a scene of a heavy woman sliding down a railing, two scenes of her falling in a gymnasium, and a closeup of <b>her</b> <b>backed</b> up <b>against</b> a wall.|$|R
60|$|And he fell on {{his knees}} before <b>her,</b> as she <b>backed</b> <b>against</b> the bookcase, and he caught hold of {{the edge of her}} dress-bottom, drawing it to him. Which made her rather abashed, and much more uncomfortable.|$|R
60|$|The {{fire had}} died down, so Maude shipped off her chair, {{and sat on}} the black fur rug, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> Frank's knees. 'Now, dear, read away!' said she.|$|E
60|$|So she {{sat down}} {{in a corner of the}} coop, leaned <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the slats, nodded at the {{friendly}} stars before she closed her eyes, and was asleep in half a minute.|$|E
60|$|Again Louise {{tried to}} find the {{speaking}} tube. Then she made an endeavor to open the door, although just then the car started with a jerk that flung <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the cushions.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> head sunk <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the rock. A low cry {{of terror}} burst from her. Her arm, {{resting on the}} rock, dropped at her side. I hurriedly {{approached}} her, in the fear that she might fall on the stony ground.|$|R
60|$|He {{entered his}} room through the French {{window on the}} veranda, when the door leading from the passage was {{suddenly}} flung open, and Miss Faulkner swept quickly inside, {{closed the door behind}} <b>her,</b> and leaned <b>back</b> <b>against</b> it, panting and breathless.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hussy--to {{come between}} us and our child now!' cried Rhoda. 'This {{is the meaning of}} what Satan showed me in the vision! You are like her at last!' And {{clutching}} the bare arm of the younger woman, she pulled <b>her</b> unresistingly <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall. Immediately Brook had loosened her hold the fragile young Gertrude slid down against the feet of her husband. When he lifted her up she was unconscious.|$|R
6000|$|She set <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> a thorn, [...] And {{there she}} has her young son borne; [...] "O smile nae sae, my bonny babe! [...] "An ye smile sae sweet, ye'll smile me dead." ...|$|E
60|$|A sigh {{made her}} turn round. With <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> {{the door and}} a white, scared face, the girl was standing. Gyp thought: 'She has {{suffered}} horribly.' And, going impulsively up to her, {{she held out her}} hand.|$|E
60|$|She ran {{ahead of}} him, intercepted him, faced him with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the door. He swept {{out a long}} arm as if to brush her aside. But it wavered and fell. Haggard, troubled, with working face, he stood before her.|$|E
6000|$|Georgina got up, {{walked with}} her majestic step across the room, {{and closed the}} door.

[...] "I am not Georgina Gressie! I am Georgina Benyon,--and it has become plain, within a short time, that the natural consequence will take place." ...|$|R
50|$|It's {{revealed}} in the New 52 run of the DCU that the Pre-Crisis event with Wonder Woman that <b>her</b> bracelets held <b>back</b> <b>her</b> strength <b>against</b> a goddess. She uses this ability during other battles, such as a feralized Superman.|$|R
60|$|Prince {{required}} but slight attention, lacking {{energy for}} superfluous movements of any sort. With {{no longer a}} companion to distract her, Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> leaning <b>against</b> the hives. The mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul, conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in time.|$|R
