40|$|At the end {{of every}} European Union {{accession}} negotiation, there is a fight about finance. Yet finance {{is by no means the}} most important element of the negotiations. Matters affecting the vital interests of new and old members like the free movement of labour or the representation of the new member state in the institutions of the Union are usually far more important in the longer term. But it is easier for politicians to talk to voters about money than about policy. The budgetary negotiations in this first enlargement to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe were perhaps more important in that these are relatively poor countries compared to the Union average per capita gross domestic product. They all will have to invest heavily in transport and environmental infrastructure in the coming decades in order to catch up with the standards of the EU- 15 and support higher economic growth and development. Assuming responsible macro-economic policy in the new member states, EU budgetary transfers can speed up this investment process considerably, allowing these countries to catch up with the old member states in terms of per capita income more quickly. Higher transfers to the new member states means of course larger net budgetary contributions for the old member states (EU- 15). This comes at a time when budget deficits are high and rising throughout the EURO-zone and when member states are making politically controversial cuts in social spending. The fiscal discipline involved in membership of the monetary union and implementation of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines therefore means that the existing member states of the Union are not keen to see their net budgetary position with Brussels deteriorate or even their <b>gross</b> <b>contributions</b> to the budget rise.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the fiscal impact attributed to recent policy changes that limited funding to public fertility clinics in Denmark. Taking into consideration that introducing patient co-payments will influence {{the numbers of}} couples treated, {{the number of children}} born every year from assisted reproductive technology will be affected. To reflect the government perspective, the model assessed the average life course of a cohort of assisted-conception singletons taking into consideration age-specific, per-capita government transfers (e. g. education, health care, family allowances, education, pensions) and lifetime <b>gross</b> tax <b>contributions</b> to derive the discounted net tax contribution from assisted-conception singletons. An investment of euro 11, 078 in a mother aged < 40 to achieve an assisted-conception singleton was valued at euro 154, 100 in cumulative discounted net tax revenue when the child reaches age 50. A {{reduction in the number of}} live births generated additional savings of euro 67 - 112 million due to reduced government transfers by age 25. However, by age 50, because of fewer children born and consequently fewer tax payers, a euro 74 - 123 million loss to government was estimated. The projected discounted net tax revenue attributed to assisted-conception children suggests that publicly funded treatment provides economic benefits to government over the lifetime of the conceived children. In January 2011, the Danish Parliament introduced a law that limited reimbursement to publicly funded fertility clinics in Denmark. Because reimbursement for fertility services can influence couples' ability to receive treatment, this will consequently result in fewer children being born each year. To inform the policy decision, this study assessed the fiscal consequences of the policy change on the government over many generations. The analytical framework discussed here estimates the net tax revenue of a cohort of assisted-conception children and the discounted net tax revenue that these children pay to the Danish government over their lifetime. The analysis illustrates that the government will save more costs than those directly related to public fertility services because fewer children are likely to be born and consequently to require government services (e. g. education, health care, family allowances). However, over time as the assisted-conception cohort matures and enters the work force. the reduced number of assisted-conception children, attributed to the funding cuts, will negatively impact government accounts due to lost tax revenue.
