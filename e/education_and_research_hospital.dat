40|$|Objective: Recent {{insights}} {{that have emerged}} in local meetings with participation of pathology residents are promising as regards achieving progress in pathology residency training. Accordingly, in this study, overall pathology residency training in Turkey is discussed in detail from the pathology residents' point of view; current data and suggestions for the solutions of problems are presented. Material and Method: Two questionnaires were applied to resident representatives and overall residents, respectively, from 23 institutions including 12 Universities and 11 Ministry of Health <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Hospitals.</b> Results: The total number of participating residents was 138; 74 from University hospitals <b>and</b> 64 from <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Hospitals.</b> An adequate number of cases per resident, widespread use of multiocular microscopes, increasing number of macroscopy technicians, ongoing educational meetings and renewal projects of the physical environment were the positive findings. However, the lack of autopsy practice, insufficient number of lectures, communication problems between resident and senior staff due to inadequate feedback mechanism, insufficient numbers of academic staff in <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>research</b> <b>hospitals</b> <b>and</b> lack of educational material in some basic branches of surgical pathology were negative findings. During pathology training, the major stress factor was the pathology workload inhibiting optimal learning. Feedback provision and scheduled working habits were the two qualities, which were needed to be improved by senior staff. Two fields, suggested by the senior residents to be incompetent were intraoperative consultation and cytopathology. When overall satisfaction for pathology residency training was considered, it was near 80 % in Universities, while it remained around 40 % in <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Hospitals</b> (p= 0. 000).

Rheumatic mitral stenosis (RMS) is the most long-term sequel in RHD. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a novel marker, and a higher NLR {{has been associated with}} poor clinical outcomes in various cardiovascular disorders. We evaluated the availability of NLR to predict severity of mitral stenosis (MS) in patients with RHD. Methods: We analyzed 300 consecutive patients with RMS. The patients were divided into tertiles according to NLR: 0. 85 < NLR ≤ 1. 85 (n= 100, tertile 1), 1. 86 ≤ NLR ≤ 2. 46 (n= 100, tertile 2), and 2. 47 ≤ NLR ≤ 7. 08 (n= 100, tertile 3). Patients with RMS were divided into three groups based on the degree of MS as mild, moderate, and severe MS. After the initial evaluation, 187 patients with moderate-to-severe RMS (Group 1) and 113 patients with mild RMS (Group 2) were reassessed. Results: The patients with severe RMS had significantly elevated NLR, mean platelet volume, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure values compared to patients with moderate and mild MS (P< 0. 001, P< 0. 001, P< 0. 001 respectively). Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that high levels of NLR was an independent predictor of severe RMS (odds ratio = 0. 68, P= 0. 008). Moderate-to-severe RMS incidence was significantly higher among patients in the tertile 3 (odds ratio = 2. 8, P= 0. 001). Conclusion: NLR is a new inflammatory marker and a simple, rapid, and easily accessible prognostic parameter that can be associated with severity of RMS in patients with RHD.

Methods: The study population consisted of 61 healthy control subjects and 64 volunteer patients monitored in the outpatient clinics of psychiatry of Antalya <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Hospital.</b> Hemograms were determined by using a fully automated hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter LH 780). Serum TOS, TAS, paraoxonase, and T. thl were measured using a novel automated colorimetric measurement method developed by Erel. Sociodemographic data forms were completed by the participants. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to assess the patients. Results: Neutrophils, NLR, TAS, and TOS significantly increased, whereas lymphocytes, T. thl, and T. thl/OSI ratio were significantly lower in the schizophrenia patient group compared to the control group. A statistically significant positive relationship was found between PANSS positive subscale with leukocytes and significantly negative relationships were found between PANSS positive subscale with lymphocytes and T. thl/OSI ratio. Significant positive relationships were found between PANSS total subscale with leukocytes and NLR. Statistically significant negative relationships were found between PANSS total subscale with lympho­cytes and T. thl/OSI ratio. In the group of patients with schizophrenia, a significant negative correlation was found between NLR with T. thl/OSI. In the group of patients with schizophrenia, a significant positive correlation was found between NLR with TOS and OSI. Conclusion: By measuring NLR, which is simple, inexpensive, and suitable for routine use, we can obtain information about oxidative stress and psychopathological symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

Usage of antibiotics for either treatment or prophylaxis was appropriate in 69 patients (45. 7 %), whereas it was inappropriate in the remaining 84 patients (54. 3 %). Inappropriate use of antibiotics was more common in surgical clinics (62. 7 %) when compared with medical clinics (24. 1 %) (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: Inappropriate usage of antibiotics was detected particularly in surgical clinics in our hospital. A strict surveillance of surgical patients and preparation of a local surgical prophylaxis guideline could help to improve the appropriate use of antibiotic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Context: Family {{practice}} training {{takes place}} at primary care based training centers linked to <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> State <b>Hospitals</b> in Turkey. There is a discussion if these units are adequate to train primary care staff and if the patients of these units reflect the applicants of primary care. Aims: The aim of our study is to investigate the demographic characteristics, the effect of distance on primary care utilization, and most common diagnosis of the patients who applied to two different outpatient clinics: One urban and one rural. Settings and Design: Study was conducted from the electronic health records of the patients applied to outpatient clinics of Ankara Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Hospital</b> Department of Family Medicine between 1 January and 31 December 2009. Results: Total number of patients applied to both of the outpatient clinics was 34, 632 [urban clinic: 16. 506 (47. 7 %), rural clinic: 18. 126 (52. 3 %) ]. Leading three diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), general medical examination (GME), and hypertension (HT) in the most common 10 diagnosis. Conclusion: In our study, the rural outpatient clinic {{is regarded as a}} primary care unit in the neighborhood of living area and the urban clinic as close to working environment. We found statistically meaningful differences in most common diagnosis, gender, age, and consultation time between the rural and urban clinics. According to our results, family practitioners′ field training should take place at different primary care units according to sociodemographic characteristics of each country...|$|R

Despite the initial discovery linking TIM-containing molecules and the airway hyperreactivity regulatory locus in mice, there is a paucity of studies on the function of TIM-containing molecules in lung inflammatory disease. Initially, studies were limited to mice models of asthma. More recently however, TIM-containing molecules have been implicated in an ever-expanding list of airway conditions that includes pneumonia, tuberculosis, influenza, sarcoidosis, lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis. This present review discusses the role of TIM-containing molecules and their ligands in the lung, {{as well as their}} potential as therapeutic targets in airway disease.

40|$|The {{history of}} Japanese {{hospitals}} {{is seen to}} have begun on the 8 th century, and Japan’s first modern hospital— which continues to this day—was built in Nagasaki in 1860 by a Dutch naval surgeon, Pompe van Meerdervoort, as a clinical training hospital. However, {{at the beginning of}} the 18 th century, there was a Yojosho (medical care facility) built in the nation’s capital, Edo, to provide medical care for the poor. This facility was built as the result of one citizen’s recommendation to the Bakufu feudal government. In Japan, with the exception of examples from ancient times when Buddhism was introduced, in the past hospitals were not built for religious reasons. In the second half of the 19 th century, the number of hospitals in Japan being used as training grounds for Western medical education gradually grew due to the national government’s decision to control the practice of Chinese herbal medicine and focus instead on Western medicine. Initially the people admitted to these hospitals were wealthy townspeople, but as medical education became more organized, charity patients were also admitted and used for medical <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>research.</b> Other <b>hospitals</b> included civic hospitals, which were established in 1868. These hospitals received funding from the Emperor to provide treatment for the poor. In addition, isolation hospitals were established in response to the cholera outbreak that began in 1858. Syphilis hospitals, which conducted syphilis examinations for pros-titutes and admitted those who were infected, began to increase in number from the second half of the 1800 s. One characteristic of Japanese hospitals is that there are many private hospitals. Indicators of this trend can be observed in the 1870 s...|$|R
