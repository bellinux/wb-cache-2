5|$|Rounding a corner, {{they see}} a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits {{on top of the}} basket for five hours, {{trapping}} the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse,</b> then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse.</b>|$|E

50|$|After the {{pumping station}} at the shore was {{finished}} in 1838 Persius designed and built up-to-date greenhouses and an orangery <b>in</b> 1839. <b>The</b> buildings were erected {{to the west of}} the coach house at the edge of the pleasure ground where three little <b>greenhouses</b> stood previously. <b>The</b> arcade of the orangery referred to the adjacent coach house. <b>The</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> flanked by little water towers, were aligned to the south at the southern gable end of the orangery.

25|$|The {{geological}} record {{appears to}} show that ice ages start when the continents are in positions which block or reduce the flow of warm water from the equator to the poles and thus allow ice sheets to form. The ice sheets increase Earth's reflectivity and thus reduce the absorption of solar radiation. With less radiation absorbed the atmosphere cools; the cooling allows the ice sheets to grow, which further increases reflectivity in a positive feedback loop. The ice age continues until the reduction in weathering causes an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|The first {{successful}} man-made fusion device was the boosted fission weapon tested in 1951 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> Item test. This {{was followed by}} true fusion weapons in 1952's Ivy Mike, and the first practical examples in 1954's Castle Bravo. This was uncontrolled fusion. In these devices, the energy released by the fission explosion is used to compress and heat fusion fuel, starting a fusion reaction. Fusion releases neutrons. These neutrons hit the surrounding fission fuel, causing the atoms to split apart much faster than normal fission processes—almost instantly by comparison. This increases the effectiveness of bombs: normal fission weapons blow themselves apart before all their fuel is used; fusion/fission weapons do not have this practical upper limit.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough {{points out}} that because of natural forces, the Earth's {{temperature}} has been fluctuating for millions of years, long before humans arrived. However, it is the additional carbon dioxide, leading to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect, which {{must also be taken}} into account. When fossil fuels are burnt, such as coal, fuel oil or natural gas, the carbon emissions combine with oxygen to further thicken the Earth's atmospheric 'blanket' and thus warm the planet. An analysis of ice cores can provide information from thousands of years ago. Comparisons of carbon dioxide levels show that those of today are far beyond anything seen in the past. The scientists interviewed are convinced that humans are responsible.|$|E

He affirmed that Leptotes was similar to Tetramicra, from which it is distinguished by the structures of the pollinarium and by the smaller lateral lobes of the lip petal; and because they have no calcar attached to the ovarium. He also differentiated it from [...] Brassavola by the pollinia and trilobed lip.
