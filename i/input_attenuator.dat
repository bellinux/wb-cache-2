3000|$|WPT-Pre (AC) {{covers the}} {{frequency}} range from 10  Hz to 10  MHz. Its input is isolated from WPT-Pre (DC) by a 220 -pF capacitance and decouples the spacecraft potential with few V to few 10  s V and the spin modulation of the DC electric field with few mV/m to few 100  s mV/m (Arase’s spin rate: ~  1 / 8  Hz). The gain of WPT-Pre (AC) is set to ~  6  dB (high-gain mode) and compensates {{for the loss}} at the connection of WPT-S and WPT-Pre (AC). The capability to measure large whistler waves with intensities {{of more than a}} few tens of mV/m is provided by an <b>input</b> <b>attenuator</b> and a capacitance of 750  pF (low-gain mode). The attenuation level is decided in relation to the antenna impedance and this 750 -pF capacitance. If we assume the typical antenna impedance in vacuum, the expected attenuation level is ~ −  20  dB. Actually, the antenna impedance depends on the local plasma density and its temperature. The antenna impedance can be evaluated using the onboard antenna impedance measurement system, conducted by changing the calibration resistances (1 kΩ, 100 kΩ, 1 MΩ, and 10 MΩ) with the calibration signal from the EWO source clock (Kasahara et al. 2017; Matsuda et al. 2017). Since the low-gain mode can also affect the input impedance of WPT-Pre (DC), the gain and phase curve of WPT-Pre (DC) and EFD are also affected; this is shown in [...] "Electric Field Detector (EFD) in EWO (EFD-WFC-OFA)" [...] in section. (We have not yet used the low-gain mode as of August 2017). The output signal of WPT-Pre (AC) is fed to EWO-WFC/OFA (E), and HFA receives the signal through WFC/OFA (E).|$|E
40|$|Future radio {{platforms}} {{have to be}} {{inexpensive and}} deal {{with a variety of}} co- existence issues. The technology trend during the last few years is towards system- on-chip (SoC) that is able to process multiple standards re-using most of the digital resources. A major bottle-neck to this approach is the co-existence of these standards operating at different frequency bands that are hitting the receiver front-end. So the current research is focused on the power, area and performance optimization of various circuit building blocks of a radio for current and incoming standards. Firstly, a linearization technique for low noise amplifiers (LNAs) called, Robust Derivative Superposition (RDS) method is proposed. RDS technique is insensitive to Process Voltage and Temperature (P. V. T.) variations and is validated with two low noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) designs in 0. 18 ?m CMOS technology. Measurement results from 5 dies of a resistive terminated LNTA shows that the pro- posed method improves IM 3 over 20 dB for input power up to - 18 dBm, and improves IIP_(3) by 10 dB. A 2 V inductor-less broadband 0. 3 to 2. 8 GHz balun-LNTA employing the proposed RDS linearization technique was designed and measured. It achieves noise figure of 6. 5 dB, IIP 3 of 16. 8 dBm, and P 1 dB of 0. 5 dBm having a power consumption of 14. 2 mW. The balun LNTA occupies an active area of 0. 06 mm 2. Secondly, the design of two high linearity, inductor-less, broadband LNTAs employing noise and distortion cancellation techniques is presented. Main design issues and the performance trade-offs of the circuits are discussed. In the fully differential architecture, the first LNTA covers 0. 1 - 2 GHz bandwidth and achieves a minimum noise figure (NFmin) of 3 dB, IIP_(3) of 10 dBm and a P_(1 dB) of 0 dBm while dissipating 30. 2 mW. The 2 ^(nd) low power bulk driven LNTA with 16 mW power consumption achieves NFmin of 3. 4 dB, IIP 3 of 11 dBm and 0. 1 - 3 GHz bandwidth. Each LNTA occupy an active area of 0. 06 mm 2 in 45 nm CMOS. Thirdly, a continuous-time low-pass ??ADC equipped with design techniques to provide robustness against loop saturation due to blockers is presented. Loop over- load detection and correction is employed to improve the ADC?s tolerance to blockers; a fast overload detector activates the <b>input</b> <b>attenuator,</b> maintaining the ADC in linear operation. To further improve ADC?s blocker tolerance, a minimally-invasive integrated low-pass filter that reduces the most critical adjacent/alternate channel blockers is implemented. An ADC prototype is implemented in a 90 nm CMOS technology and experimentally it achieves 69 dB dynamic range over a 20 MHz bandwidth with a sampling frequency of 500 MHz and 17. 1 mW of power consumption. The alternate channel blocker tolerance at the most critical frequency is as high as - 5. 5 dBFS while the conventional feed-forward modulator becomes unstable at - 23. 5 dBFS of blocker power. The proposed blocker rejection techniques are minimally-invasive and take less than 0. 3 ?sec to settle after a strong agile blocker appears. Finally, a new radio partitioning methodology that gives robust analog and mixed signal radio development in scaled technology for SoC integration, and the co-design of RF FEM-antenna system is presented. Based on the proposed methodology, a CMOS RF front-end module (FEM) with power amplifier (PA), LNA and transmit/receive switch, co-designed with antenna is implemented. The RF FEM circuit is implemented in a 32 nm CMOS technology. Post extracted simulations show a noise figure < 2. 5 dB, S_(21) of 14 dB, IIP 3 of 7 dBm and P 1 dB of - 8 dBm for the receiver. Total power consumption of the receiver is 11. 8 mW from a 1 V supply. On the trans- mitter side, PA achieves peak RF output power of 22. 34 dBm with peak power added efficiency (PAE) of 65 % and PAE of 33 % with linearization at - 6 dB power back off. Simulations show an efficiency of 80 % for the miniaturized dipole antenna...|$|E

The spin-wave waveform was detected with an asymmetric coplanar strip transmission line, as an induced voltage flowing into a fast oscilloscope. We report that the amplitude of a spin-wave packet was systematically changed by controlling the thickness of a platinum layer, up to a maximum change of 50 %. The virtues of spin wave, ultrafast propagation velocity and non-reciprocal emission, are preserved in this manner.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the design and implementation of an X-band receiver {{for use in the}} South African Synthetic Aperture Radar (SASAR II) project. The SAR will be used to demonstrate the capability of building a high resolution X-hand imaging radar in South Africa. The design starts by investigating the maximum power return from different targets over a swath width with changing incidence angles. A receiver-power-level table and diagram were constructed, with the power return from at trihedral corner reﬂector as maximum input power and thermal noise as the minimum input power to the receiver. The output of the receiver, which has to be fed to the input of an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), is limited by the ADC's maximum operating <b>input</b> power. Amplifiers, <b>attenuators</b> and mixers were chosen to implement a dual-stage downconversion from a radio frequency (RF) of 9300 MHZ to a 2 nd IF of 1300 MHZ and then to a 1 st IF of 158 MHz. A sensitivity time control (STC) is implemented in the receiver to cater for the limited dynamic range of the ADC. The power return varies with range and hence, time. Thus, an STC will correct for low return power, at far range, by boosting the received signal and attenuating large return power, at close range, ideally providing a fairly constant power return at the receiver output. A manual gain control (MGC) is also needed in the receiver, such that none of the components are driven into saturation. The gain control is switched on when large targets are expected to fall in the swath width, otherwise it is switched to a minimum for targets with tow backscattered power. The tests that were carried out on the receiver components showed that all the components operated very close to their specifications. The cascaded filters work well in tailoring the front-end 3 -dB bandwidth to close to the required 3 -dB bandwidth. The receiver was designed to have enough gain to boost the maximum power received to within the operating range of the ADC, without saturating any components in the receiver. The noise figure test showed a noise figure of 4. 20 dB. This is 1. 73 dB higher than the calculated noise figure of 2. 47 dB which is a result of an underestimation of the losses in the system...|$|R
