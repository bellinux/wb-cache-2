Over three days, the precipitation reached [...] of rainfall over three days, including [...] in one day. This accounted for about one-third of Pohnpei's record monthly rainfall total of [...] for May 2015. The high winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which fell onto cars and homes, and killed one person. One family in Palikir needed medical attention when a tree fell onto their house. Residents lost power and water access {{for up to two}} weeks. Many houses had damage to roofs, and about 200homes on Pohnpei were damaged or destroyed. Crops also sustained damage from high waves causing salt intrusion, affecting taro patches. Damage in the FSM was estimated at $1million. In response to the damage, the FSM government declared Pohnpei as a state of emergency on June8. The typhoon's westerly winds produced a swell that affected the Marshall Islands, sinking several boats in Kwajalein Atoll.|$|E
500|$|Early in its development, Maysak brushed <b>Kosrae</b> {{within the}} FSM. Persistent {{westerly}} winds knocked {{down a few}} trees and damaged a few houses while also causing beach erosion. The storm later struck Chuuk State on March29, passing directly over the main island as a Category1-equivalent typhoon, with gusts as high as 175km/h (110mph). Rainfall on Weno Island reached [...] High sustained winds, measured up to [...] at the local National Weather Service office, downed numerous trees, power lines, and tore off roofs. An estimated 80–90percent of homes in Chuuk sustained damage. The storm destroyed at least 830homes and 37businesses, displacing 6,760people. Power {{to most of the}} state, including the entirety of Weno, was knocked out and communication was difficult. On Weno alone, the storm left about 7,000people homeless. Water sources were rendered undrinkable. Outlying islands sustained heavy damage to crops and houses. Across Chuuk State, rough waves from the typhoon damaged seawalls and sank or damaged 11boats or ships. There were at least four deaths in the state. A fallen tree killed a man and a child died after being struck by airborne debris. One person died due to a mudslide, and a newborn child died after being unable to arrive at the hospital due to fallen trees.|$|E
500|$|After its formation, the {{depression}} moved slowly with the low-level flow, {{in what the}} JTWC described as an [...] "atypical eastward direction". Wind shear in the region exposed the convection from the circulation early on May7, although the thunderstorms increased the next day, mostly in the storm's northwest quadrant. A building subtropical ridge turned the system more to the north. By May8, {{the depression}} organized enough for the JTWC to upgrade it to a tropical storm. At 12:00UTC on the next day, the JMA followed suit and upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Dolphin. By that time, the system had developed rainbands spiraling around the circulation, although continued wind shear left the center exposed. Around that time, Dolphin passed about 80km (50mi) west of <b>Kosrae</b> in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), {{and over the next}} few days it passed near other small islands in the region. Despite the sheared structure, the storm developed an eye feature on May11, indicative of further strengthening, while the storm was passing 285km (180mi) east of Pohnpei. That day, the shear began to decrease, allowing the outflow to improve and convection to blossom. Early on May12, the JMA upgraded Dolphin to a severe tropical storm, estimating 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph).|$|E

German ornithologist Otto Finsch failed to find this bird on his expedition in 1880 and also the Whitney South Seas Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History in 1931 remained unsuccessful on a survey after that species.
