50|$|In metalworking, a <b>drift</b> <b>pin,</b> <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> punch, slave pin, simply drift, or even pokey bit is {{the name}} for a tool used for {{enlarging}} holes, or aligning holes prior to bolting or riveting metal parts together. A <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> is not used as a punch {{in the traditional sense}} of the term. A drift is constructed as a tapered rod, with the hammer acting on the large end of the taper. The tapered end of a drift punch is placed into the semi-aligned bolt holes of two separate components, and then driven into the hole. As it is driven in, the taper forces the two components into alignment, allowing for easy insertion of the fastener. Unlike most punches, force should never be applied to the tip of <b>drift</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E

[...] The next generation of the Silver Crush Grippers, released in 1993, marked the next major step in gripper evolution; their stainless-steel handles replaced the previous chrome-plated mild steel handles, and a new assembly technique eliminated the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> central {{to the design of}} the older grippers. IronMind briefly offered a model with a right-hand wind spring, although that design was soon shelved in order to concentrate on the more popular left-hand wind spring. The new design also featured a clear band at the midpoint of each handle, an element of trade dress for IronMind’s grippers ever since.|$|E

2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull <b>pins,</b> <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. <b>Drift</b> <b>pins</b> have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the splitting strength. In this research, splitting tests on Japanese cedar and Douglas fir were conducted to clarify splitting strength. A monotonic tensile force was applied to a drift-pinned joint with steel side plates and splitting failure originated from the pin hole. In order to evaluate the splitting strength, specimens with various parameters, i.e., diameter of <b>drift</b> <b>pin,</b> end margin, edge margin and thickness were used. All parameters affected the splitting strength, but particularly, end margin and thickness also affected the failure mode. As the end margin lengthened, the failure mode was transferred from shear to splitting. On the other hand, as thickness increased, the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> bent more at splitting. This bending of the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> caused a lag of bearing stress to timber, and the failure mode was transferred from full width splitting to partial width splitting. The splitting strength under various conditions could be evaluated by consideration of the difference in failure modes.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the strength of timber under such loading. For splitting of drift-pinned joints with steel side plates loaded parallel to grain, an evaluation method was proposed by considering that splitting occurs when maximum bearing stress by <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> to timber reaches its bearing strength. Based on this view, values of splitting strength estimated by calculation and analysis were compared with experimental values reported in the previous article. Taking the ends of the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> as free ends, the calculated values agreed well with experimental values of specimens with thickness of less than 60  mm. On the other hand, taking the ends of the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> as fixed ends, the calculated values agreed well with the experimental values of specimens with thickness of more than 90  mm. According to the method proposed in this research, increasing specimen thickness leads to greater differences between specimens with free and fixed ends. It is clear that restricting joint rotation has a large effect. Analytical and experimental values in any specimen are well matched because the restriction of rotation is set properly based on the results of the tests.|$|E

30|$|Bond {{quality and}} joint {{performance}} between {{laminated veneer lumber}} (LVL) and metal plates were investigated. Commercially fabricated LVL made of Douglas fir veneer and bonded with phenol-formaldehyde resin as well as three types of epoxy adhesives were used. Various surface preparations and treatments were applied to ordinary steel, stainless steel, and aluminum plates to remove the weak boundary layer that is incompatible with the resin and form a stable adherend layer that is chemically and mechanically compatible with the resin. Small specimens were tested in shear to search the most suitable metal surface for bonding with LVL. Generally, shear strength obtained for the specimens bonded with aluminum plates was lower than those bonded with ordinary steel plates. Among them chemically treated (ChT) and roughened (R) surfaces have demonstrated superior performance. To investigate strength performance and bond quality, LVL beams jointed with metal plates were tested while bending. The best results were obtained for specimens bonded with zinccoated metal plates, though good results were obtained also for ChT and R plates. However, the fracture proved to be fragile when no <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> were used, even for high-performance surface treatments. The usage of <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> was necessary to add toughness and avoid the brittle status of the fracture.|$|R

30|$|Different {{bearing strain}} {{distributions}} and failure behaviors of differently oriented bearing specimens were observed using DIC. The RL specimen with a 12  mm <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> {{was found to}} have highest bearing strength of 22.57  MPa, whereas the LR specimen had the lowest bearing strength of 6.47  MPa. Although different bearing strength and mixed failure behaviors from the differently oriented bearing specimens were found, {{based on the results of}} load–displacement curves, statistical analysis, and failure behaviors, the design bearing strength values and failure behaviors could largely be divided into three groups as RL and TL, RT and TR, and LT and LR. The strain distributions at the bearing area from DIC showed that the lower strain values from RL and TL were found compared to the LR and LT. It can be speculated that different load-slip modulus was related with the orientation of the specimens. The results indicated that the bearing strength from the three groups should be established for the reliable <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> connection design using glulam with drift pins.|$|E

30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze the bearing {{properties}} of the differently oriented glulam using digital image correlation (DIC). Six differently oriented specimens associated with three anatomical directions including longitudinal (L), radial (R), and tangential (T), and 12 -mm <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> were used to analyze the bearing properties, including yield load and bearing strength. The highest bearing strength of 22.57  MPa from RL was found, whereas the lowest bearing strength of 6.47  MPa from LR was found. Different strain distributions were observed from the differently oriented bearing specimens using DIC. Different failure ratios of the differently oriented specimens were highly related to the strain distributions. Although the bearing properties were found to be different between the differently oriented specimens, for the connection design aspect, the bearing properties of glulam could be grouped as RL and TL specimens, RT and TR specimens, and LR and LT specimens.|$|R

The first and second order resonance frequencies of the floor were 13.5 [*]Hz and 27.0 [*]Hz, respectively.

The maximum static load of the floor was 127 [*]kN. The apparent flexural rigidity was less than half the value of several floors studied in the past. However, it is considered that the stiffness is improved by constructing panels and this floor has almost equivalent performance. Relative deflection was not affected by the loading history.|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to devise a method to determine the residual strength of used creosote treated timber railroad bridge piles of various dimensions that have been subjected to varying degrees of environmental and mechanical deterioration. A total of 37 timber piles from three different locations were used for experimentation. Upon receipt, the piles were assigned an identification number and then stripped of any extraneous material such as wood blocks, <b>drift</b> <b>pins,</b> metal strapping, erection spikes, and metal bolts. The piles were then inspected for any form of pretest damage including, but not limited to, longitudinal cracking, fire damage, rot, decay, adequacy of creosote penetration, and general fitness of the wood. The piles were tested in uniaxial compression parallel to the grain in a custom built frame with a capacity of 1. 8 million pounds. Data taken from the testing included the applied load and three separate measurements of axial deformation. Testing for each specimen was terminated when any of the following occurred: longitudinal splitting {{along the length of the}} specimen, longitudinal splitting along the length of the specimen through bolt holes, localized barreling of the cross-section, lateral buckling, mushrooming of the butt or tip end, and/or manual termination due to failure to sustain load. A correlation was discovered between a two part pile strength parameter, [], and the ultimate test load, P[max]. The pile strength parameter consists of the axial stiffness as determined from a plot of load vs. deflection for each pile and a slenderness parameter obtainable from simple measurements as the square of the pile tip diameter divided by length. A least squares linear regression analysis was performed on a plot of the ultimate load from each test, P[max], vs. the pile strength parameter, [], for each test. Uniaxial compression tests of small clearwood samples of different species were similarly tested to determine potential limits of the pile strength parameter approach. This method of determining residual pile capacity is simple in concept and can be used in the field to determine remaining axial strength of in-service piles...|$|R

In the first part I present some of the systems of interest, in particular spin-glasses, supercooled liquids and glasses, <b>drift,</b> creep and <b>pinning</b> of a particle in a random potential, neural networks, graph partitioning {{as an example of}} combinatorial optimisation, the K-sat problem and the minority game {{as a model for the}} behaviour of agents on markets. The second part deals with the dynamics of the spherical p-spin-glass with long ranged interactions. This model is a prototype for glassy dynamics. The equations of motion for correlation- and response-functions are derived and solutions above and below the freezing temperature are investigated. At the end I discuss the so called crossover region and aging in glasses. The commonly used mode coupling theory results in equations of motion identical to those of the $p$-spin model above the dynamical transition temperature. The p-spin model is extended introducing the random interactions as slow dynamical variables as well. This takes changes in the configuration of cages into account. This is an activated process. Depending on the waiting time, equilibrium or aging is found. Comment: 36 pages, 19 figures.

MIS devices were fabricated in order to assess the differences between an industrial silicon nitride direct Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (DPECVD) method and a low damage Remote PECVD deposition. The semiconductor-insulator interface was investigated using Capacitance/Conductance Voltage (CGV) measurements. Admittance Spectroscopy (AS), Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Optoelectronic Modulation Spectroscopy (OEMS). Through the combination of AS and OEMS measurements the applied voltage at which the devices achieved inversion was accurately obtained. The DLTS measurements were energy resolved and interface states were observed in both DPECVD and RPECVD devices in {{the lower half of the}} bandgap. The surfaces of the DPECVD devices were in majority accumulation at zero bias and the interface states communicated directly with the conduction band in reverse bias. On the other hand RPECVD devices were almost at flatband at zero bias and demonstrated greater Fermi level movement over the same voltage range. Investigation of the interface states indicated a higher density of states and more complicated behaviour including a lattice relaxation mechanism and tunnelling with the interface states communicating principally with the valence band. The two types of deposition gave rise to interfaces that exhibited very different behaviour.

40|$|Constant load creep {{tests in}} {{uniaxial}} unconfined compression {{were performed on}} samples. of sintered snow and bubbly poly crystalline ice. Nominal axial stresses were in the range 0. 1 to 1. 0 kg-wt/cm 2 for snow, and 0. 5 to 20 kg-wt/cm 2 for ice. The range of temperatures investigated was from- 0. 5 to- 34. 5 °C. Assuming creep to follow the Arrhenius relation, values of apparent activation energy for secondary creep under a nominal axial stress of 0. 5 kg-wt/cm 2 varied from 10. 7 kcal/mole for ice of density 0. 83 g/cm 3 to 17. 8 kcal/mole for snow of density 0. 44 g/cm 3. The dependence of strain rate; § on stress (J for poly crystalline ice subjected to stresses in the range 0. 5 to 20 kg-wt/cm 2 at temperatures of- 4 and-lOoC could best be described by a relation of the form where C 1 and C 2 are constants for a given ice type. The behaviour of sintered snow is probably similar, although the tests {{did not go to}} sufficiently low stresses to confirm this supposition. It is suggested that the creep of poly crystalline ice depends on at least two distinct mechanisms in the stress range studied. Possibilities include dislocation damping for the process dominant at high stress, and <b>drift</b> of dislocations <b>pinned</b> by stress-induced order for the low stress mechanism. If each mechanism has its own characteristic activation energy, the apparent activation energy mea-sured in creep experiments may well vary with stress level. In snow subjected to a given nominal stress, such an effect should be reflected in variation of apparent activation energy with bulk density, since true stress in the ice matrix will increase as density decreases when the nominal applied stress is fixed. The effect of bulk density on strain rate and the possibility of predicting creep rates for snow from data on creep of poly crystalline ice are discussed. I...|$|R
40|$|Power {{electronic}} devices {{are the most}} important element in any power electronic system. In the last decade, silicon carbide-based devices have emerged as an alternative to silicon-based devices promising a new era in power conversion. The focus of many studies has been on improving material technologies to reduce production cost and defect density. This development has produced devices with superior characteristics. However, the unique properties of silicon carbide favour the development of relatively new power devices, such as the enhanced-mode junction field-effect transistor, in order to exploit the full potential of the material. Following the introduction of such devices, power electronics engineers face new challenges. In this thesis, the characteristics of SiC power devices, including the PiN diode, the Schottky diode and the JFET, are investigated. Simplified behavioural models for these SiC devices are established and implemented in commercial circuit simulators. The work focuses on the SiC enhancement-mode power VJFET as it is a potential candidate to replace Si MOSFETs and IGBTs especially for medium voltage applications. Breakdown voltage and drift region design of the SiC PiN diode are studied. Due to the conductivity modulation in the <b>drift</b> region, the <b>PiN</b> diode achieves low on-resistance. At the same time, the high critical electric field of SiC allows high breakdown voltage. However, a saturation voltage of approximately 3 V appears during the forward condition mode {{as a result of the}} wide bandgap of SiC. The high forward voltage leads to more conduction loss making this type of diodes only attractive for high voltage applications where the voltage drop over a Schottky diode with same breakdown voltage becomes prohibitively high. The characteristic and the modelling of both PiN and Schottky diodes are discussed in this thesis. Suggested models are implemented in commercial circuit simulators and feature a satisfactory accuracy over a wide temperature range. By studying the SiC VJFET structure, the physics of the device and gate drive requirements are investigated. Several driving technologies are tested. However, for an effective driving, employing a two-stage driver is recommended. With this driver, high switching speeds are achievable with minimal switching energy loss. Using the SiC JFET, a high efficiency energy conversion, that combines low switching losses with low conduction loss, is possible. Finally, a model for SiC VJFET is established and implemented on LTSpice. Model parameters are determined by measurements and datasheet values. There is a good agreement between simulation results using this model and measured static and dynamic characteristics of the SiC VJFET. PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|R
