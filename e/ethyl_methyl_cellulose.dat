40|$|The {{chiral nematic}} texture {{of a number}} of {{anisotropic}} cellulosic systems is revealed with the help of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). TEM and AFM examination of sections of cellulose films, ethyl cellulose (EC) films, <b>ethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (EMC) films, cellulose acetate (CA) films and (6 -O-trityl 2, 3 -O-hexyl) cellulose (C(Tr) (He)) 1 films showed periodicities which are characteristic of chiral nematic arrangements. Those periodicities are related to the helicoidal pitch of such organisations. Furthermore, specific structural defects were observed in sections of the chiral nematic films. These defects are associated with a parabolic focal conic texture. Chiral nematic gels were produced by $ gamma$-ray irradiation of (hydroxypropyl) cellulose (HPC) mesophases in water or methanol. Solid/liquid extraction performed on irradiated HPC films and mesophases allow us to evaluate their respective degrees of crosslinking. Optical microscopy, TEM and AFM results showed that a chiral nematic order is preserved in the crosslinked mesophases. Helicoidal suspensions of cellulosic microfibrils were prepared by acidic hydrolysis of wood pulp. Solid films, dried from these microfibril suspensions, show that the chiral nematic arrangement of the cellulosic microfibrils can be maintained in a solid material. Basic morphological data on chiral nematic films made from cellulosic microfibrils are given in this thesis. The origin of the strong contrast observed in TEM images of sections of chiral nematic cellulosic materials is discussed. We also introduce novel sample preparation techniques for microscopic observation...|$|E

40|$|Summary. At {{present the}} {{pharmaceutical}} industry and academia are focusing {{on the use of}} natural materials and resources for development of pharmaceutical product. In previous study, neem gum (NG), obtained from Azadirachata indica plant revealed satisfactory film forming ability. The present study evaluates the application potential of neem gum, as an aqueous film coating material, using ciprofloxacin hydrchloride (drug) as a model drug. Initial study of physical mixture indicated absence of chemical interaction in between drug and NG. Aqueous coating solution of NG was optimized and consisted of neem gum (13. 34 %w/w), triethyl citrate (1. 25 %w/w), talc (0. 25 %w/w) and titanium dioxide (0. 17 %w/w). The coating parameters such as pan revolutions (rpm), inlet air pressure, inlet temperature, and pan load were optimized. The uncoated and coated tablets were evaluated for hardness, disintegration time, dissolution, drug content. The coated tablets were subjected to accelerated stability conditions for 1 month and the results were compared with marketed drug tablet. Any coating defects, except surface roughness, were absent in case of NG coated tablets. NG coated tablets depicted satisfactory mechanical strength. Dissolution study of NG coated tablets depicted 90 % of drug release in 10 minutes and 100 % of drug release at 30 minutes. Accelerated storage conditions didn’t affect the tablet hardness and % drug release. The coating process efficiency, coating uniformity and loss on drying confirmed that the coating solution was optimum and coating parameters were robust. Industrial relevance. A paradigm shift, from organic solvent-based to water-based film coating of pharmaceutical dosage forms, apparent in pharmaceutical industries, is due to Government regulation, high cost of the organic solvents, safety issues {{associated with the use of}} organic solvents. Currently, the commercially available edible coatings utilize synthetic cellulosic polymers namely, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polydextrose. A particular disadvantage of HPMC coating is hardening of the coating over time and thereby prolonged tablet disintegration time. Neem gum is a promising natural, biodegradable, cheap and eco-friendly film former which can be employed for aqueous film coating of tablets, containing bitter taste or moisture sensitive drug. Moreover neem gum is an effective film former in lower concentrations (10 - 15 % w/w) and may be a cost-effective alternative over conventional film formers. Keywords.
