500|$|During Williams and Ledger's time together, {{they lived}} in Brooklyn, New York. By September 2007, the couple {{amicably}} ended their three-year relationship. Of the break-up, People quoted her telling Elle magazine, [...] "I didn't know where to go. I couldn't imagine any {{place in the world}} that was gonna <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] After Ledger's death from a combined drug intoxication (CDI) in January 2008, the usually under-the-radar actress and her daughter became an interest of the media and were often followed by paparazzi. As a result, Williams rarely gave interviews until the end of 2009.|$|E
500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does it make you <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see me cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt the ones I love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, {{she thought it would}} <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she took it out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When she returned to the set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut the back of it and taped it to her foot. Garland was unable to walk for nearly a week after Gunslinger finished shooting, writing that [...] "I had screwed up my ankle so bad!" ...|$|E

500|$|Erotica is {{a concept}} album about sex and romance, on which she {{incorporated}} an alter-ego named Mistress Dita, heavily inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Musically, it is a pop and dance record which incorporates elements from classic disco, modern house, techno and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album played on innuendos and double entendres instead of explicit words. [...] "Erotica" [...] is the opening track from the album. Starting with Madonna saying [...] "My name is Dita", she invites her lover to be passive, while she tells him to [...] "do as I say" [...] and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. It deals with sex hang-ups, and {{has been described as}} [...] "an ode to S". Her cover version of [...] "Fever" [...] follows the title track. It is described as a [...] "sassy, house-style remake" [...] of the pop standard. The third track, [...] "Bye Bye Baby," [...] starts with the declaration, [...] "This is not a love song," [...] and goes on to ask questions of a lover she is about to abandon. At one point, Madonna asks angrily: [...] "Does it make you <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see me cry?" [...] The fourth track from Erotica, [...] "Deeper and Deeper," [...] is described as one of the [...] "pure disco" [...] moments of the album. Its bridge features a flamenco guitar, and its lyrics talk about sexual obsession.|$|E
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} by many critics {{to be a major}} {{step in the right direction}} for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and chock-full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> <b>To</b> get a few of my favorite lines, just keep reading." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hypomania may <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> some {{persons who}} {{experience}} it, though {{most people who}} experience hypomania state that {{the stress of the}} experience is very painful. Bipolar people who experience hypomania, however, tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them. Even when family and friends recognize mood swings, the individual will often deny that anything is wrong. What might be called a [...] "hypomanic event", if not accompanied by depressive episodes, is often not deemed problematic, unless the mood changes are uncontrollable, volatile, or mercurial. Most commonly, symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months.|$|E

2500|$|Another of Lynch's {{prominent}} themes is industry, {{with repeated}} imagery of [...] "the clunk of machinery, {{the power of}} pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories", {{as can be seen}} with the industrial wasteland in Eraserhead, the factories in The Elephant Man, the sawmill in Twin Peaks and the lawn mower in The Straight Story. Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that [...] "It makes me <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek Elley of Variety {{wrote that}} though {{the film was}} [...] "star-heavy", it felt like [...] "the movie {{equivalent}} of an Off Broadway play," [...] and [...] "uses a lot of words to say nothing new." [...] The New York Times also mentioned the amount of dialogue in the film, writing: [...] "It’s a long conversation, more soporific than Socratic, and brimming with parental chiding, generational conflict and invocations of Vietnam," [...] and the Los Angeles Times described the lecturing in the film as [...] "dull and self-satisfied." [...] The subtitle of the review in the Los Angeles Times was: [...] "As a matter of policy, 'Lions for Lambs' doesn't play." [...] In a review entitled [...] "Political drama feels more like a lecture" [...] in The Boston Globe, Wesley Morris wrote: [...] "It does not <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> report that a movie with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise makes the eyelids droop. But that's what 'Lions for Lambs' does." [...] Writing in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, reviewer William Arnold wrote positively of the segments of the film involving Robert Redford's character: [...] "His character, who hopes to save America one slacker at a time, rings true; and his real-life conviction and his fears for democracy come through." [...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle highlighted Redford's direction of the film, commenting {{that it was not}} his best film, but it was [...] "his bravest." [...] Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described Lions for Lambs as [...] "...a well-made movie that offers no answers but raises many important questions." ...|$|E

60|$|From the Marquesas I sailed with {{sufficient}} absinthe in ballast to last me to Tahiti, where I outfitted with Scotch and American whisky, and thereafter {{there were no}} dry stretches between ports. But please do not misunderstand. There was no drunkenness, as drunkenness is ordinarily understood--no staggering and rolling around, no befuddlement of the senses. The skilled and seasoned drinker, with a strong constitution, never descends to anything like that. He drinks to <b>feel</b> <b>good,</b> <b>to</b> get a pleasant jingle, {{and no more than}} that. The things he carefully avoids are the nausea of over-drinking, the after-effect of over-drinking, the helplessness and loss of pride of over-drinking.|$|E

He's a mighty fine fellow, and Fate played a proper trick when she blotted out his unscrupulous mind and left him as innocent as an unborn babe. He will do well in his new life, I'm sure, and that girl of his, Hetty Hewitt--I've know of her reckless ways for years--has also redeemed herself and turned out a regular brick!
