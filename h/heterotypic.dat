500|$|Boletus luridus was {{described}} by German botanist Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774, in his series on fungi of Bavaria and the Palatinate, Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective luridus, ''. French botanist Pierre Bulliard's 1791 Boletus rubeolarius is a <b>heterotypic</b> synonym (based on a different type). The following year, Johann Friedrich Gmelin called it Boletus subvescus, from the Latin words sub [...] "nearly" [...] or [...] "under", and vescus [...] "edible". However, this is a nomen nudum. [...] Several taxonomical synonyms arose when the species was transferred to different genera within the family Boletaceae by different authorities, including Leccinum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, Tubiporus by Petter Karsten in 1881, Dictyopus by Lucien Quélet in 1888, and Suillellus by William Murrill in 1909.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{transcription}} factors do {{not work}} alone. [...] Many large TF families form complex homotypic or <b>heterotypic</b> interactions through dimerization. For gene transcription to occur, a number of transcription factors must bind to DNA regulatory sequences. [...] This collection of transcription factors, in turn, recruit intermediary proteins such as cofactors that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and RNA polymerase. [...] Thus, for a single transcription factor to initiate transcription, all of these other proteins must also be present, and the transcription factor must be {{in a state where}} it can bind to them if necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of vaccination with material from cases of cowpox (<b>heterotypic</b> immunisation), smallpox could be prevented by deliberate inoculation of smallpox virus, later referred to as variolation to distinguish it from smallpox vaccination.The earliest hints of the practice of inoculation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century. The Chinese also practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, dating back to the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of [...] "nasal insufflation" [...] administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heterotypic</b> cortex {{consists}} {{of those areas}} of the mature neocortex that deviate markedly from the homogeneous six-layered internal structure seen in the third trimester of human gestation. A few neocortical areas, such as Brodmann area 17 and the granular insular cortex, undergo modification to more than six layers; {{and in a few}} areas, such as Brodmann area 4, the number of layers is reduced. <b>Heterotypic</b> cortex is contrasted to homotypic cortex, which retains the fetal six-layered pattern into adulthood. The number of <b>heterotypic</b> areas is small and the specific areas differ somewhat by species.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} antigenically {{different}} serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 - DENV-4). Infection with DENV induces {{the production of}} neutralizing homotypic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies which provide lifelong immunity against the infecting serotype. Infection with DENV also produces some degree of cross-protective immunity against the other three serotypes. Neutralizing <b>heterotypic</b> (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists {{for a period of}} several months to a few years. These <b>heterotypic</b> antibody titers decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years). While <b>heterotypic</b> IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived memory B cells producing homotypic antibodies.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to inducing neutralizing <b>heterotypic</b> antibodies, infection with DENV can also induce <b>heterotypic</b> antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially {{or not at}} all. The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a [...] "trojan horse", where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of dendritic cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.|$|E
