25|$|All triangles have an <b>incircle,</b> {{but not all}} {{quadrilateral}}s do. An {{example of}} a quadrilateral that cannot be tangential is a non-square rectangle. The section characterizations below states what necessary and sufficient conditions a quadrilateral must satisfy to have an <b>incircle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the <b>incircle</b> is not in general located on Euler's line.|$|E

25|$|The {{ratio of}} {{the area of the}} <b>incircle</b> to the area of an {{equilateral}} triangle, , is larger than that of any non-equilateral triangle.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, every triangle has {{a unique}} inscribed circle (<b>incircle)</b> that is interior to the triangle and tangent to all three sides.|$|E

50|$|The common nine-point {{circle is}} tangent to all 16 <b>incircles</b> and excircles {{of the four}} triangles whose {{vertices}} form the orthocentric system.|$|R
50|$|In geometry, the Japanese theorem {{states that}} the centers of the <b>incircles</b> of certain triangles inside a cyclic {{quadrilateral}} are vertices of a rectangle.|$|R
25|$|In every {{triangle}} {{a unique}} circle, called the <b>incircle,</b> can be inscribed {{such that it}} is tangent {{to each of the}} three sides of the triangle.|$|E
25|$|The four line {{segments}} between {{the center of}} the <b>incircle</b> and the points where it is tangent to the quadrilateral partition the quadrilateral into four right kites.|$|E
25|$|An angle {{bisector}} of {{a triangle}} is {{a straight line}} through a vertex which cuts the corresponding angle in half. The three angle bisectors intersect in a single point, the incenter, usually denoted by I, {{the center of the}} triangle's <b>incircle.</b> The <b>incircle</b> is the circle which lies inside the triangle and touches all three sides. Its radius is called the inradius. There are three other important circles, the excircles; they lie outside the triangle and touch one side as well as the extensions of the other two. The centers of the in- and excircles form an orthocentric system.|$|E
50|$|The Middle Ring Road is {{a system}} of roads <b>incircling</b> the core of Tianjin. It is inside the Outer Ring Road, and <b>incircles</b> the Inner Ring Road. The road is not divided and has many traffic lights, but has {{interchanges}} at major roads. The road is very busy, having over 2 lanes in each direction with many bikes also. The road connects with the Jinghu Expressway to Shanghai via an interchange. The Middle Ring Road is very useful for traffic and taxis, and is very busy.|$|R
50|$|Triangulating an {{arbitrary}} cyclic quadrilateral by its diagonals yields four overlapping triangles (each diagonal creates two triangles). The {{centers of the}} <b>incircles</b> of those triangles form a rectangle.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>incircles</b> of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB are {{pairwise}} {{tangent to}} one another. There {{is one more}} such point, namely, the equal detour point X(176) of triangle ABC.|$|R
25|$|The eight tangent {{lengths of}} a {{tangential}} quadrilateral are the line segments from a vertex to the points where the <b>incircle</b> is tangent to the sides. From each vertex {{there are two}} congruent tangent lengths.|$|E
25|$|The two {{tangency}} chords of a {{tangential quadrilateral}} are the line segments that connect points {{on opposite sides}} where the <b>incircle</b> is tangent to these sides. These are also the diagonals of the contact quadrilateral.|$|E
25|$|In a {{tangential}} quadrilateral, {{the four}} angle bisectors {{meet at the}} center of the <b>incircle.</b> Conversely, a convex quadrilateral in which the four angle bisectors meet at a point must be tangential and the common point is the incenter.|$|E
25|$|Another {{necessary}} and sufficient condition {{is that a}} convex quadrilateral ABCD is tangential {{if and only if}} the <b>incircles</b> in the two triangles ABC and ADC are tangent to each other.|$|R

25|$|The Gergonne {{triangle}} or intouch {{triangle of}} a reference triangle has its vertices {{at the three}} points of tangency of the reference triangle's sides with its <b>incircle.</b> The extouch triangle of a reference triangle has its vertices at the points of tangency of the reference triangle's excircles with its sides (not extended).|$|E
25|$|The {{midpoints}} of {{the three}} sides and the feet {{of the three}} altitudes all lie on a single circle, the triangle's nine-point circle. The remaining three points for which it is named are the midpoints of the portion of altitude between the vertices and the orthocenter. The radius of the nine-point circle is half that of the circumcircle. It touches the <b>incircle</b> (at the Feuerbach point) and the three excircles.|$|E
25|$|In Euclidean geometry, a {{tangential}} quadrilateral (sometimes just tangent quadrilateral) or circumscribed quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral whose sides are all tangent {{to a single}} circle within the quadrilateral. This circle is called the <b>incircle</b> of the quadrilateral or its inscribed circle, its center is the incenter and its radius is called the inradius. Since these quadrilaterals can be drawn surrounding or circumscribing their incircles, they have also been called circumscribable quadrilaterals, circumscribing quadrilaterals, and circumscriptible quadrilaterals. Tangential quadrilaterals are a special case of tangential polygons.|$|E
5000|$|This {{gives an}} {{expression}} for the parameter [...] {{in terms of}} the geometric measures, [...] and [...] With this definition of [...] we then obtain an expression for the radii, , of the <b>incircles</b> formed by taking every Nth ray as the sides of the triangles ...|$|R
50|$|The theorem {{states that}} the <b>incircles</b> of the triangles formed (starting from any given ray) by every other ray, every third ray, etc. and the base line are also equal. The case of every other ray is {{illustrated}} above by the green circles, which are all equal.|$|R
50|$|The Inner Ring Road of Tianjin is {{a system}} of roads <b>incircling</b> the {{downtown}} of Tianjin, China. It is not an expressway in any way as the road user has to turn to get onto the next road and not exit. There are traffic lights or roundabouts at most intersections with other roads.|$|R
25|$|There are an infinitude {{of lines}} that bisect {{the area of}} a {{triangle}}. Three of them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints with the opposite vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle's centroid; indeed, {{they are the only}} area bisectors that go through the centroid. Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its <b>incircle).</b> There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.|$|E
500|$|After debuting {{a hybrid}} {{powertrain}} with the 2005 LF-Sh concept, Lexus began {{sales of the}} LS 600h L (UVF46), the first production V8-powered full-hybrid vehicle, in May 2007 for the 2008 model year. The long-wheelbase LS 600h L is equipped with Lexus Hybrid Drive, featuring a 5.0-liter 2UR-FSE V8 engine mated to a high-output electric motor with nickel-metal hydride battery packs. This system uses a continuously variable transmission and generates an output of [...] Fuel economy is slightly higher overall than the lower-powered non-hybrid LS, and the hybrids achieve a U.S. Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) rating. Features specific to the LS hybrids include the first production low beam LED headlights, a leather-trimmed dash, and blue-tinted hybrid badging. In April 2007, Lexus announced that the base price for the LS 600h L would be over US$104,000, surpassing the V12-equipped Toyota Century as the most expensive Japanese luxury car ever produced. A standard-wheelbase version destined for Asia and Europe, the LS 600h (UVF45), was launched in Japan in May 2007. The first 100 LS 600h L sedans sold in the U.S. were offered as [...] "Launch Edition" [...] models via the Neiman Marcus catalog for <b>InCircle</b> members.|$|E
