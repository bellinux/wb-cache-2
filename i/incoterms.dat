5000|$|<b>Incoterms</b> 2010 is {{the eighth}} set of pre-defined {{international}} contract terms {{published by the}} International Chamber of Commerce, with the first set having been published in 1936. <b>Incoterms</b> 2010 defines 11 rules, down from the 13 rules defined by <b>Incoterms</b> 2000. Four rules of the 2000 version ("Delivered at Frontier", DAF; [...] "Delivered Ex Ship", DES; [...] "Delivered Ex Quay", DEQ; [...] "Delivered Duty Unpaid", DDU) were removed, and are replaced by two new rules ("Delivered at Terminal", DAT; [...] "Delivered at Place", DAP) in the 2010 rules.|$|E

50|$|This <b>Incoterm</b> {{requires}} that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named terminal. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.|$|R
50|$|While <b>Incoterms</b> {{were first}} {{published}} in 1936, it has been revised every 10 years. <b>Incoterms</b> inform sales contract by defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved {{in the delivery of}} goods from seller to buyer. <b>Incoterms</b> 2010, the 8th revision, refers to the newest collection of essential international commercial and trade terms with 11 rules. Incoterm 2010 was effective on and from January 1, 2011. The terms were devised in recognition of non-uniform standard trade usages between various States. When incorporated into a sale contract, the Incoterm code provides a detailed interpretation of rights and obligations between parties.|$|E

40|$|GKN Aerospace Engine Systems acts as {{supplier}} to {{the original}} equipment manufacturers of aircraft engines and is one owe the largest component manufacturer in the aerospace industry. They purchase raw material from suppliers all over the world. The components are big and heavy which means that transport cost could be saved with ship transport. But since GKN Aerospace Engine Systems use Free carrier agreement as <b>incoterm</b> they tie up capital during the transportation. The capital tied up could instead be used in other investments. To overcome the problem with tied up capital during transport the <b>incoterm</b> agreement has been evaluated. The <b>incoterm</b> Delivery at place means that the supplier owns the material and thereby also the capital cost during the transportation. A production stop {{due to lack of}} raw material is expensive and to minimize the risk it is important to evaluate all possible risks. The purpose with this thesis is to identify potential risks. The concept with DAP makes it possible for the suppliers to use their own freight carrier, that could lower the prices, but it also increase the inbound transport to GKN Aerospace Engine Systems. The administration cost in the goods receive tends to increase with a DAP solution. It is also necessary to change place where the delivery precision is measured. The supplier also needs some knowledge in export transportation and have competence in transports...|$|R
50|$|In {{many respects}} this <b>Incoterm</b> has {{replaced}} FOB in modern usage, although the critical {{point at which}} the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. It {{should also be noted that}} the chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place.|$|R
50|$|The type of {{insurance}} contract {{depends on the}} <b>Incoterm</b> adopted by the parties in a sale contract. A CIF sale contract requires the seller to obtain insurance cover for the voyage. An FOB contract however places no obligation on the buyer or seller to obtain insurance, although it is prudent for the buyer to protect against potential losses. It {{is not uncommon for}} the buyer in a FOB contract to request the seller to arrange insurance on an understanding that they will reimburse the insurance costs incurred.|$|R

50|$|Any given Incoterm, in most jurisdictions, {{will not}} be {{incorporated}} into a contract without express or implied reference to it being an Incoterm. They are standardised and published, available for incorporation into international sale contracts at the parties’ discretion. Parties should specifically refer to the <b>Incoterms</b> in the sale contract to indicate incorporation. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is responsible for revising <b>Incoterms</b> periodically to reflect changing practices in international trade.|$|E

40|$|My essay demostrates {{well the}} {{interpretation}} of the rules concerning this international field. Although there are only few agreements and regulations regarding this topic, there is a developed case-law which may orientate us when we are looking for a solution. I have presented the <b>Incoterm</b> rules focusing on the responsabilities of the seller and the buyer, also concluding them in a chart. Then I have described the necessary documents for shipping; emphasizing on the bill of lading contract and giving more practical examples. In the last part I have construed the obligations of the carrier towards the cargo and the immunities and the limitation of liability someone can claim. MSc/MALL.

50|$|The seller {{pays for}} the {{carriage}} of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship {{in the country of}} Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer does require the seller to obtain insurance, the <b>Incoterm</b> CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.|$|R
40|$|In 1933, the International Chamber of Commerce {{formulated}} the UCP, {{which is}} now a set of universally accepted governing rules for letters of credit and the most successful private rules for commerce ever developed. But rules require interpretation, and courts worldwide have interpreted how the UCP should be applied in daily practice. In this thesis, {{some of the most}} important court cases interpreting the UCP have been collected, analyzed and explained. Regarding disputes and available remedies in the L/C & <b>INCOTERM</b> contract the UCP soft law has no system of how to calculate contractual damages. So the thesis will give a thorough analysis of contractual damages which will be based on the law for sale of goods and the law of contracts...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Incoterms</b> {{rules or}} International Commercial Terms are {{a series of}} pre-defined {{commercial}} terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) relating to international commercial law. They are widely used in International commercial transactions or procurement processes as the use in international sales is encouraged by trade councils, courts and international lawyers. A series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices, the <b>Incoterms</b> rules are intended primarily to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the transportation and delivery of goods. <b>Incoterms</b> inform sales contract defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer. However, it does not constitute contract or govern law. Also it does not define where titles transfer and does not address the price payable, currency or credit items.|$|E
50|$|Also of note is {{that the}} point at which risk passes under these terms has shifted from {{previous}} editions of <b>Incoterms,</b> where the risk passed at the ship's rail.|$|E
50|$|The {{risk and}} the cost {{is not always the}} same for <b>Incoterms.</b> In many cases, the risk and cost usually goes {{together}} but it is not always the case.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, most jurisdictions require {{companies}} to provide {{proof of export}} for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is {{under no obligation to}} provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another <b>Incoterm,</b> such as FCA seller's premises, may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process. 228 ...|$|R
30|$|Company C is a {{manufacturer}} of steel powder products. It turns over 750  M€ per annum, employs around 1700 workers, and has sales and distribution representation in 75 countries. Most of the production is located in Sweden from Swedish iron ore, {{but there are also}} production facilities in the USA and India. Company C recognizes that its global competitive advantage is product quality and advanced research and development. Flows included in the case study are outbound flows of components (i.e., general steel powder) and finished products (i.e., customer-specific prepared mixes of steel powders). The company purchases container liner shipping services directly, without the involvement of a forwarder, using <b>Incoterm</b> CIF (Cost Insurance and Freight) when delivering to its customers. The company has a standing order based on the departure schedule of the relevant shipping lines. Deviation from the standing order is managed through contacts with the shipping line. Air freight is an option only during rare occasions of emergency. Usually, different shipping lines are called on in order to manage variation in demand and disturbances. Transport service suppliers are re-evaluated annually using competitive tenders. The annual volume for the relevant flows is about 10, 000 TEUs.|$|R
30|$|Company B is an {{industrial}} equipment manufacturer and distributor of industrial filtration, recycling and cleaning equipment in workshop environments. The company has sales and service presence in 31 countries, manufacturing and assembly plants in 11, and distributors in an additional 30 countries. The company has an annual turnover of 290  M€ and employs some 1700 people. Almost {{two-thirds of the}} volume is transported by truck and RoRo shipping to continental Europe, and the remaining third is shipped out by containerised liner shipping. The flows included in the case study are the outbound volumes of finished products and components from Sweden to the Far East and North and South America. Air transport {{is used as a}} competing mode to maritime transport but the products are voluminous, making them expensive to send by air. For cost and environmental reasons, the aim is to minimise the use of air freight. Both components and finished products are produced after Company B receives actual orders. The level of customisation for many of the systems sold is such that orders normally originate from sales agents or offshore manufacturing sites, which in turn also place their orders based on actual end-customer orders. Sales are delivered according to <b>Incoterm</b> DAP (Delivered at Place). Transport services are routinely purchased as door-to-door transport from a forwarder. The company has a standing order based on the departure schedule of the shipping lines. Deviation from the standing order is managed through contacts with a forwarder. The forwarder is biannually re-evaluated in competitive tendering. The annual volumes for the relevant flows are about 500 TEUs.|$|R
