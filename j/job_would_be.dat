The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack.

5|$|Heikkinen {{signed on}} as an {{assistant}} coach at Michigan in the spring 1939 initially expressing ambivalence about playing professional football. Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s assurance that a coaching <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was cut by the Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E

Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dangerous.

25|$|After {{that day}} of pleasantry, Gromyko {{for the first}} time in his life wanted to enter higher education, but without warning, Gromyko and his family were moved in 1954 to Moscow, {{settling}} in the northeastern Alexeyevsky District. In 1936, after another three years of studying economics, Gromyko became a researcher and lecturer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. His area of expertise was the US economy, and he published several books on the subject. Gromyko assumed his new <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a permanent one, but in 1939 he was called upon by a Central Committee Commission which selected new personnel to work in diplomacy.

25|$|Since it was {{perceived}} by the Maya that sickness was a punishment for a mistake or transgression, {{it was important that}} the healer inquire about details of the past of the sick person.

This aspect of the medicine man’s <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> similar to a modern-day therapy session. In addition to ritualistic and spiritual elements, the medicine man had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and how they should be used.

500|$|Bennett {{realized}} he faced {{a serious challenge}} in developing the new Star Trek movie, partly due to his never having seen the television show. To compensate, Bennett watched all the original episodes. This immersion convinced Bennett that what the first movie lacked was a real villain; after seeing the episode [...] "Space Seed", he decided that the character of Khan Noonien Singh was the perfect enemy for the new film. Before the script was settled upon, Bennett gathered his production staff. He selected Robert Sallin, a director of television commercials and a college friend, to produce the film. Sallin's <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to produce Star Trek II quickly and cheaply. Bennett also hired Michael Minor as art director to shape {{the direction of the}} film.|$|E

Hornaday strongly objected to this proposal, describing Kuser as an [...] "evil genius" [...] who was attempting to steal Beebe away from his duties at the zoo. However, the zoo ultimately decided in Kuser's favor, partly because the scientific papers produced by Beebe's trip to Guiana had been beneficial to the zoo's reputation. Hornaday appointed Crandall as the zoo's acting curator of birds, giving him the duty of caring for its birds in Beebe's absence.

500|$|As a {{so-called}} [...] "bleeding-heart conservative", Kemp was a logical choice for Bush as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whose <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to foster public sector {{and private sector}} methods {{to meet the demands}} of public housing. However, the scandals of Reagan's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start, and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives: enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership. [...] The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant-owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives. Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUD's director, he cleaned up HUD's reputation, and developed a plan to salvage the troubled Federal Housing Administration. He halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive, which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett. He supported [...] "Operation Clean Sweep" [...] and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing.|$|E
500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|The Indiana {{constitution}} prevented Marshall {{from serving}} a consecutive term as governor. He {{made plans to}} run for a United States Senate seat after his term ended, but another opportunity presented itself during his last months as governor. Although he {{did not attend the}} 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, his name was put forward as Indiana's choice for president. [...] He was suggested as a compromise nominee, but William Jennings Bryan and his delegates endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Champ Clark, securing the nomination for Wilson. Indiana's delegates lobbied to have Marshall named the vice presidential candidate in exchange for supporting Wilson. Indiana was an important swing state, and Wilson hoped that Marshall's popularity would help him carry it in the general election. [...] He had his delegates support Marshall, giving him the vice presidential nomination. Marshall privately turned down the nomination, assuming the <b>job</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> boring given its limited role. He changed his mind after Wilson assured him that he would be given plenty of responsibilities. During the campaign, Marshall traveled across the United States delivering speeches. The Wilson–Marshall ticket easily won the 1912 election because of the division between the Republican Party and the Progressive Party.|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} the Pawnee summer catalog, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly organizes a reunion between Ron (Nick Offerman) and his three predecessors. She anticipates a joyous {{occasion}} and plans {{to write a letter}} about it for the catalog. However, none of the four men get along with each other, and all of them are difficult to get along with. One of them (Dakin Matthews) litters repeatedly, treats everybody disrespectfully, and cheerfully says he never gave a damn about the Parks department and only took the job because it had an easy path to job security and a lucrative pension. Another one (Jack Wallace) exhibits a sexist attitude, and tells Leslie she should not be working there due to menstruation issues. The third (Michael Gross) constantly talks about his affinity for marijuana, {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I've planted marijuana in community gardens across this city," [...] and particularly clashes with Ron (who forced him out of the position years ago) who cheerfully confirms he screwed his predecessor over and otherwise is his usual detached self. Later, a frustrated Leslie decides she cannot write the catalog letter; she stops treating the former directors with any respect by telling the sexist to shut up and calling them [...] "turds" [...] when she briefly takes a throwaway picture and then walks away from without another word. Ron takes her out to dinner to apologize, and the two process their mutual respect for each other, and vow they will never grow to hate each other the way the four former directors do. Ron even tells Leslie that he wants her to take over his Parks Director position if he becomes Pawnee's City Manager. However, Ron cheerfully says in an interview that one of his first acts as City Manager would be to eliminate the Parks department, while Leslie gives an equally upbeat interview where she says one of her first acts as City Manager, were she to leapfrog Ron for the <b>job,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to double the department's size.|$|E
