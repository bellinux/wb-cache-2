5000|$|A {{number of}} Velcro Corporation {{products}} were displayed at {{a fashion show}} at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York in 1959, and the fabric got its first break when it {{was used in the}} aerospace industry to help astronauts maneuver in and out of bulky space suits. However, this reinforced the view among the populace that Velcro was something with very limited utilitarian uses. The next major use Velcro saw was with skiers, who saw the similarities between their costume and that of the astronauts, and thus saw the advantages of a suit that was easier to <b>don</b> <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b> Scuba and marine gear followed soon after. Having seen astronauts storing food pouches on walls, children's clothing makers came on board. As touch fasteners only became widely used after NASA's adoption of it, NASA is popularly - and incorrectly - credited with its invention.|$|E
5000|$|His [...] "Iphicratean reforms" [...] {{consisted}} {{of increasing the}} length of their spears and swords, substituting linen cuirasses in place of heavier bronze armor, and introducing new footwear (later called iphicratids) that was easier to <b>don</b> <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> than previous models. In addition, he replaced the heavy hoplon/aspis with a lighter pelte that could be strapped to the forearm, freeing the left hand to help hold the lengthened spears. By these changes he greatly increased the rapidity of their movements. He also paid special attention to discipline, drill and maneuvers; the longer weapons, combined with the lighter armor and shield, forced his troops {{to take a more}} aggressive approach in tactical situations. With his peltasts Iphicrates dealt the Spartans a heavy blow in 392 BC-390 BC by almost annihilating a mora (a battalion of about 600 men) of their famous hoplites. The Iphicratean reforms are considered to {{have been one of the}} leading influences on Philip II of Macedon, when he created the pike-armed (sarissa) Macedonian phalanx. His son, Alexander the Great, employed this new infantry formation in his many conquests.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{problems}} also turned up, primarily related {{to the problem of}} keeping the suit in strong mechanical contact at every point on the body. Concavities or small folds in the fabric could lead to fluid pooling in the gaps; the groin area proved extremely difficult to tailor successfully. To correct this, small pads of polyurethane foam were inserted into concavities and were successful in most problem areas. The suits had to be tailored to each individual, although the same was true of all space suits of the era. The largest difficulty was <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> the suit. In order to effectively provide the minimum pressure of [...] necessary for human physiology, the suit had to be extremely tight-fitting, making <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> doffing a highly strenuous task.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that astronauts {{returning}} from space often experience postural instability due to the stimulus rearrangement of the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems. However, postural control may also be influenced by the head-ward shift in their center of gravity (CG) that occurs {{as a result of the}} expansion of their spinal column by as much as two inches during long duration space flight, as well as the CG shift that occurs from the Life Support Pack on the extra-vehicular activity (EVA) suit. This study investigated the effect on postural stability after (1) an immediate shift in the CG towards the head, (2) a 30 minute adaptation to the shifted CG, and (3) immediate shift of the CG back to normal, accomplished by <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> a modified backpack.

50|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment (PPE) must be worn on the worker's {{body and}} is the least desirable option for controlling hazards. It is used when other controls are not effective, have not been evaluated, or while doing maintenance or in emergency situations such as spill response. PPE normally used for typical chemicals are also appropriate for nanomaterials, including wearing long pants, long-sleeve shirts, and closed-toed shoes, {{and the use of}} safety gloves, goggles, and impervious laboratory coats. Nitrile gloves are preferred because latex gloves do not provide protection from most chemical solvents and may present an allergy hazard. Face shields are not an acceptable replacement for goggles because they do not protect against unbound dry materials. Woven cotton lab coats are not recommended for nanomaterials, as they can become contaminated with nanomaterials and release them later. PPE should be <b>donned</b> <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> in a changing room to prevent contamination of outside areas.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a problem}} with gloves. As Chris Packham wrote in a {{commentary}} in this journal in 2006 : A basic rule of all exposure control should be that this is, so far as possible, independent of the worker. This is what technical control measures attempt to achieve. Since gloves are dependent upon the wearer to <b>don,</b> use <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> correctly, we immediately introduce an element of uncer-tainty. Furthermore, when controlling exposure by technical methods, it is frequently possible to structure these so that the control is ‘fail-to-safe’, i. e. should the control measure fail, this will not result in worker exposure. In practice, this is unachievable with personal protective equipment such as gloves. Any failure will result in worke...|$|R

40|$|Background: Learning in skills centers {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in nursing education. Nurse educators struggle to substantiate their opinions on the efficacy of simulation technologies over traditional methods of instruction and it is suggested that they should re-evaluate their methods when teaching psychomotor skills. A necessary step before evaluation is to unravel what the students are actually doing in the skills center. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore nursing students’ practical skills training in the skills center to label and define generic learning actions used during the learning of two specific skills; wound care and dressing, and sterile gloving. Methods: A qualitative observational study of nursing students’ practical skill training in the skills center was developed. Students across three cohorts were video recorded while practicing wound cleaning <b>and</b> dressing, <b>and</b> <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> sterile gloves. Verbal interaction on the video recordings was transcribed. The core analytical process was the joint listening to and watching of videos with following discussions of interpretations and development of categories. Results: Seven categories of learning actions were developed: Parallel action and self-instruction, watch and copy, collaborating to find solutions, giving support, seeking support, recontextualising the skill, and humorous enactment with the equipment. The categories are exemplified and discussed in light of learning theory and research on aspects of scaffolding. Conclusions: The learning actions described in this study are a starting point in detailing students learning actions during skills training. Students’ learning in other practical nursing skills should be studied to accumulate more knowledge about students’ learning actions and how peer interaction supports or hampers learning. The relevance of the learning actions should be explored in the clinical setting. A goal is to lay the groundwork for better design of learning in skills centers in nursing education...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{visual system}} {{continuously}} adapts to the environment, {{allowing it to}} perform optimally in a changing visual world. One large change occurs every time one takes off or puts {{on a pair of}} spectacles. It would be advantageous for the visual system to learn to adapt particularly rapidly to such large, commonly occurring events, but whether it can do so remains unknown. Here, we tested whether people who routinely wear spectacles with colored lenses increase how rapidly they adapt to the color shifts their lenses produce. Adaptation to a global color shift causes the appearance of a test color to change. We measured changes in the color that appeared “unique yellow”, that is neither reddish nor greenish, as subjects <b>donned</b> <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> their spectacles. Nine habitual wearers and nine age-matched control subjects judged the color of a small monochromatic test light presented with a large, uniform, whitish surround every 5 s. Red lenses shifted unique yellow to more reddish colors (longer wavelengths), and greenish lenses shifted it to more greenish colors (shorter wavelengths), consistent with adaptation “normalizing” the appearance of the world. In controls, the time course of this adaptation contained a large, rapid component and a smaller gradual one, in agreement with prior results. Critically, in habitual wearers the rapid component was significantly larger, and the gradual component significantly smaller than in controls. The total amount of adaptation was also larger in habitual wearers than in controls. These data suggest strongly that the visual system adapts with increasing rapidity and strength as environments are encountered repeatedly over time. An additional unexpected finding was that baseline unique yellow shifted in a direction opposite to that produced by the habitually worn lenses. Overall, our results represent one of the first formal reports that adjusting to putting on or taking off spectacles becomes easier over time, and may have important implications for clinical management...|$|R

40|$|Background: The use {{of gloves}} for every patient contact (universal gloving) has been {{suggested}} as an infection prevention adjunct and alternative to contact precautions. However, gloves may carry organisms unless they are changed properly. In addition, hand hygiene is required before <b>donning</b> <b>and</b> after <b>removing</b> gloves, <b>and</b> there are scarce data regarding glove changing and hand hygiene in a universal gloving setting. Methods: This non-randomized observational before-after study evaluated the effect of education and feedback regarding hand hygiene. Compliance with hand hygiene and glove use was directly observed in a universal gloving setting at a 10 -bed intensive care unit in a Japanese tertiary care teaching university hospital. Results: A total of 6, 050 hand hygiene opportunities were identified. Overall hand hygiene compliance steadily increased from study period 1 (16. 1 %) to period 5 (56. 8 %), although there were indication-specific differences in the baseline compliance, the degree of improvement, {{and the reasons for}} non-compliance. There were decreases in the compliance for universal gloving and the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusion: It is difficult to properly perform glove use and hand hygiene in a universal gloving setting, given its complexity. Direct observation with specific feedback and education may be effective in improving compliance. 博士（医学）・甲第 671 号・平成 29 年 6 月 28 日Copyright © 2017 The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

40|$|Radiation is a {{workplace}} hazard that eludes the sensing body, or seems to. After Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, Kai Erickson described radiation as “an invisible threat,” “the very embodiment of stealth and treachery. ” The {{first generation of}} Canadian nuclear power workers, from their four decades of experience around reactors has a different sense of the matter. They describe a physical awareness of the morphology and topography of radiation, a cultivated bodily knowledge that informed their actions as they produced power. They describe a “feel and a touch for the plant,” framed in theoretical studies, made through attentiveness and alert expectation, honed by being out and about in the station, being its intimate, “listening to its very cries. ” By their telling, “doesn 2 ̆ 7 t feel right” {{ceased to be a}} metaphor about their workplace circumstance, and through study and practice, became a bodily effect, a report from the somatic. Key to work safety for Canadian nuclear workers were close study of the theory of ionizing radiation, adeptness with both the instruments which made radiation apparent and the calculations that made the readings on dials into qualitatively and spatially distinctive workplace presences, and skill in choosing, <b>donning,</b> building, <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> physical barriers between their bodies and radiation fields. Through this knowledge and practice, Canadian nuclear workers came to embody the hazards of the job. This working knowledge of the insensible enabled them to be responsible for their own radiation protection and for the safety of those with whom they worked...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effects of the combination of deoxynivalenol (<b>DON)</b> <b>and</b> zearalenone (ZON) on pigs. Twenty-four weaning piglets were divided into a control group fed a diet free of mycotoxins and a toxin group fed a diet containing 1 mg/kg <b>DON</b> <b>and</b> 250 µg/kg ZON. The results showed that supplementation of <b>DON</b> <b>and</b> ZON in diets had extensive effects on pigs. More specifically, <b>DON</b> <b>and</b> ZON caused levels of total protein, albumin, and globulin in sera to decrease (p < 0. 05) by 14. 5 %, 6. 5 % and 11. 3 %, respectively, {{and at the same time}} increased (p < 0. 05) the serum enzyme activities of γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase by 72. 0 %, 32. 6 % and 36. 6 %, respectively. In addition, <b>DON</b> <b>and</b> ZON decreased (p < 0. 05) the level of anti-classical swine fever antibody titers by 14. 8 %. Real-time PCR showed that <b>DON</b> <b>and</b> ZON caused the mRNA expression levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL- 2, to decrease (p < 0. 05) by 36. 0 %, 29. 0 % and 35. 4 %, respectively. Histopathological studies demonstrated that <b>DON</b> <b>and</b> ZON caused abnormalities in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, uterus, and kidney. The concentrations of <b>DON</b> <b>and</b> ZON used in this study are in line with the published critical values permitted by BML.
