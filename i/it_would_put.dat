5|$|A notable venue {{not found}} at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a {{population}} of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> many of them out of business. Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, Ostapchuk {{was against}} Alliance Atlantis’s plans for Whyte Avenue, believing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> both the Garneau and the Princess out of business. The Old Strathcona Foundation sided with Magic Lantern, and fought the plans. The {{argument}} {{went all the}} way to Edmonton City Council, which was asked to waive Old Strathcona’s four-story height limit for the six-story multiplex. Council sided against Alliance Atlantis when Councillor Terry Cavanagh changed his vote at the last minute, defeating the motion 6-5.|$|E
5|$|When {{approaching}} investors {{prior to}} filming, Six {{did not mention}} the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> off potential backers. The financiers of The Human Centipede did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete. The film received generally mixed reviews from mainstream film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film was released in the United States on a limited theatrical release on 30 April 2010. A sequel, entitled Full Sequence, also written and directed by Six, was released in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the plan was that, politically at least, it abandoned most of eastern Belgium to the Germans. Militarily <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the Allied rear {{at right angles to}} the French frontier defences; while for the British, their communications located at the Bay of Biscay ports, would be parallel to their front. Despite the risk of committing forces to central Belgium and an advance to the Schedlt or Dyle lines, which would be vulnerable to an outflanking move, Maurice Gamelin, the French commander, approved the plan and it remained the Allied strategy upon the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} vote, Parliament demanded {{a number of}} {{concessions}} {{as part of a}} future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-lead international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} near Woolwich was under {{construction}} by 1921, as it ran on open {{land that was}} easy to purchase, but plans {{for the remainder of}} the route had not yet been decided and there were delays due to compulsory purchasing of properties. In 1925, The Times announced a replacement bridge for the Woolwich Ferry was planned as part of the South Circular project to tie in with the East Ham and Barking Bypass (now the A13). A significant amount of new housing had been built along the route of the South Circular since the original 1903 plans, and building costs had risen because of labour and because of further demolition required. In 1927, the Governors of Dulwich College formally objected to the road as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the Memorial Library right next to a main road and remove part of the college green.|$|E

25|$|A devout Roman Catholic {{throughout}} his life, Curtis would repair to a convent {{church in the}} early hours of Sunday morning after finishing the Saturday night set at the Star Club, St. Pauli, near Hamburg. At that time Curtis still had long hair, which was unusual for the time, and was sometimes assumed to be one of the transvestites who haunted that district. He cut his hair when the band became popular, deciding that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> off some potential record buyers.|$|E
25|$|In early 1955, Lewis warned Culshaw that he {{had heard}} rumours that Capitol was on the point of {{severing}} its ties with Decca. Within days it was announced that Capitol had been taken over by EMI. Capitol sessions already booked were completed, including two records of Jacques Ibert conducting his own works, but EMI made it clear that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> an end to Capitol's classical activity, which was regarded as superfluous. Lewis invited Culshaw to rejoin Decca, which he did in the autumn of 1955.|$|E
25|$|The case {{arose from}} a claim by a New Jersey {{manufacturer}} that a Maryland firm had misrepresented {{itself in a}} transaction and thus the contract between the two was unenforceable, precluding the arbitration agreed upon {{in the event of}} a dispute. Abe Fortas wrote for a 6-3 majority that the FAA was broad enough to require arbitration of all issues save the arbitration clause itself. Hugo Black's dissent called the majority's interpretation overbroad and at odds with Congressional intent in passing the law. He feared <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> legal matters in the hands of arbitrators with little or no legal understanding of it nor duty to follow the law.|$|E

25|$|Brazelton {{admitted}} in a 2003 interview {{that when he}} started the comic and was unsure as to its potential longevity, he fell back on using himself and those close to him to avoid writing backstories for potentially short-lived characters. This shortcut also hamstrings Brazelton's potential for development; he cannot reveal too much back story of the characters {{out of concern for}} their counterparts' privacy, yet he can't make something up because readers will attribute the fiction to the real person. In 2009, Brazelton confessed that if he were to go back with what he knew now, he would begin again with all-original characters, despite the artificial familiarity it breeds in his fans. The main characters which have been based on real people are author Tom, his wife Cami, their beagle Truman, and Tom's friend Jared. Brazelton has gone on record saying his young son, Henry, will not be joining the comic strip because of the limitations <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> on he and his wife's characters to be responsible and parental.|$|E
25|$|Utah held {{intensely}} liberal {{views of}} women's suffrage {{and also a}} strong dedication to polygamy. To {{the people in the}} East, women's suffrage was seen as the opposite of polygamy. For many, the two ideals could not coincide because polygamy was seen as oppressive to women. Hamilton Wilcox, a New York suffragist (1867–1868), suggested women's suffrage should be experimented with in the territories. The East was heavily motivated to push women's enfranchisement in the Utah territory believing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> an end to polygamy. By 1870 the idea became so popular and pushed by the East that Utah territorial legislature began debate over the right of women to vote. On February 12, 1870, after two weeks of debate a unanimous vote passed a bill enfranchising the women of Utah, fifty years before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteed women nationwide the right to vote. However, instead of voting against plural marriage, Mormon women helped double the majority in favor of plural marriage by reelecting William H. Hooper, who defended polygamy. Froiseth, a long time believer in the enfranchisement of women and later {{the vice president of the}} Utah Women's Suffrage Association (1888), firmly believed Mormon women should not have the right to vote—at least until polygamy was outlawed. She recognized this was inconsistent with her beliefs about women's rights but concluded, by her own judgement, that Mormon women were too heavily influenced to make voting decisions for themselves.|$|E
25|$|After some time, Seven {{begins to}} {{question}} why Captain Janeway {{continues to make}} contact with alien species as they travel back to Earth, as it often results in incidents. Janeway explains that Voyagers purpose is exploration and will continue that mission despite any problems that might occur. While working in astrometrics, Seven detects an ancient alien communications platform which connects {{all the way back to}} the borders of Federation space. This results in the first successful communication with Starfleet since Voyager was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, although it does also result in angering an alien race upon first contact; the Hirogen had claimed the platform for their own. The crew subsequently receive messages from home through the array, but the ship is once again threatened by the Hirogen. Tuvok and Seven transport aboard the array to speed the downloading of the messages, but are captured and tortured by the aliens. They are rescued by 'Voyager', but the communications array is destroyed. When the crew find a member of Species 8472 being hunted by the Hirogen, Seven is reluctant to help her former enemy as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the ship at risk of destruction from the Hirogen. When the Hirogen threaten Voyager, Seven disobeys Janeway's command and transports the alien aboard a Hirogen ship. In response, the Captain punishes her by restricting her computer access and curfews her to the cargo bay where her Borg unit is set-up.|$|E

500|$|Pulsford {{spoke for}} five hours in {{the debate on the}} 1902 Customs Tariff Bill, {{although}} he later supported time limits for speeches. Missing out on a frontbench portfolio when the Free Traders were briefly in government from 1904 to 1905, he was absent from parliament for most of 1907. Described by the Tribune as [...] "the best living authority on Australia's tariff question", his pamphlet to the Cobden Club in 1907 attracted a favourable reception. He opposed women's suffrage on the grounds that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> Australia [...] "in advance of public opinion throughout the world", believing it would lead to the [...] "vulgarisation of women".|$|E
500|$|In March 1983, Reagan {{introduced}} the Strategic Defense Initiative, a defense {{project that would}} have used ground- and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. Reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible. There was much disbelief surrounding the program's scientific feasibility, leading opponents to dub SDI [...] "Star Wars" [...] and argue that its technological objective was unattainable. The Soviets became concerned about the possible effects SDI would have; leader Yuri Andropov said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> [...] "the entire world in jeopardy." [...] For those reasons, David Gergen, former aide to President Reagan, believes that in retrospect, SDI hastened {{the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{heard about}} Cotton's flight {{and sent him}} letters urging {{him to come to}} New England. [...] None of the great Puritan clergymen had gone there, and he felt that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> him at too great a {{distance}} to return should the situation in England warrant. [...] Despite this, he made his decision to emigrate by the spring of 1633 and wrote a letter to Bishop Williams on 7 May, resigning from his pastorate at St. Botolph's and thanking the bishop for his flexibility and mildness. [...] By the summer, he had reunited with his wife, and the couple {{made their way to the}} coast of Kent. [...] In June or July 1633, the 48-year-old Cotton boarded the ship Griffin with his wife and step-daughter, along with fellow ministers Thomas Hooker and Samuel Stone. [...] Also on board was Edward Hutchinson, the oldest son of Anne Hutchinson who was traveling with his uncle Edward. [...] Cotton's wife was pregnant and bore their child during the voyage, and they named him Seaborn. [...] Eighteen months after his departure from England, Cotton wrote that his decision to emigrate was not difficult to make; he found preaching in a new land to be far preferable to [...] "sitting in a loathsome prison." ...|$|E
