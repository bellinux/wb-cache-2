25|$|The {{nature of}} Philcoxias highly {{specialized}} morphology {{has led to}} confusion about its proper taxonomic placement. In 1996, before Philcoxia was even formally published as a taxon, it had been placed by Vinícius Souza in the tribe Scrophularieae of the Scrophulariaceae. Peter Taylor et al. later noted in the 2000 description of the genus that its affinities should include the genera <b>Gratiola</b> and Dopatrium in the tribe Gratioleae of the Scrophulariaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group later changed the circumscription of the Scrophulariaceae so that the tribe Gratioleae is now within the Plantaginaceae. In 2004, E. Fischer also placed in tribe Gratioleae, but also placed it within the informally recognized subtribe Dopatriinae, which was described as also containing the genera Deinostema, Dopatrium, Hydrotriche, and Limnophila, which consist mostly of aquatic species. In 2007, an extensive study and phylogenetic analysis by Peter Fritsch et al. confirmed that Philcoxia should {{be placed in the}} tribe Gratioleae, but it is in fact not as closely related to <b>Gratiola</b> and the Dopatriinae as was previously assumed.|$|E

40|$|Cytogenetic {{characterization}} {{and determination}} of DNA content by flow cytometry of five species of Mecardonia Ruiz et Pavon, 1798 (<b>Gratiolae,</b> Plantaginaceae) was performed. This {{is the first}} study of nuclear DNA content {{carried out in the}} genus. Mitotic analysis revealed a base chromosome number x = 11 for all entities and different ploidy levels, ranging from diploid (2 n = 2 x = 22) to hexaploid (2 n = 6 x = 66). The results include the first report of the chromosome numbers for M. flagellaris (Chamisso & Schlechtendal, 1827) (2 n = 22), M. grandiflora (Bentham) Pennell, 1946 (2 n = 22), M. kamogawae Greppi & Hagiwara, 2011 (2 n = 66), and Mecardonia sp. (2 n = 44). The three ploidy levels here reported suggest that polyploidy is common in Mecardonia and appear to be an important factor in the evolution of this genus. The 2 C- and 1 Cx-values were also estimated in all the species. The 2 C-values ranged from 1. 91 to 5. 29 pg. The 1 Cx-values ranged from 0. 88 to 1. 03 pg. The general tendency indicated a decrease in the 1 Cx-value with increasing ploidy level. The significance of the results is discussed in relation to taxonomy of the genus...|$|R

50|$|Fischer (2004) {{considered}} {{the family to}} consist of three subfamilies - Antirrhinoideae, Gratioloideae, and Digitalidoideae.

He then divided the Gratioleae, with its 16 genera (and about 182 species) into three subtribes - Caprarinae, Dopatrinae, and Gratiolinae. The Gratiolinae had 10 genera (about 121 species) distributed through temperate and tropical America - Bacopa and Mecardonia (formerly Herpestis), Amphianthus, <b>Gratiola,</b> Sophronanthe, Benjaminia, Scoparia, Boelkea, Maeviella, and Braunblequetia.

Above them are a pair of slightly larger, floating leaves which are oval in shape and up to 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) long. Flowers occur in the axils of both submerged and floating leaves. Those occurring underwater are cleistogamous and do not open, and those blooming on the water's surface have open five-lobed white corollas a few millimeters long. It is a fast-growing species, germinating immediately with sufficient rain and maturing to flower in 17 days. Its life cycle is quick because appropriate growing conditions occur for only a brief time at these pools.|$|E

40|$|Cachexia is {{a severe}} {{complication}} {{of cancer and}} currently there are no drugs that would effectively deal with exhaustion and intoxication in various diseases. Materials and methods. In this paper a study and evaluation of the antitumor and anticachexia activities of the extract of <b>Gratiola</b> officinalis l. in rats with transplanted sarcoma 45 in experiment in vivo was conducted. <b>Gratiola</b> officinalis l. extract is received by patented method and is not toxic to animals. The study was conducted on 40 white male rats line Wistar weighing 150 ± 50 g. Animals were divided into 4 groups (10 rats per group) : control group, comparison group with sarcoma without affecting, group with sarcoma with intramuscular and group with sarcoma with oral administration of the extract in a dosage of 110 mg/kg. The extract was administered intramuscularly or orally 72 hours after transplantation of sarcoma 45. The tumor volume {{and the weight of}} the animals were assessed daily. Results. The extract of leaves and flowers of <b>Gratiola</b> officinalis l. obtained by patented method has a strong antitumor activity, reducing the growth rate of the tumor and causing marked changes in the tumor, as well as providing stable anticachexia effect. Index of tumor weight inhibition was 70. 6 % on average. Intramuscular administration was more effective in reducing of tumor growth, but less effectively increases the weight of animals than oral administration. In both administration methods <b>Gratiola</b> officinalis extract has no toxic effect on peripheral blood. We have previously found that the extract has antioxidant activity so that anticachexia effect is pathogenic, meaning it occurs by reducing toxicity. Conclusions. <b>Gratiola</b> officinalis extract has a broad spectrum of biological activity, in particular antitumor, anticachexia, it is not toxic, so it is advisable to investigate as a promising tool for the treatment of tumor diseases and cancer cachexia, and cachexia caused by other chronic diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective — Discovery of the apoptosis-inducing {{effects of}} {{flavonoid}} vagonin {{allowed to make}} an assumption of existence of similar effect in others flavonoids. This study {{of the effects of}} extracts from <b>Gratīola</b> officinālis, Helichrýsum arenárium and diploid forms of Zea mays on bone marrow and blood leucocytes at intramuscular and oral administration was carried out on rats bearing sarcoma 45. Earlier, the apoptosis-inducing effects were detected for these extracts but the toxic effects of extracts on blood and bone marrow have not been studied. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of these extracts on white blood cell count and bone marrow morphology. Material and Methods — The experiments were carried out on 48 male Wistar albino rats according to University's Animal Ethics Committee (Protocol № 13, 2011, Saratov, Russia) and the relevant national agency regulating experiments on animals. We evaluated white blood cell count and bone marrow morphology in animals after oral and intramuscular administration of extracts. A growth rate of tumor was also ranked. Results — Oral and intramuscular administration of extracts from flavonoid-containing plants Zea mays and <b>Gratīola</b> officinālis causes normalization of myelocytic germ parameters in bone marrow of tumor-bearing rats and increase of lymphocyte percent in white blood cell count of blood and myelogram. Conclusion — Absence of toxic effects and normalization of myelocytic germ parameters in bone marrow of tumor-bearing rats after oral and intramuscular administration of extracts from flavonoid-containing plants Zea mays and <b>Gratīola</b> officinālis allows to recommend further study of the antitumor effect of these extracts...|$|E
