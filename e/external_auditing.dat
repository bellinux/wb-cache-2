40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether reliance by the external auditors on the internal auditors’ work lead to a reduction in the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> cost and <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> work. Two different questionnaire surveys were sent to 387 head of internal auditors and 142 external auditors of the English local authorities, yielding a response rate of 43. 9 % and 45. 0 % respectively. Findings of the study show that the external auditors in English local authorities perceived that their reliance on internal audit work has no effect on the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> fees or on the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> work. Internal auditors in English local authorities perceived the external auditors’ reliance on their work has no effect on the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> fees but has reduced the extent of the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> work. To conclude, the reliance on internal audit work in the local authorities in England does not have much impact on reducing <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> fees and <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> work.

50|$|Accounting can {{be divided}} into several fields {{including}} financial accounting, management accounting, <b>external</b> <b>auditing,</b> tax accounting and cost accounting. Accounting information systems are designed to support accounting functions and related activities. Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information, including the preparation of financial statements, to external users of the information, such as investors, regulators and suppliers; and management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information for internal use by management. The recording of financial transactions, so that summaries of the financials may be presented in financial reports, is known as bookkeeping, of which double-entry bookkeeping is the most common system.|$|E

50|$|The Federal Reserve Banks conduct ongoing {{internal}} audits of their operations {{to ensure that}} their accounts are accurate and comply with the Federal Reserve System's accounting principles. The banks are also subject to two types of <b>external</b> <b>auditing.</b> Since 1978 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted regular audits of the banks' operations. The GAO audits are reported to the public, but they may not review a bank's monetary policy decisions or disclose them to the public. Since 1999 each bank has also been required to submit to an annual audit by an external accounting firm, which produces a confidential report to the bank and a summary statement for the bank's annual report. Some members of Congress continue to advocate a more public and intrusive GAO audit of the Federal Reserve System, but Federal Reserve representatives support the existing restrictions to prevent political influence over long-range economic decisions.|$|E

It contains a conceptual analysis of trust/confidence, as well as a case study of the professionalization of <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden. The conceptual analysis discusses the “time-binding” aspect of trust/confidence, and the significance of social control mechanisms related to “persons”, “roles”, “values” and “programs” for creating and sustaining trust/confidence. The case study focuses on the role of trust/confidence for the organization and professionalization of <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden, and in particular on the ways in which trust in auditors and auditing have been stabilized. The latter issue is dealt with through a discussion attempting to capture a historic displacement in three dimensions: from reliance on the auditor’spersonal reliability, to trust in the professional role; from trust in the individual discretion of certain persons to trust in the regulation of auditing as a standardized program; and finally, from trust in the values represented by individual auditors to trust in the institutionalized professional values.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that ``horizontal accountability," i. e., a system of governance where auditing functions lie outside the executive branch, can ensure credible disclosure of information. This paper examines a model of intertemporal information provision in government that suggests a cautious approach to that view. Government consists of a succession of regimes, each ruling for one period before relinquishing power to a successor. Without <b>external</b> <b>auditing,</b> credible communication cannot be sustained. Hence, expenditure policies are suboptimal. Even with <b>external</b> <b>auditing,</b> credible communication requires ideological conflicts between the auditor and the regime. Moreover, because information transmission stops when the auditor's and the regime's biases coincide, effective deterrents even in the ``good" periods (when the auditor's and the regime's biases differ) are difficult to construct. As a result, in standard constructions of equilibrium, efficient policy choices are shown to be unsustainabledynastic government, dynamic policy bias, auditor neutrality, credible communication...|$|E
