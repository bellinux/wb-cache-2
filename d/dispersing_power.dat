UV-vis absorbance, {{transmission electron microscopy}} and zeta potential were employed to characterize the dispersion of MWCNTs in the aqueous phase. Among the three surfactants, DPA provided maximum dispersion stability while BPA and HPA provided minimum dispersion stability. We have shown that there exists an optimum weight ratio of surfactant to MWCNT of 1. 5 - 1 for the effective dispersion of MWCNTs. The-potential values of the DPA-nanotube dispersion increased as the DPA concentration increased to reach a maximum value of- 62 mV.

40|$|The {{presence}} of deposits in the honing grooves in diesel engine cylinder liners {{can cause a}} severe increase in the consumption of lubricating oil. These deposits may appear amber in which case they may {{be referred to as}} 'liner lacquerer' or be nearly invisible in which case they are often referred to as 'transparent glaze' or 'bore glaze' in the marine sector. The formation of these deposits is believed to be influenced by engine design, engine load, fuel composition and lubricating oil composition. This relationship has, however, not been well understood and little material has been published on this subject. This thesis describes an investigation of this phenomenon. The problem has been approached by studying the composition of deposit samples, studying cases of deposit formation in the field and through experimental work. As a result of this work, it is hypothesized that the root cause of the deposit formation is a mismatch between the rate of formation of oil insoluble material on or within the oil film and the oil film <b>dispersing</b> <b>power</b> and exchange rate. A large number of parameters will affect this balance which explains the sliding shift in appearance and composition of 'liner lacquer' and 'bore glaze' and the difficulty in identifying the cause of this problem. A combined mass balance and chemical kinetics approach is used {{to bridge the gap between}} fundamental deposit theory and tangible engine related parameters. It is thus possible to rationalize the formation of deposits on cylinder liners. This understanding is sufficient to point out which factors should be considered in terms of the prevention of deposit formation and to present a viable hypothesis on the reason for the deposit formation in the engines that have been investigated in the course of this work as summarized in the following paragraph. The {{presence of}} deposit indicates that the <b>dispersing</b> <b>power</b> and transport rate of the oil film is insufficient to deal with the deposit precursors being formed. This is believed related to extensive low load operation which is associated with both low liner temperatures and low nominal oil consumption in these engines. Low liner temperatures will encourage the formation of insoluble material due to condensation of sulphuric acid precursors, while low oil consumption is believed to indicate low oil film exchange which reduces the transport of matter and also contributes to oil film oxidation by prolonging the exposure to combustion gases. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The Doppler measurements are conducted by monitoring the stellar fringe phase shifts of the interferometer instead of absorption-line centroid shifts as in state-of-the-art echelle spectroscopy. High Doppler sensitivity is achieved through optimizing the optical delay in the interferometer and reducing photon noise by measuring multiple fringes over a broad band. This broadband operation is performed by coupling the interferometer with a low- to medium-resolution postdisperser. The resulting fringing spectra over the bandpass are recorded on a two-dimensional detector, with fringes sampled in the slit spatial direction and the spectrum sampled in the dispersion direction. The resulting total Doppler sensitivity is, in theory, independent of the <b>dispersing</b> <b>power</b> of the postdisperser, which allows {{for the development of}} new-generation RV machines with much reduced size, high stability, and low cost compared to echelles.

Data are presented suggesting that matrix glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) prevent spontaneous tropoelastin aggregation in vivo, at least up to the deamination of lysine residues on tropoelastin by matrix lysyl oxidase. Lysyl oxidase inhibitors beta- aminopropionitrile, aminoacetonitrile, semicarbazide, and isonicotinic acid hydrazide were given to newborn chicks, to chick embryos, and to newborn rats, and the ultrastructural alterations of the aortic elastic fibers were analyzed and compared with {{the extent of the}} enzyme inhibition. When inhibition was greater than 65 % all chemicals induced alterations of elastic fibers in the form of lateral aggregates of elastin, which were always permeated by cytochemically and immunologically recognizable GAGs. The number and size of the abnormal elastin/GAGs aggregates were proportional to the extent of lysyl oxidase inhibition. The phenomenon was independent of the animal species. All data suggest that, upon inhibition of lysyl oxidase, matrix GAGs remain among elastin molecules during fibrogenesis by binding to positively charged amino groups on elastin. Newly synthesized and secreted tropoelastin has the highest number of free epsilon amino groups, and, therefore, the highest capability of binding to GAGs.

Likewise, it has been noted that the SWCNT solutions with low enough zeta potentials exhibit higher sheet resistance after making CNT-PET films due to the damage to SWCNTs caused by high dispersion force. Since the spray coating of SWCNT solution gives the SWCNT-SDS composite layer on PET film after drying, the excess SDS should be washed off.

40|$|AbstractThe physico-chemical {{properties}} of short-chain phosphatidylcholine are reviewed {{to the extent}} that its biological activity as a mild detergent can be rationalized. Long-chain diacylphosphatidylcholines are typical membrane phospholipids that form preferentially smectic lamellar phases (bilayers) when dispersed in water. In contrast, the preferred phase of the short-chain analogues dispersed in excess water is the micellar phase. The preferred conformation and the dynamics of short-chain phosphatidylcholines in the monomeric and micellar state present in H 2 O are discussed. The motionally averaged conformation of short-chain phosphatidylcholines is then compared to the single-crystal structures of membrane lipids. The main conclusion emerging is that in terms of preferred conformation and motional averaging short-chain phosphatidylcholines closely resemble their long-chain analogues. The <b>dispersing</b> <b>power</b> of short-chain phospholipids is emphasized {{in the second part of}} the review. Evidence is presented to show that this class of compounds is superior to most other detergents used in the solubilization of membrane proteins and the reconstitution of the solubilized proteins to artificial membrane systems (proteoliposomes). The prominent feature of the solubilization/reconstitution of integral membrane proteins by short-chain PC is the retention of the native protein structure and hence the protein function. Due to their special detergent-like properties, short-chain PC lend themselves very well not only to membrane solubilization but also to the purification of integral membrane proteins. The retention of the native protein structure in the solubilized state, i. e. in mixed micelles consisting of the integral membrane protein, intrinsic membrane lipids and short-chain PC, is rationalized. It is hypothesized that short-chain PC interacts primarily with the lipid bilayer of a membrane and very little if at all with the membrane proteins. In this way, the membrane protein remains associated with its preferred intrinsic membrane lipids and retains its native structure and its function...|$|E

The major finding of the research is that the <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> structure (e. g. coalition, minority, divided governments) was a hitherto unnoticed significant political factor behind the transformation of fragmented, indirect, and weak welfare benefits into universal, direct, and generous ones. Unlike the conventional approach using welfare expenditure data in analysing welfare politics, the project examined possible relations between the changes in power structure and the legislative activities of major political actors using the whole universe of billsâroughly 50, 000 in totalâin three nations {{during the past two}} decades. Among others, the research focused on how dimensions such as the number, the success ratio, or the primary political sponsors have changed along with the different levels of power dispersion/concentration applying regression analyses. Moreover, the key analysis includes both orthodox and unorthodox social policies and applies multiple methods (e. g. social network analysis, media content analysis, or theory-informed narratives) to verify/triangulate/fine-tune findings from the legislation patterns. The result suggests that when bargaining among a number of parties/politicians prevailed, welfare policy tended to be premised on the lowest common denominatorâthe median voters such as consumers, women, labourers who often were unorganized and not geographically concentrated. As a result, the <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> structure went hand in hand with a loose but broad issue coalitionâfor specific welfare expansionsâamong academia, civil society, bureaucrats, and politicians irrespective of their ideology.

40|$|Conventional single-molecule {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy {{is limited}} in temporal resolution {{by the need to}} collect enough photons to measure a spectrum, in frequency resolution by the <b>dispersing</b> <b>power</b> of the spectrometer, and by environmental conditions by the need to immobilize the chromophore on a substrate. In this thesis, we use the recently developed technique of photon-correlation Fourier spectroscopy (PCFS) to circumvent each of these limitations. PCFS combines the high temporal resolution of photon correlation measurements with the high frequency resolution of Fourier spectroscopy. The experimental setup consists of a Michelson interferometer where the two outputs are detected with avalanche photodiodes and cross-correlated with a hardware autocorrelator card. The interferometer maps spectral changes into intensity changes which can be measured with high temporal resolution by the autocorrelator. The distribution of spectral changes between photons with a given temporal separation determines the degree of correlation in the interferogram. By measuring the intensity correlation at different interferometer positions while dithering one mirror, a time dependent spectral correlation function is obtained. From this, we learn about the temporal evolution of the emission line shape at timescales approaching the lifetime of the emitter. In this body of work, we both apply PCFS to study low temperature colloidal quantum dots and extend the technique to extract spectral lineshapes and dynamics of single quantum dots freely diffusing in solution. In solution, spectral correlations originating from the same quantum dot are statistically enhanced and separable from the ensemble using intensity fluctuations from diffusion. We are able to use spectral correlations from many diffusing chromophores to determine the average single chromophore spectral correlation. This thesis begins with a review of spectral dynamics in quantum dots in Chapter 1. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the theoretical and experimental implementation of PCFS. Chapters 4 and 5 cover numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations of the extension of PCFS to single quantum dots obscured by an ensemble in solution.

It means that the energy reduction of the refrigeration section greatly contributes to energy conservation of supermarket. Most of the energy consumption apparatus of the refrigeration section of the supermarket are refrigerated cabinets and its power consumption highly depended on the indoor air enthalpy and the outside air temperature. When we are going to introduce <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> into a certain facility, the biggest problem that should be solved is annual utilization rate increase in exhaust heat. Because the annual utilization rate increment of the exhaust heat was not guaranteed by using only to heating, we built the demonstration supermarket which equipped environmental friendly <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> (gas engine, solar cell, solar heat), and utilized this supermarket for waste heat helpful use. In this study, we tried to increment the condenser exit supercooling of the refrigerated cabinet which had had the biggest energy consumption in a supermarket and, validated its energy conservation effect and carbon dioxide emission reduction one. The cold temperature that used for supercooling was manufactured by adsorption type refrigerator. The energy conservation effect of supercooling is about from 10 to 25 % during the summertime and intermediate time. However there is no effect of supercooling in the winter because the outside temperature is low. At last we found that when the outside temperature is about 15 ? or more, supercooling effect appears. In addition, since energy consumption of the refrigerated cabinet is influenced by the indoor enthalpy, we adjusted the indoor air temperature and humidity by introducing the desiccant system and validated its effect...|$|R

The main highlights of applying high penetration level solar panels are to provide the electrical power for the remote areas. Considering this concept instead of designing and building transmission lines would decrease the power loss throughout the entire power electrical system and increase the overall reliability and stability of the system theoretically. However, <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> generation may cause significant voltage regulation and stability problems into the power system. This project demonstrates a typical structure of solar-connected network and analyzes the operation and functionality of PV system comparing the single penetration and dispersed penetration upon the simulation model. The simulation would be analyzed with different cases which are different penetration levels containing PQ and PV control types of generations. The load flow of this system would be analyzed to find the optimal point of voltage quality and stability. At the end the tables are provided to make conclusions about advantages of <b>dispersed</b> PV <b>power</b> generation. The tested power system in this project is modeled by ETAP software which is a perfect package for power system and load flow studies...|$|R

This paper proposes a computational tool to assess the optimal DG size and deployment {{for more than one}} unit, taking the minimum losses and voltage profile as objective functions. A technique called radial basis function (RBF) neural network has been utilized for such target. The method is only depending on the training process; so it is simple in terms of algorithm and structure and it has fast computational speed and high accuracy; therefore it is flexible and reliable to be tested in different target scenarios. The proposed method is designed to find the best solution of multi- DG sizing and deployment in 33 -bus IEEE distribution system and create the suitable topology of the system in the presence of DG. Some important results for DG deployment and discussion are involved to show the effectiveness of our proposed method...|$|R
