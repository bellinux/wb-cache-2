500|$|Iyall {{released}} a solo album entitled Strange Language with former band members Bossi and Smith in 1986. Afterward she pursued {{a career as}} an art teacher. The band reunited briefly for a live performance in 1993. In 2004, Romeo Void was featured on an episode of VH1's Bands Reunited. Bossi had sustained too much hearing damage {{over the years and}} was unable to perform, although he did meet up with the band again and observed the reunion performance in an adjacent room. Iyall has continued to dabble in music related projects and events. [...] "I still like to sing and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to perform," [...] she said. In 2003 she was involved in a musical project called Knife in Water. She began collaborating with Peter Dunne, who was known as Peter [...] when he played guitar for Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Iyall and Dunne performed at a support benefit for Crawdaddy! founder Paul Williams in June 2009, and performed at a concert honoring 415 Records later that September. They {{released a}}n album entitled Stay Strong in 2010.|$|E
500|$|McCartney played lead guitar {{on several}} Beatles recordings, {{including}} what MacDonald {{described as a}} [...] "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" [...] on [...] "Drive My Car", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino. McCartney said of the instrument, [...] "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this." [...] He contributed what MacDonald described as [...] "a startling guitar solo" [...] on the Harrison composition [...] "Taxman" [...] and the [...] "shrieking" [...] guitar on [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" [...] and [...] "Helter Skelter". MacDonald also praised McCartney's [...] "coruscating pseudo-Indian" [...] guitar solo on [...] "Good Morning Good Morning". McCartney also played lead guitar on [...] "Another Girl". While in Wings, McCartney tended to leave electric guitar work to other group members, though he played most of the lead guitar on Band on the Run. In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and David Gilmour, stating, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> Hendrix the best". He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live performances.|$|E
2500|$|As a Harrison solo performance, [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] shared {{common ground}} with the Dylan-styled [...] "Apple Scruffs", a track from All Things Must Pass that was then issued as a 1971 B-side. Asked at his pre-tour press conference on 23 October 1974 whether he planned to perform any songs solo in the {{upcoming}} concerts, Harrison replied: [...] "I hope not. I'd like to do some acoustic tunes, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> a little back-beat." [...] Harrison's vocal affliction was evident in his singing throughout the subsequent tour, which the press began calling [...] "the Dark Hoarse Tour".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2013 Salmon {{recalled}} [...] "a {{whole lot}} of what I do is tied up in my past. The Scientists, The Beasts of Bourbon, The Surrealists. This is great, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to make new stuff. I've kept my sanity {{over the years by}} doing new stuff and waiting for it to become old enough to be revived". He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd's Bush, which was issued as a live album, Sedition in the following year.|$|E

6000|$|... "I will, with pleasure; but I read few modern novels, so I {{may not be}} a good judge there. Most of {{them seem}} very poor stuff, and I cannot waste time even to skim them as some people do. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> the old-fashioned ones I read as a girl, though you would laugh at them. Did any of you ever read 'Thaddeus of Warsaw'?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Marcucci {{then gave}} Fabian a song written by Mort Shuman and Doc Pomus, [...] "I'm a Man", which Fabian later said he [...] "liked {{a lot and}} was very {{comfortable}} with, was giving me more experience, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> felt <b>like</b> a fish out of water." [...] The song made the top 40.|$|R
5000|$|Jonas {{opened up}} to Entertainment Weekly about the {{prospect}} of re-releasing the album with some additional tracks. He revealed, [...] "I feel like the next step is just going to be getting a collection of a few more songs and maybe repackaging the album. ... <b>I</b> <b>still</b> feel <b>like</b> there’s some life left on the record I released last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|Very {{carefully}} Peter {{walked around}} the little bunch of leaves and peered under them from the other side. There, sure enough, was a nest beneath them, and in it four speckled eggs. [...] "I won't tell a soul, Teacher. I promise you I won't tell a soul," [...] declared Peter very earnestly. [...] "I understand now why you are called Oven Bird, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> the name Teacher best." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{frivolous}} ingenuity which wasted {{itself in}} this exercise happily {{could not hold}} out long, and in verse it was pretty well helpless from the beginning. Yet I will not altogether blame it, for it made me know, as nothing else could, the resources of our tongue in that sort; and in the revolt from the slavish bondage I took upon myself I did not {{go so far as}} to plunge into any very wild polysyllabic excesses. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> the little word if it says the thing I want to say as well as the big one, but I honor above all the word that says the thing. At the same time I confess that I have a prejudice against certain words that I cannot overcome; the sight of some offends me, the sound of others, and rather than use one of those detested vocables, even when I perceive that it would convey my exact meaning, I would cast about long for some other. I think this is a foible, and a disadvantage, but I do not deny it.|$|E
60|$|I {{imagine that}} my early {{likes and dislikes}} in Dickens were not very discriminating. I liked 'David Copperfield,' and 'Barnaby Rudge,' and 'Bleak House,' and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> them; but I do not think I liked them more than 'Dombey & Son,' and 'Nicholas Nickleby,' and the 'Pickwick Papers,' which I cannot read now with any sort of patience, {{not to speak of}} pleasure. I liked 'Martin Chuzzlewit,' too, and the other day I read a great part of it again, and found it roughly true in the {{passages}} that referred to America, though it was surcharged in the serious moods, and caricatured in the comic. The English are always inadequate observers; they seem too full of themselves to have eyes and ears for any alien people; but as far as an Englishman could, Dickens had caught the look of our life in certain aspects. His report of it was clumsy and farcical; but in a large, loose way it was like enough; at least he had caught the note of our self-satisfied, intolerant, and hypocritical provinciality, and this was not altogether lost in his mocking horse-play.|$|E

I’m having healthy diet…I had talked with my wife a couple of times during this half year. From my side, <b>I</b> think…I’d <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to, to have a child, somehow.” (Spoken in English by M 4) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Eldritch {{later said}} about the album: [...] "The Sisterhood album was a weapon in this {{corporate}} war. That's why I called it Gift. German: poison ... But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> the record. It's weird but it's fine." [...] "I {{see it as a}} techno record. Or what I thought to be techno at the time." ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 2005 {{interview}} with Record Collector magazine's Nick Dalton, Harley {{spoke of his}} current musical style: [...] "Anytime! is seriously unplugged electro-acoustic. It's similar to original Cockney Rebel - violin, no electric guitar. But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> playing with my electric band. I'm doing Glastonbury again, headlining the acoustic stage for the first time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the song's theme, Jackson {{said that}} the title [...] "just sounded like {{the perfect way to}} say that I’m aware of all the modern {{technology}} and do adapt to some of it, and the health — better eating and diet policies — but every now and then, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> that bologna on white bread." ...|$|E

60|$|I was {{so shocked}} by the {{contents}} of this heart-rending letter, that I ran off directly towards the little hotel {{with the intention of}} taking it on my way to Doctor Strong's, and trying to soothe Mr. Micawber with a word of comfort. But, half-way there, I met the London coach with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber up behind; Mr. Micawber, the very picture of tranquil enjoyment, smiling at Mrs. Micawber's conversation, eating walnuts out of a paper bag, with a bottle sticking out of his breast pocket. As they did not see me, I thought it best, all things considered, not to see them. So, with a great weight taken off my mind, I turned into a by-street that was the nearest way to school, and felt, upon the whole, relieved that they were gone; though <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>liked</b> them very much, nevertheless.|$|R
60|$|I {{will take}} him to this gentleman on Monday, and arrange for his going there every day; but, if you will not object, <b>I</b> should <b>still</b> <b>like</b> him to remain with you, {{and to have the}} {{advantage}} of preparing these annoying verses under your eye until the holidays. That Mr. Cookesley may have his own way thoroughly, I will send Charley to Mr. Hardisty daily until the school at Eton recommences.|$|R
5000|$|In Puerto Rico he {{is known}} as [...] "Igor", the {{nickname}} he has carried {{since he was a}} nine-year-old fascinated by the professional wrestler [...] "Igor the Magnificent.""I watched wrestling all the time and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> it", Gonzalez said. [...] "One day when I was nine, I told another guy, 'I'm Igor.' And he said,'Okay, your name is Igor from now on.' And I've been Igor since then." ...|$|E
5000|$|CNN's Paul Tatara stated: [...] "Crystal is Crystal throughout, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> him for it. Muresan, on {{the other}} hand, is sweet but, shall we say, a limited performer. He also speaks as if he's storing {{potatoes}} in his cheeks for the oncoming Romanian winter. He's not any good, but, then again, Harrison Ford would {{be hard pressed to}} pretend that he's 7-foot-7. [...] "My Giant" [...] would probably play better to children. There's an itty-bitty bit of swearing. Beware of sugar comas." ...|$|E
5000|$|Actor Gary Lockwood, {{who also}} acted in the film, felt that [...] "Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, {{because you had}} this {{beautiful}} girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her." [...] Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). [...] "It's terribly touching to me. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> it when I see it," [...] writes Kazan. [...] "And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly." ...|$|E
5000|$|Finally, I got {{out from}} the {{drainage}} pipe which I could never escape all by myself. I feel really really lucky that <b>I</b> am <b>still</b> alive <b>like</b> {{all the other people}} who came out from any catastrophes! ...|$|R

5000|$|Death, death! Now it's all I dream about. Dying {{and going}} to {{wherever}} villainy isn't the prevailing custom, where affirmations and negations at least carry the philosophical sense that lexicons assign to them, where honor starts at the soul instead of the lips. Dying, getting out of here, for dignity's sake, for art's sake, {{for the sake of}} self-preservation! <b>I</b> <b>still</b> feel <b>like</b> the healthy one {{in the middle of this}} leper colony! ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the British newspaper column [...] "Hugs and Kisses 23" [...] Baio said, in reply to the question 'what his favorite album of all time was', [...] "Queen's, Classic Queen. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> it. It could be Greatest Hits. It's the one with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' on it. They were selling it on MTV with an ad trailer featuring the guys from Wayne's World singing along to it in the car. I was maybe seven, and I was like, I really like that song, so I'll get that album." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dalton Brown is most {{interested}} in the evocative qualities of a subject and its personal associations {{as seen in the}} paintings Grand Westfield Porch, 1980 and My Westfield Window, 1980, and the pastels Retreat Grasses, 1990, and Aurora, Six Columns, 1991. Expressing mood, attitude, and ideas are key to understanding the meaning of her work: [...] "The visual tension between controlled, linear, constructed elements and textured, disordered, active areas has always intrigued me. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to compose my images with these contrasts which I think have symbolic implications as well as visual interest and compositional strength." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lisa Macklem from Spoiler TV {{said that}} she enjoyed the flashbacks and that they episode had some really great plot twists and turns."Once again, most of the {{character}} revelations felt natural, and I think this speaks once again to the extensive preparation that went into crafting this world. The stories may not always unfold with no plot holes, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> feel <b>like</b> patience with the unfolding of the characters’ stories has been rewarded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Master. That is {{unless you}} should desire that I {{accompany}} you somewhere else instead, by sea southward for instance. If so, I {{do not know}} that I would refuse, since Ethiopia will not run away and there is much of the world that <b>I</b> should <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to visit. Only then there is Karema to be thought about, who expects, or, when she learns all, soon will expect, to be a queen," [...] he added doubtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{nice and}} old-fashioned," [...] said Fleur calmly. [...] "You're frightfully silent, Jon. <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> silence when it's swift." [...] She let go his hand. [...] "Did you think I dropped my {{handkerchief}} on purpose?" ...|$|R
