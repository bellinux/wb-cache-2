5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't <b>It</b> <b>Cool</b> News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E

The film declined by 63% in its second week. Batman & Robin faced early competition with Face/Off and Hercules. Schumacher blamed it on yellow journalism started by Harry Knowles of Ain't <b>It</b> <b>Cool</b> News and other film websites such as Dark Horizons. The film went on to gross $107.3 million in North America and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million. Warner Bros. acknowledged Batman & Robins shortcomings in the domestic market but pointed out success overseas.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does <b>it</b> <b>cool</b> upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E
