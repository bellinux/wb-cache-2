40|$|Popularity based {{search engines}} have served to stagnate {{information}} retrieval from the web. Developed {{to deal with}} the very real problem of degrading quality within keyword based search they have had the unintended side effect of creating “icebergs ” around topics, where only a small minority of the information is above the popularity waterline. This problem is especially pronounced with emerging information–new sites are often hidden until they become popular enough to be considered above the water-line. In domains new to a user this is often helpful–they can focus on popular sites first. Unfortunately it is not the best tool for a professional seeking to keep up-to-date with a topic as it emerges and evolves. We present a tool focused on this audience–a system that addresses the very large scale information gathering, filtering and routing, and presentation problems associated with creating a useful incremental stream of information from the web as a whole. Utilizing the WebFountain platform as the primary data engine and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) as the delivery mechanism, our “Daily Deltas ” (Delta) application is able to provide an informative feed of relevant content directly to a user. Individuals receive a personalized, <b>incremental</b> <b>feed</b> of pages related to their topic allowing them to track their interests independent of the overall popularity of the topic...|$|E
40|$|A robust polymer based and polyol {{mediated}} {{procedure to}} synthesize nanobimetallic particles has been modified to produce core–shell and alloy Ag/Pt nanoparticles with tunable properties. Novel three-dimensional (3 D) quasi nanocubes entangled in nanowebs were produced by rapid solution phase transformation with hot addition of absolute ethanol. The optical characterization showed extinction of plasmon resonance band occurring with <b>incremental</b> <b>feeding</b> ratio of Pt source in all cases. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high resolution {{transmission electron microscope}} (HRTEM) images revealed that the shape, size and size distribution of asprepared silver platinum nanoparticles depended on the stabilizer or capping agent, mole ratio of metal ion sources, temperature and time of reaction. Meanwhile, catalytic activity was highest in the reduction of p-nitrophenol {{in the presence of}} polyvinylpyrrolidone/diethylene glycol stabilized Ag/Pt nanoparticles...|$|R

(Electrical And Electronic Engineering) This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a system of Artificial Neural Networks that enables the <b>incremental</b> training of <b>feed</b> forward neural networks using supervised training algorithms such as back propagation. It is argued that incremental learning is fundamental to the adaptive learning behavior observed in human intelligence and constitutes an imperative step towards artificial cognition. The importance of developing incremental learning as a system of ANNs is stressed before the complete system is presented. Details of {{the development and implementation of}} the system is complemented by the description of two case studies. In conclusion the role of the incremental learning system as basis for further development of fundamental elements of cognition is projected...|$|R
40|$|Ground Flaxseed (Linum uitatissimum) is a lipid {{supplement}} that {{is commonly}} fed to dairy cows. It {{is believed that}} supplemental lipid can change the Fatty Acid (FA) composition in the milk, and decrease methane production. Twenty lactating organic Jersey cows, housed at the UNH Organic Dairy Research Farm (ODRF), {{were randomly assigned to}} five replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares to investigate the effects of increasing dietary levels of ground flaxseed (0, 5, 10, or 15 % of the diet dry matter) on animal fperformance (e. g., dry matter intake, milk production, milk composition), ruminal metabolism, and enteric methane emissions. Each period lasted 21 days with 14 days for diet adaptation and seven days for data and samples collection. Cows were fed twice daily (a. m. and p. m.) a total mixed ration containing 65 % grass-legume baleage, and one of the following supplemental mixturess: 0 % ground flaxseed, 27 % corn meal, and 8 % soybean meal 5 % ground flaxeed, 24 % corn meal, and 6 % soybean meal 10 % ground flaxseed, 21 % corn meal, and 4 % soybean meal 15 % ground flaxseed, 17. 5 corn meal, and 2. 5 % soybean meal. <b>Feeding</b> <b>incremental</b> dietary levels of ground flaxseed resulted in linear decreases of dry matter intake, yields of milk and milk components, ruminal molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, and enteric methane emissions. However, the molar proportion of propionate increased linearly with <b>feeding</b> <b>incremental</b> dietary levels of ground flaxseed. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of ground flaxseed on milk yield and animal health...|$|R
40|$|Background In the UK, 1 – 2 % {{of infants}} are born very preterm (< 32 weeks of gestation) or have very {{low birth weight}} (< 1500 g). Very preterm infants are {{initially}} unable to be fed nutritional volumes of milk and therefore require intravenous nutrition. Milk feeding strategies influence several long and short term health outcomes including growth, survival, infection (associated with intravenous nutrition) and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC); with both infection and NEC being key predictive factors of long term disability. Currently there is no consistent strategy for feeding preterm infants across the UK. The SIFT trial will test two speeds of increasing milk feeds with the primary aim of determining effects on survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months of age, corrected for prematurity. The trial will also examine many secondary outcomes including infection, NEC, time taken to reach full feeds and growth. Methods/design Two thousand eight hundred very preterm or very low birth weight infants will be recruited from approximately 30 hospitals across the UK to a randomised controlled trial. Infants with severe congenital anomaly or no realistic chance of survival will be excluded. Infants will be randomly allocated to either a faster (30 ml/kg/day) or slower (18 ml/kg/day) rate of increase in milk feeds. Data will be collected during the neonatal hospital stay on weight, infection rates, episodes of NEC, length of stay and time to reach full milk feeds. Long term health outcomes comprising vision, hearing, motor and cognitive impairment will be assessed at 24 months of age (corrected for prematurity) using a parent report questionnaire. Discussion Extensive searches have found no active or proposed studies investigating the rate of increasing milk feeds. The results of this trial will have importance for optimising <b>incremental</b> milk <b>feeding</b> for very preterm and/or very low birth weight infants. No additional resources {{will be required to}} implement an optimal feeding strategy, and therefore if successful, the trial results could rapidly be adopted across the NHS at low cost.

40|$|AbstractAgri-food {{industries}} such as chicken {{meat production}} face increasing pressure to quantify and improve their environmental performance over time, while simultaneously increasing production to meet global demand. Using life cycle assessment, this study aimed to quantify resource use, environmental impacts and hotspots for Australian chicken meat production using updated inventories and new methods. Two contrasting states; Queensland, and South Australia, and two housing systems; conventional and free range were analysed to indicate the variation expected between regions and systems. Lower impacts were observed per kilogram of chicken meat produced in South Australia compared to Queensland for fossil fuel energy, greenhouse gas (including land use and direct land use change) and fresh water consumption (18. 1 and 21. 4  MJ, 2. 8 and 3. 4  kg CO 2 -e, 38 and 111  L respectively), but not arable land or stress weighted water use (22. 5 and 14  m 2, 36 and 26  L H 2 O-e respectively). Feed production was the largest contributor to all impact categories, and also showed the largest variation between regions, highlighting the importance of spatially specific feed grain datasets to determine resource use and greenhouse gas from chicken meat production. While the feed conversion ratio was lower in South Australia, this {{was found to be}} less significant than differences related to crop yield, irrigation water use and the use of imported feed ingredients, suggesting that <b>incremental</b> improvements in <b>feed</b> conversion ratio will result in lower impacts only when feed inputs and production systems do not change. Fresh water consumption was lower in South Australia, but did not correlate with stress weighed water use (lower in Queensland), highlighting that volumetric water use is not a reliable indicator of the impact of water use. We did not observe substantial differences between conventional and free range production when feed related differences were removed, because key productivity factors such as feed conversion ratio were similar between the two housing types in Australia. While results were found to vary between regions, total greenhouse gas emissions were low from these Australian supply chains, and resource use was moderate. Expansion of the study to include additional regions and impact categories is recommended in future benchmarking studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of incremental amounts of Ascophyllum nodosum meal (ANOD) on milk production, milk composition including fatty acids and I, blood metabolites, and nutrient intake and digestibility in early lactation dairy cows fed high-forage diets. Twelve multiparous Jersey cows averaging (mean ± standard deviation) 40 ± 21 d in milk and 464 ± 35 kg of body weight and 4 primiparous Jersey cows averaging 75 ± 37 d in milk and 384 ± 17 kg of body weight were randomly assigned to treatment sequences in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each period lasted 21 d with 14 d for diet adaptation and 7 d for data and sample collection. Cows were fed a total mixed ration (64 : 36 forage-to-concentrate ratio) supplemented (as fed) with 0, 57, 113, or 170 g/d of ANOD. Milk yield as well as concentrations and yields of milk components (fat, protein, lactose, milk urea N) were not affected by increasing dietary amounts of ANOD. Concentration (from 178 to 1, 370 µg/L) and yield (from 2. 8 to 20. 6 mg/d) of milk I increased linearly in cows fed incremental amounts of ANOD as a result of the high concentration of I (820 mg/kg of dry matter) in ANOD. Overall, only minor changes were observed in the proportion of milk fatty acids with ANOD supplementation. Quadratic trends were observed for dry matter intake and total-tract digestibilities of organic matter and neutral detergent fiber, whereas negative linear trends were observed for serum concentration of cortisol and crude protein digestibility with ANOD supplementation. Serum concentrations of triiodothyronine and thyroxine were not affected by ANOD supplementation and averaged 1. 1 and 48. 4 ng/mL, respectively. However, feeding increasing amounts of ANOD linearly reduced the plasma concentration of nonesterified fatty acids (from 164 to 132 mEq/L). Quadratic effects were found for the total-tract digestibility of ADF and urinary output of purine derivatives, suggesting that ANOD supplementation may stimulate growth of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in a dose-dependent fashion. In general, <b>feeding</b> <b>incremental</b> amounts of ANOD to early lactation dairy cows dramatically increased milk I concentration and output with no effect on animal performance...|$|R
