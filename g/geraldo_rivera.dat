500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} U.S. {{to go into}} rehabilitation, the media showed him little sympathy.

A Daily Express headline read, [...] "Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run", while a News of the World headline accused Jackson of being a fugitive. These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have cosmetic surgery {{that would make him}} unrecognizable on his return. <b>Geraldo</b> <b>Rivera</b> set up a mock trial, with a jury made up of audience members, even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{appeared}} as a correspondent on The Daily Show between 1997 and 2005. During this time, the comedian developed the character that would later {{form the basis for}} his Colbert Report persona, one that its creator calls a [...] "fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool". Colbert frequently cites Stone Phillips — whom he describes as having [...] "the greatest neck in journalism" [...] — as a source of inspiration for the character, as well as <b>Geraldo</b> <b>Rivera,</b> [...] "because he's got this great sense of mission... He just thinks he's gonna change the world with this report". As a correspondent, Colbert was regularly pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, fellow correspondent Steve Carell, or host Jon Stewart in scripted exchanges which typically revealed the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he was discussing. Other Daily Show correspondents have since adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{began taking}} painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the {{allegations}}. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson stopped eating.

Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The media showed Jackson little sympathy. In 1993, The Daily Mirror held a [...] "Spot the Jacko" [...] contest, offering readers a trip to Disney World if they could correctly predict where Jackson would appear next. The same year, a Daily Express headline read [...] "Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run", while a News of the World headline accused Jackson of being a fugitive; these tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had travelled to Europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognisable on his return. In early November 1993, talk show host <b>Geraldo</b> <b>Rivera</b> set up a mock trial with a jury of audience members, though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.|$|E
500|$|When Lennon {{was invited}} to play with Frank Zappa at the Fillmore (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them. Later that year, she {{released}} Fly, a double album.

[...] She also received minor airplay with the ballad [...] "Mrs. Lennon". [...] The track [...] "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" [...] was an ode to Ono's missing daughter, and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. That same year, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Majorca, Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from his hotel. Accusations flew between the two, as well as the matter of custody. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko; Ono would not see her daughter until 1998. It was during this time that she wrote [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko", which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album Live Peace in Toronto 1969, in addition to Fly. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of [...] "Happy Christmas (War Is Over)" [...] when Yoko whispers [...] "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, [...] "Happy Christmas, Julian." [...] The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, [...] "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" [...] has since become a Christmas standard. That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in Madison Square Garden with Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, and Sha Na Na for mentally handicapped children organized by WABC-TV's <b>Geraldo</b> <b>Rivera.</b>|$|E
