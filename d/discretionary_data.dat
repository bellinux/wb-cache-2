40|$|The {{ability to}} use data to improve student {{learning}} {{is one of the}} contentious aims of current education policy. This paper uses a distributed leadership framework and social network analysis to introduce two approaches the design of school information system: Prescriptive data systems designed to give teachers answers to instructional questions; and <b>discretionary</b> <b>data</b> systems are designed to help teachers ask the right questions about instruction. While each of these approaches has been used for using data to improve student learning, each approach is build on radically different assumptions about who should make decisions about assessment, teaching and learning. A distributed leadership perspective can be used to reveal how leaders create and assemble artifacts to influence patterns of professional interaction in schools (Halverson, 2003; Spillane, Diamond, & Jita, 2003 l Goldstein, 2004; Scribner, et. al. 2007; Halverson, et. al. 2007). In each of these case-based examples, the intentional relation of structures to action implies that power must be used to compel, either through mandate or persuasion, school professional to interact in intended ways. Discussion of how school leaders use power have tended to focus on how power is misused – from creating coercive institutional systems to outright interpersona...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{association}} between the level of compliance of Australian listed companies with Australian corporate governance principles, in aggregate, {{and the level of}} discretionary accruals using the modified Jones model. It is hypothesised that higher levels of compliance would be associated with lower levels of <b>discretionary</b> accruals. <b>Data</b> from a random sample of 214 Australian listed companies for the years 2009 and 2010 were used to test the hypothesis. The results demonstrate a significant negative relationship indicating that companies with higher levels of compliance engage in lower levels of earnings management via discretionary accruals...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{hospital}} admission rates across small areas are ubiquitous, {{and it is}} increasingly assumed that high rates result from physicians' <b>discretionary</b> decisions. <b>Data</b> for elderly patients from the health insurance system of Manitoba were used to construct an index that divided physicians into four groups based on their propensity to admit patients to the hospital. I then determined whether physicians who {{are more prone to}} admit patients use hospitals for more discretionary purposes and admit patients who are less ill. Although the differences between physicians with different practice styles were in the expected direction, the most compelling finding was the similarity in characteristics of patients admitted by physicians with markedly different practice styles. Such findings suggest a very wide latitude in physicians' decisions to admit patients; this latitude is not well captured by a model that posits a logical relationship between physician treatment patterns and patient need...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} two {{important}} characteristics of board effectiveness: (1) {{the proportion of}} independent non-executive directors; and (2) CEO Duality. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine whether the presence of a majority of independent non-executive directors and the separation role between chairman and CEO, as recommended in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) 2000, effectively constrains the incidence of earnings management as measured by income-increasing and income-decreasing <b>discretionary</b> accruals. Using <b>data</b> from the top 200 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia’s Main Board and Second Board for the year 2004, this study finds a positive significant result of board independence when firms undershoot target earnings. Although contradictory to the prediction of agency theory, the results show that a higher proportion of independent non-executive director...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{a structural}} model of strategic trader behavior that {{sheds light on}} the determinants of trading volume and stock returns. Our novel identification approach exploits enormous empirical variation in trading and volatility associated with {{the time of day}} and public news arrival. Over 95 % of trading occurs during regular market hours (9 : 30 am to 4 pm), even though prices exhibit considerable volatility during extended hours, especially when news arrives. For the model to explain the <b>data,</b> <b>discretionary</b> liquidity trading must constitute the bulk of trading volume and must increase significantly after news arrives. However, from 2001 to 2010, informed trading increasingly contributes to volume and stock price discovery because our estimate of the cost of acquiring private information falls by a factor of 12 in this decade...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a small New-Keynesian {{model with}} imperfect information and optimal <b>discretionary</b> policy using <b>data</b> for the euro area. The model {{is used to}} assess the usefulness of monetary aggregates and unit labour costs as information variables for monetary policy. The estimates reveal that the information content of the M 3 monetary aggregate is limited. A more useful role emerges for the unit labour cost indicator, which contains information on potential output that helps to reduce the volatility of the output gap. Finally, the estimated weights for the objectives of monetary policy show that considerable importance is attributed to interest-rate smoothing, greater than to output gap stabilization. This finding indicates that the welfare gains of commitment may be smaller than suggested by typical parametrizations of New-Keynesian models. monetary policy, Kalman filter, inflation, output gap...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{managers}} manipulate accruals to {{help their}} firms emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization. Chapter 11 reorganization provides a very strong incentive: managers will lose their jobs or even their career if the firms are liquidated. Also, they often own shares of their firms, In most cases, they will receive some new shares of reorganized firms but nothing in liquidation. I argue that since the earnings test {{is one of the}} most common tests used in deciding whether a reorganization plan is confirmed, managers have incentives to take a "big bath" at the filing of Chapter 11 and inflate the earnings when the firms try to have their plan confirmed and to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The empirical results support the hypotheses. I find significant negative abnormal accruals in the year of filing Chapter 11 and the years of operating under Chapter 11. Both the discretionary operating accruals and the discretionary total accruals are positive in the year before the confirmation of the reorganization plan. However, only the discretionary operating accruals are significant. The evidence also shows that there is a relationship between the discretionary accruals and managers' ownership. Key Words: Bankruptcy, Chapter 11 reorganization, Earnings management, <b>Discretionary</b> accruals. <b>Data</b> Availability: Data are available from sources identified in the paper.

40|$|The recent {{revelation of}} the {{misleading}} audited accounts of several big companies in the US has heightened public concern about the integrity of a firm’s financial reporting processes. The management of the accounts {{is commonly known as}} accrual management as it is effectively accomplished through manipulation of discretionary accruals. A firm’s internal corporate governance systems should be able to constrain the extent of earnings being managed. To this end, this paper investigates one important aspect of the internal corporate governance, namely the independence {{of the board of directors}} and the audit committee. It is argued that the extent to which the board and the audit committee are independent of management determines their ability to constrain the management of <b>discretionary</b> accruals. Using <b>data</b> from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) non-financial Main Board listed companies in 1998 evidence showed that neither board independence nor the audit committee independence effectively constrained the accrual management level. The interactive effects of board independence and audit committee independence were also found to be insignificant. Evidence in this paper, therefore, casts doubt that the independence of boards and the audit committee can lead to high quality accounting information, which is thereby useful to users...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new survey methods, in particular the 3 D laser scanners, has generated new, miscellaneous problems for the surveyor. In the past, the survey points {{used to create a}} model were chosen before the measurements were taken; today instead, this choice is made later. The new laser methodologies automatically record the data (points cloud).. Only afterwards is the data elaborated differently {{in order to create a}} numeric or geometrical model 01 the surveyed object. In other words, while in the past the surveyor played a critical role before the survey process began by selecting the data, new technology now assigns him a "post-process" role, often resulting in the mere use 01 semiautomatic techniques. However, this radical change undoubtedly induces an identity crisis in surveyors, especially those who belong to that large group of surveyors who normally carried out their job using the direct or photogrammetric procedure which considered the <b>discretionary</b> choice 01 <b>data</b> to be surveyed as an extremely important cultural rite. In order to study the critical moment that representation is going through, Disegnare.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of the length of the audit firm-client {{relationship}} and the size of the audit firm on audit quality in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach – To test their hypotheses, the authors use the quadratic form approach, similar to Chi and Huang, with some modifications. The population of this study encompasses all firms in which stock is publicly traded on the Amman Stock Exchange throughout the years (2002 - 2006). Findings – Statistical analysis of data shows that, audit firm tenure affects the audit quality adversely (negatively). Audit quality deteriorates, when audit firm tenure is extended as a result of the growth in the magnitude of <b>discretionary</b> accruals. Meanwhile, <b>data</b> analysis did not reveal that the audit firm size has any significant impact on the correlation between audit firm tenure and audit quality. Practical implications – If auditor independence and audit quality are to be enhanced, the audit firm should be rotated in order to open the door for new auditors to investigate the client with greater scrutiny and due care. Moreover, the activities of big audit firms should be monitored in order to distinguish their role from small firms. Originality/value – The paper provides evidence from a developing country about audit quality. It is expected to support and sustain improvement of audit quality, and therefore, financial reporting quality. The evidence provided by this paper adds to the literature internationally and this is important because auditing is a socially constructed phenomenon.

40|$|The Australian {{government}} {{ratified the}} Kyoto Protocol in 2007 signifying {{their commitment to}} address global warming and associated harmful climate change. Central to the Government 2 ̆ 7 s strategy is the proposed emissions trading scheme (AETS) now mooted to begin in 2011. Credible, transparent and efficient information is necessary to inform such a market, hence the National Greenhouse and Energy Act 2007 requires annual mandatory corporate reporting of GHG emissions from 1 July 2008. This study examines GHG emissions disclosure practices of Australian companies {{as well as their}} motivations to voluntarily report emissions before mandatory reporting, from a legitimacy perspective. A logit regression is used to analyse the link between voluntary GHG emissions disclosure (VEmD) and: the existence of an environmental management system (EMS); presence of an environment committee; CEO membership of the environment committee; firm size and industry category of 271 ASX 300 firms. The findings reveal that firms with an EMS in place are more likely to disclose <b>discretionary</b> GHG emissions <b>data.</b> Firms that have certified their EMS (ISO 14001) are more inclined to voluntarily disclose GHG emissions information than firms without a certified EMS. Energy and mining firms demonstrate a higher propensity to disclose GHG emissions information than other industries. Firm size was also positively related to VEmD. Findings of this study not only emphasise the importance of an EMS as a device to manage environmental impacts of a firm‟s operations, but it also shows the role of an EMS in bridging communication between firms and their relevant stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Dado que a necessidade energética de indivíduos pode ser obtida pelo gasto energético, foi realizado estudo com o objetivo de conhecer a atividade física e quantificar o gasto energético de adolescentes, inseridos ou não no mercado de trabalho. MÉTODO: Estudou-se o gasto energético de 273 estudantes, de ambos os sexos, do período noturno, de seis escolas da rede estadual de ensino, de Santo André, SP, por meio de questionário auto-aplicado sobre atividades físicas, ocupacionais e discricionais. RESULTADOS: Verificou-se que os estudantes trabalham de 40 a 50 horas semanais, percebendo de um a três salários-mínimos por mês; a atividade discricional destacada foi assistir televisão; e o gasto energético foi 3. 000 e 2. 100 Cal para os meninos e meninas, respectivamente. CONCLUSÕES: Os resultados encontrados mostraram que os estudantes trabalhadores não gastam mais energia que os não trabalhadores. OBJECTIVE: It is {{well-known}} that energy expenditure provides a feasible {{way to measure}} the individual's energy needs. The final aim {{of this paper was}} to discover the level of physical activity and to quantify the energy expenditure of adolescents who either participated, of otherwise, in the labor market. METHODS: This paper focussed on the evaluation of the energy expenditure of 273 students of both sexes attending the evening period of six schools belonging to the State School Network of Santo André, State of S.
