Now, the increased complexity of vehicles under test and the presence of data from one or several computer systems on a vehicle has further increased the rate and format complexity of a typical telemetry data stream.

The polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectricity film was selected as the sensing material and the signal processing circuit was mainly composed by charge amplifier, band-pass filter. In order to verify the accuracy of the sensor, the dynamic calibration experiments were carried out. By adjustment of the feeder's vibration parameters, the different feeding velocity can be gained. In the dynamic calibration experiments, the sensor was fixed at the height of 19. 5 mm and the fixing angle of 33 °~ 35 °, the feeding velocity of 60   80 grain per second, 1000 samples of full grain were randomly selected in the experiments, and the results indicated the detecting error was less than 5. 7 %. Using the different mixture ratio of the full grain, the imperfect grain, short stalk to do multi-group experiments, the result shows that the sensor can distinguish the grain from the mixture stalks. In the rig-tests, the monitoring sensor was fixed on the caudal region of the cylinder concave grid of the combine harvester in order to monitor the threshing compounds.
