5000|$|With the {{transfer}} of the capital from Tabriz to Qazvin in 1548, the khetab khaneh was in large part dismantled, following edicts of repentance published by the Shah for religious and economic reasons. The artists fled to provincial or foreign courts (Mughal or Ottoman). Only Aqa Mirak resisted this series of departures. Other artists, such as Siavush Beg the Georgian or Sadiqi Beg took the place of the preceding generation. New grand calligraphers, Mir Ali ou Malik Dayalami appeared and gave birth to the [...] "rule of the two quills", which defined identical rules for calligraphy and painting. Illumination and bookbinding evolved in parallel from the art of tapestry, given that the templates used were identical. In manuscripts, most often the paintings were <b>double</b> <b>pages</b> with no connection with the text, but images of servers of drinks, young women, princes, and dervishes filled the albums (muhaqqa).|$|E

The album consists of 41 <b>double</b> <b>pages</b> of letters, paintings, fan paintings, sketches, and poems; ink and colour on paper and silk. The album size is 15 × 9in. (40 x 24 cm.). Date;1804. All of the works bears Nanpo's writing. Some works was coproduced and inscribed by other gifted people. The inscribed works includes examples by the kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjūrō V, the geisha Katsu, the courtesan Nareginu, the kyōka master Shikatsube Magao, the novelist Santō Kyōden, and the kanshi (Chinese-style verse) poets Kikuchi Gozan and Okubo Shibutsu. There are paintings by the ukiyo-e artists Hokusai and Hokuba in the album. A further two fan paintings, one with a Chinese-style landscape by Haruki Nanmei (1795-1878) and a playful image of the Chinese poet Li Bai in his cups by Unshitsu Dojin, shows Shokusanjin's links to the more aloft of the literati artists.|$|E

50|$|The main London {{portion of}} the {{manuscript}} has 36 full-page figurative miniatures, one a double page spread. Baltimore has four miniatures, also including one double page subject (so five pages). Two further miniatures (or one double one) are missing, as shown by a small and apparently early system of numbering the miniatures. The manuscript therefore originally had 42 pages of miniatures, counting <b>double</b> <b>pages</b> as two. Some miniatures are out of their natural sequence, but the numbering suggests the manuscript was made in this way. Apart from the figurative miniatures, {{there are a number}} of pages with decorative panels of abstract motifs, plants and animals, especially at the beginning and end of sections of the work. The original painted and lacquered book covers each (front and back) have one side with a gold and brown scene of animals attacking other animals in a landscape and on the other side a scene with muted colour, one of a hunt and the other of an enthroned ruler, no doubt Akbar, being presented with the catch of game. All four scenes are enclosed in a frame with two borders of elaborate decoration, which like much of the abstract decorative work is similar in style to Persian, or Mughal, carpet decoration.|$|E
5000|$|The A6 {{paper size}} {{is used for}} these mini books and printed on coated paper, richly {{decorated}} with full colour illustrations. Every book of this encyclopaedic collection is composed of a monograph and focuses on a particular topic, the whole series covers all areas of human knowledge and experience, such as history, archaeology, art, aesthetics, music, religion, culture, civilisation, science, geology, biography, the research of supernatural, et cetera. There are 502 professional authors who have written for the collection. They usually use timelines and historical perspective to describe a subject, for example, [...] (lit. “The Hour of the Great Passage: Chronicle of the Death”), which narrated in chronological order to present the view of death in Europe from the Medieval Period to the 20th century, through historical vision of cultural, social and religious aspects. Almost all the volumes follow the same method, therefore, history is the essential element of perspective of this work. Every volume has around 200 pages with approximately 200 illustrations. Each book opens with 8-10 full-page illustrations or photographs, prefaced by a pull-quote on the inside front cove, which Thames & Hudson director Jamie Camplin calls it a “cinema-influenced trailer”. At the back of each book is the “Documents” section, here they provide more detailed documentary information and historical records, the sources of all illustrations as well as photo credits, dedicated to {{those who want to}} do further research.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effect of {{reducing}} questionnaire length on the response rate in a physician survey. Study Design and Setting: A postal four double-page questionnaire on end-of-life decision making was sent to a random sample of 1, 100 general practitioners, 400 elderly care physicians, and 500 medical specialists. Another random sample of 500 medical specialists received a shorter questionnaire of two <b>double</b> <b>pages.</b> After 3 months and one reminder, all nonresponding physicians received an even shorter questionnaire of one double page. Results: Total response was 64 % (1, 456 of 2, 269 eligible respondents). Response rate of medical specialists for the four double-page questionnaire was equal to that of the two double-page questionnaire (190 and 191 questionnaires were returned, respectively). The total response rate increased from 53 % to 64 % after sending a short one double-page questionnaire (1, 203 - 1, 456 respondents). Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that reducing the length of a long questionnaire in a physician survey does not necessarily improve response rate. To improve response rate and gather more information, researchers could decide to send a drastically shortened version of the questionnaire to nonresponders. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|International audienceThe article first {{focuses on}} the {{documentary}} albums on painters published in children’s literature and, in a second part, on an interdisciplinary sequence in a CM 2 class based on these albums. It first presents an analysis of three <b>double</b> <b>pages</b> devoted to La danse, a painting by H. Matisse, taken from three different youth albums, and deals with the layout of these three documents and the three dimensions of the texts associated with the reproduction of the painting: the informative, interpretive and subjective dimensions, which can be read in those texts. It then deals with the interdisciplinary sequence, carried out with a double objective {{on the part of}} the teacher: the understanding of the support (objective linked to proficiency in reading) and the awareness of works of art. After reading the <b>double</b> <b>pages</b> devoted to this picture according to a protocol mentioned in the article, pupils of the observed CM 2 class were invited to create their own double page for the Web site of the school. The article shows how they reinvest the dimensions of the albums in their own writing and realization, in the layout of their proposals but also in their texts, even though they have not been the subject of a specific workL’article s’intéresse, dans un premier temps, aux albums documentaires sur les peintres qui paraissent en littérature de jeunesse, et, dans un second temps, à une séquence interdisciplinaire réalisée dans une classe de CM 2 à partir de ces albums. Il propose d’abord une analyse de trois doubles pages consacrées à La danse, un tableau d’H. Matisse, prises dans trois albums pour la jeunesse différents, et traite de la mise en page de ces trois documents, mais aussi des trois dimensions, informative, interprétative et subjective, des textes, associés à la reproduction du tableau, que l’on peut y lire. Puis il traite de la séquence interdisciplinaire, menée avec un double objectif de la part de l’enseignante : la compréhension du support (objectif lié à la maitrise de la lecture) et la sensibilisation aux œuvres d’art. Après avoir pris connaissance des doubles pages consacrées à ce tableau selon un protocole évoqué dans l’article, des élèves du CM 2 observé ont été conviés à fabriquer leur propre double page pour le site internet de l’école.

40|$|This is {{the written}} {{report of a}} thesis project which {{was done in the}} form of a book. This book was {{produced}} as a dummy consisting of fifty-five <b>double</b> <b>pages</b> (spreads). The book was planned and executed in all details and it is ready to be printed. The visual part includes a number of photo-sequences: seventy-seven black and white photographs and five postcards. Within these series of images are sequences of seven Swiss poems, seven exerpts from American TV commercials, seven Malay proverbs, seven quotations from the MFA Handbook, passages from seven books dealing with different concepts of photography and seven footnotes. The main theme of the book is the challenge of conventional relationships between reality and its depiction in the photograph. Other themes appearing are visual and literal comments on different processes involved in the whole thesis project, ie. the process of going through the MFA Program, the process of making or taking photographs, the photographic process itself, the process of planning and making the book and the process of looking through the book. The whole project (photographs, texts, the book, the show) was planned to encompass simultaneously everything a photographer could possibly deal with within the given framework...|$|E

" This theme has been chosen in the lieu {{of the discovery}} at the State Archives of Tachov was found an original manuscript 194 which deserves to be known {{in the sphere of}} historians of Italian language as well as in academia in general. The original manuscript is entitled the Ducal commission for Alvise Bragadin, 1589, the only source of Venetian law in the Czech lands. It is a register of laws from the 15 th and 16 th centuries, with which the Doge Pasquale Cicogna nominates the patrician Alvise Bragadin to the office of rector of the city of Feltre, a town in Dominium of mainland, which belongs to the trevisian province. The legal register has two hundred <b>double</b> <b>pages,</b> contains 278 provisions partially written in medieval Latin and partially in regional Italian (va/gare). This work deals with Venetian register from a point of linguistic view: it describes the formation from legal Italian of 16 th century and its evolution while describing morphological components concerning this issue. ln the first section the aspect and the characteristics of the constitutional system of the Venetian Republic of the 15 th century are depicted.

40|$|Performed publication: ‘Echoes and Transformations’, {{edition of}} 40, 2016, 50 x 70 cm - during {{exhibition}} ‘Echoes and Transformations’, White Conduit Projects, London, 20 Oct – 9 Nov 2016. Performance with NaoKo TakaHashi, 20 Oct 2016, 15 min, 4 parts (folded publication, pencil, electro-acoustic amplification with effects pedals, spoken word). Performance with Kaho Aso, 2 Nov 2016, 15 min, 4 parts (folded publication, 4 photographs, scissors, glue, live projection, Noh flute, Kotsuzumi, drum calls). Conceived as diptychs {{in an exhibition}} context, the image-pairs strive to invert a conventional understanding of active subject and passive object positions by combining images of insides of masks that seem to change between concave and convex shapes, with images of whitened faces whose static positions remind of classical sculptures. The white here works as a non-representational space: an empty stage, a placeholder or insertion that enables an enacting of imaginary personae who are, similar to Noh characters, seemingly caught in retrospective states. They are sculpted and still, long before photography rendered them immutable, evoking a sense of premonition and awareness. As part of the printed publication ('Echoes and Afterlives') the <b>double</b> <b>pages</b> of masks and faces actually fold onto {{each other in the}} process of moving through the pages, thus literally donning a mask onto a face or shoeing a face into a mask. At the same time the publication includes two kinds of text – the first observing fragments from the actor’s moving body on stage, the other combining metaphors of whiteness from different literary contexts into double triplets thus developing other levels of agency, voice and embodiment. In a performance context, the acting out of the initial publication and its later editioned reproduction as a live-collage-projection ('Echoes and Transformation') enabled me to invite different sound artists into the work. These collaborations prompted me to rethink the work not only in relation to a timeline, but also as part of improvisation and rescaling processes, while my own gestures of cutting and folding the pages interacted with the respective sonic environments, which opened up the work through elements of layering, decollage and overwriting...|$|E
