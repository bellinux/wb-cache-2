North Korean artillery and mortar fire fell on Battle Mountain, P'il-bong and Sobuk-san, and {{during the period of}} September 1–6 there were strong local attacks and patrols by North Korean troops. The 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry, never succeeded in gaining complete possession of the southern parts of Sobuk-san, which would have given observation into the valley below and into the North Koreans' rear areas. The instability of the 24th Infantry made it necessary for Kean to order Throckmorton to send his only regimental reserve, E Company, north into the 24th Infantry sector along the Haman road to protect the right flank of the 5th Regimental Combat Team. In this position, E Company collected stragglers from the 24th Infantry every night and the next morning sent them back to their units. The US Navy then entered the battle {{in this part of the}} line, its destroyers standing off the south coast gave <b>illumination</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> by directing their searchlights against low-hanging clouds on Sobuk-san. One destroyer was on station almost continuously, supporting the ground action with the fire of six 5-inch guns.

60|$|An old {{custom of}} rejoicing over the {{installation}} of a new parish priest is still {{to be seen in}} almost primitive quaintness. The people of each parish--nobles, citizens, and plebeians alike--formerly elected their own priest, and, till the year 1576, they used to perambulate the city to the sound of drums, with banners flying, after an election, and proclaim the name of their favorite. On the day of the parroco's induction his portrait was placed over the church door and after the celebration of the morning mass, a breakfast was given, which grew to be so splendid in time, that in the fifteenth century a statute limited its profusion. In the afternoon the new parroco, preceded by a band of military music, visited all the streets and courts of his parish, and then, as now, all the windows of the parish were decorated with brilliant tapestries, and other gay-colored cloths and pictures. In those times as in these, there was an <b>illumination</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> throngs of people in the campo of the church, and booths for traffic in cakes of flour and raisins,--fried in lard upon the spot, and sold smoking hot, with immense uproar {{on the part of the}} merchant; and for three days afterward the parish bells were sounded in concert.|$|E

First, by millimeter wave radar to get the world coordinate of the preceding vehicles and establish the transformation of the relationship between the world coordinate and image pixels coordinate, we can convert the world coordinates of the radar target to image coordinate in order to form the region of interesting image. And then, by using the image processing method, we can reduce interference from the outside environment. Depending on D-S evidence theory, we can achieve a general value of reliability to test vehicles of interest. The experimental results show that the method can effectively eliminate the influence of <b>illumination</b> condition <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> accurately detect leading vehicles, and determine their location and accurate positioning. In order to improve nighttime driving, the driver shortage vision, reduce rear-end accident. Enhancing nighttime color image by three algorithms, a comparative study and evaluation by three algorithms are presented.

40|$|Variation in {{illumination}} conditions {{through a}} scene {{is a common}} issue for classification, segmentation and recognition applications. Traffic monitoring and driver assistance systems have difficulty with the changing <b>illumination</b> conditions <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> throughout the day, with multiple sources (especially <b>at</b> <b>night)</b> and {{in the presence of}} shadows. The majority of existing algorithms for color constancy or shadow detection rely on multiple frames for comparison or to build a background model. The proposed approach uses a novel color space inspired by the Log-Chromaticity space and modifies the bilateral filter to equalize illumination across objects using a single frame. Neighboring pixels of the same color, but of different brightness, are assumed to be of the same object/material. The utility of the algorithm is studied over day and night simulated scenes of varying complexity. The objective is not to provide a product for visual inspection but rather an alternate image with fewer illumination related issues for other algorithms to process. The usefulness of the filter is demonstrated by applying two simple classifiers and comparing the class statistics. The hyper-log-chromaticity image and the filtered image both improve the quality of the classification relative to the un-processed image...|$|R

Optical changes in the aged eye, such as pupillary miosis and increased lens density, cannot account for the severity of this problem, and little is known about its neural basis. Dark adaptation functions were measured on 94 adults ranging in age from the 20 s to the 80 s to assess the rate of rod-mediated sensitivity recovery after exposure to a 98 % bleach. Fundus photography and a grading scale were used to characterize macular health in subjects over age 49 in order to control for macular disease. Thresholds for each subject were corrected for lens density based on individual estimates, and pupil diameter was controlled. Results indicated that during human aging there is a dramatic slowing in rod-mediated dark adaptation that can be attributed to delayed rhodopsin regeneration. During the second component of the rod-mediated phase of dark adaptation, the rate of sensitivity recovery decreased 0. 02 log unit/min per decade, and the time constant of rhodopsin regeneration increased 8. 4 s/decade. The amount of time to reach within 0. 3 log units of baseline scotopic sensitivity increased 2. 76 min/decade. These aging-related changes in rod-mediated dark adaptation may contribute to night vision problems commonly experienced by the elderly...|$|R

The designers of Clearview sought to create a typeface adapted for mixed-case signage, initially expecting it would be based on an existing European sans-serif typeface. Instead, using a similar weight to the FHWA fonts, a new font was created from scratch. Two key differences are much larger counter spaces, the enclosed spaces in letters like the lower case [...] "e" [...] or [...] "a", and a higher x-height, the relative height of the lower case [...] "x" [...] to the upper case [...] "X".

40|$|Pedestrian {{detection}} {{is among}} the most frequently-used preprocessing tasks in many surveillance application fields, from low-level people counting to high-level scene understanding. Even though many approaches perform well in the daytime with sufficient <b>illumination,</b> pedestrian detection <b>at</b> <b>night</b> is still a critical and challenging problem for video surveillance systems. To respond to this need, in this paper, we provide an affordable solution with a near-infrared stereo network camera, as well as a novel three-dimensional foreground pedestrian detection model. Specifically, instead of using an expensive thermal camera, we build a near-infrared stereo vision system with two calibrated network cameras and near-infrared lamps. The core of the system is a novel voxel surface model, which is able to estimate the dynamic changes of three-dimensional geometric information of the surveillance scene and to segment and locate foreground pedestrians in real time. A free update policy for unknown points is designed for model updating, and the extracted shadow of the pedestrian is adopted to remove foreground false alarms. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the system is deployed in several nighttime surveillance scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of nighttime pedestrian segmentation and detection in real time under heavy occlusion. In addition, the qualitative and quantitative comparison results show that our work outperforms classical background subtraction approaches and a recent RGB-D method, as well as achieving comparable performance with the state-of-the-art deep learning pedestrian detection method even with a much lower hardware cost...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a suitable test that was sensitive to retinal image degradation in subjects who have undergone excimer laser refractive surgery and that was also relevant to visual demands in commercial aviation. Methods: Assessment of the visual environment and the tasks involved in piloting a commercial aircraft formed the basis for the selection of the test parameters. The new contrast acuity assessment (CAA) test covers a functional visual field of ± 5 ° and is based on minimum spatial vision requirements for commercial pilots. Results: Data measured in 100 normal subjects were used to define the `standard normal observer' and the range of variation for the parameters of the test. This approach makes it possible to quickly establish whether a given subject's performance falls within the range of the standard normal observer. The test is also administered under low ambient <b>illumination</b> since flying <b>at</b> <b>night</b> involves mesopic levels of light adaptation when the pupil size is large and the effects of aberrations and scattered light are therefore more pronounced. Conclusion: The results of the test are simple to interpret and reveal visual performance that falls outside the normal range as a result of either significant degradation of retinal image quality (caused by increased aberrations and scattered light) or abnormal processing of visual information in the retina and/or the visual pathway...|$|R
