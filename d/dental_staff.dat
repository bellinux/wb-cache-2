5|$|On Valentine's Day, Liz {{goes to her}} dentist {{appointment}} and tells the receptionist {{that she did not}} sign the waiver. After her surgery, Liz reassures the <b>dental</b> <b>staff</b> that the anesthesia is having no effect on her and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E

40|$|Objective The Common Risk Factor Approach {{proposes that}} public health efforts can be {{improved}} by multiple agencies working together on a shared risk factor. The present study aimed to assess the acceptability to parents, <b>dental</b> practice <b>staff</b> and commissioners of the delivery of dietary advice in the dentistry setting {{in order to address}} obesity. Design Semi-structured focus groups with <b>dental</b> practice <b>staff</b> and one-to-one interviews with parents of pre-school children and public health commissioners involved in an oral health promotion initiative delivering dietary advice in dental surgeries. Data were analysed using the Framework Approach. Setting General dental practice surgeries and pre-schools in areas of high deprivation in north-east England. Subjects Parents (n 4), <b>dental</b> practice <b>staff</b> (n 23) and one commissioner. Results All participants found acceptable the concept of delivering public health messages in non-conventional settings. <b>Dental</b> practice <b>staff</b> were concerned about the potential for conflicting messages and deprioritisation of oral health advice, and they identified practical barriers to delivery, such as lack of training. Parents were very apprehensive about the potential of such approaches to stigmatise overweight children, including bullying. Uncertainty over the causes of obesity led to confusion about its solutions and the roles of public health and health care. Conclusions Major concerns about the implementation of the Common Risk Factor Approach were raised by parents and <b>dental</b> practice <b>staff.</b> Specific dietary guidance for both oral health and healthy weight, as well as further research into issues of suitability, feasibility and stigmatisation, are needed...|$|R

25|$|By 1920, {{the dental}} service had been demobilised. During the interwar years, {{the focus of}} Australia's {{military}} planning was upon maintaining a reduced permanent force with a larger part-time military force. The need for dental services was thus greatly reduced and, as a result, they were largely provided by civilian dentists that were also serving in the Militia, although {{a small number of}} permanent <b>dental</b> <b>staff</b> were retained on the establishment. Nevertheless, in 1928 an inspector of dental services was appointed, and although training opportunities were limited due to the economic hardships of the Great Depression, throughout the interwar years the service developed its capabilities and corporate knowledge through a series of tactical exercises.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a dentist-implemented behavioral intervention in which brief escape from dental treatment was provided on a regular basis, independent of the child's behavior. Within a multiple baseline design across subjects, 5 children, ages 4 to 7  years, were provided with temporary escape from dental treatment on a fixed-time schedule. The intervals were signaled by an electronic timer worn by the dentist. Clinically significant reductions were observed in physically disruptive behavior across all 5 children with the introduction of noncontingent escape, and verbally disruptive behavior was markedly reduced in 4 of the 5 children. In addition, the <b>dental</b> <b>staff's</b> use of physical restraint was reduced to near zero across all 5 children. The research extends the literature in both clinical dentistry and in applied behavior analysis by demonstrating that a dentist can easily and effectively implement noncontingent reinforcement to produce clinically significant and socially important changes in children's health behavior...|$|R

40|$|We {{used the}} NPS {{methodology}} (Net Promoter Score) developed by Fred Reichheld to determine loyalty of KRASSMU <b>dental</b> clinic <b>staff.</b> The method {{makes it possible}} using only 2 questions to evaluate not only the level of employees’ loyalty to the organization, but also to identify the approaches of increasing or retaining this level. The doctors, nurses, administrative and general service staff - all in all 60 employees {{were involved in the}} survey. As a result of the survey the level of NPS of the KRASSMU <b>dental</b> clinic <b>staff</b> is as following: 2. 9 % are promoters {{with a high degree of}} loyalty, 41. 4 % with an average degree of loyalty; the group of critics includes employees with a low degree of loyalty - 45. 7 %, totally not loyal - 10 %. Thus the NPS index is - 11. 4 %. Despite the negative NPS index the job performance standards of the dental clinic are increasing every year. It is achieved by the reward of the staff, satisfaction of needs, honest relationship in case of fulfillment of the terms of contract, the favorable environmental conditions in the workplace, as well as a qualitative monitoring the work of staff.

40|$|Abstract: Aim: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{is still a}} global public health problem. Over 2 billion people have serological evidence of past or current HBV infection. Of these cases, 350 - 400 million, 5 - 7 % of the world population, suffer from chronic infection. We sought to assess knowledge levels of dental patients {{about the nature of}} HBV infection, sources of infection, mode of transmission and vaccination. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study a questionnaire was prepared and given randomly to 300 dental patients. All the participants were personally interviewed and anonymity was assured. Results: Among these subjects, 67. 7 % had heard of HBV; 61 % did not know that chronic HBV {{infection is}} usually asymptomatic; 80. 3 % of cases did not know that hepatitis B infection is preventable. Only 10 % of patients knew that HBV can be transmitted by saliva; 52 % of subjects did not have any information about hepatitis B vaccine in preventing liver disease and only 13. 3 % of patients had been vaccinated. More than half the patients (58. 2 %) believed that HBV could be transmitted by dentists and <b>dental</b> <b>staffs</b> in the <b>dental</b> clinics during surgeries. Conclusion: This study indicated low levels of knowledge about the nature of HBV infection, sources of infection, mode of transmission and vaccination. Thus, more work should be done with regard to educating patients...|$|R
