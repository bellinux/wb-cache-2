The transient numerical simulation was performed in an approximation with an axial-symmetric finite element model.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to understand jet flow development from plain and grooved rectangular nozzles of aspect ratio 2 :I using two-component hotwire anemometry. Grooves of square configuration (side 4 mm) and length 5 mm were introduced in the (i) minor-axis, (ii) major-axis and, (iii) in both minor- and major-axes directions. The equivalent diameter of the plain rectangular nozzle is 37 - 5 min. Studies were carried out for a nominal jet exit velocity of 20 ms(- 1) and for Reynolds number based on equivalent diameter of 54, 000. The introduction of <b>grooves</b> in either <b>plane</b> does not show any influence on the potential-core length but results in faster jet-decay thereafter. It is observed that the grooves when introduced ill minor-axis direction inhibit the jet growth in that plane while promoting the jet growth along major-axis plane and hence, delays the phenomena of axis-switching. However when introduced in major-axis direction, the grooves promote jet growth along major-axis plane while inhibiting jet-growth in minor-axis plane. Cross-sectional contours of mean-velocity suggest that the grooves modify the process of overall jet development significantly in the plane in which they are introduced relative to the plain jet and hence, significantly affect the axis-switching location in each case...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of a direct-injection type diesel engine often depends {{on the strength of}} swirl or squish, shape of combustion chamber, the number of nozzle holes, etc. This is of course because the combustion in the cylinder was affected by the mixture formation process. In this paper, combustion process of biodiesel fuel was studied by employing the piston which has several <b>grooves</b> with inclined <b>plane</b> on the piston crown to generate swirl during the compression stroke in the cylinder in order to improve the atomization of high viscosity fuel such as biodiesel fuel and toroidal type piston generally used in high speed diesel engine. To take a photograph of flame, single cylinder, four stroke diesel engine was remodeled into two stroke visible engine and high speed video camera was used. The results obtained are summarized as follows; (1) In the case of toroidal piston, when biodiesel fuel was supplied to plunger type injection system which has very low injection pressure as compared with common-rail injection system, the flame propagation speed was slowed and the maximum combustion pressure became lower. These phenomena became further aggravated as the fuel viscosity gets higher. (2) In the case of swirl groove piston, early stage of combustion such as rapid ignition timing and flame propagation was activated by intensifying the air flow in the cylinder. (3) Combustion process of biodiesel fuel was improved by the reason mentioned in paragraph (2) above. Consequently, the swirl grooves would also function to improve the combustion of high viscosity fuel...|$|R

They went and inspected the slide, and discussed the question of putting new wood into the groove.

There are moments {{in the lives of}} most of us in which it seems to us that there will never be more cakes and ale. George, however, talked of the children, and reminded his father that in matters of business nothing is so ruinous as ruin.

Michel acknowledged the truth of the rule, but again declared that there was no money to be got out of the thing. He yielded, however, and promised that the repairs should be made. Then they went down to the mill, which was going at that time. George, as he stood by and watched the man and boy adjusting the logs to the cradle, and listened to the apparently self-acting saw as it did its work, and observed the perfection of the simple machinery which he himself had adjusted, and smelt the sweet scent of the newly-made sawdust, and listened to the music of the little stream, when, between whiles, the rattle of the mill would cease for half a minute,--George, as he stood in silence, looking at all this, listening to the sounds, smelling the perfume, thinking how much sweeter it all was than the little room in which Madame Faragon sat at Colmar, and in which it was, at any rate for the present, his duty to submit his accounts to her, from time to time,--resolved that he would at once make an effort. He knew his father's temper well. Might it not be that though there should be a quarrel for a time, everything would come right at last?

40|$|Regularly spaced incised shore-normal <b>grooves</b> (gutters) on <b>plane</b> {{consolidated}} {{surfaces in}} littoral and sublittoral zones are widely {{observed in the}} marine geological record. Despite their common occurrence there are few investigations into their origins in contemporary marine environments. While their formation is often attributed to wave-induced currents related to wave swash and backwash on the beach-face, no conceptual model has been advanced to explain the presence of gutters, their morphology or their quasi-regular alongshore spacing. The paper examines gutters cut in soft sandstone at Medmerry near Selsey, UK and argues that their formation is related to wave breaking and swash zone processes during an unprecedented sequence of storms {{in the winter of}} 2013 / 14. During this period exceptionally high near-shore waves (Hs around 6 m) were recorded for the south coast beaches and these storm conditions persisted periodically through to mid-February 2014. The consequence was extensive beach erosion and the exposure of underlying substrates. In this study gutter morphology was quantified using terrestrial lidar and a wave-resolving numerical model was used to defined the nearshore wave conditions and swash characteristics. Three of the largest storm events during the winter of 2013 / 14 were modelled: (a) moderate waves coincident with an exceptionally high tide; (b) exceptionally high waves occurring during neap tides; and (c) high waves occurring during spring tides. The model results showed swash zone shear stress is a dome-shaped function of distance across the beach-face thereby controlling gutter depth. Further, high-speed sheet flows characterised by periodic, shore-normal, high and low speed streaks alongshore are thought to be implicated in the mechanism controlling gutter spacing. However, in any situation, the specific spacing of gutters is moderated by both the local sheet flow characteristics and the larger-scale morphological forcing. Together these factors indicate that gutter spacing is an emergent property which makes spacing unpredictable...|$|R

For clay mineralogy, fractions between < 2 and < 0. 2 mm were separated out from the sediments. The clay fractions were then subjected to examination by X-ray diffraction (XRD) of oriented K/Ca saturated samples using a Philips Diffractometer and Ni-filtered Cu Ka radiation with the scanning speed of 10 2 Ө min - 1. The main clay minerals for all the samples are identical and show the presence of hydroxy-interlayered smectites with minor quantities of mica, kaolinite, smectites, quartz and feldspar. The first weathering product of the Deccan Basalt (DB) is the dioctahedral smectite. Since the present semi aridic climatic condition of the study area can not transform a smectite to HIS and either smectite to kaolin, it is quite likely that both the HIS and Sm/K are generated in the tropical humid climate of the Western Ghats and then carried through the exiting river system like Godavari, Adula and Mahalungi. Therefore it is evident that the clay minerals present in these sediments represent another climatic history more humid than the one prevailing at present...|$|R
40|$|The novel Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) process allows {{producing}} complex three-dimensional shapes from Computer Aided Design (CAD) models without {{specially designed}} forming tools. This process thus meets {{a demand for}} small batch production and rapid prototyping of industrial shell-like structures. The formability of a metal sheet subjected to this process is generally found to be much higher compared to traditional forming processes such as stamping and deep drawing. This thesis formulates {{an explanation for the}} remarkable formability on the basis of through-thickness shearing that occurs during ISF. While in the study of many conventional sheet forming processes through-thickness shear (TTS) can be neglected, several numerical and experimental investigations presented in this work have shown that this assumption does not hold for ISF. The finite element method, a numerical tool for solving non-linear field problems, is adopted for the simulation of ISF processes. Models of different spatial refinement, determined by the mesh density, have been investigated, using various models for the material constitutive behavior. A non-negligible TTS is indeed predicted by models with a sufficiently large mesh density. Such fine meshes also allow proper modelling of the small contact zone in ISF, as well as an accurate prediction of the forming force. On the experimental side, a direct measurement method of the overall TTS is proposed, and statistically non-zero through-thickness shear angles are observed for a low carbon steel sheet. The accuracy of these measurements is however limited, and the method itself is questionable as a defect needs to be introduced. Another experimental verification of TTS is performed from christallographic texture measurements by X-ray diffraction. The deformation texture contains evidence of TTS during the ISF process, although only in a qualitative sense. The Marciniak-Kuczynski (MK) model framework, which assumes an imperfection (groove) in an otherwise perfectly homogeneous sheet (matrix), is a commonly used analytical tool to predict the limit of sheet formability due to the onset of localized necking. An original extension to the MK model framework is presented in this thesis in order to explicitly account for TTS, which is usually disregarded in MK analyses. This is achieved by the introduction of additional force equilibrium and geometric compatibility equations that govern the connection between matrix and groove in the MK model framework. Furthermore, in order to integrate plastic anisotropy in the extended model featuring TTS, a material reference frame available in recent literature is incorporated, as well as a particular model for anisotropic yielding that relies on virtual testing of anisotropy (Facet plastic potential), since out-of-plane anisotropy related to TTS cannot be measured experimentally. The extended MK model shows that TTS delays the onset of localized necking in case the TTS is applied to the sheet {{in the same direction as}} the incipient necking direction. The underlying mechanism is a stress mode change within the <b>groove</b> towards the <b>plane</b> strain yield point, which brings about additional hardening that stabilizes necking. From the comparison of formability predictions between an aluminum and a low carbon steel sheet, it is also clearly seen that anisotropy influences the amount of delay in necking that is due to TTS. The occurrence of TTS in the ISF process postpones the onset of localized necking and thus contributes to the high formability that is observed. Het vernieuwende Incrementeel Plaatvormgevingsproces (IPV) laat toe comp lexe driedimensionele vormen te produceren zonder specifieke gereedschap pen, wat een antwoord biedt op de industriële vraag naar snelle producti etechnieken voor kleine hoeveelheden en prototypes van schaalvormige str ucturen. Het is gebleken dat de vervormbaarheid van metaalplaat in dit p roces veel hoger is dan in traditionele plaatvormgevingsprocessen zoals strekken en dieptrekken. Deze thesis formuleert een verklaring voor deze hoge vervormbaarheid op basis van de plastische afschuiving over de pla atdikte die optreedt tijdens IPV. Eindige elementen modellering van de kleine plastische zone in een IPV p roces toegepast op aluminiumplaat toont duidelijk een significante afsch uiving over de plaatdikte aan. Dit vervormingsmechanisme is experimentee l geverifieerd door metingen van de totale afschuifhoek in laagkoolstofs taalplaat. Bovendien is het effect van deze afschuiving te zien in de op gemeten kristallografische vervormingstextuur. Het Marciniak-Kuczynski vervormingslimietmodel voor de voorspelling van gelokaliseerde insnoering is uitgebreid naar vervormingen met afschuivin g over de plaatdikte. Plastische anisotropie ten gevolge van de kristall ografische textuur is hierbij in rekening gebracht. Dit theoretische kad er voorspelt dat afschuiving over de plaatdikte het begin van gelokalise erde insnoering kan uitstellen, wat interessante toekomstperspectieven m et zich meebrengt betreffende afschuiving over de plaatdikte in andere v ormgevingsprocessen van metaalplaat.
