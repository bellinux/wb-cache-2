40|$|In this master thesis I analyse and {{implement}} a tool for configuration and fault management of optical connections in an optical transport network. Network operators or equipment such as IP-routers can configure optical crossconnects to establish point-to-point lightpaths from one edge of the network to another. A lightpath {{is a series of}} optical WDM channels that are interconnected. Functions in the control plane can protect connections from channel, fibre or node faults. The nodes detect and locate faults and alert other nodes that automatically perform protection switching of crossconnects to pre-configured settings. The configuration tool has been tested in simulation and in a real metropolitan area test network. Distributed fault detection and restoration routines improve the performance compared to centralised <b>fault</b> <b>processing.</b> The difference is probably quite small though. The tool has been developed in steps from a centralised processing approach towards almost fully distributed processing. Optimisations of the program code such as faster functions, smaller node messages, asynchronous message transmission etc. were added to each implementation step. Hence, the last version which is the most distributed is also the most optimised and a performance comparison of centralised versus distributed would be unfair. For example, the distributed restoration routine triggered by fault detection takes about 60 ms both when the fault is in a WDM channel with one protected connection and in a fibre with four protected connections. The centralised approach needs more than 100 ms to restore a fibre fault. The value could be far less with optimisation...|$|E
40|$|The Ion Cyclotron RF Transmitter System (ICRF) at Alcator C-Mod {{comprises}} {{four separate}} transmitters each capable of driving 2 MW of power into plasma loads. Four separate transmission lines guide RF power into three antennas, each mounted {{in a separate}} horizontal port, in the C-Mod Tokamak. Protection for the antennas, matching elements and transmission line is accomplished by two unique but interdependent subsystems encompassed by the ICRF Fault System. The Antenna Protection System evaluates antenna phasing and voltage, sets fault thresholds, generates fault signals, and passes fault information to the Master Fault Processor. During operation, the Master Fault Processor is responsible for detecting hazards along the transmission line, generating faults, processing faults from the Antenna Protection System, terminating RF drive and extinguishing faults within 10 mus. In addition, the system controls various delays and sets the boundaries for RF retries. The ICRF Control System provides amplitude regulation for all antennas and phase control for a four-strap antenna. We are modifying some of the <b>fault</b> <b>processing</b> components and control elements of these systems {{in an effort to}} improve reliability and serviceability, and increase flexibility. This upgrade will reduce wired interconnections, add remote features to improve access to key operating parameters, improve RF isolation with new switching components, simplify phase control, and expand the RF regulation system to an active control regime whereby plasma parameters may become direct feedback elements for RF regulation.
