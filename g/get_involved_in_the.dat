Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF {{claimed that the}} purpose was to destroy the PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.|$|E

5|$|Tahir's {{unexpected}} {{victory was}} decisive: al-Ma'mun's position was secured, while his main opponents, the abnaʾ, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader. Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another abnaʾ army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala {{after a series}} of hard-fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter. Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Banu Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al-Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa's son, Husayn. However, al-Amin's efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians' reluctance to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the abnaʾ to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab tribal support backfired on al-Amin, as the abnaʾ began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma'mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the abnaʾ, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al-Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al-Amin's case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma'mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu 'l-Ri'asatayn ("he of the two headships"), signifying his control over both civil and military administration.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, students' {{unions are}} run by students, {{independent}} of the educational facility.

25|$|The {{strike at}} St. John's started on January 4, 1966. The union pushed for {{mediation}} and arbitration in December 1965, but the university refused {{to submit to}} either.

25|$|While {{the cleanup}} efforts have {{improved}} {{the situation in}} the canyon, the garbage reaccumulates especially during the rainy season.

Mexico’s federal environmental agency, the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (Semarnat) states that it cannot <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> situation as it is the municipalities that have the responsibility for disposing of trash appropriately. However, many of these local governments do not have landfills or the separation of recyclables.|$|E
