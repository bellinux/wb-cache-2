5|$|Day-Lewis {{returned}} in 1993, playing Newland Archer in Martin Scorsese's {{adaptation of the}} Edith Wharton novel The Age of Innocence. To prepare for the film, set in America's <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> he wore 1870s-period aristocratic clothing around New York City for two months, including top hat, cane and cape.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{president}} during the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although Grant was not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, clouding Grant's historical reputation. Grant was greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did not stop the guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, were eager to discredit Reconstruction, and the moral integrity of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Payne married Mary Perry (1818–1895), {{the only}} child of a wealthy local merchant. They had six children: Nathan P. Payne (1837–1885), a future mayor of Cleveland; Oliver Hazard Payne (1839–1917), the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> businessman; Flora Payne (1842–1893), who married William Collins Whitney, the Secretary of the Navy; Henry Payne (1845–1878); Howard Payne (1849–1908); Mary Perry Payne (1854–1898), who married Charles William Bingham (1846–1929).|$|E
5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age.</b> The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|The Bone Wars, {{also known}} as the Great Dinosaur Rush, was a period of intense and ruthlessly {{competitive}} fossil hunting and discovery during the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> of American history, marked by a heated rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to outdo the other in the field, resorting to bribery, theft, and the destruction of bones. Each scientist also sought to ruin his rival's reputation and cut off his funding, using attacks in scientific publications.|$|E
5|$|As {{the postwar}} years yielded to the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period. In 1875, George B. Post won a competition to build a new home for the Troy Savings Bank, with an upstairs auditorium. While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux-Arts vein.|$|E

25|$|Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan (formerly, Consuelo Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough; born Consuelo Vanderbilt; 2 March 1877 – 6 December 1964) was {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} American Vanderbilt family. Her marriage to Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough became an international emblem of the socially advantageous, but loveless, marriages common during the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eliza Frances Andrews (August 10, 1840 – January 21, 1931) was {{a popular}} Southern writer of the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age.</b> Her works were {{published}} in popular magazines and papers, including the New York World and Godey's Lady's Book. Her longer works included The War-Time Journal of a Georgian Girl (1908) and two botany textbooks.|$|E
25|$|The Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site is a {{historic}} house museum in Hyde Park, New York. It became a National Historic Landmark and started operation under the National Park Service in 1940. The mansion, known as Hyde Park, was the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> home of Frederick William Vanderbilt and his family from 1895 to 1938.|$|E
25|$|Robert Gould Shaw II (sometimes {{referred}} to as RGS II) (June 16, 1872 — March 29, 1930) was a wealthy landowner and socialite of the leisure class in the greater Boston area of Massachusetts. He {{was one of the}} prominent figures of the boom years {{at the turn of the}} century, sometimes called the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> many Americans {{began working}} fewer hours {{and had more}} {{disposable}} income. With new-found money and time to spend on leisure activities, Americans sought new venues for entertainment. Amusement parks, set up outside major cities and in rural areas, emerged to meet this new economic opportunity. These parks served as source of fantasy and escape from real life. By the early 1900s, hundreds of amusement parks were operating in the United States and Canada. Trolley parks stood outside many cities. Parks like Atlanta's Ponce de Leon and Idora Park, near Youngstown, OH, took passengers to traditionally popular picnic grounds, which by the late 1890s also often included rides like the Giant Swing, Carousel, and Shoot-the-Chutes. These amusement parks were often based on nationally known parks or world's fairs: they had names like Coney Island, White City, Luna Park, or Dreamland. The American <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> was, in fact, amusement parks' Golden Age that reigned until the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{this era}} saw mostly steady growth and a {{relatively}} low level of financial crises. In contrast to the Bretton Woods system, the pre–World War I financial order was not created at a single high level conference; rather it evolved organically {{in a series of}} discrete steps. The <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> a time of especially rapid development in North America, falls into this period.|$|E
25|$|Livingston Manor's {{prestige}} {{began to}} diminish somewhat {{in the later}} years of the century. The new money of the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> had come from industrialization, not landownership, and preferred newer hot spots like Long Island and Newport for its summer mansions and retreats, or followed Jay Gould and the Rockefellers in building or improving estates further downriver, closer to the city.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until that}} point, Nelson's {{political}} career was {{largely based on}} the issues of an unfolding economic frontier, with land development, immigration, and <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> dynamics. With the birth of the Progressive Era, the winds of reform started blowing more from the east than the west, and urban issues came more to the forefront. As a result, Nelson had to reinvent his political strategy.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence {{retained}} {{control of}} the new Lawrenceville Cement Company, but was ousted after three years when William Beach took over. Beach expanded the production facilities, {{in time for the}} rise in demand that occurred as the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> saw a rapid increase in demand after the lull caused by the Civil War. Beach died in 1881; control soon passed to his son William N. Beach II.|$|E
25|$|Wall Street in a {{conceptual}} sense represents financial and economic power. To Americans, it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics, {{and its role}} {{has been a source}} of controversy throughout the nation's history, particularly beginning around the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> period in the late 19th century. Wall Street became the symbol of a country and economic system that many Americans see as having developed through trade, capitalism, and innovation.|$|E
25|$|The postwar years, {{the period}} later {{referred}} to as the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> were prosperous for Ossining. While shipbuilding and river shipping finally faded as an industry when the railroad, now part of the New York Central, was fully established, quarrying continued. The village had become an industrial center, with over a hundred businesses located downtown or on the waterfront, from Brandreth's pill factory to pickle and sleigh manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|By 1894, Flagler's {{railroad}} system reached what {{is today}} known as West Palm Beach. Flagler constructed the Royal Poinciana Hotel in Palm Beach overlooking the Lake Worth Lagoon. He also built The Breakers Hotel {{on the ocean}} side of Palm Beach, and Whitehall, his private 55-room, 60,000 square foot (5,600m²) winter home. The development of these three structures, coupled with railroad access to them, established Palm Beach as a winter resort for the wealthy members of America's <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{that era}} {{most of the}} easily {{accessible}} woodlands had been harvested. In combination with technological advances in some fields that eliminated {{the need for the}} raw materials of the forest, most of the industries that had made such an impact on the region in the early 19th century declined. In their place a new one arose, mountain tourism, giving the newly affluent of the <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> a place to connect with nature and get away from hot cities in the summer months.|$|E
