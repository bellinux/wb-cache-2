5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. <b>Fresh</b> <b>milk</b> was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E

40|$|Background: As milk is an {{excellent}} medium for growth of microorganisms, milk gets contaminated very easily leading to its early spoilage and to milk-borne diseases. Objectives: To compare the quality of pasteurized milk with milk cooker-treated milk and to compare the quality of <b>fresh</b> ultra-high-temperature (UHT) <b>milk</b> with that of UHT milk close to expiry date. Materials and Methods: Samples of pasteurized milk, milk heated in <b>milk</b> cooker, <b>fresh</b> UHT <b>milk,</b> and UHT milk nearing expiry date were tested by methylene blue reduction test, coliform test, and colony count test. The results were analyzed statistically using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11. 5. Results: All milk samples passed the methylene blue test and UHT-treated milk passed the coliform test also. Out of the 30 <b>fresh</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> samples, seven (23. 3 %) passed the coliform test; but the same after milk cooker treatment, 16 (53. 3 %) passed the coliform test (P < 0. 05). Fourteen (46. 6 %) out of 30 <b>fresh</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> samples failed the colony count test, but the same after milk cooker treatment only eight (26. 6 %) failed the test (P = 0. 583). Only seven out of the 60 UHT milk samples failed the colony count test and out of these six (20 %) were close to expiry date (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Milk cooker-treated milk appears to be safer than the <b>fresh</b> pasteurized <b>milk.</b> <b>Fresh</b> UHT-treated <b>milk</b> is safer then UHT milk close to expiry date...|$|R

25|$|The Imperial Family {{were not}} the only {{residents}} of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the servants' quarters that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by the smell of the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide <b>fresh</b> <b>milk.</b> It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.|$|E

Selected <b>milk</b> samples from <b>fresh</b> <b>milks</b> were heated at 25 $ sp circ$C, 60 $ sp circ$C, 70 $ sp circ$C, 80 $ sp circ$C and 90 $ sp circ$C, respectively. Whole casein and whey protein were separated by adjusting the pH to 4. 6. Quantitative determination of milk protein were performed by reverse-phase HPLC. Whole casein was separated to $ kappa$-casein ($ kappa$-Cn), $ beta$-casein ($ beta$-Cn) and $ rm alpha sb{s}$-casein ($ rm alpha sb{s}$-Cn). Whey protein was separated as immunoglobulin (Ig), bovine serum albumin (BSA), $ alpha$-lactalbumin ($ alpha$-La) and $ beta$-lactoglobulin ($ beta$-Lg). Individual milk protein fraction was quantitatively determined by relative peak area and their ratios to whey protein or casein. The denaturation of individual milk protein at different heating temperature was investigated. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

25|$|The factory was in {{the center}} of a dairy farmland, but with Hershey’s support, houses, businesses, churches and a {{transportation}} infrastructure accreted around the plant. Because the land was surrounded by dairy farms, Hershey was able to use <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> to mass-produce quality milk chocolate. Hershey continued to experiment and perfect the process of making milk chocolate using the techniques he had first learned for adding milk to make caramels when he had moved to Drexel Hill.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} century or so larger farms specialising in dairy alone have emerged. Large scale dairy farming is only viable where either {{a large amount of}} milk is {{required}} for production of more durable dairy products such as cheese, butter, etc. or there is a substantial market of people with cash to buy milk, but no cows of their own. In the 1800's von Thünen argued that there was about a 100 mile radius surrounding a city where such <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> supply was economically viable.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the changes of the microbiological quality of <b>milk</b> during storage. <b>Fresh</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> {{was used for the}} laboratory experimentations. Cooling chain of the samples was broken for 8 and for 12 hours at different temperatures (22 – 30 °C). In these samples, total count of psychrotrophic microorganisms was assessed. Technological indiscipline, i. e. higher storage temperature (24 °C and more), was associated with higher increase of total count of microorganisms and psychrotrophic microorganisms. Microbiological results proved that the samples stored under standard conditions were of very good quality. However, in <b>fresh</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> the representation of total count of microorganisms and psychrotrophic microorganisms meets fully the norm requirements.

25|$|Panela {{is another}} white <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> cheese with little fat or cholesterol. The origins of this cheese {{probably}} {{goes back to}} the Balkans or the Italian peninsula, but it has been significantly modified to Mexican tastes. It is made with skim milk, giving it a fairly firm texture, with a sweet/sour taste. In traditional markets, this cheese is often sold in baskets in which it has been molded, giving it the alternate name of queso de canasta. It is often served cold as part of an appetizer or snack tray. It is also found on sandwiches in most parts of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{proceeds}} from the 1900 sale of the Lancaster Caramel Company, Hershey initially acquired farm land roughly 30 miles northwest of Lancaster, near his birthplace of Derry Township, PA. There, he could obtain the large supplies of <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> needed to perfect and produce fine milk chocolate. Excited by the potential of milk chocolate, which {{at that time was}} a luxury product, Hershey was determined to develop a formula for milk chocolate and market and sell it to the American public. Through trial and error, he created his own formula for milk chocolate. The first Hershey bar was produced in 1900. Hershey's Kisses were developed in 1907, and the Hershey's Bar with almonds was introduced in 1908.|$|E
25|$|The {{types of}} {{livestock}} {{raised in the}} 15 barangays of Quezon include carabao, cattle, hog, goat, and horse. Except for some cattle at Abut, Callanguigan and Minagbag as well as carabaos at Minagbag where animals are raised for sale, these animals are used more as work animals in tilling the land for agricultural and hauling farm products. These big animals (3,812 heads for cattle and 2,627 heads for Carabao) are grown/ maintained more as farm-helps rather than for commercial purposes. Some cattle however are good source of <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> and meat for local consumption.

25|$|Metrication in the United Kingdom, {{the process}} of {{introducing}} the metric system of measurement in place of imperial units, has made steady progress since the mid 20th century but today remains equivocal and varies by context. Most of government, industry and commerce use metric units, but imperial units are officially used to specify journey distances, vehicle speeds and the sizes of returnable milk containers, beer and cider glasses (though <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> is often still sold in multiples of pints, with the metric equivalent also marked). Imperial units are also often used to describe body measurements and vehicle fuel economy. In schools metric units are taught and used as the norm and imperial units that remain in common usage in the UK must also be taught.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} steps in {{preparing}} {{a cup of}} tea is a much-debated topic, and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in <b>fresh</b> <b>milk,</b> similar to the change in taste of UHT milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist it is better to add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed. Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer so the earlier you add milk the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the European Heart Journal found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.|$|E
