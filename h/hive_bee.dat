In {{the absence of any}} such a severely scientific administrator as we have been dreaming of, human society [24] is kept together by bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them. Social organization is not peculiar to men. Other societies, such as those constituted by bees and ants, have also arisen out of the advantage of co-operation in the struggle for existence; and their resemblances to, and their differences from, human society are alike instructive. The society formed by the <b>hive</b> <b>bee</b> fulfils the ideal of the communistic aphorism [...] "to each according to his needs, from each according to his capacity." [...] Within it, the struggle for existence is strictly limited. Queen, drones, and workers have each their allotted sufficiency of food; each performs the function assigned to it in the economy of the hive, and all contribute {{to the success of the}} whole cooperative society in its competition with rival collectors of nectar and pollen and with other enemies, in the state of nature without. In the same sense as the garden, or the colony, is a work of human art, the bee polity is a work of apiarian art, brought about by the cosmic process, working through the organization of the hymenopterous type.|$|E

We first perform an analysis of steady state bee populations given mortality rates within each bee caste and find that the honey bee colony is highly susceptible to hive and pupae mortality rates.

50|$|Five {{species of}} bees of {{commercial}} importance {{are found in}} India; Apis dorsata (Rock bee) (and a larger Himalayan subspecies, Apis dorsata laboriosa), Apis cerana indica (Indian <b>hive</b> <b>bee),</b> Apis florea (dwarf bee), Apis mellifera (European or Italian bee), and Tetragonula iridipennis (Dammer or stingless bee). Rock bees are aggressive and cannot be maintained but are harvested from the wild. Honey from dwarf bees is also harvested from the wild as these are nomadic and produce very small yields. Native Apis cerana and Apis mellifera introduced from the temperate zone are more amenable to culturing in artificial bee boxes. Dammer bees can be domesticated and are important factors in pollination of various crops but produce little honey.|$|E

Honey from the hill mountain region offers an exotic taste. Beekeeping in Nepal is regarded as a very rewarding occupation for many people. Nepal is host to five species of honeybee, but only the Asian <b>hive</b> <b>bee</b> (Ampis cerana) and the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) are kept in hives to manage for honey production. Communities who do not practice traditional beekeeping techniques called ‘honey hunters’, collect honey from the nests of wild species. Wild (organic) honey produced by Apis dorsata contains large amounts of enzymes and amino acids, attributing a good price in international markets.|$|E

40|$|Honeybees, Apis mellifera, {{gradually}} {{increase their}} rate of forage uptake as they gain foraging experience. This increase in foraging performance {{has been proposed}} to occur {{as a result of}} learning; however, factors affecting flight ability such as changes in physiological components of flight metabolism could also contribute to this pattern. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to assess the contribution of physiological changes to the increase in honeybee foraging performance. We investigated aspects of honeybee flight muscle biochemistry throughout the adult life, from non-foraging <b>hive</b> <b>bees,</b> through young and mature foragers, to old foragers near the end of their lifespan. Two-dimensional gel proteomic analysis on honeybee thorax muscle revealed an increase in several proteins from <b>hive</b> <b>bees</b> to mature foragers including Summary troponin T 10 a, aldolase and superoxide dismutase. By contrast, the activities (Vmax) of enzymes involved in aerobic performance, phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and cytochrome c oxidase, did not increase in the flight muscles of <b>hive</b> <b>bees,</b> young foragers, mature foragers and old foragers. However, citrate synthase activity was found to increase with foraging experience. Hence, our results suggest plasticity in both structural and metabolic components of flight muscles with foraging experience...|$|R

Here we present the first exact data on individual drone weight loss, especially from the red eyed pupal stage onwards.

A cerana police worker-laid eggs {{in the same way}} that A. florea and A. mellifera do, but are perhaps slightly more tolerant of worker-laid eggs than the other species.

40|$|Bees play a {{vital role}} in pollination. This paper focuses on the {{weighing}} process of honey. Honey is usually stored at the comb in a <b>hive.</b> <b>Bee</b> farmers brush bees away from the comb and then collect honey, and the collected honey is weighed afterward. However, such a process brings strong negative influences on bees and even leads to the death of bees. This paper therefore presents an Internet of Things-based weight monitoring system which uses weight sensors to measure the weight of honey and simplifies the whole weighing procedure. To verify the system, the weight measured by the system is compared to the weight of standard weights used for calibration by employing a linear regression model. The R 2 of the regression model is 0. 9788, which suggests that the weighing system is highly reliable and is able to be applied to obtain actual weight of honey. In the future, the weight data of honey can be used to find the relationship between honey production and different ecological parameters, such as bees’ foraging behavior and weather conditions. It is expected that the findings can serve as critical information for honey production improvement...|$|E

40|$|Vitellogenin is a female-specific glucolipoprotein yolk {{precursor}} {{produced by}} all oviparous animals. Vitellogenin expression is under hormonal control, and the protein is generally synthesized directly before yolk deposition. In the honeybee (Apis mellifera), vitellogenin {{is not only}} synthesized by the reproductive queen, {{but also by the}} functionally sterile workers. In summer, the worker population consists of a <b>hive</b> <b>bee</b> group performing a multitude of tasks including nursing inside the nest, and a forager group specialized in collecting nectar, pollen, water, and propolis. Vitellogenin is synthesized in large quantities by hive bees. When hive bees develop into foragers, their juvenile hormone titers increase, and this causes cessation of their vitellogenin production. This inverse relationship between vitellogenin synthesis and juvenile hormone is opposite to the norm in insects, and the underlying proximate processes and life-history reasons are still not understood. Here we document an alternative use of vitellogenin by showing that it is a source for the proteinaceous royal jelly that is produced by the hive bees. Hive bees use the jelly to feed larvae, queen, workers, and drones. This finding suggests that the evolution of a brood-rearing worker class and a specialized forager class in an advanced eusocial insect society has been directed by an alternative utilization of yolk protein...|$|E
40|$|A mysterious {{problem has}} {{developed}} within honey bee populations; in a worst case scenario, bee hives will spontaneously collapse {{as the entire}} population disappears from the hive. This phenomenon has been named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). The problem is recent and has no known cause, though it is surmised to stem from one or multiple infections. Though the causative agent(s) of CCD remains unknown, there are several defining factors of an “infected ” colony; disappearance {{of the majority of}} hive bees while the queen remains, and the avoidance of the abandoned hive by scavenging species. Absence of bee carcasses suggest the forager bees, {{whose job it is to}} obtain food for the colony, evacuate once affected. Adolescent hive bees, which care for the larval bees and the queen, are then drawn into premature foraging behavior. In order to gain insight into the possible dynamics of this phenomenon, we created a mathematical model that simulates the dynamics of a healthy hive. To this model we then add equations representing the disorder affecting the population. These equations account for the rapid exodus of forager bees from the hive; the loss of forager bees initiates the collapse of the entire colony. Our model predicts that the transition rate from <b>hive</b> <b>bee</b> to forager bee, along with the queen’s reproductive rate, dictates the outcome of an affected colony...|$|E
40|$|When a {{honeybee}} colony loses its queen, workers activate their ovaries {{and begin to}} lay eggs. This {{is accompanied by a}} shift in their pheromonal bouquet, which becomes more queen like. Workers of the Asian <b>hive</b> <b>bee</b> Apis cerana show unusually high levels of ovary activation and this can be interpreted as evidence for a recent evolutionary arms race between queens and workers over worker reproduction in this species. To further explore this, we compared the rate of pheromonal bouquet change between two honeybee sister species of Apis cerana and Apis mellifera under queenright and queenless conditions. We show that in both species, the pheromonal components HOB, 9 -ODA, HVA, 9 -HDA, 10 -HDAA and 10 -HDA have significantly higher amounts in laying workers than in non-laying workers. In the queenright colonies of A. mellifera and A. cerana the ratios (9 -ODA) / (9 -ODA+ 9 -HDA+ 10 -HDAA+ 10 -HDA) are not significantly different between the two species, but in queenless A. cerana colonies the ratio is significant higher than in A. mellifera, suggesting that in A. cerana, the workers’ pheromonal bouquet is dominated by the queen compound, 9 -ODA. The amount of 9 -ODA in laying A. cerana workers increase by over 585 % compared to the non-laying workers, that is 6. 75 times higher than in A. mellifera were laying workers only had 86 % more 9 -ODA compared to non-laying workers.

40|$|In stingless <b>bees,</b> {{recruitment}} of <b>hive</b> <b>bees</b> to food sources involves thoracic vibrations by foragers during trophallaxis. The temporal pattern of these vibrations correlates with the sugar {{concentration of the}} collected food. One possible pathway for transfering such information to nestmates is through airborne sound. In the present study, we investigated the transformation of thoracic vibrations into air particle velocity, sound pressure, and jet airflows in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Whereas particle velocity and sound pressure were found all around and above vibrating individuals, {{there was no evidence}} for a jet airflow as with honey bees. The largest particle velocities were measured 5 mm above the wings (16. 0 +/- 4. 8 mm s(- 1)). Around a vibrating individual, we found maximum particle velocities of 8. 6 +/- 3. 0 mm s(- 1) (horizontal particle velocity) in front of the bee`s head and of 6. 0 +/- 2. 1 mm s(- 1) (vertical particle velocity) behind its wings. Wing oscillations, which are mainly responsible for air particle movements in honey bees, significantly contributed to vertically oriented particle oscillations only close to the abdomen in M. scutellaris(distances <= 5 mm). Almost 80 % of the <b>hive</b> <b>bees</b> attending trophallactic food transfers stayed within a range of 5 mm from the vibrating foragers.

40|$|Includes {{published}} papers co-authored with othersIn all societies, {{cooperation between}} members {{is necessary to}} allow the society to function smoothly. However, as the interests of individuals rarely overlap completely, all societies contain members that act selfishly {{at the expense of}} the greater entity. Thus, policing mechanisms are generally required in order to maintain cohesion within the society. In social insects, conflict between individuals and the society are often reproductive in nature. Kin selection theory predicts that in haplo-diploid, polyandrous species such as honeybees, workers should largely refrain from producing their own offspring, as the workers collectively have higher inclusive fitness if they rear the sons of their mother, the queen. However, opportunities for personal reproduction at the expense of colony-level fitness are often exploited by individual workers, a phenomenon known as worker reproductive parasitism (WRP). This has led to the evolution of worker ‘policing’, in which workers selectively destroy worker-laid eggs that would otherwise be reared at the colony’s expense. In my PhD, I have investigated WRP in both the Western honeybee Apis mellifera, and the Asian <b>hive</b> <b>bee</b> A. cerana. The major theme of my research has been to elucidate the circumstances that afford opportunities for potential reproductive parasites to evade worker policing. This research is significant, as it yields insights into the conflicting selective forces that lead to the formation of societies, the selfish behaviour of the individuals that comprise them and how this behaviour is controlled. These insights are applicable to all social species, including humans...|$|E

Introduction: To anyone who intends to manage bees for profit, {{knowledge}} of their structural peculiarities and life history will aid greatly in determining more accurately what conditions are necessary to their greatest welfare. Such knowledge, however, will never {{take the place of}} an acquaintance with those conditions under which actual practice has shown that bees thrive, but it will form a good basis for an understanding of whatever practice has found best in the management of these industrious and profitable insects. It may also show in what ways practice may be improved. In its life history we trace the bee from the Branch Aethropoda, Class Henapoda, winged insects. This includes the family Apidae, or bee family, of which there are several marked types of genera, such as Apis, the <b>hive</b> <b>bee,</b> Bombus, the bumble bee; Hylocopa, the carpenter bee; Megachile, the leaf cutter, and many others. All of these are very interesting to study, and each fulfills a purpose in the economy of Nature; but in this paper only the first Apis, or the hive bee; can be considered. There is another, Melipona, the stingless honey bee of the American tropics, which has often been brought up with the expectation of realizing important practical results from it. So far this has proved a failure, their honey yield is small, not well ripened, and not easily harvested in good shape, as the honey cells are of dark wax, and arranged in irregular clumps, like those of our bumble bees...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{isolation}} between {{closely related}} species is often incomplete. The Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the Eastern <b>hive</b> <b>bee,</b> A. cerana have been allopatric for millions of years, but are nonetheless similar in morphology and behaviour. During the last century the two species were brought into contact anthropogenically, providing potential opportunities for interspecific matings. Hybrids between A. mellifera and A. cerana are inviable, so natural interspecific matings are of concern because they may reduce the viability of A. cerana and A. mellifera populations – two of the world's most important pollinators. We examined the mating behaviour of A. mellifera and A. cerana queens and drones from Caoba Basin, China and Cairns, Australia. Drone mating flight times overlap in both areas. Analysis of the spermathecal contents of queens with species-specific genetic markers indicated that in Caoba Basin, 14 % of A. mellifera queens mated {{with at least one}} A. cerana male, but we detected no A. cerana queens that had mated with A. mellifera males. Similarly, in Cairns, no A. cerana queens carried A. mellifera sperm, but one third of A. mellifera queens had mated with at least one A. cerana male. No hybrid embryos were detected in eggs laid by interspecifically-mated A. mellifera queens in either location. However A. mellifera queens artificially inseminated with A. cerana sperm produced inviable hybrid eggs, or unfertilised drones. This suggests that reproductive interference will impact the viability of honey bee populations wherever A. cerana and A. mellifera are in contact. This article is protected by copyright.
