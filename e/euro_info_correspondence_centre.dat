40|$|Abstract. After nearly 30 {{years of}} access surgery for haemodialysis, {{a survey of}} {{vascular}} access in a large population seemed relevant in order to analyse {{the state of the}} art. On 1 January 1988, 2195 patients in 52 centres in The Netherlands (population 14 714 900) were on long-term haemodialysis and 588 on continuous ambulant perito-neal dialysis (CAPD) for renal insufficiency. A questionnaire was mailed out, to which there was 100 % response. Of all the patients on long-term haemo-dialysis, 70 % had a Cimino fistula, 22 % a graft fistula, and 6 % a more proximal arm fistula. The remaining 2 % had a Scribner shunt. Of all the graft fistulae, the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft was the one most used (58 %), followed by the homologous vein graft (25 %), the autologous vein graft (13 %), and those made of other materials (4 %). Preference for acute access was recorded; catheteri-sation of the subclavian vein was used almost exclusively in 17 centres, while in 24 centres it was chosen in more than 50 % of the cases. The femoral vein was almost always the choice for acute access in 6 centres and it was selected in more than 50 % of the cases in 17 centres. Another alternative, the Scribner shunt, was applied in selected cases in 22 of the 52 centres.

40|$|The Letters of Richard Cobden (1804 - 1865) provides, in four printed volumes, {{the first}} {{critical}} edition of Cobden's letters, publishing the complete text in as near the original form as possible. The letters {{are accompanied by}} full scholarly apparatus, together with an introduction to each volume which re-assesses Cobden's importance in their light. Together, these volumes make available a unique source of the understanding of British liberalism in its European and international contexts, throwing new light {{on issues such as}} the repeal of the Corn Laws, British radical movements, the Crimean War, the Indian Mutiny, Anglo-French relations, and the American Civil War. The fourth and final volume, drawing on some forty-six archives worldwide, is dominated by Cobden's search for a permanent political legacy at home and abroad, following the severe check to his health in the autumn of 1859. In January 1860, he succeeded in negotiating the Anglo-French Commercial Treaty, a landmark in Anglo-French relations designed to bind the two nations closer together, and to provide the basis for a Europe united by free trade. Yet the Treaty's benefits were threatened by a continuing naval arms race between Britain and France, fuelled by what Cobden saw as self-interested scare mongering in his tract The Three Panics (1862). By 1862 an even bigger danger was the possibility that British industry's need for cotton might precipitate intervention in the American Civil War. Much of Cobden's <b>correspondence</b> now <b>centred</b> on the necessity of non-intervention and a campaign for the reform of international maritime law, while he played a major part in attempts to alleviate the effects of the 'Cotton Famine' in Lancashire. In addition to Anglo-American relations, Cobden, the 'International Man', continued to monitor the exercise of British power around the globe. He was convinced that the 'gunboat' diplomacy of his prime antagonist, Lord Palmerston, was ultimately harmful to Britain, whose welfare demanded limited military expenditure and the dismantling of the British 'colonial system'. Known for a long time as the 'prophet in the wilderness', in 1864 Cobden welcomed Palmerston's inability to intervene in the Schleswig-Holstein crisis as a key turning-point in Britain's foreign policy, which, together with the imminent end of the American Civil War, opened up the prospect of a new reform movement at home. Disappointed with the growing apathy of the entrepreneurs he had once mobilised in the Anti-Corn Law League, Cobden now promoted the enfranchisement of the working classes as necessary and desirable in order to achieve the reform of the aristocratic state for which he had campaigned since the 1830 s...|$|R
40|$|The {{correspondence}} principle offered {{a unique opportunity}} to test the Horowitz and Maldacena mechanism at <b>correspondence</b> point "the <b>centre</b> of mass energies around (M_s/(g_s) ^ 2) ". First by using Horowitz and Maldacena proposal, the black hole final state for closed strings is studied and the entropy of these states is calculated. Then, to consider the closed string states, a copy of the original Hilbert space is constructed with a set of operators of creation/anihilation that have the same commutation properties as the original ones. The total Hilbert space is the tensor product of the two spaces H_right⊗ H_left, where in this case H_left/right denotes the physical quantum states space of the closed string. It is shown that closed string states can be represented by a maximally entangled two-mode squeezed state of the left and right spaces of closed string. Also, the entropy for these string states is calculated. It is found that black hole entropy matches the closed string entropy at transition point. This means that our result is consistent with {{correspondence principle}} and thus HM mechanism in string theory works. Consequently the unitarity of the black hole in string theory can be reconciled. However Gottesman and Preskill point out that, in this scenario, departures from unitarity can arise due to interactions between the collapsing body and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon and information can be lost. By extending the Gottesman and Preskill method to string theory, the amount of information transformation from the matter to the state of outgoing Hagedorn radiation for closed strings is obtained. It is observed that information is lost for closed strings.

40|$|Jenny Helena Florence O’Hara {{was born}} in 1892 in Madoc, Ontario. She married Robert Newton Pincock in 1915. He was an osteopath. Her sister, Minnie O’Hara married Fred Maines in 1922. He was educated at Victoria University in Toronto and was an ordained {{minister}} who had served with the YMCA overseas during the First World War. In 1927, Jenny, Minnie and Reverend Fred Maines began to hold séances. They worked in collaboration with Mr. William Cartheuser who was an American medium. Jenny Pincock’s Trails of Truth documents these séances. Most of the séances took place at 47 Church Street, St. Catharines which was the residence of Reverend Maines. Other participants in the séances included: Dr. E. J. Pratt and his wife Viola; poet W. W. E. Ross and other local citizens. The group were basically middle class, well-educated citizens. The Maines and Pincocks began the Church of the Divine Revelation in St. Catharines, Ontario on Sept. 6, 1930 with Fred Maines as the ordained minister. He remained in this position from 1930 - 1935. Dr. Anderson (in spirit form) provided instructions for {{the running of the}} church. In 1931, the United Church of Canada into which Maines had originally been ordained suspended him because of his foray into spiritualism. Maines was also ordained into the spiritualist ministry. In 1932, they established the Radiant Healing Centre which was also located in St. Catharines, Ontario. On the Radiant Healing <b>Centre</b> <b>correspondence</b> it states that the centre is “under guidance of ‘Dr. Anderson’ who manifests in direct voice through psychic powers of Dr. William Cartheuser”. William worked for the New York section of the American Society for Psychical Research. He also maintained a home at Lily Dale Spiritualist Camp, New York. Jenny spent summers working as a librarian at Lily Dale. It was thought that a séance could provide alternative medicine. The proponents of this train of thought did not believe in a division of medicine and faith. They believed in a unity of spirit, mind and body. Supposedly, voices emanated from trumpets (aluminum cones) which were used for the séances. These voices were distinctly different from the medium’s voice. The trumpets were also known to levitate. People felt as if they were being touched and taps on the table were heard. “Dr. Anderson” was an old-fashioned (deceased) doctor who supposedly dispensed medical wisdom and sympathy. The spirits at the Healing Centre did not rely on direct physical contact, but worked though prescribed movements of the participants which meant that healing could take place over great amounts of time or space. When members of the church joined as a group, even in absentia, they sent forth a radiant healing light. The healing force could be realized and dispensed by the ‘angelic helpers’. Newton Pincock died in 1928, but was said to perform osteopathic treatments after his death as the force of his spirit would apply itself to the body. In 1935, Jenny Pincock broke ties with William Cartheuser. She began to suspect that William had let his mind influence the messages from the spirit, but she did not doubt his powers as a medium. A publication called Progression was produced by this group, with its first issue being put out in October of 1932. Publication ceased in 1938. Women were particularly drawn to this spiritualist type of religion. Women were encouraged to take control over their minds and bodies whereas in biomedical circles they were deemed weak and powerless.

40|$|In Part I a brief {{historical}} {{review of}} the existing information on diamond is given. In Part II a short account of all the experimental techniques {{used in the present}} investigation is given. Part III deals with the optical and interferometric studies of the crystallographic traces on (111) cleavage faces of diamond octahedrons cleaved by three different methods(a) by the usual method of cleaving (b) by breaking and (c) by pushing. These studies are further extended to the traces on (111) cleavage faces obtained from (a) a regular octahedron (b) a dodecahedron and (c) a crystal of irregular habit. The occurrence of these traces is fully discussed and they have been attributed due to the deposition of some weak (111) planes during the growth of the crystal. This is confirmed by the measurements made on their displacements across large cleavage steps (Chapter 7). Part TV deals with the etching of diamond cleavage faces. A brief {{review of the}} etch methods used for crystallographic research and the existing information on the etching of diamond surfaces are given in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5 various etch patterns formed on the octahedral cleavages are described and fully discussed. It is established that etch pits are distributed in three ways (a) random small pits (b) striking linear arrangements and (c) individual isolated pits usually larger than others. The pit concentrations are found to vary from 10 per sq. mm. to over 10 per sq. mm. and some small regions are found quite free from imperfections. The etching has revealed small oriented ring cracks. Their occurrence is explained as being due to the shock of cleavage. Chapter 6 deals with the etching of oppositely matched faces. It is demonstrated that there is a remarkable degree of coincidence and matching (in mirror images) of the etch patterns on the matched faces. Nearly one to one <b>correspondence</b> between the <b>centres</b> of the isolated pits and also between the sets of complex linear patterns is established. It is observed that the cleavage ledges displace sideways due to the solution process and this produces an apparent systematic displacement of the etch patterns. These observations are fully discussed and are accounted for. In Chapter 7 by etching small cleaved out blocks a striking stratigraphy is revealed and it is proved that the individual stratigraphical sheets go right through the whole crystal. The etch strata therefore reveal {{for the first time the}} whole history of the growth of the diamond studied. The implications are briefly discussed. In Chapter 8 the formation of rectilinear and curvilinear pits is fully described and it is shown that (a) the rectilinearity or curvilinearity of etch pits depends primarily on the rate of etch (b) rectilinearity is highly sensitive to temperature. The mechanism of pit formation is discussed in some detail and the way in which linear crystal defects lead either to flat bottomed or point bottomed etch pits is also discussed. In Part five a valuable technique developed for testing the glazier's diamonds is described. The onset and progressive deterioration of the cutting edges (both polished and natural) of glazier's diamonds (and consequently of the cut) studied by this technique is fully described. It is observed that the natural cutting edges are much more wear resistant compared to the polished cutting edges. The results are briefly discussed. In Appendix A some graphitization experiments aiming at clarifying the meaning of the frosted appearance of some natural stones are described. A small diamond graphitized at 1250 °C in N 2 at a pressure of 3 mm. when heating in potassium nitrate fractured by cleavage in the melt. Thus a section across and through the graphitized region was exposed and subjected to etch. Prom the etch patterns on the cleavage faces the depth of the graphite layer is assessed from 40 to 50 microns. In Appendix B observations made on trigons on (111) cleavage faces of natural octahedron and (111) faces of synthetic diamonds are described. It is observed that the orientation of trigons and etch pits on (111) faces of synthetic diamond is the same as on (111) faces of natural diamonds. The results are discussed in the light of the formation of trigons. <p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the audit was to assess how effectively and efficiently the ATO managed contact centres {{as part of its}} overall service delivery strategy. To form an opinion against the audit objective, the ANAO adopted the following high-level criteria: 	contact centres are effectively integrated with other ATO client communication channels, such as the online and on-site channels; 	contact centres are supported by effective business and administrative arrangements; 	contact centres provide a high level of client service; and 	contact centres are managed efficiently. The audit principally focused on the ATO’s handling of incoming telephone calls by contact centres. Overall conclusion The provision of high quality and accessible services to clients underpins the ATO’s promotion of compliance with Australia’s extensive systems of taxation and superannuation. A key component of the ATO’s approach to engaging with clients is its network of 13 contact centres that, in 2013 – 14, handled 10  million inbound telephone calls—representing almost half of its 20. 7  million client contacts in that year. While the ATO is aiming to make online contact with clients the preferred communication channel by 2020, contact centres are likely to remain an important channel for large numbers of clients {{in the absence of any}} action to reduce the demand for these services. Contact centres are a major communication channel for clients to contact the ATO and have generally been managed effectively. Overall, the arrangements established for telephone contact provide clients with ready access to a broad range of call services, with the handling of inbound calls resulting in relatively high levels of overall client satisfaction over many years. The ATO has generally sound organisational arrangements to manage calls, although an overarching client communication channel strategy is yet to be established. While not being in a position to readily demonstrate the efficiency of its contact centre operations, there is evidence to indicate that the ATO has achieved value for money from the use of outsource providers and it has also maintained a strong focus on monitoring and reducing the costs of its own contact centres. Until 2012, the ATO had a distinct client communication strategy in place covering the four key channels—contact <b>centres,</b> <b>correspondence,</b> online and shopfronts. This strategy has not been updated or replaced since reaching its nominal expiry date in 2012. While a draft digital strategy was prepared in July 2014 for online services, this strategy focuses on the ATO’s digital presence and does not provide or reference a detailed plan for the provision of high quality and accessible services through other channels, including call services. Accordingly, there would be merit in the ATO developing a strategy that more fully encompasses all service channels and provides a plan for transitioning to the preferred online channel environment. As the management of the four service channels is assigned to a number of groups and BSLs across the organisation, there is also scope for the ATO to adopt organisational arrangements that better support the coordinated delivery of client engagement services across the channels. To efficiently handle call volumes and effectively address the needs of clients, the ATO directs calls to staff with relevant skills and knowledge. In general, calls of a specialised nature are handled by ATO contact centres, with the more straightforward calls increasingly being directed to outsource providers. Outsourcing has been particularly effective in enabling the ATO to manage significant fluctuations in call workloads, particularly during ‘Tax Time’ from July to October each year. The ATO has also made effective use of technology, including in managing periods of high call volumes, such as providing opportunities for callers to receive a call back when their call reaches the front of the queue. As well as relatively high levels of overall satisfaction with contact centres, client satisfaction surveys indicate reasonably high levels of satisfaction across most of the major elements of service, including the time taken to resolve a query (84  per cent in 2013 – 14) and the overall quality of information provided (86  per cent in 2013). The main exception has been a reasonably significant level of dissatisfaction with call waiting times, with only 57  per cent of respondents satisfied with the length of waiting times in 2013 – 14. At present, the ATO’s call answering service commitment for its general information line only relates to Tax Time. Using service commitments that measure the extent to which the ATO meets call wait times throughout the year would better enable it to manage call wait times and enhance client satisfaction. In recent years, the ATO has taken a number of steps to improve the efficiency of its contact centre operations. These steps have included changes to the skill levels of contact centre staff and better support for CSRs to improve first contact resolution rates (that is, the percentage of calls resolved by the CSR who first answers the call), with the ATO reporting a first response resolution rate of around 80  per cent over the past two years. These results need to be viewed with some caution, however, as not all calls included in the rate have been satisfactorily resolved. For example, calls that cannot be answered because a caller is unable to establish proof of identify are treated as being resolved when, from the client’s perspective, the matter has not been resolved as they need to call again. As well as improving its measurement of first contact resolution rates, there is scope for the ATO to implement a consistent methodology for calculating call handling costs.
