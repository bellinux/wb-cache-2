30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} new Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS) {{models for the}} Skew-Gen-t (Skewed Generalized t) and NIG (Normal-Inverse Gaussian) distributions as alternatives to the recent DCS models for the Student’s-t and EGB 2 (Exponential Generalized Beta of the second kind) distributions, respectively. The DCS models we propose include stochastic local level, stochastic seasonality, and irregular components with DCS-EGARCH (Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) volatility dynamics. DCS models are robust to extreme observations, whereas standard financial time series models are not. We use data from the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>Quetzal</b> (GTQ) to United States Dollar (USD) exchange rate {{for the period of}} 4 th January 1994 – 30 th June 2017. This dataset exhibits significant rises and falls in the GTQ/USD that lead to extreme observations, stochastic seasonality with dynamic amplitude, and volatility dynamics. These seasonality dynamics of the GTQ/USD are related to the Guatemalan trade-related currency movements, receipt and payment of foreign loans, and remittance payments of Guatemalans working abroad. We show that the in-sample statistical performance of the DCS-Skew-Gen-t and the DCS-NIG models is superior to that of the DCS-t and the DCS-EGB 2 models, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the statistical performance of all DCS models is superior to that of the standard financial time series model.|$|E
30|$|Historically, Guatemala has {{ranked among}} the largest {{exporters}} of several agricultural products worldwide. According to the United States Dollar (USD) value of sugar exports, Guatemala is the fourth ranked country in the world, for example, with a value of USD 826.2 million during 2017 (that is 3 % of total sugar exports worldwide, following Brazil with 41.3 %, Thailand with 9.4 % and France with 4.9 %). Guatemala is the fourteenth ranked country for coffee exports worldwide, with a value of USD 748.6 million during 2017 (that is 2.3 % of total coffee exports worldwide, following Ethiopia with 2.9 %, United States with 2.7 % and the Netherlands with 2.3 %). Moreover, Guatemala is the fifth ranked country for banana exports worldwide, with a value of USD 882.3 million during 2017 (that is 7.1 % of total banana exports worldwide, following Ecuador with 24.6 %, Belgium with 8.5 %, Costa Rica with 8.4 % and Colombia with 7.4 %). We also highlight that Guatemala is the top cardamom producing country worldwide, with a total value of exports of USD 277.1 million during 2016 (that is 55.7 % of total cardamom exports worldwide, followed by Nepal with 12.4 %, India with 8.7 % and the United Arab Emirates with 6.2 %). The sugarcane, coffee, banana and cardamom production in Guatemala has a seasonal component related to weather conditions. Therefore, the export-related currency movements of these products may lead to an exchange rate seasonality (i.e. annual seasonality) of the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>Quetzal</b> (GTQ) to USD (GTQ/USD) exchange rate.|$|E
