Common practice is to <b>derate</b> 20 degrees Celsius from the maximum rated temperature limit. Relays operating at rated load are affected by their environment. Oil vapor may greatly decrease the contact life, and dust or dirt may cause the contacts to burn {{before the end of}} normal operating life. Control relay life cycle varies from 50,000 to over one million cycles depending on the electrical loads on the contacts, duty cycle, application, {{and the extent to which}} the relay is derated. When a control relay is operating at its derated value, it is controlling a smaller value of current than its maximum make and break ratings. This is often done to extend the operating life of a control relay. The table lists the relay derating factors for typical industrial control applications.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} {{it is not}} possible to obtain the quoted theoretical maximum throughput rate for machines in a placement system. It is necessary to <b>derate</b> the theoretical numbers to obtain realistic values, due to unexpected downtime, board load and unload time and machine configuration. Other factors include PWB size, component mix, and the requirement for more complex vision recognition for fine-pitch components. There are many techniques of derating. Global derating considers system-wide stops, slow-downs and set ups as well as machine factors. To calculate the amount of global or system derating, one should take the average of the number of total components placed per hour in a long period (i.e. an entire product shift). Regularly scheduled stops should be included when determining the level of global derating the system requires.Rigorous derating, which considers each piece of equipment in service for a particular product individually, must be conducted by specific machine model for the line balancing. Rigorous derating values are necessary for full optimization of the process.|$|E

40|$|To sustain in {{the vibrant}} field of civil aviation, the {{aircraft}} and engine manufacturers {{are in the}} pursuit of delivering efficient systems with the best economics. In umpteen scenarios of growing interest, engine maintenance cost due to scheduled maintenance is of importance. The current research is focused on estimation of the maintenance factors, such as severity and shop visit rate to study the operational scenarios and concurrent technologies. The severity, defined as relative engine damage is estimated by blending the aircraft performance, gas turbine performance, gas turbine design and life estimation methods towards transforming the thrust variation into life estimates, reflecting the severity on critical Life Limited Part (LLP) of an aircraft engine. The Shop Visit Rate (SVR) is predicted based on Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) margin consumption due to gas turbine performance degradation. The severity studies reveal that Hight Pressure Turbine (HPT) blade and disc are critical, depicting engine severity. Lower thrust engine severity is dominated by cyclic damage (low cycle fatigue) and large thrust engines by steady state damage (creep). The operational factors, take-off <b>derate</b> and Outside Air Temperature (OAT) have more sensitivity on severity of aircraft engines. The use of climb <b>derate,</b> reduces the damage on large thrust engines considerably, especially for three shaft engines. Cooling effectiveness and thermal barrier coating are important technological factors for reducing the severity level. The SVR prediction on lower and large thrust engines, depict the take-off EGT as a source for shop visits, governed by operational parameters such as takeoff <b>derate,</b> OAT, trip length and engine wash. The engine aging curves are represented as Weibull distribution based on severity and SVR. Severity estimation and shop visit prediction methodology, demonstrated through an integrated tool will serve as a decision making element for comparing competitive engines, operational strategies and engine technologies...|$|E

The increased vulnerability of the components to atmospheric particle strikes poses a big threat in attaining the reliability required for various mission critical applications.

A general solution to this problem is to arrive at a soft error mitigation methodology with an acceptable implementation overhead and error tolerance level. This implementation overhead can then be reduced by taking advantage of various <b>derating</b> effects like logical <b>derating,</b> electrical <b>derating</b> and timing window <b>derating,</b> and/or making use of application redundancy, e. g. redundancy in firmware/software executing on the so designed robust hardware.

40|$|This aims to {{find the}} {{potentiality}} of introducing absorption chiller systems to improve the diesel power plant performance in Sri Lanka. The energy efficient operation of diesel power plants is very much important for the country due to {{the high cost of}} generation of thermal electricity. Therefore waste heat of diesel power plant is utilized to run a suitable absorption chiller. The considered waste heat is mainly of exhaust and cooling water in the diesel engines of the power plant. The performance of the power generating diesel engines is considered in two ways. That is in terms of specific fuel oil consumption (SFC) and engine deration. The SFC of the engines varies due to many factors. Since the site conditions in Sri Lanka are not in standard conditions the higher SFC and engine deration is possible. The ISO standard site conditions mean the 25 oC (77 oF) ambient temperature, 30 % relative humidity and a model was developed to evaluate the performance of particular engines. All the temperature values in the model are given in Fahrenheit degrees (oF). It is observed that the engine SFC is low and the engine will not <b>derate</b> at the standard site conditions. From the model it is obvious that when the ambient temperature is 70 oF (21. 1 oC) the engine will not <b>derate</b> due to the effect of humidity even though the percentage of relative humidity reaches 100. In contrast, above 133. 6 oF (56. 4 oC) ambient temperature the power plant diesel engines <b>derate</b> due to the effect of humidity irrespective of the value of percentage relative humidity.
