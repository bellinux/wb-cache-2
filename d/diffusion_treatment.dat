5000|$|In 1947, Kirkendall {{found that}} an inert marker set {{at a point in}} a binary alloy moves from the initial sate point after the <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment.</b> [...] The {{phenomena}} are so called Kirkendall effect and it was considered that we cannot understand it from the existing theory of binary interdiffusion in those days. As a result, a new concept of intrinsic diffusion was then introduced for understanding the Kirkendall effect in the interdiffusion problems. Based on the intrinsic diffusion concept, Darken derived a relation between an interdiffusion coefficient and intrinsic diffusion coefficients in a binary interdiffusion in 1948. At present, however, it is revealed that the so-called Darken equation itself is mathematically wrong in the derivation process. Although the concentration of diffusion particles is a real quantity in physics, the temperature is a thermodynamic state quantity. As far as the shape of heat conduction material is unchangeable during a thermal treatment, the coordinate system of heat equation set in a material is a fixed one, since the coordinate system is not influenced by variations of the material internal structure. On the other hand, strictly speaking, the coordinate system of diffusion equation set in the diffusion field (solvent) is a moving one, since the origin of coordinate system is generally influenced by such variations.|$|E

And with the increase of diffusion temperature, the current oscillation behaviors donated by the current oscillation domains in solution of 180 g/L H 2 SO 4 gradually disappeared. When the temperature is up to 500 ˚C and 700 ˚C, no current oscillation phenomena can be observed.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the use of}} {{nitrogen}} or carbon as alloying elements in plasma <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment</b> of TiAl 6 V 4 is beneficial for the load-supporting properties of the base material. The plasma <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment</b> produces a compound layer consisting of nitrides or carbides and an inner diffusion zone, essentially characterized by the presence of nitrogen- or carbon-rich alpha-Ti crystals which are embedded in the metal matrix. This results in a hardness gradient from the interior to the surface. To avoid hydrogen embrittlement, plasma nitriding is performed in a pure nitrogen atmosphere. The formation of soot by carburizing could be avoided by optimizing the carbon flow during plasma carburizing. The influence of plasma nitriding and carburizing on the adhesion of the TiC coating depends on the plasma diffusion pretreatment and the conditions of the TiC coating. Plasma-nitrocarburizing pretreatment leads to the best adhesion of the TiC coating; the critical load of failure is 80 % higher than in the case of TiC on base material. A critical load of approximately 33 N was found under the optimum parameters. We conclude that the combination of plasma <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment</b> and TiC coating extends the tribological applicability of TiAl 6 V 4 in many industrial sectors.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{diffusion}} on platinum coatings deposited {{on the surface of}} nickel based superalloy was evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: The platinum coatings with thickness of 3 mm and 7 mm were deposited by electroplating process on Inconel 713 LC Ni-base superalloy. The heat treatment of electroplating coatings at the temperature 1050 °C during 2 h under argon atmosphere was performed. The microstructure investigations of the heat treated coatings were conducted by the use of optical microscope (Nikon Epiphot 300) and a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S- 3400 N) equipped with an X-radiation detector EDS (VOYAGER of NORAN INSTRUMENTS). The phase composition was identified by X-ray (ARL X’TRAX) diffractometer. The surface roughness parameter - Ra was evaluated by Perthometer S 2 MAHR equipment. Findings: The microstructure of platinum electroplating coating with thickness of 3 µm after <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment</b> consists of two phases: γ-Ni and (Al 0. 25 Pt 0. 75) Ni 3. The increase of platinum thickness from 3 µm to 7 µm does not influence the phase composition of heat treated coatings. Heat treatment of platinum electroplating coatings causes the increase of surface roughness parameter as a result of unequal mass flow of platinum and nickel. Research limitations/implications: The results will be used in the future investigations to explain the mechanism of reaction of platinum as a modifier in aluminide coatings. Practical implications: The platinum electroplating coatings after <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment</b> and aluminizing process are widely used as coatings for turbine blades of aircraft engines.

This work extends the existing knowledge of sound propagation to such areas by a scale model study, rather than by model calculations. The scale model study was executed for two parallel urban canyons at a 1 to 40 scale, with a point source located in one canyon. Cases with acoustically hard façades and absorption and <b>diffusion</b> façade <b>treatments</b> were in vestigated. To correct for excess air attenuation of the measurements, a wavelet-based method has been applied. The measurement results in the shielded canyon show that, {{in contrast to the}} directly exposed street canyon, the levels and the decay times are quite constant over the length of the canyon. The energy-time curve in the shielded canyon is characterized by a rise time, which can be related to the sound pressure level. The rise times and decays can be explained by separate reflection, diffraction and diffusion processes. A closed courtyard situation enlarges the level difference between acoustically hard façades and applied façade absorption or <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatments</b> at both the directly exposed and shielded side. A comparison between measurements with two different diffusion mechanisms, horizontal and vertical diffusion, reveals that vertical diffusion yields lower levels at the shielded side compared to horizontal diffusion for the investigated situations...|$|R

In this paper micro-abrasion wear testing is {{used to evaluate the}} wear resistance of triode plasma diffusion-treated, single-layered TiN-, CrAlN-, and WC/C-coated and duplex-diffusion and coated Ti– 6 Al– 4 V under uniform three-body rolling abrasion. Nanoindentation, Knoop microhardness, mechan- ical surface profilometry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, were used to characterise the surfaces under investigation. Optimum testing conditions for rolling abra- sion were established by varying the test parameters and resultant severity of contact. Very low normal loads and high volume fractions of particles in the abrasive slurry are necessary to obtain predictable and reproducible results. Relatively coarse SiC abrasive particles, having a mean diameter of around 3 m, appear more suitable for micro-abrasion testing of the samples investigated, compared to finer Al 2 O 3 particles. Problems associated with the measurement of the scar volume and subsequent calculation of the wear rate for hard coatings deposited on relatively soft metals like titanium are identified, and suit- able testing and measurement techniques are suggested. Three-dimensional wear scar maps generated by mechanical stylus profilometry were used to measure the wear volumes. Under the test conditions used, wear coefficients can be determined from perforating and non-perforating tests, although perforat- ing tests provide more consistent results. Triode plasma <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatments,</b> plasma-assisted (PA) PVD TiN and PAPVD CrAlN can reduce the specific wear rate of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V, while PACVD-based WC/C coatings do not provide suitable protection against abrasive wear.

40|$|Giant steps is a {{technique}} to accelerate Monte Carlo radiative transfer in optically-thick cells of astrophysical atmospheres by greatly {{reducing the number of}} Monte Carlo steps needed to propagate photon packets through such cells. Giant steps replaces the exact <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment</b> of ordinary Monte Carlo radiative transfer in the cells by an approximate <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment.</b> In this paper, we describe the basic idea of giant steps and report demonstration giant-steps flux calculations for the grey atmosphere. Speed-up factors of order 100 are obtained relative to ordinary Monte Carlo radiative transfer. In practical applications, speed-up factors of order ten (Mazzali et al. 2001) and perhaps more are possible. The speed-up factor is likely to be significantly application-dependent and there is a trade-off between speed-up and accuracy. This paper and past work (Mazzali et al. 2001) suggest that giant-steps error can probably be kept to a few percent by using sufficiently large boundary-layer optical depths while still maintaining large speed-up factors. Thus, giant steps can be characterized as a moderate accuracy radiative transfer technique.

40|$|Abstract. Giant steps is a {{technique}} to accelerate Monte Carlo radiative transfer in opticallythick cells (which are isotropic and homogeneous in matter properties and into which astrophysical atmospheres are divided) by greatly {{reducing the number of}} Monte Carlo steps needed to propagate photon packets through such cells. In an optically-thick cell, packets starting from any point (which can be regarded a point source) well away from the cell wall act essentially as packets diffusing from the point source in an infinite, isotropic, homogeneous atmosphere. One can replace many ordinary Monte Carlo steps that a packet diffusing from the point source takes by a randomly directed giant step whose length is slightly less than the distance to the nearest cell wall point from the point source. The giant step is assigned a time duration equal to the time for the RMS radius for a burst of packets diffusing from the point source to have reached the giant step length. We call assigning giant-step time durations this way RMS-radius (RMSR) synchronization. Propagating packets by series of giant steps in giant-steps random walks in the interiors of optically-thick cells constitutes the technique of giant steps. Giant steps effectively replaces the exact <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment</b> of ordinary Monte Carlo radiative transfer in optically-thick cells by an approximate <b>diffusion</b> <b>treatment.</b> In this paper, we describe the basic idea of giant steps and report demonstration giantstep...|$|E

40|$|During forming {{operations}} {{the contact}} conditions {{relating to the}} surface of the tools, the intermediate coolant or lubricant and the hot work piece material are determining the material flow and the resulting wear. The possibilities for an optimization of the tool surfaces are aspects of various scientific activities of IST and IFUM and are subject of this paper. Tools typically made of hot working steel can be treated with different technologies in order to achieve wear resistant properties. First of all, the surface is mainly determined by its topography which is defined by the manufacturing method or applied finishing technology. This paper will give an overview to adjustable surface properties with additional conditioning methods like severe shot peening. The stabilization of the topography is a new approach to enhance the wear resistance of forming tools. Several models like the Abbott-Firestone graph are used in order to obtain suitable describing parameters such as the roughness-parameter s. The development of s during the running-in stage has a strong influence on the tool life which can be shown. A stabilization of the topographical conditions can enhance the service life of the tools.
