More precisely, a null {{in any of these}} fields would allow any value in the other one, even on that is not found in Authors table. For example, if Authors contained only ('Doe', 'John'), then ('Smith', NULL) would satisfy the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> constraint. SQL-92 added two extra options for narrowing down the matches in such cases. If MATCH PARTIAL is added after the REFERENCES declaration then any non-null must match the <b>foreign</b> <b>key,</b> e. g. ('Doe', NULL) would still match, but ('Smith', NULL) would not. Finally, if MATCH FULL is added then ('Smith', NULL) would not match the constraint either, but (NULL, NULL) would still match it.|$|E

Much of this melody is in the mode of B-flat major, the main key of the entire piece; however, during bars 11 and 12, the mode shifts to G minor. This shift demonstrates one of Joplin's late-life techniques: establishing a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> within the framework of a strain.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the child}} and parent table may, in fact, be the same table, i.e. the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> refers {{back to the same}} table.

50|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>keys</b> play an {{essential}} role in database design.

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{relational}} databases, a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table. In simpler words, the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> is defined in a second table, but {{it refers to the}} primary key or a unique key in the first table. For example, a table called Employee has a primary key called employee_id. Another table called Employee Details has a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> which references employee_id in order to uniquely identify the relationship between both tables.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the purpose}} of the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> is to {{identify}} a particular row of the referenced table, it is generally required that the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> is equal to the candidate key in some row of the primary table, or else have no value (the NULL value.). This rule is called a referential integrity constraint between the two tables.Because violations of these constraints can be the source of many database problems, most database management systems provide mechanisms to ensure that every non-null <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> corresponds to a row of the referenced table.|$|E

50|$|For {{referential}} integrity {{to hold in}} a relational database, any column in a base table that is declared a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> can contain either a null value, or only values from a parent table's primary key or a candidate key. In other words, when a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> value is used it must reference a valid, existing primary key in the parent table. For instance, deleting a record that contains a value referred to by a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> in another table would break {{referential integrity}}. Some relational database management systems (RDBMS) can enforce referential integrity, normally either by deleting the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> rows as well to maintain integrity, or by returning an error and not performing the delete. Which method is used may be determined by a referential integrity constraint defined in a data dictionary.|$|E
50|$|In a {{relational}} database, a weak entity is {{an entity}} that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone; therefore, it must use a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> {{in conjunction with}} its attributes to create a primary key.

We show that integrity constraints such as <b>keys</b> and <b>foreign</b> <b>keys</b> affect consistency of such specifications. We prove that the consistency problem for incomplete specifications with <b>keys</b> and <b>foreign</b> <b>keys</b> can always be solved in NP. We then show a dichotomy result, classifying the complexity of the problem as NP-complete or PTIME, depending on the precise set of features used in incomplete descriptions. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{natural join}} is arguably {{one of the}} most {{important}} operators since it is the relational counterpart of logical AND. Note carefully that if the same variable appears in each of two predicates that are connected by AND, then that variable stands for the same thing and both appearances must always be substituted by the same value. In particular, natural join allows the combination of relations that are associated by a <b>foreign</b> <b>key.</b> For example, in the above example a <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> probably holds from Employee.DeptName to Dept.DeptName and then the natural join of Employee and Dept combines all employees with their departments. Note that this works because the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> holds between attributes with the same name. If this is not the case such as in the <b>foreign</b> <b>key</b> from Dept.manager to Employee.Name then we have to rename these columns before we take the natural join. Such a join is sometimes also referred to as an equijoin (see θ-join).|$|E
