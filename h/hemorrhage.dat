5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from <b>hemorrhage.</b> Intracerebral <b>hemorrhage,</b> with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid <b>hemorrhage,</b> and intraventricular <b>hemorrhage.</b> Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid <b>hemorrhage</b> involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular <b>hemorrhage</b> occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, <b>hemorrhage</b> from an AVM may lead to intracerebral <b>hemorrhage</b> (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid <b>hemorrhage),</b> there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH.

This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} intraocular pressure (IOP) -reducing treatment {{on the development of}} disc <b>hemorrhages</b> in patients with glaucoma. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of patients in the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial, followed up to 11 years (median = 8 years). PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly detected glaucoma randomized to argon laser trabeculoplasty plus betaxolol (n = 129) or no initial treatment (n = 126), followed with tonometry, perimetry, and ophthalmoscopy every 3 months, and fundus photography every 6 months. METHODS: Logistic regression expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), analysis of variance, and Cox time-dependent models, expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence (yes/no) and frequency of disc <b>hemorrhages.</b> RESULTS: Disc <b>hemorrhages</b> were identified in approximately 55 % of all patients, whether by ophthalmoscopy or review of photographs. In analyses including data up to the time of progression, disc <b>hemorrhages</b> were equally common among treated and control patients: 51. 2 % versus 45. 2 %, respectively (P = 0. 34), based on ophthalmoscopy, and 50. 4 % versus 44. 4 %, respectively (P = 0. 34), based on photographs. Gender was the only factor related to the presence of disc <b>hemorrhages</b> detected by both ophthalmoscopy (OR = 0. 48; CI, 0. 26 - 0. 88; P = 0. 022) and photographs (OR = 0. 64; CI, 0. 38 - 1. 09; P = 0. 099) for male patients. The frequency of disc <b>hemorrhages</b> over time did not differ between treated and control patients: 8. 4 % versus 8. 5 %, respectively (P = 0. 93), based on ophthalmoscopy, and 12. 4 % versus 11. 2 %, respectively (P = 0. 36), based on photographs. Disc <b>hemorrhages</b> were significantly associated with time to progression (HR = 1. 02; CI, 1. 01 - 1. 04), and {{there was no evidence of}} interaction between treatment group and disc <b>hemorrhages.</b> CONCLUSIONS: IOP-reducing treatment was unrelated to the presence or frequency of disc <b>hemorrhages.</b> The results may suggest that disc <b>hemorrhages</b> cannot be considered an indication of insufficient IOP-lowering treatment, and that glaucoma progression in eyes with disc <b>hemorrhages</b> cannot be totally halted by IOP reduction.

5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic <b>hemorrhage,</b> in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid <b>hemorrhage</b> if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{assess the}} {{hypothesis}} that retinopathies are indicative of systemic microvascular injury. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The only U. S. national survey assessing microvascular <b>hemorrhaging</b> at two distinct anatomical sites was the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 1994). The systemic microvascular injury hypothesis was assessed by modeling the association of retinal and gingival <b>hemorrhaging</b> and the factors that explain this association. RESULTS — Individuals in whom one or more in five gingival sites was <b>hemorrhaging</b> had a 57 % increased odds for retinal <b>hemorrhaging</b> (95 % CI: 1. 26 – 1. 94). This association between retinal and gingival <b>hemorrhaging</b> was 51 % explained by A 1 C concentrations. Retinal and gingival <b>hemorrhaging</b> exhibited the signature J-shaped prevalence patterns when plotted {{as a function of}} A 1 C concentrations. CONCLUSIONS — Gingival <b>hemorrhaging</b> reflected on retinal <b>hemorrhaging,</b> and both shared chronic hyperglycemia as an explanatory marker. These epidemiological findings support {{the hypothesis that}} retinopathies are reflective of systemic microvascular injury. The retina was often considered the only tissue in which microangiopathic processes can be visualized and graded using simple noninvasive diagnostic tools. Studies reported that these retinal pathological conditions were predictive of systemic morbidities such as myocardial infarction, dementia, stroke, and kidney failure (1). As early as 1988, such findings have led to the hypothesis that retinal microvascular changes are reflective of systemic microvascular injury present in tissues ranging from the kidney to the heart (2). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether multiple microvascular pathological conditions can be linked epidemiologically and to explore factors explaining such co-occurrence...|$|R
