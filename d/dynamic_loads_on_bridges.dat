40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>bridges</b> {{generated}} by axle loads from trucks are well known. The influence eof the roughness of the {{approaches to the}} bridges has {{a significant effect on}} the development of the dynamic loads that is not well appreciated. If Long Wavelength Roughness (LWR) is present in the road surface it can excite suspension systems, yet its presence cannot be detected using current road roughness assessment techniques. An examination of the impact of the repeated dynamic loads on a reinforced concrete bridge as the result of LWR shows additional deflection and excitation close to the resonant frequency of the bridge...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{load data}} have been Valuable for bridge and {{pavement}} design. Traditional ways to acquire truck axle and gross weight information are expensive {{and subject to}} bias, and {{this has led to}} the development of Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) techniques. Most of the existing WIM systems have been developed to measure only the static axle loads. This paper aims to introduce a method to identify moving <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>bridges</b> using the bridge responses caused by such loads. A closed-form solution can be obtained to identify moving constant loads, while numerical methods must be used to identify the time-varying moving loads. The set of equations that leads to the solution is based on Euler's equation of beams. A two-axle vehicle model is developed to generate the theoretical responses and the corresponding interactive moving forces. Studies were carried out to check whether the proposed method could recover the original interactive moving forces and the method was found to be feasible...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{dynamic loads}} are {{important}} for bridge engineering as well as pavement design. A large number of research {{studies have indicated that}} bridge dynamic loads increase road surface damage by a factor of 2 - 4. Although the field test is the best available approach to understanding actual vehicle-induced <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>bridges,</b> according to pervious studies there is only a limited amount of field data available on skew box girder continuous bridges. This paper presents an evaluation of vehicle-induced dynamic loads, based on a field test that was carried out on a skew box girder continuous bridge as reported in a companion paper (Part I). The effects of different parameters such as the weight, speed, type, number of axles and position of vehicles on dynamic loads are investigated. Based on the statistical analysis, the use of the dynamic load factor (DLF) is proposed. The dynamic load factor obtained in this study is less than the values provided by most bridge design codes...|$|E

40|$|Recently, Lithuania {{and other}} European {{countries}} have got an {{increased interest in}} the safety assessment of reinforced concrete bridges. Bridges of old construction are designed for a much lower total weight of heavy vehicles and their much lower traffic flows. Due to defects during bridge operation, changing dynamic factors and occurring overloads, a load-carrying capacity of bridges has decreased, their service life has shortened. The Master’s Thesis gives an overview of reinforced concrete bridge condition in Lithuania, the main defects and damages, and their possible causes (concrete carbonation, reinforcement corrosion, action of chlorides), introduces the reinforced concrete bridge safety factor calculation methodology used by the Slovenian bridge researchers. The bridge over the Kaunas HE has been selected {{as the object of}} analysis. During the research the main inspection was carried out, also static and dynamic tests and laboratory investigations of concrete span structure. The effect of reinforcement corrosion on stiffness and deformability of the span structure was determined. For bridge research the reinforced concrete bridge safety factor calculation method, suggested by the Slovenian scientists, was used to evaluate the general condition of bridge structure, the effect of dead loads and moving loads, the flows of heavy vehicles and the influence of <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>bridge</b> structure.

40|$|Summary: Design {{criteria}} are needed specifically for portable bridges {{to insure that}} they are safe and cost effective. This paper discusses different portable bridge categories and their general design criteria.

40|$|Title of Thesis : 	THE EFFECT OF DEAD, LIVE AND BLAST LOADS <b>ON</b> A SUSPENSION <b>BRIDGE</b> 	 	Kunal N. Suthar, Master of Science, 2007 	 Thesis {{directed}} by :	Dr. Chung C. Fu Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Bridges in America are of special importance. The {{analysis of these}} bridges should be carried out for different loading conditions. Bridges are normally designed for dead load, live load and other occasional loads. American Association of State Highways and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) have specified for the ship impact, seismic vulnerability and also against vehicular collisions. But there are no definite structural design criteria for the bridges under typical blast loadings. This thesis is intended to provide a basic guideline for using the blast <b>load</b> analysis <b>on</b> the suspension <b>bridge.</b> Further research may be carried out in this field to develop some standards for the bridge resistance against explosions. Also, the AASHTO loading was applied to study the effect of live <b>load</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bridge.</b> The results obtained from live <b>loading</b> <b>on</b> the same suspension bridge were implemented to allocate costs depending upon the effect of particular vehicle <b>on</b> the <b>bridge</b> deck. To study the non-linear analysis, a three-dimensional finite analysis model under <b>dynamic</b> <b>load</b> has been established for the Suspension bridge part (West-bound side) of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge for determining the effect of live load, which was used for cost allocation studies. This vehicle-bridge interaction modeling was done using a Finite Element Software known as "Visual Bridge Design System" (VBDS). Development and interaction of a detailed truck using proper design standards were applied to realistically represent the actual loading conditions. The results obtained were in close proximity {{when compared with the}} data available through the State Road Commission, State of Maryland. Results presented in this thesis hence demonstrate a significant potential for using the VBDS and for thorough investigation of the vehicle-bridge interaction and <b>dynamic</b> <b>loading</b> <b>on</b> <b>bridges.</b> For carrying out the impact of blast loading, the bridge was modeled in parallel using the SAP 2000 system. The whole modeling of the suspension part of the bay <b>bridge</b> was done <b>on</b> the SAP 2000 for carrying out the non-linear analysis of the blast loads. The behaviors of each element under the effect of the blasts were studied from the output generated by the SAP 2000. The output of the software presents results including moments, axial loads and displacements Moreover, moments and axial load at each node and at any point within the element, can be easily obtained from the software output. The "progressive collapse" approach of the bridge was also carried out to know the exact behavior with the formation of the plastic hinges under the impact of blast loadings. Also the comparisons of the blast loads with and without the application of initial stress were carried out. This shows the importance of using initial stress in the analysis of a suspension bridge...|$|R
40|$|Wind effects <b>on</b> {{long span}} <b>bridges</b> {{are a major}} concern for bridge design. Wind acts as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>load</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bridge</b> deck causing the bridge to react in ways not {{accounted}} for in static load design. Attention to these effects increased tremendously after famous bridge collapses, such as the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940. Due to this collapse and others, engineers were made painfully aware that wind phenomena, such as flutter and vortex shedding, can cause major structural damage if not considered in the design process. The solution for many years since has been to conduct wind tunnel tests on small scale models of bridges, which are both time consuming and expensive. In the last few decades, the capabilities of computers have increased exponentially {{to a point where}} it is feasible for engineers to develop a computer process that will produce the same values that could be found in a wind tunnel test. This thesis begins to explore the time efficiency and viability of using a computer model based on the finite difference model (FDM) for solving the governing equations. The most typical computing method is the finite element method which has been thoroughly tested and produces reasonably comparable data to the wind tunnel tests that have also been performed. The Great Belt East Bridge (GBEB) is the subject of all the modeling done in both the wind tunnel and the computer simulations. The time required to run a finite difference method program is less than that required for the finite element method. The Strouhal number and coefficient of drag are observed to ascertain whether the FDM analysis results are sufficiently close to wind tunnel numbers for the GBEB. The results {{of this study indicate that}} FDM does not appear to generate reasonable values for Cd and St at the grid refinements simulated in this work...|$|R
40|$|The InfraWatch {{project is}} a Dutch {{research}} project, aimed at developing novel techniques for large-scale monitoring of concrete infra-structures. The project involves a large bridge, fitted with multiple types of sensors that capture the high-resolution dynamic behavior of the bridge. With 145 sensors measuring at 100 Hz, {{a huge amount of}} data becomes available that describes various aspects of the bridge’s response to traffic and weather conditions, both long and short-term. A single truck passing the bridge already encompasses almost 50, 000 readings, such that detailed modal analysis can be performed. At the same time, this data-intensive monitoring continues around the clock, as well as the calendar, such that more gradual effects like changes in temperature and traffic conditions can be tracked as well. This wealth of information is being analyzed in various ways ? which will be elaborated in this paper ? combining both computer science and civil engineering expertise. The InfraWatch {{project is a}} central project in the Dutch national research program “Integral Solutions for Sustainable Construction (IS 2 C) ”, which is aimed at developing novel techniques for a next generation predictive simulation model for service life assessment. Other projects within this program are concerned with key degradation processes in structural concrete, such as ASR and chloride penetration. In the near future, the progress of such degradation processes will be measured by dedicated sensors, to be developed within these ‘sister projects’. Such direct degradation measurements will complement the indirect measurements currently performed, which essentially only monitor the <b>dynamic</b> <b>load</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bridge.</b> A lab experiment is currently being developed in the Stevin II laboratory of Delft University of Technology, where ASR and chloride penetration will be measured alongside with the dynamic deformations of a test beam under <b>load</b> while focusing <b>on</b> the mutual interaction of both the materials degradation processes and the structural response.

40|$|Knowledge of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> acting <b>on</b> a {{structure}} and its dynamic response {{is important for}} many engineering applications. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> are crucial in the design process. Monitoring of these allows to assess the actual solicitation of the structure over its lifetime. The response of the structure, which for example consists of strains or accelerations, {{can be used to}} check if serviceability limit states are exceeded, or to monitor the condition of the structure. In many cases, the forces applied to the structure cannot be directly measured, for example wind <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> tall buildings or <b>dynamic</b> vehicle <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>bridges.</b> In addition, the response cannot be measured at all physical locations, due to practical and economical considerations. If the forces and/or the response cannot be directly obtained from measurements, system inversion techniques can be used for estimating the unmeasured quantities, hereby using a limited set of response measurements and a dynamic model of the structure. The present research addresses the application of filtering techniques for force identification and response estimation in structural dynamics. Filtering techniques provide efficient solutions for system inversion, and allow for real-time monitoring of structures. The discussion is limited to linear structural behavior. The work is divided in two parts. The first part establishes a theoretical framework for system inversion. Three filtering algorithms are presented: a classical Kalman filter, an augmented Kalman filter, and a three-step joint input-state estimation algorithm. Considerable attention is paid to the design of sensor networks, through the elaboration of generic conditions for system inversion {{and the development of a}} novel approach for uncertainty quantification, which applies to a broad range of system inversion algorithms. The second part of the thesis shows a verification of the developed approach for system inversion by means of two case studies, using data obtained from full-scale experiments. The first case shows the application of joint input-state estimation for force identification on a footbridge. The second case compares multiple system inversion techniques for the estimation of dynamic strains in the tower of an offshore monopile wind turbine in the North Sea. In both cases, the quality of the estimates is assessed by comparison with the corresponding measured quantities. status: publishe...|$|R
