25|$|One {{fragment}} of the meteorite {{was said to}} have landed on a dog, as observed by a farmer named Mohammed Ali Effendi Hakim in the village of Denshal supposedly vaporizing the animal instantly.

25|$|Polish {{science fiction}} writing {{has not had}} much impact on {{non-print}} media like cinema, television and computer games, although several science fiction, fantasy and horror films and games {{have been made in}} Poland.

25|$|Harmonia axyridis (the {{harlequin}} ladybird) is {{an example}} of how an animal might be partly welcome and partly harmful. It was introduced into North America from Asia in 1916 to control aphids, but is now the most common species, outcompeting many of the native species. It has since spread to much of western Europe, reaching the UK in 2004. It <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> domestic and agricultural pest in some regions, and gives cause for ecological concern. It has similarly arrived in parts of Africa, where it has proved variously unwelcome, perhaps most prominently in vine-related crops.|$|E

25|$|Scrooge never {{completed}} a formal education, {{as he left}} school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills.

Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides {{to search for the}} possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Falsk and Mathisen {{wrote and}} created the film Showbiz, where Falsk played the movie's protagonist, a loser obsessed with {{becoming}} a pop star, while Mathisen played six different supporting roles. According to Falsk, he and Mathisen were determined to break every screenwriting rule and ignore every film cliché when writing the script. Falsk also directed the film, which was slaughtered by the critics after its premiere in September 1989, and bombed at the box office. Nonetheless, Showbiz <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cult film in Norway. The duo's next project, the television show Tom Mathisen og Herodes Falsks latterlige verden (The ridiculous world of Tom Mathisen and Herodes Falsk), which aired on the cable channel TVNorge, was more successful. The TV show was basically an extension of Falsk/Mathisen's live act and featured sketches, songs, television parodies and bits of Falsk's stand-up material.|$|E
25|$|Responding to its sentimental public, Argentine film {{at times}} returns to {{subjects}} of the heart. David Lipszyc's grainy portrait of depression-era Argentina, El astillero ("The Shipyard", 2000) was a hit with critics, Paula Hernandez's touching ode to immigrants, Inheritance (2001), <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sleeper, Adolfo Aristarain's Common Places (2002) follows an elderly professor into retirement, Cleopatra (2003), Eduardo Mignona's tale of an unlikely friendship, received numerous awards, as did Carlos Sorín's touching El perro ("The Dog", 2004). Emotional negativity, a staple for filmmakers anywhere, was explored in Mario Sabato's India Pravile (2003), Francisco D'Intino's La esperanza (2005) and Ariel Rotter's El otro ("The Other", 2007) each deals with mid-life crises in very different ways. The pronounced sentimentality of the average Argentine was also the subject of Robert Duvall's 2002 Assassination Tango, a deceptively simple crime drama that shows that still waters do, indeed, run deep.|$|E

25|$|Situated on {{the mouth}} of the River Shannon, Limerick has been an {{important}} gateway city for over 800 years. Due to the city's location on the midpoint of the Atlantic Corridor, nearness to Shannon Airport (12 Miles) and good supply of reasonably priced hotels it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> base city for tourists travelling along the west coast of Ireland, although the city has many attractions in its own right. King John's Castle in the medieval quarter of the city is arguably the best known attraction in the city, dating back to 922AD. The old city walls of Limerick surround a small bit of the site, although most of the walls have collapsed.St Marys cathedral also in the medieval quarter is a must see.Its a completely restored 12th century cathedral with stunning views over the city. The Hunt Museum in the city hosts one of the world's greatest private collections in the world, winning the Museum of the year award many times over the years.

Artists' works in the museum include Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jack B. Yeats and Henry Moore.|$|E

500|$|Some {{members of}} the fanbase criticized the {{introduction}} of Doggett, claiming that the character had been intentionally created to replace previous lead Fox Mulder's work.

500|$|Foster et al. {{conclude}} that {{whether or not}} a massacre occurred on the scale of that detailed in some versions of the story, the fact that people continue to tell it is indicative of a [...] "deep unease about the communal memory of frontier history" [...] in South Australia.

There is a conservative estimate of 80 settler deaths in South Australia during the frontier wars, with a highly speculative estimate of an Aboriginal death toll between 400 and 800.|$|E
500|$|Although Fillmore <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cult {{figure as}} America's most forgettable chief executive, Smith [...] found {{him to be}} [...] "a {{conscientious}} president" [...] who chose to honor his oath of office and enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, rather than govern based on his personal preferences. Paul G. Calabresi and Christopher S. Yoo, in their study of presidential power, deemed Fillmore [...] "a faithful executor of the laws of the United States—for good and for ill". But, according to Smith, the enforcement of the act has given Fillmore an undeserved pro-southern reputation. Fillmore's place in history has also suffered because [...] "even those who give him high marks for his support of the compromise have done so almost grudgingly, probably because of his Know-Nothing candidacy in 1856". Smith argued that Fillmore's association with the Know Nothings looks far worse in retrospect than it did at the time, and that the former president was not motivated by nativism in his candidacy.|$|E
