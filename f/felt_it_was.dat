5|$|Amy Dumas {{was born}} in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 14, 1975. She {{attended}} many different schools throughout her childhood and adolescent years and managed to finish high school at Lassiter High School six months before graduation. She majored in education at Georgia State University, but dropped out in 1993 because she <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too much like high school.|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} physician, Sonnabend was renowned for {{protecting}} and promoting patients' rights. He did not {{shy away from}} criticising the scientific establishment when he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> failing to put patients' interests first. He often disagreed with mainstream opinion on AIDS.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1962 season, Shaughnessy {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} with a year remaining on his contract. He expressed regret in his departure and admiration for Halas, but said that he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for a change.|$|E
50|$|JPod {{has been}} {{received}} with mixed reception from literary critics. Some <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just an unsuccessful update of Microserfs, with no added substance, while others enjoyed its entertaining style and satire.|$|R
60|$|This was bitterly said, and the repinings which extorted {{the words}} <b>were</b> bitterly <b>felt.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{impossible}} to say what might next have escaped her had not a gentle, low voice spoken at her elbow.|$|R
5000|$|Crapsey pictured himself [...] "as {{a simple}} parish priest, {{primarily}} concerned with the welfare of his parishioners." [...] However, he was not satisfied with [...] "the dogma of the church" [...] and he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> duty to speak publicly about this fact.|$|R
5|$|Former {{chairman}} Eggert Magnússon {{made clear}} his ambition for West Ham {{to move to}} the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a logical move for the Government {{as it was in the}} borough of Newham.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Armoured Directorate of the Red Army (ABTU RKKA) {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a new conical turret for the T-26 similar to the BT-7's turret and to arm it with the 76.2mm L-10 tank gun. Engineers of the Factory No. 174 <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible to implement this project because it would lead to a significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que Soy which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single. It was picked by George for India to cover as he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something women could relate to. India's version was included on the soundtrack for The 24 Hour Woman.|$|E
3000|$|... “It was {{the first}} time (to have an oral English class) so I was worried at first but I <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fun and that I would be able to pass. I got used to <b>it</b> and <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fun to speak English.” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|After {{not being}} signed to any MLB {{team for the}} 2008 season, Piazza {{announced}} his retirement on May 20, 2008, saying, [...] "After discussing my options with my wife, family and agent, I <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time {{to start a new}} chapter in my life. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> an amazing journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> {{only being}} more merciful, <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> very well,' said Mr. Kendal; 'but one also becomes less thorough-going, because {{practice}} is more painful than theory, and one remembers consequences {{that have made}} themselves <b>felt.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> just as well {{that there should be}} young people to put us in mind what our flights once were.' ...|$|R
5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the final cut at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, as he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to separate his work and home life, but, at the time, he had no choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{dialogue}} between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, as he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not necessarily central to the episode's story.|$|E
5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
60|$|The sight was pathetic, {{and at this}} {{particular}} time I <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> more than I could bear.|$|R
60|$|He nodded. He <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{useless to}} combat her resolution.|$|R
60|$|Steve <b>felt</b> stunned. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> unthinkable {{that this}} thing had really occurred.|$|R
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the committee's work was subject of great debate. While some members thought the language had too many compromises and {{was the result of}} design by committee, others <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> better than the three languages examined. Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.|$|E
5|$|They toured Australia in February 2009 {{as part of}} the St Jerome's Laneway Festival. In April 2009, manager Martin Pike {{announced}} a pause in the band's career together for the time being. After 19 years, he said that they <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to take a rest and move on to new projects.|$|E
5|$|While {{the quality}} of the game's {{graphics}} was lauded and sales were good during its month of release, the control was received negatively by critics, who <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> awkward and unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels, released in 2001 and 2003.|$|E
50|$|English Basketball was {{progressing}} {{very well}} indeed and by including 'Catford Saints' as the English team (1939 Championship Winners) in the Liege Festival that year, the ABBA once more made England's position in European Basketball <b>felt.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> unfortunate for {{the progress of}} Basketball that World War II started {{in the latter part}} of 1939.|$|R
60|$|I spoke cheerily, {{more because}} I <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> {{a duty to}} do so, than because I had much hope.|$|R
60|$|But I <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> {{unwise to}} act on her sole advice, much as I have always valued her opinion.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has {{favored the}} sound of the Rhodes over the Wurlitzer Electric Piano, because he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{technically}} superior instrument. Steely Dan has featured the Rhodes in almost all of their albums after 1975, and Fagen has also used the Rhodes in all of his solo albums and continues to play it at every one of his touring performances since 1994.|$|E
5|$|Growing up, Takako Matsu practiced {{piano and}} took vocal {{training}} as a child. Prior to releasing music, she acted in various television drama and plays. In 1996, she acted in the drama Long Vacation, which became very popular in Japan. At the wrap up party of the drama, {{the director of the}} series at that time heard her perform karaoke and suggested that she try singing. Although taken aback and hesitant at first, she later agreed, as she <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a chance that everyone received and because she liked singing; she felt it might work out somehow.|$|E
60|$|Maggie <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{impossible}} {{she should}} ever be queen of these people.|$|R
50|$|The style first {{appeared}} under this {{name in the}} 19th century and was generally made of lightweight and malleable material such as straw or <b>felt.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> said to derive from the straw hats traditionally worn by Breton agricultural workers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{not to be confused}} with the Breton cap, a fabric cap with a peak at the front associated with fishermen.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} of the short story, Lantz {{comments}} that [...] "'Mr. Prokharchin,' dreams dreams, in which the accumulation of money figures prominently, express his anxiety about his {{sense of self and}} his guilt over the selfishness that has isolated him from other human beings." [...] Vissarion Belinsky <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "affected, maniéré, and incomprehensible".|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it was an instant success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Clark {{became the}} third {{president}} of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He {{was the first to}} appoint a faculty and admit a class of students. Although initially successful, MAC was criticized by politicians and newspaper editors who <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a waste of funding in a state that was growing increasingly industrial. Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark's success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Striptease made news {{again when}} it was shown in a fourth-grade class in Chicago, Illinois. The teacher claimed the {{students}} chose the film, but he drew criticism since the film was risqué. (The violent 1996 film Scream was shown in the same school on the same day, causing further controversy.) In 2000 in Ireland, some viewers criticized the Radio Telefís Éireann for running Striptease. These viewers questioned the film's appropriateness and some considered it demeaning to women. However, the station <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not pornography and it was aired at night.|$|E
50|$|DARPA {{was deeply}} {{disappointed}} with researchers {{working on the}} Speech Understanding Research program at Carnegie Mellon University. DARPA had hoped for, and <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> promised, a system that could respond to voice commands from a pilot. The SUR team had developed a system which could recognize spoken English, {{but only if the}} words were spoken in a particular order. DARPA <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> duped and, in 1974, they cancelled a three million dollar a year grant.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} that I thought <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> right to do so--that I <b>was</b> {{thoroughly}} convinced <b>it</b> would <b>be,</b> since he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> right.|$|R
60|$|The Princess intervened. She <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{necessary}} at {{any cost}} to do so.|$|R
