60|$|Lord Ashleigh smiled. His {{hand had}} {{disappeared}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dinner-coat.|$|E
60|$|Huxter arose {{with great}} {{perturbation}} at this news, and plunged his stick <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paletot, and seized his hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't shoot!" [...] she cried, as Mr. Peters absent-mindedly dipped {{his hand}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. [...] "Oh, please don't shoot!" ...|$|E
60|$|He stopped short, {{and thrust}} his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his checked trousers.|$|R
60|$|He eyed me {{with one}} of his blackest looks, and thrust his hands savagely <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his riding-coat.|$|R
60|$|The Demon did not reply. He was busily {{forcing the}} various {{electrical}} devices that Rob had relinquished <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his fiery jacket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Gracedieu's {{object was}} to consult me--" [...] Before I {{could say the}} next words, I saw him put his hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dressing-gown.|$|E
6000|$|Chauvelin {{gave him}} no direct reply. He was busy {{collecting}} his precious papers together and thrusting them back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. Then he said quietly: ...|$|E
60|$|Prince Shan's fingers stole <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. He {{held out}} a {{crumpled}} sheet of paper, on which was written a single sentence. The girl began to shiver.|$|E
60|$|They {{were silent}} for some minutes. Norah shivered, and thrust her hands deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> her jacket. Lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation.|$|R
60|$|She {{stuck her}} hands deeply <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> her dust-coat, and a china-blue eye {{regarded}} Melville {{from under the}} brim of the boldly trimmed bonnet.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In Sandwich-Carrots!—dainty Sandwich-Carrots (1796), James Gillray caricatured Lord Sandwich {{slipping}} money <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> {{an attractive}} carrot-seller, {{said to be}} one of his usual amusements.|$|R
60|$|Slipping the key <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{tunic and}} {{covering}} the bundle {{with his long}} surcoat, De Vac {{stepped out into the}} darkness of the alley and hastened toward the dock.|$|E
60|$|Outside, the sea-mist {{was white}} and woolly. They went hand in hand. It was cold, so she thrust her hand with his <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, while they walked together.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you don't," [...] {{said the}} man, {{and put the}} {{sovereign}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trousers, which were of a corduroy material. [...] "Now," [...] said he, [...] "what am I do to earn this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Not one drop,’ replied my father; ‘and if {{you find}} {{yourself}} in want, let me counsel you to put your hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> your coat.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not lost, Little Flower. I see it; {{you have}} it now. Put your hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> your dress. What do you find there?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dr. Monygham {{slipped off}} the window-sill, and, {{thrusting}} his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long, grey dust coat he was wearing, made a few steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn was too head-achy to be customarily timid. [...] "Let's see that. Did I {{give you}} only five dollars?" [...] Receiving the bill, he folded it with much primness, tucked it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt, and remarked: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{took the}} rabbit {{and dropped it}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. Seeing that Walter was too {{exhausted}} to talk, he asked no questions, and said nothing till {{he pointed to a}} low mound of earth, and said: [...] "Here we are." ...|$|E
60|$|Sweet Morgiana! the billiard-ball {{eyes had}} a {{tremendous}} effect on the Captain. They fell plump, as it were, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart; and he gallantly proposed to treat the company to a bottle of champagne, which was accepted without much difficulty.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy did {{not stop}} to consider. He knew that every dollar the {{schooner}} brought now would go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his father, {{and that was enough}} for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go {{back and}} be damned to it!" [...] said the captain recklessly, {{plunging}} his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his pea jacket and plumping back into his chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one drop," [...] replied my father; [...] "and if {{you find}} {{yourself}} in want, let me counsel you to put your hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> your coat." ...|$|R
60|$|Bjelke {{stared at}} him with glassy eyes. He {{crumpled}} the letter {{in his hand and}} stuffed one and the other <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> black satin coat. He attempted to laugh to reassure the startled chamberlain, and achieved a ghastly grimace.|$|E
60|$|Hannah {{handed him}} the sixpence. Oyster McOyster dashed it {{fiercely}} on the ground, then picking it up he dashed it with full force {{against the wall of}} the cottage. Then, seizing it again he dashed it angrily <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kilt.|$|E
60|$|It was quite, {{quite clearly}} written. The letter was {{addressed}} to her. The postman had brought it here two years ago: her father had taken it from him and thrust it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bunda, meaning to give it presently to his daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I am too late," [...] said Phineas, {{and putting}} his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his coat, {{he turned his}} back upon her, and walked away across the mountain.|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} more to be said. Lord Rufton sat moodily in the corner with his brows drawn down and his hands thrust deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his riding-breeches.|$|R
5000|$|A {{report by}} The Sentry categorizes {{corruption}} in South Sudan {{in a slightly}} different way, identifying the following four main methods the nation's wealth is diverted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> elites: ...|$|R
60|$|To {{some extent}} at least, his {{thoughts}} betrayed themselves in his actions. He put the object that I had half {{seen in his}} hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dressing-gown, {{and moved to the}} toilet-table. Opening one of the drawers, he took from it a folded sheet of paper, and came back to me.|$|E
60|$|The {{examination}} of the papers took him some time. When he had finished he gathered them all together again, retied the bit of ribbon round them and slipped the packet back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. There was a look of grim determination on his face, even though a bitter sigh escaped his set lips.|$|E
6000|$|Foy {{examined}} {{it in the}} faint light, and there, still hooked above the guard, was a single severed finger, a long and skinny finger, to which {{the point of the}} sword Silence had played surgeon, and on it a gold ring. [...] "This may be useful," [...] thought Foy, as he slipped handle and finger <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cloak.|$|E
5000|$|All {{four corners}} are folded {{up so that}} the points meet in the middle, and the player works their fingers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> paper {{in each of the}} four corners.|$|R
5000|$|Examples {{include the}} {{misdirection}} of company funds into [...] "shadow companies" [...] (and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> corrupt employees), <b>the</b> skimming {{of foreign aid}} money, scams and other corrupt activity.|$|R
6000|$|... "An insult!" [...] she answered, {{crushing}} {{the paper in}} her hand and then stuffing it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> her dress. [...] "Light your pipe, daddy, dear. Here--I'll strike the match." ...|$|R
