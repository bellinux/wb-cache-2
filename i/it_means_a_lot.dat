[...] Despite missing the match against Brighton, Dalglish was {{confident}} that Daniel Agger and Craig Bellamy would be fit for the final.

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} James Christopher Monger said [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] {{would gain}} an extra [...] "life in countless montages on MTV reality shows and 30-second cola commercials". Monger {{said that the}} album consisted [...] "of perfectly executed and fairly standard clean vocal post-hardcore emo-pop" [...] which shows the [...] "limitations of the genre". Monger called the backing vocals [...] "exciting at first", but felt that they [...] "eventually dissolve into the waves of distortion mid-album", becoming an [...] "audio equivalent of an energy drink crash". The final track, [...] "If <b>It</b> <b>Means</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> to You", as Monger noted, {{was different from the}} preceding tracks, as they were [...] "deafening, ultimately forgettable, over-compressed slabs of twentysomething angst". Sputnikmusic's John Hanson said the album was an [...] "incredibly derivative and plodding record" [...] that was filled with [...] "laughable moments". He also noted the band [...] "haven't seemed to progress that basic combination of ideas" [...] in combining pop-punk and metalcore, and that the intro to [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] is [...] "just one example of embarrassing decisions".|$|E

500|$|Homesick was {{produced}} by Gilbert, and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage, with mixing taking place in December 2008, at Zing Studios. Mastering took place at West West Side Studios, by Alan Douches. The album features three guesting vocalists: Mike Hranica of The Devil Wears Prada on [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?", Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain on [...] "Welcome to the Family", and Sierra Kusterbeck of VersaEmerge on [...] "If <b>It</b> <b>Means</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> to You". The latter featured harmonica played by Dave Guynn. One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You (2010). An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when {{it came down to}} writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] I think it was the best music for the whole record. The music was just so catchy on its own [...] so we said we will just set this aside for next time around." ...|$|E

Three singles were released from the album: [...] "NJ Legion Iced Tea" [...] in January 2009, [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] in March 2009, [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] in August 2009. Only the third [...] of these charted, at number 40 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. A re-release with additional tracks was released in October 2009.

Adam Thorn later joined the band in 2000. Depending on whom you ask, Kudzu Wish was an indie rock band, a punk rock band, a post-hardcore band, or an amalgamation of {{some or all of}} those genres. Perhaps guitarist Eric Mann defined the band most accurately:"it <b>means</b> <b>a</b> rock band of 5 dudes, whose many music influences just happen to make sense together.

2500|$|Mr Dinos {{was then}} aimed, as expected, at the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over {{two and a}} half miles. The {{build-up}} to the race was exceptionally difficult for Paul Cole as seventy percent of the horses at Whatcombe were affected by a viral infection and Mr Dinos had to be kept in isolation, attended only by his stable lad Tom Pirie. Kieren Fallon took over the ride in Gold Cup 19 June and Mr Dinos started 3/1 second favourite behind his old rival Mamool. Black Sam Bellamy, Pole Star, Kasthari and Persian Punch were again in the field whilst the other runners were Fight Your Corner (Chester Vase), Tholjanah (Noel Murless Stakes), Jardines Lookout (Goodwood Cup), Savannah Bay (Prix de Lutece), Pugin (runner-up in the Irish St Leger) and Alcazar. Persian Punch set the pace with Mr Dinos settling third before moving up into second place with nine furlongs left to run. Fallon sent the colt into the lead three furlongs out and Mr Dinos [...] "forged clear" [...] in the straight to win [...] "easily" [...] by six lengths from Persian Punch. After the race Fallon said [...] "I rode a horse who could take me there. He travelled well, he travelled all the way, even though he was a bit lazy.
