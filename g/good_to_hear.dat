25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
500|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} that Piane was [...] "drawn to the musicality of Bale's rage-filled voice". Piane spent three hours {{working on the}} remix. [...] "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track.... It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," [...] said Piane. In an interview with LA Weekly, Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: [...] "We're all people in this world. So I figured, [...] remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, maybe people will remember the remix." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the song}} was generally positive. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC felt the song's lyrics were generic, but complimented Cyrus vocals: [...] "Miley acquits herself well vocally — there are moments where her voice sounds a tad strained, but it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her on a track that's a little more subdued and with less frantic production than the uptempo, sassy pop songs we're used to." [...] Michael Menachem of Billboard magazine called the song [...] "one of the year's strongest ballads". Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe praised [...] "The Climb" [...] for being a [...] "pretty liberation anthem". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "On tunes like [...] 'The Climb', the 16-year-old Tennessee native turns up her homegrown inflections, but a few elongated r's won't exactly shut out her huge pop audience." [...] Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times believed that [...] "The Climb" [...] was [...] "buried in cheese" [...] and described it as [...] "pre-Valentine's Day gooeyness". However, Martens said, [...] "'The Climb' is the rare Miley ballad that's on par with some of her more spunky teen pop." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2005, the White House {{announced}} that [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] gets regular rotation on George W. Bush's iPod. Morrison announced before a university performance in England: [...] "Yeah, it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> things like that, you know. But I {{would have preferred}} {{if it was a}} new song." ...|$|E
2500|$|During October and November 2009, they {{recorded}} the album Absolute Dissent (2010), marking the band's 30th anniversary. It {{was preceded by}} the In Excelsis EP in June 2010. In November, the band received the [...] "Innovator Award" [...] at the 2010 Classic Rock Roll of Honour; the award was presented to Killing Joke by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, who stated, [...] "I go back a long way with Jaz Coleman and the band. I used {{to go and see}} the band, and it was a band that really impressed me because Geordie's guitar sound was just really, really strong. And they were really tribal, the band, and it was really intense. It was just really <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> something like that during the 80s, which sort of caved in a bit with haircuts and synthesizers". The band were also honoured by [...] Metal Hammer at their annual awards, receiving the Album of the Year award for Absolute Dissent.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, after {{struggling}} {{in the ratings}} for years, Days of Our Lives received a two-year pickup. However, the soap's budget was decreased by 40%. To make do with the new restrictions, executive producer Ken Corday was forced to fire Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn. Marlena's on screen love interest, Drake Hogestyn, had been fired in early 2007 {{as a way to}} clear money in the budget. However, he was brought back in 2008 for storyline purposes and to please fans. The couple were quickly reunited after Drake returned; and then they traveled to Switzerland to treat John's physical disability. Fans were furious with the way the writers wrote John and Marlena out. In an interview with Nelson Branco, Deidre said, [...] "Yes. There was enormous upheaval. I wasn't following a lot of the brouhaha but I was told fans and critics were upset. But it is what it is. Yes, it feels <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that fans miss Marlena. People are deeply attached to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: [...] "As we are too far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over." [...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. I think you should secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E
