50|$|It {{is likely}} that Angles broke into the Midlands from East Anglia and the Wash early in the 6th century. Those who {{established}} their control first {{came to be called}} Middil <b>Engli</b> (Middle Angles). Their territory was centred in modern Leicestershire and East Staffordshire, but probably extended as far as the Cambridgeshire uplands and the Chilterns. This gave them a strategically important place within both Mercia and England as a whole, dominating both the great land routes of Watling Street and Fosse Way, and the major river route of the River Trent, together with its tributaries, the Tame and Soar.|$|E

5000|$|This coinage {{series was}} {{authorized}} by the law on January 6, 1896. The name of the coin could derive from [...] "Verena", a personification of the Confederation of Switzerland in the female effigy, (similar to the French Marianne or the American Lady Liberty) probably modeled by Françoise <b>Engli,</b> shown on the obverse of the coin. The name of the design could also have roots in the tale of William Tell, in which a character named [...] "Vreneli" [...] appears. The coin {{is also known as}} a Helvetia from the inscription above the portrait. Helvetia actually connotes two ideas: it is a variation of the official Latin name of Switzerland, Confoederatio Helvetica or Swiss Confederation, and, by extension, it refers to the allegorical figure of the Swiss version of Lady Liberty. The Helvetia figure is often depicted with a tiara with the word [...] "Libertas" [...] the Latin root for Liberty, as depicted on an earlier version of the denomination and known as the [...] "Libery head". The coins issued between 1897 and 1949 were designed by Fritz Landry of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, whose signature, [...] "F. Landry" [...] appears on the coin under the portrait. The edge of the coin is imprinted with stars in relief.|$|E
5000|$|When I reached New York I called Bil Dwyer who {{had also}} worked on the Columbus Dispatch... I called him just {{socially}} and told him I was in town to say hello. I didn't know where he lived, on Christopher Street. I didn't even know where Christopher Street was. So he said, [...] "My God, I'm glad you called! I've got a problem here. Come on down!" [...] This was like the first night I was in town, {{and he had been}} submitting things to King Features and selling gags, by the way, to the magazines, Collier's and The New Yorker. Anyway, he had submitted a gag-type strip to King Features, and he got a call back saying that Paul Fung was being pulled off Dumb Dora and Dwyer had the assignment. Here he was suddenly with six strips and a Sunday page to do and he'd never done anything except single panels. And he was in trouble. Frank <b>Engli</b> was helping him. He did lettering. He later on did a strip called Looking Back, about stone age characters—very well done cartooning. But his lettering was especially good. So I went down to see them and they were laboring away at the first release. Bil was a good gag writer, but he'd never had this kind of assignment before. So he said to me, [...] "Will you sit in on this thing and especially draw the girls?" [...] So I laid out the first batch of stuff and again, it was not hard for me to do because I had those 11 o'clock deadlines every morning. And so then I inked the girls, and he inked the other characters; very simple drawing. Dwyer... was a very good gag man. Chic Young had originated the character and then Paul finally took over from Chic when Chic started Blondie. Paul was drawing it before Dwyer. I never did find out, by the way, why he withdrew. Maybe Fung had a fight with King Features. I don't know, and I never did ask. So we made the deadline, which was the thing that was bothering Dwyer, but in the mean time I had to go to work the next morning at eight o'clock.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for simultaneously estimating the term structure {{of interest rates}} and computing its arbitrage bounds. It unifies existing estimation procedures that apply smoothing and linear programming methods. The methodology adjusts for tax effects and (possibly asymmetric) transaction costs. The paper reviews and extends the arbitrage theory of bond markets {{which is based on}} the duality theory of mathematical programming. Apart from term structure estimation, the theory can be used to optimize bond portfolios, spot arbitrage arbitrage opportunities, and hedge non-traded cash flows.

40|$|Based on {{empirical}} evidence from a free word order language (German) we propose a fundamental {{revision of the}} principles guiding the ordering of discourse entities in the forward-looking centers within the centering model. We claim that grammatical role criteria should be replaced by indicators of the functional information structure of the utterances, i. e., the distinction between context-bound and unbound discourse elements. This claim is backed up by an empirical evaluation of functional centering. 1 Introduction The centering model has evolved as a methodology for the description and explanation of the local coherence of discourse (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995), with focus on pronominal and nominal anaphora. Though several cross-linguistic studies {{have been carried out}} (cf. the enumeration in Grosz et al. (1995)), an almost canonical scheme for the ordering on the forward-looking centers has emerged, one that reflects well-known regularities of fixed word order languages such as <b>Engli</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to assess the adequa cy of how the {{grammatical}} status of the present perfect (PP) is established in three reference gram mars of English (Quirk et al. 1985; Biber et al. 1999; Huddleston and Pullum 2002). I propose that t he categorizations both as aspect and as tense as presented in these grammars have their inherent wea knesses and are particularly de#cient when data from varieties other than British or American <b>Engli</b> sh is included. To test this assumption, I will ana lyze PP occurrences extracted from the International Corpus of English (ICE) appearing in contexts that have traditionally been considered ungrammatical or at l east odd. One such context is the co–occurrence of the PP with de#nite temporal adverbials. In this ca se, the PP is used like a simple past, which may be taken as evidence for the tense status of the PP an d will therefore be {{the focal point of}} the analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} conducjE 3 to {{determine}} whether counting correct word sequences is a v 4 idmeasure of written expression {{for use in a}} formative avaluatio system for elementary students. A correct word sequence was de ined as two adjacent, correctly spelled words that were acceptable i 4 ithin the context of the phrase to a natfve speaker of the <b>Engli</b> language. Written expression samples from 50 students in grades 3 through 6 were scored in terms of correct word siquences to inv tigate (1) the consistency among scorers using the procedure, (2) the typical performance levels of students in these grades on this measure, and (3) the validity of this measure relative to criterion measures of written expression. Analyses revealed that the average inter-scorer agreement was 90. 3 %. Average scores for students in grades 3 through 6 ranged from 27. 3 at grade 3 to 58. 8 at grade 6, with an increase of about 10 for each successive grade level. Correlations between correct word sequences and several criterion measures, including a holistic rating, were very high, leading to the conclusion that correct word sequences were highly representative of appropriate writing and that counting them is a valid and reliable measure of written expression.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{teaching}} processes involved in foreign language learning, concentrating {{on the question of}} why Greek young learners are not more successful in learning English, despite an early start and high exposure to the foreign language. Central to my study are student-teacher and student-student interactions within <b>Engli</b> sh language classrooms, including any linguistic, pedagogical, motivational or cultural aspects that infonn these interactions and student learning. The study aims to extend the understanding of bow to implement interactive methods within the specific region and develop learners' English communicative competence in an examination-oriented education system. The first part of my study provides an exploratory research, which has been pursued in both state schools and frodistiria in a specific Greek region. Research methods included: lesson observations, teacher interviews and transcription analysis. The second part of the research introduces an intervention study dimension, which consisted of monitoring and modification to classroom practice, exploring the perspective of shifting teaching and learning, providing potential of a new Young Language Leaming philosophy within the Greek context. This part of the research was achieved in a frodistirio in classes of students aged 7 - 11 in order to improve current language learning clas ses and use the data for cross-sectional comparative purposes. Data collection included open-ended field notes, video-recorded lessons and speaking tasks were audio recorded. A group of older learners attending English Proficiency classes for the preparation of Certificate of Proficiency Exams (ePE), aged 14 - 15 years old, based in the frodistirio, were also interviewed on their past experience of English language learning in state schools and frodistiria. The Director of the frodistirio, observed 10 language lessons during the research period. These observations provide feedback on students' reactions to interactive tasks from an external reviewer. Finally, parents were requested to complete a questionnaire {{at the end of the}} academic year, regarding their children's progress and their feelings of the new methods introduced. The thesis reveals the complexities and paradoxes embedded in the learning environment of English for Young Learners (EYL) in South Western Greece. The findings include the identification of an effective interactive methodology that might be applied in the specific regional setting as an outcome of my own teaching and research. The research in question, explores the potential that exists both within the educational structure and in Young Language Learning (YLL) in Greece. It introduces interactive language learning and identifies its role within this context. The research can contribute to the enablement of successful language learners in an environment where children learn to appreciate the foreign language and encounter it as means of communication and not for examination purposes only.
