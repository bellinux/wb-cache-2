5|$|After {{destroying}} his workshop, Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> the door, and then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E
25|$|The British were victorious {{over the}} Ottomans in the Middle East during World WarI and victory in Palestine {{was a step}} towards dismemberment of that empire.

25|$|After {{giving up}} 34 {{unanswered}} points, Oakland {{finally managed to}} drive 82 yards down the field and score on a 39-yard touchdown pass from Gannon to receiver Jerry Porter. Although he was initially ruled as being out of bounds when he caught the ball, {{it was determined that}} Porter had one foot in the end zone and used it to drag the other <b>foot</b> <b>out.</b> The two-point conversion failed, so the Raiders were still down 34–9.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, a 30-yard {{reception}} by Colts receiver Sean Dawkins set up Blanchard's second field goal. But later on, Pittsburgh drove 80 yards in 17 plays, featuring three third down conversion runs by Kordell Stewart, and scored on O'Donnell's 5-yard third and goal {{touchdown pass to}} Stewart with 13 {{seconds left in the}} half to make it 10–6. Replays showed Stewart had put half a <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> of bounds before making the catch, which would have made him an ineligible receiver, but the penalty was not called.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Green Bay {{managed a}} drive deep into San Francisco territory, but Favre {{committed}} a 15-yard intentional grounding penalty on third and 14, and Longwell missed a 47-yard field goal {{attempt on the}} next play. On the 49ers ensuing drive, they drove 52 yards in nine plays, including Young's 48-yard completion to Terrell Owens on third down and 26, to reach the Packers 10-yard line. Young nearly completed a touchdown pass to J. J. Stokes, but Stokes landed with one <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> of bounds {{in the end zone}} and the 49ers settled for a Gary Anderson field goal, cutting the score to 10-3 with less than a minute left in the half. Only 51 seconds remained after Green Bay got the ball back, but Favre got his team into scoring range with a 40-yard completion to Freeman, and Longwell capitalized with a 43-yard field goal as time expired, giving the Packers a 13-3 halftime lead.|$|E

25|$|The Indian violin, while {{essentially}} the same instrument as that used in Western music, is different in some senses. The instrument is tuned so that the IV and III strings (G and D on a western-tuned violin) and the II and I (A and E) strings are sa–pa (do–sol) pairs and sound the same but are offset by an octave, resembling common scordatura or fiddle cross-tunings such as C–G–C–G or A–E–A–E. The tonic sa (do) is not fixed, but variably tuned to accommodate the vocalist or lead player. The way the musician holds the instrument varies from Western to Indian music. In Indian music the musician sits on the floor cross-legged with the right <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> in front of them. The scroll of the instrument rests on the foot. This position is essential to playing well {{due to the nature}} of Indian music. The hand can move all over the fingerboard and there is no set position for the left hand, so it is important for the violin to be in a steady, unmoving position.|$|E
25|$|Montana quickly rallied the 49ers back in {{the second}} quarter, leading them on an 80-yard scoring drive that saw San Francisco fool Washington with a halfback option play in which running back Harry Sydney {{completed}} a 28-yard pass to tight end Brent Jones. On the last play of the drive, Montana fired a 10-yard pass to Rice in the end zone, who caught the ball between two defenders to retake the lead for San Francisco at 14-10. Then after a punt, Montana again went to work, completing a 32-yard pass to halfback Roger Craig and a 47-yarder to Jones before finishing off the 89-yard possession with an 8-yard scoring toss to Mike Sherrard. The team was aided by another controversial call on the drive; Jones caught his 47-yard reception in the air and landed with a <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> of bounds, but officials ruled he had been forced out in the air by safety Alvin Walton. At the time, a reception made by a player forced out of bounds still counted as a catch. This rule was changed in 2008.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1813, Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune's 5th Division of the Army of Portugal counted 4,800 men. The {{division}} {{included two}} battalions {{each of the}} 15th, 66th, 82nd, and 86th Line Infantry Regiments. That day, one of the brigades was halted at the village of San Millán de San Zadornil. The leading brigade of the Light Division under John Ormsby Vandeleur marched up from the west and attacked. As Vandeleur's men pushed the French from the village and east along the road, Maucune's second brigade appeared from a rocky gorge to the southwest. The second brigade {{was in the right}} rear of Vandeleur's brigade, but before the French could take advantage of the situation, James Kempt's brigade arrived on the scene. Kempt immediately attacked and, to avoid being taken in flank and rear, Maucune's second brigade left the road and began to retreat across the hillsides. Noticing what was going on behind him, Vandeleur pulled the 1st Battalion of the 52nd <b>Foot</b> <b>out</b> of line and turned it against the French second brigade. Under the pressure, Maucune's second brigade collapsed and the men ran away.|$|E

25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E
500|$|After Watermelon Man {{proved to}} be a {{financial}} success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the Mojave desert, turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun. [...] He decided that the film was going to be [...] "about a brother getting the Man's <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> of his ass."...Is!. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song DVD, Xenon Entertainment Group, 2003. [...] Because no studio would finance the film, Van Peebles put his own money into the production, and shot it independently. Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by Bill Cosby to complete the film. [...] "Cosby didn't want an equity part," [...] according to Van Peebles. [...] "He just wanted his money back." [...] Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, it was {{reported}} that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill. Digital Spy forum members had previously pointed out that her return was hinted at in a photo on the official EastEnders website and in a feature ("Script Peek") where Phil is quoted as saying, [...] "I know exactly what makes her tick" [...] before adding [...] "I've wriggled off her hook so many times. She's already picturing me standing in the dock" [...] in the 29 December episode. Marsden returned to investigate the murder of Archie Mitchell. A source told Digital Spy, [...] "Marsden has a score to settle with Phil. She was never far behind Phil when he put a <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> of place all those years ago and she's back with a vengeance...With so many people in the frame for Archie's murder, Marsden has a difficult job on her hands if she wants to pin it on Phil." [...] Of her return she said, [...] "It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six."...I really thought Marsden was no more. It was a really great surprise because I’d just finished a year’s run at the National Theatre, appearing in a new play called England People Very Nice – so it couldn’t have come at a better time."

2500|$|Deep Purple's troubled North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed {{production}} of the Deep Purple album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. [...] This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the Billboard Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by Warner Bros. Records, who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.) During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. [...] Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer. Paice stated, [...] "A change had to come. If they hadn't left, the band would have totally disintegrated." [...] Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> the door. Simper said that Evans had met a girl in Hollywood and had eyes on being an actor, while Blackmore explained, [...] "Rod {{just wanted to go}} to America and live in America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rob soon hears that Laura's father, {{who liked}} Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he never {{committed}} to Laura and always had one <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> the door. This made him realize he neglected his own {{future in the}} process. Afterward, he and Laura move back in together again. Rob meets a music columnist whom he soon develops a crush on, but while making a mixtape for her, wonders if he'll always just be jumping rock to rock. Laura meets with Rob in a bar where he explains how other girls are just fantasies, and while Laura is a reality, he never gets tired of her. He then proposes marriage to her, and she thanks him for asking. Later, she organizes an evening where he {{has the opportunity to}} revisit a love of his youth: dee-jaying. It is also a celebration of the recently released single by the two delinquents, where Barry's band plays [...] "Let's Get It On". Surprised that Barry's band is not a disaster, Rob holds Laura, and they both sway to the music. Rob makes a mixtape for Laura, feeling like he's finally learned how to make her happy.|$|E

2500|$|The 2011/12 season saw Sammy improve as a batsman: in {{the series}} against India and Australia Sammy scored over 100runs, which he had not done {{previously}} in a Test series. This trend continued when the West Indies toured England in May 2012. Sammy began the series with scores of 17 and 37 in the first Test at Lord's, during which he passed 3,000runs in first-class cricket. In the following Test, in his 26th Test, Sammy registered his maiden Test century. It was just the seventh time a number eight batsman had scored a century for the West Indies. Sammy partnered Marlon Samuels in a 204-run stand, the second-highest for the West Indies' seventh wicket. The West Indies lost the Test and drew the next one to lose the series 2–0; Sammy finished with 201runs from five innings and was his team's third highest run-scorer {{in the series}} while his six wickets cost 48.50runs each.• Commenting on Sammy's performance in the series, former West Indies captain Viv Richards said [...] "All {{of a sudden there}} was this new-found confidence. You need to have a leader who can come out to the middle and make some sort of contribution. He has done enough and should not feel he has one foot in and one <b>foot</b> <b>out</b> as far as the leadership in concerned. He has done his bit to provide a winning environment." ...|$|E
