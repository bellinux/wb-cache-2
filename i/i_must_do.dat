During this posting, Ball undertook an unusual mission. On the evening of 28 July, he flew a French espionage agent across enemy lines. Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, only to find that the agent refused {{to get out of the}} aircraft. While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the London Gazette announced that he had been awarded the Military Cross [...] "for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions," [...] particularly for [...] "one occasion [...] he attacked six in one flight". This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds. He professed no hatred for his opponents, writing to his parents [...] "I only scrap because it is my duty... Nothing makes me feel more rotten than to see them go down, but you see it is either them or me, so <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> my duty best to make it a case of them".|$|E
2500|$|As Bunyan {{refused to}} agree to give up preaching, his period of {{imprisonment}} eventually extended to 12 years and brought great hardship to his family. Elizabeth, who made strenuous attempts to obtain his release, had been pregnant when her husband was arrested and she subsequently gave birth prematurely to a still-born child. Left to bring up four step-children, {{one of whom was}} blind, she had to rely on the charity of Bunyan's fellow members of the Bedford Meeting and other supporters and on what little her husband could earn in gaol by making shoelaces. But Bunyan remained resolute: [...] "O I saw in this condition I was a man who was pulling down his house upon the head of his Wife and Children; yet thought I, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> it, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> it".|$|E

She {{collected}} rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O'Keeffe explored the land she loved often in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained: [...] "Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the 'Faraway'. It is a place I have painted before ... even now <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> it again." ...|$|E

2500|$|William Diaper (1685–1717) was an English poet of the Augustan era. Little {{is known}} about his life. He was born in Bridgwater, Somerset and {{attended}} Balliol College, Oxford as a pauper, where he took his BA in 1702. In 1709 he was ordained a deacon at Wells and became a curate in the parish of Brent, which he describes in disparaging terms in a poem of the same name, calling it [...] "nature's gaol". By 1712, he had made contacts in the London literary world and become a protégé of Jonathan Swift, who refers to the poet several times in his Journal to Stella. In March 1712, Swift writes:Here is a young fellow has writ some Sea Eclogues, poems of Mermen, resembling pastorals of shepherds, {{and they are very}} pretty, and the thought is new. Mermen are he-mermaids; Tritons, natives of the sea. Do you understand me? I think to recommend him to our Society to-morrow. His name is Diaper. P— on him, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> something for him, and {{get him out of the}} way. I hate to have any new wits rise, but when they do rise I would encourage them; but they tread on our heels and thrust us off the stage.In December 1712, he continued his account of Diaper's progress:This morning I presented one Diaper, a poet, to Lord Bolingbroke, with a new poem, which is a very good one; and I am to give him a sum of money from my lord; and I have contrived to make a parson of him, for he is half one already, being in deacon’s orders, and serves a small cure in the country; but has a sword at his a—— here in town. ’Tis a poor little short wretch, but will do best in a gown, and we will make Lord Keeper give him a living.In another letter, Swift refers to Diaper's being ill:I was to see a poor poet, one Mr. Diaper, in a nasty garret, very sick. I gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bolingbroke, and disposed the other sixty to two other authors, and desired a friend to receive the hundred pounds for poor Harrison, and will carry it to him to-morrow morning. I sent to see how he did, and he is extremely ill; and I very much afflicted for him, for he is my own creature, and in a very honourable post, and very worthy of it. I dined in the City. I am in much concern for this poor lad. His mother and sister attend him, and he wants nothing.|$|E
