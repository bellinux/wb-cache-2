5000|$|Much like a {{real estate}} agent, the {{franchise}} [...] "recruitment consultant" [...] typically charges no upfront fees to [...] "buyers" [...] (franchisees); instead, he or she receives {{the bulk of his}} or her income from [...] "sellers" [...] (franchisers) and thus operates as a biased conduit between the two. It is important to understand that franchisors do not employ franchise consultants, but they do employ franchise brokers who call themselves franchise consultants. They establish relationships with these franchise consulting firms. The role of the <b>franchise</b> <b>consultant</b> is to build a win-win relationship between the franchisor and the potential franchisee. Quality franchise consulting firms that have a large footprint in the franchising industry and help screen out the franchises that don't meet the high standards that are set by franchise experts.|$|E
5000|$|Consultants' {{services}} are [...] "free" [...] {{to the potential}} buyer or franchisee {{only to the extent}} payment goes from the franchisee to the franchise company then into the brokers pocket, but these franchise brokers receive a substantial commission of up to 50% or more of the franchise fee the buyer pays to the franchise company. The potential buyer would pay exactly the same franchise fee as he or she would pay if they had contacted the same franchise on their own. It is illegal for the franchisor to charge anything additional for the use of a <b>Franchise</b> <b>Consultant,</b> unless this is disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD). So why would a franchisors work with franchise consultants? They do because franchise consultants screen out all of the under qualified candidates and only introduce to them highly screened quality candidates that fit their business model. Quality franchises are not concerned with paying the consultant a percentage of the initial franchise fee because they are looking at the long term residual value of on-going royalties from the franchisee. Of course, there are a substantial number of franchises that use franchise brokers (misleadingly called [...] "franchise consultants") as a way to sell a large number of franchises in a network where maximizing franchise sales is paramount over franchise network survival.|$|E
5000|$|A few larger {{franchise}} consulting firms have branched out themselves, essentially [...] "franchising" [...] their {{franchise consulting}} businesses. And industry publications such as Franchise Business Review and Entrepreneur regularly quote high performing <b>franchise</b> <b>consultants</b> as reliable article sources. High performing <b>franchise</b> <b>consultants</b> {{are those who}} have a past performance record of providing quality matches for clients and a high success rate of their clients. But buyer beware applies - many of these highly touted <b>franchise</b> <b>consultants</b> represent <b>franchise</b> companies that have little, if any, name recognition.|$|R
50|$|There {{are still}} <b>{{franchise}}</b> <b>consultants</b> who charge clients for input whether the client desires advice on buying a franchise or assistance becoming a franchisor {{of their own}} (hopefully quality) business.

5000|$|In {{addition}} however, {{smaller and}} more pragmatic consultancy practices may work much closer with smaller businesses and work with them to franchise their business over time. This enables the business to begin franchising their business much sooner, often within 2 years of successful operation of a local model and for much less money - therefore risk, than {{using some of the}} larger consultancy practices. Franchise consultancies of this kind {{are paid for by the}} franchisor not the franchisee - therefore mitigates risk on behalf of the franchisee of being sold something which is not necessarily [...] "right for them" [...] but rather gives the <b>franchise</b> <b>consultants</b> a nice commission.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{licensed}} attorneys who act as <b>franchise</b> <b>consultants</b> and who center their practices on their expertise in franchising {{and who will}} consult/represent the franchisee or the franchisor under a fee agreement. Attorneys cannot take fees from franchisors and consult with the franchisee {{at the same time}} because this would represent a conflict of interest for an attorney under state laws. A consultant package from an attorney will, of course, be expensive, but the attorney has the incentive and the duty under the law to [...] "vet" [...] the franchisor and perform [...] "due diligence" [...] on the offering on behalf of his/her client when he/she offers a consultant package to a client. It is critical to use a franchise attorney who also has an MBA, as this will ensure due diligence from both a legal and business perspective.|$|R
40|$|Although federal Australian {{franchising}} sector regulation promotes franchise system {{disclosure and}} provides for mandatory conflict mediation, {{there is some}} concern that inequities exist within the conflict management process. As a result regulators are reviewing existing regulation and investigating alternative dispute resolution options {{in an attempt to}} proactively manage franchising conflict. Central to this process is identifying the sources of conflict in the franchising relationship. Conflict refers to the existence of deep underlying differences between involved parties that result in responses to potential or actual obstructions that impede one or more parties from realising their goals. This inductive research extends the conflict literature in dyadic exchange relationships through investigating antecedent influences upon franchising conflict from the franchisor and franchisee perspectives. A total of 24 interviews was conducted with lawyers, mediators, brokers, franchisors, franchisee advocates, <b>franchise</b> <b>consultants,</b> <b>franchising</b> academics, franchisor industry representatives and franchising media representatives. The key findings suggest that a lack of due diligence is associated with the formation of unrealistic expectations which increases the potential for future relational conflict. Although franchising experience impacts upon operational approaches and conflict, the role played by third parties and market conditions both appear to exacerbate dissatisfaction in most franchise systems. The concept maps and preliminary conceptual models presented in this paper will be tested in a large quantitative survey of key franchising stakeholders in the near future.

40|$|The lead negotiators for the {{management}} and consultant sides in an NHS trust in northern England responded to debate in their trust about consultant contracts by offering to research the attitudes of their peers towards a variety of contract options. The options tested included the current contract; models already examined in the trust and elsewhere, such as time sensitive and mild performance related contracts; and some more radical and speculative possibilities, including <b>consultants</b> <b>franchising</b> their services to the trust. Beyond the predictable conclusion that consultants would prefer no change while managers desired it, a time sensitive contract emerged as having potential for successful negotiation. On the other hand, neither consultants nor managers favoured a strict performance related contract or a fee for service contract. There was a strong similarity of opinion {{between the two groups}} on the relative salary values of the options, though the consultants consistently priced these higher than the managers...|$|R

Franchise business is a business that has been proven to increase economic development and the acceleration is the right system for the creation of equal opportunities. According to research by Amir Karamoy a <b>franchise</b> business <b>consultant,</b> in Indonesia there has been tremendous development of franchising. For it is time for all sectors involved in the franchise business to improve itself, including in the field of law. Problems certainty and legal protection to be one aspect of the expectations franchisor and franchisee, especially legal protection for franchisees. The research method used in this research is descriptive analytical normative juridical approach. Phase research is supported by the research literature and field research through interviews instruments. According to research by the author, it was concluded that the arrangements and procedures for the implementation of a franchise business is subject to the general conditions governing the engagement in Book III of the Civil Code specifically regulates the agreements and, more specifically, government regulation No 42 of 2007 on the franchise and the Ministry of Industry and trade of the Republic of Indonesia No. 259 /MPP/KEP/ 7 / 1997 provisions and Procedures Implementation Franchise Registration. Supporting factors and the cause of termination of the franchise agreement set by the franchisor in the agreement may be the reason in the termination of the agreement with the consideration that the termination is not adverse franchisee. I hope the author will expect the government to intervene directly and make laws that do not harm the franchisor and franchisee. ...|$|R
