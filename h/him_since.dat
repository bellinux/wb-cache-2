5|$|As a wanted criminal, Anarky's {{methods and}} goals were {{described}} as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation. When in need of assistance, he would call on {{the help of the}} homeless community in Gotham who had supported <b>him</b> <b>since</b> his first appearance.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned <b>him</b> <b>since</b> no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E

5|$|Roy {{started the}} first month of the season scoring at his normal rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which have bothered <b>him</b> <b>since</b> college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers {{announced}} that he would be out indefinitely. It was widely speculated that Roy {{would not be able to}} play at an All-Star level again. This forced the team to start running its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews.|$|E

5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known <b>him</b> <b>since</b> childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{became a}} Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, with his {{appointment}} as Chaplain in 1946, and in 1950 {{advanced to the}} position of Dean. His rising academic reputation was confirmed in 1953 with the publication of a project which had occupied <b>him</b> <b>since</b> the days of his curacy—his new translation of Origen's Contra Celsum, with introduction and notes. He had by now made himself an expert in Patristic Greek; only an inexactness in philology marking his earlier abandonment of Greek for music. Also in 1953 he was appointed co-editor (with Hedley Sparks) of the Journal of Theological Studies and continued editing it until 1985. He held the university appointment of Hulsean Lecturer from 1954–6.|$|E
5|$|In January 1979, Nyerere mobilised the Tanzania People's Defence Force and counterattacked, {{joined by}} several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, and, despite {{military}} help from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Amin {{was forced to}} flee into exile by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured. He escaped first to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for his staying out of politics. Amin lived {{for a number of}} years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda–Tanzania war for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed Amin (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located Amin in 1980, and secured the first interview with <b>him</b> <b>since</b> his deposition.|$|E

5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Kramer {{is almost}} {{immediately}} out, {{due to the}} presence of a beautiful exhibitionist woman in the apartment across the street who walks around in her apartment naked with the curtains open. The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with <b>him</b> <b>since</b> she wants to remain a virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows like Tiny Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E
5|$|Poniatowski {{has been}} the subject of {{numerous}} biographies and many works of art. Voltaire, who saw Poniatowski as a model reformist, modeled King Teucer in his drama Les Lois de Minos (1772) after him. At least 58 contemporary poems were dedicated to him or praised <b>him.</b> <b>Since</b> then, he has been a major character in many works of Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, in the Rok 1794 trilogy by Władysław Stanisław Reymont, in the novels of Tadeusz Łopalewski, and in the dramas of Ignacy Grabowski, Tadeusz Miciński, Roman Bradstaetter and Bogdan Śmigielski. He is discussed in Luise Mühlbach's novel Joseph II and His Court, and appears in Jane Porter's Thaddeus of Warsaw.|$|E

5|$|Reading {{finished}} the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place {{higher than the}} previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only {{on the day of}} a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following <b>him</b> <b>since</b> the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Street scandal {{occurred}} in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London, {{was discovered by}} police. The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced {{the handling of the}} case by the authorities, and has coloured biographers' perceptions of <b>him</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E
5|$|The greater {{national}} arms (stora riksvapnet) {{originated in}} 1448 and has remained unchanged in Swedish law since 1943. The first legislation of state arms in Sweden was in 1908, and {{prior to that}} the state arms were changed by royal decree. It also, as it originally was, remains to be the personal coat of arms of the king of Sweden; as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by {{other members of the}} Royal House, with the alterations and additions decided by <b>him.</b> <b>Since</b> the beginning of the reign of Gustav Vasa in 1523 it has been customary in Sweden to display the arms of the ruling dynasty as an inescutcheon in the centre of the greater arms.|$|E
