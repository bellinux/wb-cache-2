5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and <b>ketones,</b> and symmetrical <b>ketones</b> by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl <b>ketones</b> to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH).

40|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of methyl n-butyl <b>ketone</b> {{is known}} to be enhanced by combination with methyl ethyl <b>ketone.</b> This study was conducted to clarify the potentiating effect of aliphatic monoketones on the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl <b>ketone.</b> Rats were subcutaneously injected in the back with 4 mmol/kg/day of methyl ethyl <b>ketone,</b> methyl n-propyl <b>ketone,</b> methyl n-amyl <b>ketone,</b> or methyl n-hexyl <b>ketone</b> mixed with an equimolar dose of methyl n-butyl <b>ketone</b> five days a week for 20 weeks. The maximum motor fibre conduction velocity and the distal latency were measured every two weeks in the tail nerves of the treated animals and controls. All the monoketones tested enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl <b>ketone.</b> Of the compounds tested, methyl n-hexyl <b>ketone,</b> which had the longest carbon chain, enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl <b>ketone</b> most strongly.

40|$|<b>Ketone</b> body {{concentrations}} fluctuate markedly during {{physiological and}} pathological conditions. Tracer techniques {{have been developed}} {{in recent years to}} study production, utilization, and the metabolic clearance rate of <b>ketone</b> bodies. This review describes data on the roles of insulin, catecholamines, and thyroid hormones in the regulation of <b>ketone</b> body kinetics. The data indicate that insulin lowers <b>ketone</b> body concentrations by three independent mechanisms: first, it inhibits lipolysis, and thus lowers free fatty acid availability for ketogenesis; second, it restrains <b>ketone</b> body production within the liver; third, it enhances peripheral <b>ketone</b> body utilization. To assess these effects in humans in vivo, experimental models were developed to study insulin effects with controlled concentrations of free fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, and <b>ketone</b> bodies. Presently available data also support an important role of catecholamines in increasing <b>ketone</b> body concentrations. Evidence was presented that norepinephrine increases ketogenesis not only by stimulating lipolysis, and thus releasing free fatty acids, but also by increasing intrahepatic ketogenesis. Thyroid hormone availability was associated with lipolysis and ketogenesis. <b>Ketone</b> body concentrations after an overnight fast were only modestly elevated in hyperthyroidism resulting from increased peripheral <b>ketone</b> body clearance. There was a significant correlation between serum triiodothyronine levels and the <b>ketone</b> body metabolic clearance rate. Thus, <b>ketone</b> body homeostasis in human subjects resulted from the interaction of hormones such as insulin, catecholamines, and thyroid hormones regulating lipolysis, intrahepatic ketogenesis, and peripheral <b>ketone</b> body utilization...|$|R

5000|$|In organic {{chemistry}} a hydroxy <b>ketone</b> (often referred to {{simply as a}} ketol) is a functional group consisting of a <b>ketone</b> flanked by a hydroxyl group.

50|$|Ketosis is a {{nutritional}} process characterised by serum concentrations of <b>ketone</b> bodies over 0.5 mM, with low and stable levels of insulin and blood glucose. It {{is almost always}} generalized with hyperketonemia, that is, an elevated level of <b>ketone</b> bodies in the blood throughout the body. <b>Ketone</b> bodies are formed by ketogenesis when liver glycogen stores are depleted (or from metabolising medium-chain triglycerides). The main <b>ketone</b> bodies used for energy are acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and the levels of <b>ketone</b> bodies are regulated mainly by insulin and glucagon. Most cells in the body can use both glucose and <b>ketone</b> bodies for fuel, and during ketosis, free fatty acids and glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis) fuel the remainder.|$|R
40|$|Using a {{continuous}} intravenous infusion of D-(-) - 3 -hydroxy[4, 4, 4 - 2 H 3]butyrate tracer, we measured total <b>ketone</b> body transport in 12 infants: six newborns, four 1 - 6 -mo-olds, one diabetic, and one hyperinsulinemic infant. <b>Ketone</b> body inflow-outflow transport (flux) averaged 17. 3 +/- 1. 4 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 in the neonates, a value not {{different from that}} of 20. 6 +/- 0. 9 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 measured in the older infants. This rate was accelerated to 32. 2 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 in the diabetic and slowed to 5. 0 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 in the hyperinsulinemic child. As in the adult, <b>ketone</b> turnover was directly proportional to free fatty acid and <b>ketone</b> body concentrations, while <b>ketone</b> clearance declined as the circulatory content of <b>ketone</b> bodies increased. Compared with the adult, however, <b>ketone</b> body turnover rates of 12. 8 - 21. 9 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 in newborns fasted for less than 8 h, and rates of 17. 9 - 26. 0 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 in older infants fasted for less than 10 h, were in a range found in adults only after several days of total fasting. If the bulk of transported <b>ketone</b> body fuels are oxidized in the infant as they are in the adult, <b>ketone</b> bodies could account for as much as 25 % of the neonate's basal energy requirements in the first several days of life. These studies demonstrate active ketogenesis and quantitatively important <b>ketone</b> body fuel transport in the human infant. Furthermore, the qualitatively similar relationships between the newborn and the adult relative to free fatty acid concentration and <b>ketone</b> inflow, and with regard to <b>ketone</b> concentration and clearance rate, suggest that intrahepatic and extrahepatic regulatory systems controlling <b>ketone</b> body metabolism are well established by early postnatal life in humans...|$|R

5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, <b>ketones,</b> and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like <b>ketones</b> and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E

5|$|The Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (often {{referred to}} as simply the Nazarov cyclization) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones.
