Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the Dalmatian coast and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a Very flare to engulf all the chase boats <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> flames.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of horse}} and foot {{soldiers}} immersed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad {{themselves and their}} horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the Coulomb-damping {{friction}} {{is considered}} in {{the problem of the}} wave-seabed interaction <b>in</b> <b>a</b> porous <b>seabed</b> <b>of</b> finite thickness. <b>A</b> closed-form analytical solution is presented here. In the model, the water waves and porous <b>seabed</b> are coupled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complex wave number. Thus, the effects of soil properties on the wave characteristics can be examined. In addition, three types of elastic waves are {{considered in the}} seabed induced by the water wave: compressional wave in the soil skeleton and in the pore fluid, respectively, and the third is <b>a</b> shear waves <b>in</b> the soil skeleton, due to the low rigidity and permeability of the fine sand and clay. The results indicate that the coulomb-damping friction is significantly affects the wave-induced pore pressure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>of</b> fine sand and clay. Also, the wave characteristics have been significantly affected by the seabed response. 本文旨在解析並探討波浪通過於一平坦、有限厚度且具有庫侖阻尼摩擦效應的海床時，波浪與海底床之交互作用問題。往昔學者為得到一較簡單的數學式來描述多孔隙介質的運動行為，大多忽略孔隙介質中流體與固體結構的互制運動行為及土壤內部摩擦效應的影響。基此，本文除將透水彈性體中固體結構與孔隙流體分開推導其個別運動方程式外，並考慮波浪作用於土壤內部時，產生了兩種壓力波及一種剪力波。由於剪力波對低滲透率的土壤有重要的影響，因此在波浪與海床交互作用的問題時，庫侖阻尼摩擦效應的作用顯得重要。由解析之結果發現，具有庫侖阻尼摩擦效應的細砂或黏土海床對波浪流場的變化有明顯的影響，且在土壤動力反應，也以細砂或黏土海床之影響最為顯著...|$|R

25|$|Set in the 1830s, {{the story}} centers on Rosina da Silva, the {{sophisticated}} eldest {{daughter of a}} wealthy Jewish Italian family living in a small enclave of Sephardic London Jews. When her father is murdered {{on the street and}} leaves behind numerous debts, she refuses an arranged marriage to an older suitor, declaring that she will work to support her family, even if she has to take to the stage like her aunt, who is a renowned singer. She decides to use her classical education and advertise her services as a governess, transforming herself into Mary Blackchurch - a Protestant of partial Italian descent - in order to conceal her heritage. She quickly accepts a position as governess for a Scottish family living on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides.

40|$|AbstractExtreme waves can induce seepage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>seabed</b> {{and cause}} {{problems}} to marine structures in coastal regions.

An analytical solution is presented for the pore pressure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>of</b> defined thickness. Parametric studies {{were carried out}} to examine the influence of air content in the pore water, and of the soil hydraulic conductivity on the seepage. It has been shown that the air content and the soil hydraulic conductivity can affect the pore pressure response significantly. An increase in the air content or <b>a</b> decrease <b>in</b> the soil hydraulic conductivity will increase the magnitude of the pore pressure gradient and results in the pore pressure varying sharply. The liquefaction potential <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>seabed</b> under cnoidal waves is discussed. Consequently, comparative studies are carried out to show that the soil shear modulus and Poisson constant can influence the difference between the transient seepage equation and Biot's equation, and the transient seepage equation is a limit of Biot's equation...|$|R
