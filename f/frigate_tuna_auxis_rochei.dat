Consequently, the water masses ’ convergence imparts on the area an intense geostrophic circulation of water masses and hydrographic processes, particularly suitable for the spawning {{of a number of}} tuna species, among which <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> (<b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei)</b> is most abundant. The TUNIBAL project whose main aim was focused on bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) larval ecology allowed acquiring information on its related species during the 2003 - 2005 spawning seasons. This document presents information on the interannual variability of bullet tuna larval abundance and on their distribution pattern observed throughout these years. Overall, the 2003 Mediterranean heat wave appears to have affected the strong interannual differences observed of bullet tuna larval abundance. Although, their larvae are widely spread over the area, major concentrations tend to be closer to the coast than the other tuna species spawning in the area, particularly bluefin and albacore (T. alalunga).

We show that the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene region is {{a powerful tool for}} identification of these young fish. Using this method, we identified 50 juvenile scombrids collected from Exmouth Bay, Western Australia.

40|$|The {{bluefin tuna}} (Thunnus thynnus) is a heavily fished {{temperate}} tuna that spawns in the Mediterranean Sea; the area off the Balearic Islands {{is a key}} spawning area.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea is {{considered}} by several authors as a hot-spot of Climate Oscillation, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO). However, information {{about the effect of}} the climate oscillations on the fitness of the species is still scarce. In this context, bullet tuna is an important migratory species with a substantial socio-economical value, whose fisheries might be affected by the effect of certain climatological conditions. In fact, these atmospheric oscillations trigger a chain of hydrodynamic events, leading a change on the timing, destinations, and success of the migratory species in their search for spawning grounds. This study relies on the hypothesis of a correlation between the physical condition of the post-spawning bullet tuna and climate oscillation indexes.

This study aims to analyze histamine and histamine-forming bacteria in processed pindang tuna (A. rochei). Fresh tuna (A. rochei) was obtained from TPI Cisolok Palabuhanratu. The fish was processed according to pindang badeng method (20 % salt added, boiled for 8 hours). The product then stored at room temperature and observed for 0, 8, 16, 24 and 32 hours. Analysis were conducted through chemical (histamine and TVB) and microbiological test (TPC, identification of bacteria, histamine levels in bacteria). The results showed that the stored pindang for 32 hours can reactivate the production of histamine and increase their levels significantly. This is consistent with the increase on the value of TVB and TPC in pindang products. Six types of histamine-forming bacteria found on pindang tuna that are P. vulgaris, H. alvei, M.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Inter-Research {{and can be}} found at: [URL] spawning habitats of many large marine pelagic predators are poorly known. This lack of knowledge hampers conservation efforts that are aimed at identifying critical habitats for the spawning of these species. We hypothesized that phylogenetically related species show different adaptations and respond differently to environmental and geographical cues for when and where to spawn. We tested this hypothesis on a 5 yr data set (2001 to 2005) from the Balearic Islands region (Mediterranean Sea), targeting the early larval stage of 3 abundant species of tuna: bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus, a large migratory oceanic species; albacore T. alalunga, a smaller species; and bullet <b>tuna</b> <b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei,</b> often found closer to coastal areas. The spatial distribution of spawning locations at the regional scale differed for the 3 tuna species. Bluefin tuna relied heavily on environmental signals, and therefore their spawning habitats can vary depending on the environment. In contrast, the spawning habitat of albacore and bullet tuna was driven mostly by geography and was less variable over contrasting environmental conditions.

40|$|The bullet <b>tuna</b> <b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei,</b> Risso 1810, {{is a small}} tuna widely {{distributed}} in tropical and temperate seas. The present study reports on the first attempt to jointly monitor diet and food selection in larvae of this species and to assess {{the influence of the}} ontogenetic development of feeding-related organs on the diet. A. rochei larvae from 2 to 7 mm long are diurnal feeders and highly active predators, with high values of feeding incidence, gut fullness and number of ingested prey items. The rate of change in prey item size in relation to larval size was higher than in other species. Only small, non-motile prey items are eaten at the onset of feeding. Rapid mouth development and the early appearance of teeth allow larvae from 3 to 5 mm long to ingest a wide range of prey. However, niche breadth decreases at 5 mm, when larvae avoid small prey items in favour of larger ones with a higher carbon content. Chesson’s selectivity index indicated that small larvae (from 2 to 3 mm long) selected a variety of small prey items, mainly copepod nauplii. Larvae measuring 3 to 5 mm selectively ate cladocerans and appendicularians, and larvae with lengths ≥ 5 mm preferred appendicularians and fish larvae. Precocious body development (mouth, teeth, and onset of stomach and caudal fin development) and improved visual acuity (larger lens diameter and angular cone density) are factors that contribute to the feeding success of larvae of this species...|$|R

The results strongly supported a major role of gelatinous plankton in the diet of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the oceanic stage and ocean sunfish (Mola mola) also primarily relied on gelatinous zooplankton. In contrast, stable isotope ratios ruled out any relevant consumption of gelatinous plankton by bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), blue shark (Prionace glauca), leerfish (Lichia amia), bonito (Sarda sarda), striped dolphin (Stenella caerueloalba) and loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the neritic stage, all of which primarily relied on fish and squid. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were confirmed as crustacean consumers. The ratios of stable isotopes in albacore (Thunnus alalunga), amberjack (Seriola dumerili), blue butterfish (Stromaeus fiatola), bullet <b>tuna</b> (<b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei),</b> dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were consistent with mixed diets revealed by stomach content analysis, including nekton and crustaceans, but the consumption of gelatinous plankton could not be ruled out completely. In conclusion, the jellyvorous guild in the Mediterranean integrates two specialists (ocean sunfish and loggerhead sea turtles in the oceanic stage) and several opportunists (bluefin tuna, little tunny, spearfish, swordfish and, perhaps, blue butterfish), most of them with shrinking populations due to overfishing...|$|R

The majority of identified fish larvae belonged to demersal species, mainly picarel Spicara smaris (23. 76 % of the total larval fish abundance), followed by red mullet Mullus barbatus (14. 92 %) and several species of the Sparidae family (9. 15 %). Small pelagic species as Sardinella Sardinella aurita and European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus were also abundant (27. 75 %) and dominated the fish larvae community in offshore stations. Five large pelagic species were found among the larvae, including bullet <b>tuna</b> <b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei,</b> Atlantic black skipjack Euthynnus alletteratus, albacore Thunnus alalunga, swordfish Xiphias gladius and the highly migratory Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus. All these apex predator species appear in 38. 5 % of the sampling stations and contribute about 7. 9 % of the total larval catches. The larval fish assemblage of the Gulf of Gabes is predominantly composed of neritic species in correspondence with the shallow depths of the study area. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that larval distributions were mainly conditioned by depth. However, other factors, like hydrographic processes, play also a very important role in shaping the spatial pattern of larval fish distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} and mitigation of {{adverse effects of}} the bycatch of tuna longline fishery have been mainly developed and implemented for seabirds, sharks and turtles and, the knowledge on teleost bycatch for this fishery, remains very poor. This paper contributes to a comprehensive assessment of life history traits and fishery attributes of target and bycatch species caught by the tuna longline fishery in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Data was compiled on seven life history traits and three fishery attributes for 33 and 27 teleost stocks caught by longliners in South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively. In addition, each species was assigned into four categories describing {{the fate of the}} catch: target species for commercial use, bycatch species kept for consumption, bycatch species kept for commercial use and discarded bycatch. Life history traits and fishery attributes did not differ between oceans. However, non-target but commercialized species were smaller in the Atlantic Ocean. Teleosts caught by the tuna longline fishery was segregated into three main groups: (1) the fast growing species represented mainly by dolphinfishes (Coryphaena hippurus and C. equisellis), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis), bullet <b>tuna</b> (<b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei),</b> snoek (Thyrsites atun) and blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus); (2) target tunas and most other bycatch species which were part of an intermediate group and (3) billfishes including swordfish representing the large and slow growing species with moderate to high market values and unknown or highly uncertain stock status. Investment in some key life history traits (such as growth coefficient) and the development of quantitative or semi-quantitative approaches (stock assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment) should be priorized as precautionary management measures for these species...|$|R
40|$|During routine {{monitoring}} of commercial purse seine catches in 2011, 87 fingerling specimens of scombrids {{were collected in}} the southern Adriatic Sea. Sequencing of mitochondrial control region locus inferred that specimens belonged to the Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus, 1758) (N= 29), bullet <b>tuna,</b> <b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei</b> (Risso, 1810) (N= 30) and little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus, Rafinesque, 1810 (N= 28). Due to previously published growth parameters, age of collected specimens {{was estimated to be}} approximately 30 days. In order to determine possible location of the spawning event coupled modelling system ROMS-ICHTHYOP was run. Realistic ROMS simulations were made to provide current and density fields for the ICHTHYOP model. ROMS model was forced with realistic surface air-sea fluxes calculated from fine resolution ALADIN model, river inflows, tides and external dynamics. ICHTHYOP was run in the backward mode for 30 days using published investigations on the studied species and its early stage dynamics, such as their growth and developmental stage thermal dependence, lethal temperatures, etc. Apart simulations with coupled modelling system, detailed analysis of prevailing meteorological and oceanographic conditions was made using all available data. Comparison to climatology of the area approved that 2011 had unusually prolonged warm and dry summer season. Occasional inflows of hot and dry air from the northern Africa additionally warm up Adriatic atmosphere. Under these conditions sea surface temperature was up to 2 standard deviations above normal. In the deeper layers, high temperature and salinity were recorded. According to performed simulations it seems that tuna species spawn within the commercial tuna cages (this is not the first evidence of natural spawning within commercial tuna farming facility in the Adriatic), while the other two species most probably opportunistically use positive environmental (abiotic and biotic) conditions and spawn in the same area...|$|R

With five age groups of each, the dominant black pomfret was one year, while <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> was two years. The total mortality coefficient (Z) and the fishing mortality (F) of the black pomfret were at high levels, the exploitation ratio (E) was over 0. 5, {{and the number of}} captured juvenile fishes showed that the stock of black pomfret in this area was overexploited and improper fishing gear was utilized. Compared with previous studies, the maximum and mean fork length, body weight and age of the two fishes declined gradually, the populations were younger in age and smaller in size. The growth coefficient k increased and age at the inflexion point of weight t(r) was younger than before. The smaller change of the fork length at first maturity of the two fishes has indicated a more vulnerable fishery ecosystem in this area. Therefore, in addition to the traditional fishery management approach, such as taking the minimum length into consideration, ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF) should be taken to improve the practical fishing management, including conserving the small pelagic fishery population in order to achieve the sustainable fishing of the stocks...|$|R
40|$|The Maldivian pole-and-line tuna fishery {{has been}} in {{existence}} for hundreds of years. The sailing fleet underwent mechanization in the 1970 s. By mid 1980 s the purpose-built second generation vessels that replaced the converted sailing vessels increased the catch by threefold. However, further rapid increase in catch was slow until late 1990 s with third generation fibreglass (FRP) vessels joining the fleet. Catches then doubled from 1996 to 2006. Private sector investments in post-harvest sector are driving the most recent phase of fishery expansion. These include the additional collection and storage facilities, tuna canneries and the rapidly growing fresh tuna export business. Total reported tuna catches at present are 170, 000 mt of which 80 % is skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) followed by yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Other coastal varieties, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> (<b>Auxis</b> thazard) and kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis) are caught in small quantities, < 5 % at present. Roughly a third of this catch is consumed locally the rest are exported in canned, fresh/chilled, frozen, dried, and other forms. The total export earnings {{in the recent years}} were in excess of US $ 100 million. The increasing fishing power and efficiency CPUE of both skipjack and yellowfin tuna are increasing. Skipjack CPUE has increased almost consistently in the recent years; from about 270 kg day in 1997 to over 600 kg /day during 2006.

In order to accomplish to accomplish these objectives a total of 2381 individuals of A. rochei were collected all over the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Each individual was measured, weight, sexed and aged. The fitness condition indexes (Kmean and LeCren) were posteriorly obtained individually after the representation of the length-weight relationships. Additionally, fisheries and atmospheric oscillations data were also obtained. A non-parametric Spearman test (α= 0. 01) was used to correlate the atmospheric oscillation indexes with both physical condition indexes and annual landings data. Finally, a Mann-Whitney test (α= 0. 05) was used to test significant differences between the physical condition of males and females for both the pre-spawning and post-spawning individuals. The results obtained reflect that the atmospheric oscillations, indexed by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO), associated to a time lag (between six months and one year) between the prevalence of the atmospheric conditions and the biological responses in the individuals. Generally, positive phases of the NAO index (negative AO) enhance the migration towards the Mediterranean Sea (higher Kmean), and positive phases of AO (negative NAO) favor the exit towards the Atlantic Ocean (higher LeCren index). These results are explained by the modification of the predominant winds that could favor the migration, as well the nutrients availability after the spawning period. It was also observed that the condition factor in females is significantly larger than in males, which suggests a higher energetic investment in reproduction carried out by females. Finally, a change in growth for older post-spawning individuals was detected, that suggests a higher reproductive investment by older individuals. Nevertheless, despite these findings, further research in this field is needed, since several aspects of the biology of A. rochei remain unclear...|$|R

María Pilar Olivar Buera del Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC) y del Dr. Fernando Villate Guinea de la Universidad del Pais Vasco (UPV). [...] 141 pagesWe have analysed {{the relationship}} of the ictioplankton community with its fisical and trophic environment in two hydrographical contrasting conditions (summer stratification versus autumn mixed column), and we have characterized the larval diet of five teleost species in the NW Mediterranean: the three clupeiform of the region [anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) ], a small <b>tuna</b> [bullet <b>tuna</b> (<b>Auxis</b> <b>rochei)</b> ] and the most important demersal species of the region [hake (Merluccius merluccius) ]. These species have been chosen because they represent two different morphotypes, 1) that of the clupeiforms, which correspond to a stylized larvae with small mouth, long body and digestive tract linked to the tail, and 2) that of bullet tuna and hake, which correspond to a robust larvae with big mouth, robust body and compact digestive tract independent of the tail. Moreover, we have studied the diet variations i) along development, in relation to ii) prey availability and iii) morphology of the feeding-related structures like visual system, mouth and digestive tract. Feeding is an important aspect of the larval fish ecology that affects the population dynamics (through larval survival and subsequence recruitment fluctuations). The factors that affect the larvae in their prey selection and the feeding strategies have been scarcely studied for these species in the Catalan Sea. These factors can be different depending on the species and can change with ontogeny. The main objective of this Ph. D has been to understand the specific trophic strategies of the larvae of these five important species in Mediterranean fisheries. We can point out three types of strategies: 1) The hake’s one, which from the onset specializes feeding in a prey type (Clausocalanus spp.) and only increases the number of copepods to respond to the nutritional requirements of growth. 2) Anchovy and sardine’s type, which show low feeding incidence at the beginning, and they change the size and number of preys step by step along development without showing abrupt changes in the diet. 3) Bullet tuna and hake’s type, opportunist species which deeply adjust their prey type (and size) in their larval period as they enhance their abilities [ [...] . ]Esta Tesis Doctoral ha sido realizada gracias a una beca/contrato predoctoral del Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (España) durante 4 años que se encuadra dentro del Programa de Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI) y ha comprendido un periodo de tiempo desde el 1 de Agosto de 2005 hasta el 30 de julio de 2009 Peer Reviewe...|$|R
