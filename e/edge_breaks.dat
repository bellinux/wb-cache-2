Teddy reveals to Ian that he has been questioning his sexuality for years, but that he's always been trying to ignore those feelings. And that his first attraction to the same sex was on his roommate, Tripp Wellington, while attending Exeter Prep School. He then reveals he dropped out of Exeter after developing feelings for him. This conversation then brings Teddy and Ian closer as friends due to Ian being the only one Teddy can confide in about his homosexuality. A few nights later during a beach luau, Teddy sees Ian with another guy and becomes jealous.

After being in a car crash that injured and embittered her mother, her father designed the Sensen to help Nilin forget her part in it. Nilin becomes a memory hunter, someone who can enter and steal memories: because of skills taught to her by her father, she could also 'remix' them to create a false memory and potentially change a person's outlook and future actions. Under unknown circumstances, she joins the Errorists, an underground movement opposed to the Sensen technology. After she manipulates a target into committing suicide, she is imprisoned in the Bastille and her memories erased. The unseen Errorist leader <b>Edge</b> <b>breaks</b> her out of prison and acts as her guide and helper during her missions. Nilin follows his orders in order to recover her lost memories, although she finds herself doubting herself and fearing recovering her memories because of what more she might have done. Eventually, she finds out her origins, and ends up remixing the memories of her parents to make them see the harm the technology is causing and allow Nilin entrance to H3O, the Memorize central server and the core of the Sensen technology. When she reaches the Central Server, Edge confirms her growing suspicion that he and H3O are one and the same, and that he led her {{all the way to the}} central server for the expressed purpose of having her kill him. Due to common use of Sensens to remove painful memories from their human users, the H3O computer had essentially become a horrific repository of countless negative memories and experiences; when it unexpectedly gained self-awareness, it found itself experiencing incredible suffering, leading to its wish to be destroyed. Nilin links mentally with the server and is confronted by H3O, a sentient entity that had developed in the Memorize servers from the vast collection of painful memories, who informs her that Edge was an aspect of him, created and released into the world specifically to bring down Memorize by organizing the Errorist movement, and in the process, put an end to H3O. He also tells her that as long as he exists the horrors of Sensen abuse will continue until they eventually overwhelm the entire population, meaning that Nilin must destroy H3O. When Nilin expresses reluctance at the prospect of killing him, H3O spawns multiple hostile remembranes to force her to fight him. Nilin finally destroys Edge/H3O, releasing the stored memories into the general population. In his last moments, H3O thanks her for putting an end to his pain. With her mind now restored, Nilin resolves to help heal the damage Sensen has done to the world.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} detecting axes of bilateral symmetry in images. In order to achieve robustness to variation in illumination, only edge gradient information is used. To overcome the problem of <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> a potential field is developed from the edge map which spreads {{the information in the}} image plane. Pairs of points in the image plane are made to vote for their axes of symmetry with some confidence values. To make the method robust to overlapping objects, only local features in the form of Taylor coefficients are used for quantifying symmetry. We define an axis of symmetry histogram, which is used to accumulate the weighted votes for all possible axes of symmetry. To reduce the computational complexity of voting, a hashing scheme is proposed, wherein pairs of points, whose potential fields are too asymmetric, are pruned by not being counted for the vote. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is fairly robust to <b>edge</b> <b>breaks,</b> and is able to detect symmetries even when only 0. 05 % of the possible pairs are used for voting...|$|E

Study Design: 30 root canals were chosen with an angle between 15 and 30 º. Before starting to prepare the canals the files were observed microscopically using a scanning electronic microscope. The ProTaper sequence recommended by the manufacturer was used, with NaOCl as irrigant. The instruments were sterilised after every three canals were shaped. The instruments were observed with the same microscope after shaping each canal, until 30 root canals were shaped. The criteria used for checking the instruments were: blunt cutting edges, disruption of cutting edge, microfractures, fatigue cracks, metal flash, dentine remains. Results: Many microscopic defects were found such as: cutting <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> (up to 70 %); fatigue cracks, between 33 and 100 %. No microfractures were found. An S 1 and an SX file were fractured. Conclusion: ProTaper instruments are quite reliable if used following usual requirements...|$|E

Associated {{with each}} circular planar graph Γ {{there is a}} set π(Γ) = {(P; Q) } of pairs of sequences of boundary nodes which are connected through Γ. A graph Γ is called critical if removing any <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> {{at least one of}} the connections (P; Q) in π(Γ). We prove that two critical circular planar graphs are Y−Δ equivalent if and only if they have the same connections. If a conductivity γ is assigned to each edge in Γ, there is a linear from boundary voltages to boundary currents, called the network response. This linear map is represented by a matrix Λγ. We show that if (Γ,γ) is any circular planar resistor network whose underlying graph Γ is critical, then the values of all the conductors in Γ may be calculated from Λγ. Finally, we give an algebraic description of the set of network response matrices that can occur for circular planar resistor networks...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} unique way to control both bandgap and the {{magnetic}} properties of nanoscale graphene, which might prove highly beneficial for application in nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. We have shown that chemical doping by nitrogen along a single zigzag <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> the sublattice symmetry of graphene. This leads {{to the opening of}} a gap and a shift of the molecular orbitals localized on the doped edge {{in such a way that}} the spin gap asymmetry, which can lead to half-metallicity under certain conditions, is obtained. The spin-selective behavior of graphene and tunable spin gaps help us to obtain semiconductor diode-like current-voltage characteristics, where the current flowing in one direction is preferred over the other. The doping in the middle of the graphene layer results in an impurity level between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of pure graphene (again, much like in semiconductor systems) localized on the zigzag edges thus decreasing the bandgap and adding unpaired electrons, and this can also be used to control graphene conductivity.

30|$|Different {{from the}} {{ordinary}} LPGE due to asymmetry scattering on phonons, static defects, or other carriers in noncentrosymmetric media, the ALPGE {{is supposed to}} due to the optical momentum alignment effect [1, 7]. This ALPGE {{is similar to the}} so-called surface photogalvanic effect in [10 – 12] and the edge photogalvanic effect in [13], where the electrical detection of optical momentum alignment is carried out in metals as well as semiconductors. However, optical momentum alignment alone is not enough to induce a net electric current due to the symmetrical distribution of carriers with momenta k and −k in optical excitation. It has been believed that the diffuse scattering of the surface or the <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> the symmetrical distribution of carriers with opposite k. While in the MQW studied here, the optical absorption corresponds to the inner wells {{and the size of the}} sample is much larger than the diameter of the laser beam and can be considered edgeless, thus the surface as well as the edge photogalvanic effect can be neglected in our experiment. It is believed that in our experiments the inhomogeneity of light intensity plays the same role with the surface or the edge for generating a net electric current.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Unsteady {{pressure}} distributions at {{a pitching}} Lambda wing with 53 ° sweep angle {{are described in}} this paper. The tests with a half wing model with a purely round leading edge were conducted in the Transonic Wind Tunnel Göttingen. The free stream Mach number was varied between 0. 3 and 0. 7. Oscillation frequencies up to 22 Hz and amplitudes smaller than 1 ° were used. The pressure distributions suggest flow conditions that {{can be divided into}} three Regimes, depending on the mean angle of attack: I) Above 10 °, at the rear outboard part of the wing, the suction increases which is caused by a vortical flow occurring close to the surface. A strong suction peak emerges at the leading edge. II) At higher angles of attack, the strong suction peak at the leading <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> down, and a typical hump like pressure distribution below a vortex core is generated further downstream. This is the sign for a vortex flow further separating from the surface. Features of a vortex breakdown can be found. However, it lacks the typical signs for a transformation from a jet-like to a wake-like flow. III) Finally, the low pressure region below the vortex moves inboard and a deadwater type of flow exists at the outboard part of the wing. The unsteady pressure distributions strongly depend on the mean angle of attack. The highest unsteady pressures occur in Regimes II and III. Especially the out of phase parts drastically increase in Regime II. Furthermore, the quasi-steady effects strongly lag the motion. This means, the sign of the imaginary part of the unsteady pressure distribution is opposite to that of the real part. The lag increases with frequency. For angles of attack above that of the maximum lift, the negative lift slope turns positive with increasing frequency due to the strong lag of the vortex...|$|E

The {{machinability}} of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite is evaluated by measurement of tool wear, surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the work-piece. Wear mechanisms and patterns of tools in turning of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite are discussed. The experimental setup involved turning Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) 78. 0 mm long and 31. 8 mm diameter on a precision lathe at fixed feed rate, different depth of cut and cutting speed using PCD, CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated tools. The reinforcement of the matrix consists of SiC 5 - 8 µm in diameter. Experimental results reveal that abrasion and adhesion presented the most prevalent mode of wear among all the tools. Fracture was observed among CBN tools while chipping on PCD tools. Flank and crater wear were observed in all tools with flank wear more prevalent in both CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated. Wear among PCD tools was low as compared to CBN tools. Further analysis reveal that the outer layer of the CBN-coated tools wear off fast creating a good platform for adhesion of matrix material on to the tool. This further increases wear of the tool due to adhesive wear as the built-up <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> off from the tool. PCD tool presented better surface finish than CBN tools with CBN-coated performing better than CBN-uncoated. Due to high SiC content, discontinuous chips are formed which are also curled due to increase in temperature at cutting zone causing bimetallic effect on the chip. On dimensional accuracy it was observed that PCD tool produced lowest diameter error followed by CBN-uncoated and finally CBN-Coated. It is concluded that in machining Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite PCD tools are the best followed by CBN-coated and lastly CBN-uncoated...|$|E

The purposes for the project is together with suitable partners demonstrate an automated system together with sensors for deburring not well-positioned surfaces. The <b>edge</b> <b>break</b> is now done partly manual because of robots limitation in achieving the required quality and accuracy. A typical <b>edge</b> <b>breaking</b> requirement is 0, 38 - 0, 76 mm on discs. Aero engine components are often exposed to high stress levels and vibrations during operations. Burrs and sharp edges on these components can lead to edge cracking and component failure. So therefore removal of burrs and creating rounded edges is necessary.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate methods of improving fastener and joint performance in wood-based composite case furniture. In general, several types of joints and fasteners were tested and evaluated. This study, accordingly, provides much of the information needed for the product engineering of case furniture constructed of particleboard and medium density fiberboard. In order to achieve the desired objective and to produce practical results, the boards chosen for the project were representative of the quality of the material usually used in the construction of case furniture. Results of the <b>edge</b> <b>breaking</b> strength tests indicated that breaking strength of the corner joints increased approximately in proportion to the square root of both IB and MOR properties. A clear relationship between <b>edge</b> <b>breaking</b> strength and MOE, MOR, and IB could not be found in either the tension or the compression tests. Edge pull-out test results indicated that edge distance and hole diameter have a significant effect on the edge pull-out strength of the particleboard and medium density fiberboard. Test results for withdrawal strength of screws indicate that both face and edge withdrawal strength of screws were close to what have been obtained in the previous studies done by Eckelman. Using adhesive with screw, withdrawal strength resistance was increased in both MDF and particleboard panels. It is clear that the performance of the joints is not related to the cost of the fasteners. In many cases, joints with low performance were the most expensive. Cap screws, for example, had the highest cost but low performance. On the other hand, sheet metal screws with glue were cheaper but higher in performance. ...|$|R
