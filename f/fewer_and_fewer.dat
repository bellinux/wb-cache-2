5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E

5|$|The Viet Minh {{opened fire}} with a massive {{artillery}} bombardment in March. After several days the French artillery commander, Charles Piroth, unable to respond with any effective counterbattery fire, committed suicide. The Viet Minh occupied the highlands around Điện Biên Phủ and bombarded the French positions. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. The French repeatedly repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions. Supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air, though as the key French positions were overrun, the French perimeter contracted and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible. As the Viet Minh antiaircraft fire took its toll, <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> of those supplies reached the French. The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, {{and most of the}} French forces surrendered. A few of them escaped to Laos. The French government then resigned, and the new Prime Minister, the left-of-centre Pierre Mendès France, supported French withdrawal from Indochina.|$|E
5|$|The interdiction effort during Commando Hunt VI (15 May through 31 October 1971) {{was thrown}} off by Lam Son 719 during April and May. During the offensive, 80 {{percent of all}} U.S. aerial sorties were {{directed}} to support it. This highlighted what was now rapidly becoming a dual dilemma for the Air Force: First, the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia meant that there were <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> air assets available with which to conduct more and more missions. During Commando Hunt, for example, 1,777 aircraft were utilized during the campaign. By {{the time of the}} opening of Commando Hunt VI, that figure had decreased to 1,199 aircraft and this number dropped to 953 before that phase was completed; Second, this state of affairs was exacerbated by the withdrawal of sorties to conduct missions for Operation Freedom Deal in Cambodia.|$|E

40|$|The {{expressions}} <b>few</b> <b>and</b> a <b>few</b> {{are typically}} {{considered to be}} separate quantifiers. I challenge this assumption, showing that with the appropriate definition of few, a few can be derived compositionally as a + few. The core of the analysis is a proposal that few has a denotation as a one-place predicate which incorporates a negation operator. From this, argument interpretations can be derived for expressions such as <b>few</b> students <b>and</b> a <b>few</b> students, differing only in the scope of negation. I show that this approach adequately captures the interpretive differences between <b>few</b> <b>and</b> a <b>few.</b> I further show that other such pairs are blocked by a constraint against the vacuous application of a. ...|$|R

25|$|We {{find that}} the {{centering}} of the management of industries into <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> hands makes the trade unions unable {{to cope with the}} ever growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers.|$|E

Detroit sponsored <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> promotionals so model companies depended more on kits but the model building hobby declined as well.

25|$|No {{evidence}} of divine right: Even if the Christian God exists, {{there is no}} evidence that the Orange-Nassaus have been given a divine right, and even if they did, any God could also one day withdraw his or her grace from them (as he did with several Old Testament kings, or, according to the 1581 Act of Abjuration on which Dutch independence was based, with Philip II of Spain).

25|$|During The Porfiriato, Diaz modernized {{different}} aspects of Mexico's infrastructure, such as a tenfold in railways, steam-powered locomotives, increase in telegraph lines across the country. These improvements were mainly backed by foreign capital and were done to benefit his close supporters and foreign investors. In the other hand, he showed less concern for the common Mexican people. During 1883-1894, laws were passed to give <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> people large amounts of land. Land was taken away from people by bribing local judges to declare them vacant. Díaz's friend obtained 12 million acres of land in Baja California by bribing local judges. Those who opposed were killed or captured and sold as slaves to plantations.|$|E

25|$|The {{electronic}} calculators of {{the mid-1960s}} were large and heavy desktop machines {{due to their}} use of hundreds of transistors on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply.

U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: Canon Inc. with Texas Instruments, Hayakawa Electric (later renamed Sharp Corporation) with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics (later renamed Rockwell International), Busicom with Mostek and Intel, and General Instrument with Sanyo.|$|E
25|$|Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer {{concludes that}} the {{shrinkage}} of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh {{is still very much}} alive, a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as most parts of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> with each generation. He also concludes however, that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.|$|E
25|$|It {{was hoped}} that the U.S. would use {{conventional}} and nuclear weapons to strike at Soviet staging areas in the occupied Baltic states {{in case of a}} Soviet attack on Sweden. Over time and due to the official neutrality policy, <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> Swedish military officials were aware of the military cooperation with the west, making such cooperation in the event of war increasingly difficult. At the same time Swedish defensive planning was completely based on help from abroad in the event of war. Later research has shown that every publicly available war-game training, included the scenario that Sweden was under attack from the Soviets, and would rely on NATO forces for defence. The fact that it was not permissible to mention this aloud eventually led to the Swedish armed forces becoming highly misbalanced. For example, a strong ability to defend against an amphibious invasion was maintained, while an ability to strike at inland staging areas was almost completely absent.|$|E
