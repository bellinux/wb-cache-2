40|$|Abstract: <b>In-use</b> <b>light</b> duty diesel {{vehicles}} are {{considered as one}} of major sources of particulate emissions in many cities, {{and the start of}} the retrofit program for the light duty diesel vehicles is expected in near future in Korea. One of the problems of the retrofit of the light duty diesel vehicles is that the exhaust gas temperature is too low to apply passive regeneration DPF systems. This study introduces a catalytic combustor as a new active DPF regeneration technology. This study shows the principle and characteristics of DPF regeneration by the catalytic combustor and suggests it's proper control method for better regeneration...|$|E
40|$|This one-year project {{focused on}} the effects on fuel economy, {{emission}} characteristics, driveability, and component compatibility of <b>in-use</b> <b>light</b> duty vehicles running on blends of 30 % and 10 % ethanol. The test sample included 15 vehicles of various years, makes, and models. The procedures used for testing each of the fuels’ mileage, emissions, driveability, oil analysis, and material compatibility are described. E 10 fuel contains 90 % gasoline and 10 % ethanol by volume. E 30 contains 70 % gasoline and 30 % ethanol by volume. These were the two fuels used in this test. The {{results of the study}} revealed that volumetric fuel economy decreased when using E 30. There were no driveability or material compatibility problems experienced during the study. Emissions results showed that some emissions were higher when running on E 30, some were lower. All emissions were low and well below federal standards...|$|E
40|$|It is {{intended}} to present technical analysis of issues using data that are currently available. The purpose in the release of such reports is to facilitate the exchange of technical information and {{to inform the public}} of technical developments which may form the basis for a final EPA decision, position, or regulatory action. Note: This report is a revision of the August 2000 EPA technical report of the same title. The earlier report had the appearance of a draft report, and therefore this report has revised line spacing and page breaks. It also incorporates the results of a September 2000 FTP evaporative emission test conducted at the Ford Motor Company, Allen Park, Michigan testing laboratories. That result is discussed under “Ford Vehicle No. 192 ", in Section VII- Discussion, and also in the Appendix, under the section “Ford Vehicles 155 and 192. ” I. Summary: From April 1999 through May 2000, EPA conducted a study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} onboard diagnostics (OBD II) evaporative emission monitors on a sample of <b>in-use</b> <b>light</b> duty vehicles and light duty trucks. The purpose of the study was to determine if OBD II technology is an effective and efficient means of identifying in-use vehicles with excess evaporative emissions. The results of this study have been routinely shared at quarterly I/M OBD workgrou...|$|E
