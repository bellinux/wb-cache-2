25|$|Following {{one week}} of clashes in May 2008, {{leaders of both}} the {{opposition}} and majority signed the <b>Doha</b> <b>Agreement,</b> defusing the 18-month crisis.

25|$|On 9 May 2008, Hezbollah and Amal forces, {{sparked by}} a {{government}} declaration that Hezbollah's communications network was illegal, seized western Beirut, leading to the 2008 conflict in Lebanon. The Lebanese government denounced the violence as a coup attempt. At least 62 {{people died in the}} resulting clashes between pro-government and opposition militias. On 21 May 2008, the signing of the <b>Doha</b> <b>Agreement</b> ended the fighting. As part of the accord, which ended 18 months of political paralysis, Michel Suleiman became president and a national unity government was established, granting a veto to the opposition. The agreement was a victory for opposition forces, as the government caved in to all their main demands.|$|E
25|$|The 2006–2008 Lebanese protests were {{a series}} of {{political}} protests and sit-ins that began on December 1, 2006, led by groups in Lebanon that opposed the US and Saudi-backed government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and ended on May 21, 2008 following the <b>Doha</b> <b>Agreement.</b> The opposition group {{was made up of}} Hezbollah, Amal, and the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM); a number of smaller parties were also involved, including the Marada party, the Lebanese Communist Party and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. The majority {{of the members of the}} government were part of the anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance, a coalition of political parties and independents in Lebanon. The two groups were also divided along religious lines, with most Sunnis and Druze supporting the government, and most Shi'a supporting the opposition group. The Christian community was split between the two factions, with Michel Aoun, the leader of the FPM, claiming to have more than 70% support among the Christians, according to the results of the 2005 parliamentary elections.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the World Trade Organization, and analyzes how ongoing international trade negotiations (the Doha Round), if completed, will significantly limit the protection provided to {{farmers in the}} European Union. Export subsidies will be eliminated and import tariffs lowered by 60 %.

40|$|We use a CGE microsimulation {{model to}} assess the poverty impacts for Cameroon of the Doha round, {{as well as more}} ambitious world and {{domestic}} trade liberalization, paying particular attention to the choice of replacement tax. <b>Doha</b> <b>Agreements</b> remove roughly 43, 000 people from poverty in Cameroon. More ambitious world trade liberalization brings down the number of poor by 308, 000 individuals. However, Cameroon’s own liberalization has strong adverse impacts, increasing the number of poor by over a million. Combined world and domestic liberalization thus increases poverty, especially when lost tariff revenues are compensated by a consumption tax rather than a VAT. SUMMARY The aim of this paper is {{to assess the}} possible impacts of the Doha round of negotiations on poverty in Cameroon. During the recent period of economic recovery, Cameroon has enjoyed a sharp decline in poverty with the headcount index falling from 53. 3 percent of inhabitants in 1996 to 40. 2 percent in 2001, mostly thanks to economic growth rather than redistribution. Will the current trade negotiations under the Doha Round reinforc...|$|R
25|$|In May 2008, {{after the}} {{government}} decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control {{of the city was}} handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the <b>Doha</b> <b>Agreement,</b> the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.|$|E
500|$|On 7 May 2008, Lebanon's 17-month-long {{political}} crisis spiraled out of control. The fighting was sparked {{by a government}} move to shut down Hezbollah's telecommunication network and remove Beirut Airport's security chief over alleged ties to Hezbollah. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the government's decision to declare the group's military telecommunications network illegal was a [...] "declaration of war" [...] on the organization, and demanded that the government revoke it. Hezbollah-led opposition fighters seized control of several West Beirut neighborhoods from Future Movement militiamen loyal to the backed government, in street battles that left 11 dead and 30 wounded. The opposition-seized areas were then {{handed over to the}} Lebanese Army. The army also pledged to resolve the dispute and has reversed the decisions of the government by letting Hezbollah preserve its telecoms network and re-instating the airport's security chief. At the end, rival Lebanese leaders reached consensus over <b>Doha</b> <b>Agreement</b> on 21 May 2008, to end the 18-month political feud that exploded into fighting and nearly drove the country to a new civil war. On the basis of this agreement, Hezbollah and its opposition allies were effectively granted veto power in Lebanon's parliament. At the end of the conflicts, National unity government was formed by Fouad Siniora on 11 July 2008 and Hezbollah has one minister and controls eleven of thirty seats in the cabinet.|$|E

40|$|Doha Round is a {{new round}} of {{negotiation}} in World Trade Organization that held on November 9 - 14 th 2001, at Doha, Qatar. There are 21 subjects of negotiation. The deadline for reaching agreement in all subjects was in 2005 and extended in 2006. Even it was extended, the agreement still could not be reached. One reason of it was unreachable agreements in agriculture, services, and non-agriculture market access (NAMA). This article will try to examine the reason for unreachable agreements in agriculture, services, and non-agriculture market access (NAMA) based on negotiation and rational choice theory. The unreachable agreements in agriculture, services, and non-agriculture market access (NAMA) is result of unreachable concession because of cost that will be received by developed and developing countries based on issue-linkages between agriculture, services, and non-agriculture market access (NAMA). Therefore this article will explain correlation between issue-linkages and unreachable agreement in agriculture, services, and non-agriculture market access (NAMA).

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the potential {{impacts of the}} Doha trade proposals (those of the USA, EU and G 20) on agricultural production and incomes of China's farmers by region and income group. By linking a global trade model to a national policy model which itself is connected {{to a set of}} disaggregated household data, we are able to assess the effects of the proposed Doha trade liberalizations on households both at the national and regional levels. According to the results of the model, the impacts of a <b>Doha</b> Round <b>agreement</b> on households differ significantly from those of China's WTO accession. China's economy would benefit from the trade liberalization associated with the Doha Round. The overall impacts, however, are relatively minor. Although farmers will benefit at the national level, the gains among farmers vary largely by income group and province. Also, the impacts on households that produce different types of crops differ.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and spiking unemployment figures {{have raised the}} threat of escalating barriers to trade. An early conclusion to the Doha Round might help avert some {{of the increase in}} protectionism, but no one knows by how much. And while Doha will help the world economy, it will also create winners and losers across countries and across sectors within countries (Polaski, 2006). How much developing countries can win or lose depends, to a large extent, on how the issue of agricultural subsidies in developed countries is resolved. But it also depends on the definition of sensitive commodities and the effects of further liberalising trade in manufacturing goods. Developing countries will have to look very carefully at the gains and losses from proposed <b>Doha</b> Round <b>agreements,</b> the so-called ?modalities?. For many developing countries, the nature of any agreed package will be more important than reaching any agreement by a specific deadline.
