50|$|In Humberside {{a police}} car was swept away by the rising waters at Spurn Point. In Cleethorpes a total of 1,500 houses were {{affected}} by flooding during the event. 1,017 houses were <b>flooded</b> <b>above</b> floor level, a further 185 houses were flooded below floor level and 288 houses had their gardens flooded. It was estimated that £1,600,000 (1978) worth of damage was caused to private property and goods in Cleethorpes. One of the big differences between 1978 and the storm surge during the Gale of January 1976 in the town, was that damage occurred much further inland. Damage was reported up to three-quarters of a mile away from the sea wall. In Cleethorpes the damage spread over an area of 5 km² in total. The railway between Grimsby and Cleethorpes was left inoperable as the ballast was washed {{out from under the}} track. Further south on the Lincolnshire coast the resorts of Sandilands and Mablethorpe saw 28 homes and 8 business premises left underwater, with caravans and chalets along the Lincolnshire coast damaged. In Boston, Lincolnshire following the failure of a brick retaining wall, St Botolph's Church and 180 houses were flooded. Waters in the church exceeded the levels seen in 1953.|$|E
40|$|The late Quaternary Arno valley fill, {{in western}} Tuscany, was formed {{during the last}} glacio-eustatic cycle. It" "exhibits a total {{thickness}} of 35 - 40 m, and is 5 - 7 km wide. It consists almost entirely of a single transgressive succession emplaced during the post-Last Glacial Maximum transgression, between latest Pleistocene (13 cal. ka" "BP) and early Holocene (8 cal. ka BP). An indurated horizon, intensively reworked by pedogenic features, occurs lateral to the deep incision. " "Above a fluvial deposit flooring the valley, the incised valley fill includes an early transgressive succession of" "coastal plain, bay head-delta, and estuarine deposits. As sea-level rise continued, the valley was filled and the interfluves <b>flooded.</b> <b>Above</b> the interfluve sequence boundary, the late transgressive Holocene succession is about" " 17 m thick, and includes a transgressive-regressive succession of coastal, shallow-marine and modern deltaic deposits. " "Facies analysis of continuous cores and stratigraphic correlation of borehole data from the lower Arno coastal plain allow detailed reconstruction of three-dimensional facies architecture of the valley body. Alternating" "freshwater and brackish deposits form the valley fill at proximal-most locations. West of Pisa, the valley fill includes amalgamated estuary-mouth sand bodies, whereas at distal locations (beneath the present shoreline) it consists almost entirely of estuarine mud. " "Subtle vertical facies changes within the valley fill allow identification and lateral tracing of three vertically stacked, shallowing-upward successions, about 10 m thick and bounded by flooding surfaces, which are inter-" "preted as parasequences. Parasequence architecture suggests that sea-level rise close to the Pleistocene-Holo- cene boundary was punctuated by at least two distinct stillstand phases. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} test the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in the {{applicability}} of flood risk assessment, this paper applies the traditional BP neural networks (BPNN), radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and probabilistic neural networks (PNN) to establish flood risk assessment model using MATLAB combined with GIS technology. It is observed that BPNN is superior among three methods. Taking Beijiang River basin as a case study, the risk assessment map based on BPNN model shows that the dangerous areas are mainly located in these areas: Sihui, Qingyuan city, Fogang, northwest Huaiji, central Yangshan, central Yingde, northeast Nanxiong and so on. Compared with a few historical large <b>floods,</b> <b>above</b> results can better reflect the actual situation of flood risk in Beijiang River basin, which validate the rationality of the presented model and provide a reference for flood control and disaster assessment.
