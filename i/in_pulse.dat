5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around the pulsar. The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the pulsar, but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E

25|$|In gymnotiforms, electrocytes differ between wave-type and pulse-type {{electric}} fishes. In wave-type fishes, electrocytes {{are in a}} tubular form. <b>In</b> <b>pulse</b> {{fish the}} electrocytes tend to be flattened disks. The electocytes also form columns, but unlike the shorter size of electric organ in mormyrids, gymnotiforms have long electric organs that extend throughout almost the entire longitudinal body length. Also different from the stalk system in mormyrids, stalks in gymnotiforms only make one type of innervation at the posterior side of electrocyte. Pulse-type gymnotifoms generally show a higher complexity than the wave-type fishes. For instance, their electrocytes can be either cylindrical or drum-shaped with stalks innervating from either posterior or anterior side. Another important difference is that, unlike mormyrids or wave-type gymnotiforms, electrocytes of pulse-type gymnotiforms are not homogenous along the long electric organ that traverses the fish body. Different parts of the electric organs of some gymnotoiforms are innervated differently or may have different cellular firing properties.|$|E

40|$|This paper fills an {{information}} gap regarding factors affecting the {{supply and demand}} of <b>pulses</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan. The short- and long-term supply elasticities were estimated using the Nerlovian partial adjustment process, while demand elasticities were estimated by applying the Deaton and Muellbauer Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS). Generally lack of technological innovation <b>in</b> <b>pulses,</b> except <b>in</b> mungbean, has reduced their production and they are pushed to low intensive areas which are marginal for cereal and cash crop production. Pulses did not benefit from the investment in irrigation infrastructure. Increase in wage rates has further affected the mungbean and lentil production. On the demand side, contrary to normal belief, pulses have high own-price demand and income elasticities. Thus decline <b>in</b> <b>pulses</b> consumption is not caused by their being regarded as inferior goods, rather it {{can be attributed to}} disproportionate increase <b>in</b> <b>pulses</b> price, as laxity <b>in</b> <b>pulses</b> research left their production behind demand. The high-yielding, short-duration, and pest-resistant pulses varieties with synchronised maturity can revive their production trend as well as improve the dietary pattern, especially of the poor. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to analyze the}} dynamics of production for <b>pulses</b> <b>in</b> India, {{one of the most}} important crops in India from the perspective of nutrition as well as environmental sustainability. India has been persistently deficient <b>in</b> <b>pulses</b> <b>in</b> spite of significant investment by the government over time. Using secondary data for a long period of time, from 1950 to 2011, we study how production of pulses has changed across regions and over time in India. Realizing the role of <b>pulses</b> <b>in</b> the cereals complex, the study shows the changing scenario <b>in</b> <b>pulses</b> production as it was crowded out by cereals with the advent of Green Revolution technologies. We create typologies of different phases in the evolution of production in India. Results show that there have been pronounced movements <b>in</b> <b>pulses,</b> with production centers shifting regionally from north to south and east to west and some concentration in central India. Notwithstanding the turnaround <b>in</b> <b>pulses</b> <b>in</b> the past three to four years, pulses have been moving increasingly to marginal unirrigated areas. The econometric results based on fixed-effects estimation establish that as irrigation becomes available there is a switch away from pulses toward competing crops. Recent advances in technology with short- to extra-short-duration varieties that fit into cereal-based systems have opened up new avenues for <b>pulses</b> reflected <b>in</b> increasing production. Also, we find no evidence of crowding out of domestic production because of liberalized trade, which has been the case <b>in</b> <b>pulses</b> for a long period of time.
