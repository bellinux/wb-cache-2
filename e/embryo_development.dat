5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in <b>embryo</b> <b>development</b> problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The extinctions of Macroolithus {{and other}} eggs from Southern China {{have also had}} a history of {{different}} interpretations. In the 1990s, Chinese paleontologists, including the prominent egg specialist Zhao Zikui, observed a gradual reduction in dinosaur egg diversity during the final 200,000 to 300,000 years of the Cretaceous, with only Macroolithus ranging up to the boundary. They postulated, contrary to the impact hypothesis, that the extinction {{was the result of a}} prolonged drought that increased the concentration of trace heavy metals, which adversely affected eggshell and <b>embryo</b> <b>development</b> of the dinosaurs causing the population to gradually decline and collapse. Zhao et al. revised this hypothesis in 2002, postulating a gradual extinction of Macroolithus caused by the volcanism of the Deccan Traps. In 2004, Buck et al. disputed this interpretation, arguing that the apparent gradual extinction was an illusion caused by reworking of sediments. Zhao et al. (2009) maintained that the extinction event was gradual.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} a physiological analysis of somatic embryogenesis in four elite cultivars of date palms: Ahmar, Amsekhsi, Tijib, and Amaside, {{from the initial}} callogenesis to establishment and proliferation of embryogenic suspension cultures. Somatic <b>embryos</b> <b>development</b> and in vitro plants rooting were also studied. For each step, auxins and cytokinins concentrations were optimised. The primary callogenesis from leaf explants of seedlings appeared highly dependent on genotype. Ahmar (80 %) and Amsekhsi (76 %) appeared highly callogenic, whereas Tijib (10 %) and Amaside (2 %) produced low amounts of calluses. 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid appeared favorable to the induction of primary callogenesis and its effect was enhanced {{by the addition of}} benzyl adenine or adenine sulfate. Secondary friable calli obtained from chopped granular calli were used to initiate embryogenic cell suspensions in media supplied with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Suspension cultures showed a growth rate of fourfold after four subcultures in presence of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 [*]mg/L. Our results showed that a seven-day transitory treatment with benzyl adenine 0, 5 [*]mg/L was necessary to optimize <b>embryos</b> <b>development.</b> Naphthalene acetic acid induced the development of primary orthogravitropic roots during embryos germination.

5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.

25|$|Oocytes are {{carefully}} denudated from the cumulus cells, as these cells {{can be a}} source of contamination during the PGD if PCR-based technology is used. In the majority of the reported cycles, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is used instead of IVF. The main reasons are to prevent contamination with residual sperm adhered to the zona pellucida and to avoid unexpected fertilization failure. The ICSI procedure is carried out on mature metaphase-II oocytes and fertilization is assessed 16–18 hours after. The <b>embryo</b> <b>development</b> is further evaluated every day prior to biopsy and until transfer to the woman’s uterus. During the cleavage stage, embryo evaluation is performed daily {{on the basis of the}} number, size, cell-shape and fragmentation rate of the blastomeres.
