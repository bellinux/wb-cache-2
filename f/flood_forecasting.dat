25|$|Physical process {{models of}} {{complete}} drainage basins {{are even more}} complex. Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown. Basin models typically combine land-surface process components (to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel) {{with a series of}} reach models. For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff hydrograph that might result from a 100-year storm, although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting</b> and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and climate change.|$|E

Making improvements to extended-range rainfall and <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> models, assessing forecast skill and uncertainty, and exploring how to apply <b>flood</b> <b>forecasts</b> and communicate their benefits to decision-makers are significant challenges facing the forecasting and water resources management communities. This paper presents some of the latest science and initiatives from Australia on the development, application and communication of extreme rainfall and <b>flood</b> <b>forecasts</b> on the extended-range "subseasonal-to-seasonal" (S 2 S) forecasting timescale, with a focus on risk-based decision-making, increasing flood risk awareness and preparedness, capturing uncertainty, understanding human responses to <b>flood</b> <b>forecasts</b> and warnings, and the growing adoption of "climate services".

Accordingly, by means of a case study, a verification procedure is proposed. It comprises three steps that can be partially or totally implemented depending on the specific aim of the analysis (that is the context) allowing, this way, to evaluate forecasts at different perspectives or according to different points of view.

25|$|Radar {{estimates}} of rainfall and general weather forecasting techniques {{are also important}} components of good <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting.</b> In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway, and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.|$|E

40|$|The common {{approach}} to quantifying the precipitation forecast uncertainty is ensemble simulations where a {{numerical weather prediction}} (NWP) model is run {{for a number of}} cases with slightly different initial conditions. In practice, the spread of ensemble members in terms of flood discharge is used as a measure of forecast uncertainty due to uncertain precipitation forecasts. This study presents the uncertainty propagation of rainfall forecast into hydrological response with catchment scale through distributed rainfall-runoff modeling based on the forecasted ensemble rainfall of NWP model. At first, forecast rainfall error based on the BIAS is compared with <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> error to assess the error propagation. Second, the variability of <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> uncertainty according to catchment scale is discussed using ensemble spread.

40|$|Abstract no. H 33 G- 0908 Destructive flash floods {{occurred}} {{more frequently}} in the small and medium river basins in China recently. However, meteorological and hydrological station networks in such river basins were usually poor. Some of them were newly-built only several years ago so that long-series observations are unavailable; and therefore, {{it is impossible to}} gain the most suitable parameters for <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> from the historical data directly. This paper developed a rolling <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> method for such regions, taking the Leli River basin in Guangxi Province, China, as the study area. The Digital Yellow River Integrated Model (DYRIM) was adopted to simulate the streamflows of the Tianlin hydrological station for each flood during the study period, and the model parameters were rolling optimized in real time as follows. First, the parameters were calibrated with the observed rainfall and streamflow data of the first flood, and they were used to <b>forecast</b> the <b>flood</b> caused by the next rain. Second, when the rain came true, the parameters were modified with the newly-observed rainfall and streamflow data if the simulation result obtained with the parameters of the last flood was not satisfied; and the new parameters would be used to <b>forecast</b> the next <b>flood.</b> Through repeating the above two steps for each flood, the parameters may be optimized constantly; and finally, the value ranges of the parameters could be obtained.

A spatially-distributed continuous rainfall-runoff model is used along with ensemble and deterministic precipitation forecasts that combine rain gauge data, radar data and the forecast fields of the ALADIN and ECMWF numerical weather prediction models.
