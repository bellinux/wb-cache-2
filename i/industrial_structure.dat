40|$|China has {{undergone}} substantial industrial restructuring since the economic transition. The triple process of marketisation, globalisation and decentralisation {{has had a}} significant influence on the changes in <b>industrial</b> <b>structures</b> in Chinese provinces. Using provincial-industrial level data for 1980 - 2003, this article finds that Chinese provinces are quite similar in their <b>industrial</b> <b>structures.</b> The interior provinces, however, have gradually specialised in resource-based industries, so their <b>industrial</b> <b>structures</b> deviate from the national structure, while the coastal provinces host fairly similar industries. Statistical analysis found that marketisation had enhanced the role of comparative advantage in natural resources, stimulating the divergence of <b>industrial</b> <b>structures</b> of provinces with different resource endowments while encouraging provinces with comparable endowments to develop similar industries. However, decentralisation generates economic fragmentation of domestic markets, fueling inter-provincial protectionism and rational imitation, and leading to the convergence of <b>industrial</b> <b>structures</b> among provinces. Globalisation has two effects. On the one hand, the globalised provinces have been converging in their <b>industrial</b> <b>structures.</b> On the other hand, the globalised provinces have rather different <b>industrial</b> <b>structures</b> from the underperforming provinces in exports and utilisation of FDI. This result implies that economic transition and its consequences are critical in understanding industrial restructuring in the transitional economies. ...|$|R

Several government bodies were created and four-year plans were also enacted. Between 1952 and 1982, economic growth was on average 8.7%, and between 1983 and 1986 at 6.9%. The gross national product grew by 360% between 1965 and 1986. The percentage of global exports was over 2% in 1986, over other recently industrialized countries, (like South Korea), and the global industrial production output grew a further 680% between 1965 and 1986. The social gap between {{the rich and the poor}} fell (Gini: 0.558 in 1953, 0.303 in 1980), even lower than some Western European countries, but it grew a little in the 80's.

The entire [...] <b>industrial</b> <b>structure</b> sits {{on the west bank}} of the Rock River. Around 1900 the rest of the Piano Company's main complex was added to the existing structure. The main (west) facade of the Schiller Piano Company factory building faces Third Street with no setback from the street and its secondary facade, along with the rest of the exterior, features an exposed basement because the elevation lowers as the terrain slopes toward the Rock River. The rear facade exhibits a U-shape while maintaining the exposed basement level found throughout much of the rest of the structure. The front facade features seven bays, demarcated by wooden trim between the stucco panels, entrances are located on each of the even numbered panels. The roof is an unusual multi-gabled, low pitch roof, which is still original in its form. The building features two windows over each of the entrance bays. After Dale Dye purchased the facility the stucco cladding was added to the exterior in 1977-1978, covering all original windows and walls; they remain extant beneath the stucco, and some show up in post-2005 photographs.|$|E

6000|$|In the {{chapters}} {{of this book}} I have not generally had in mind the situation or the problems of England. [...] "Europe" [...] in my narration must generally be interpreted to exclude the British Isles. England {{is in a state}} of transition, and her economic problems are serious. We may be on the eve of great changes in her social and <b>industrial</b> <b>structure.</b> Some of us may welcome such prospects and some of us deplore them. But they are of a different kind altogether from those impending on Europe. I do not perceive in England the slightest possibility of catastrophe or any serious likelihood of a general upheaval of society. The war has impoverished us, but not seriously;--I should judge that the real wealth of the country in 1919 is at least equal to what it was in 1900. Our balance of trade is adverse, but not so much so that the readjustment of it need disorder our economic life.[157] The deficit in our Budget is large, but not beyond what firm and prudent statesmanship could bridge. The shortening of the hours of labor may have somewhat diminished our productivity. But it should not be too much to hope that this is a feature of transition, and no due who is acquainted with the British workingman can doubt that, if it suits him, and if he is in sympathy and reasonable contentment with the conditions of his life, he can produce at least as much in a shorter working day as he did in the longer hours which prevailed formerly. The most serious problems for England have been brought to a head by the war, but are in their origins more fundamental. The forces of the nineteenth century have run their course and are exhausted. The economic motives and ideals of that generation no longer satisfy us: we must find a new way and must suffer again the malaise, and finally the pangs, of a new industrial birth. This is one element. The other is that on which I have enlarged in Chapter II.;--the increase in the real cost of food and the diminishing response of nature to any further increase in the population of the world, a tendency which must be especially injurious to the greatest of all industrial countries and the most dependent on imported supplies of food.|$|E
