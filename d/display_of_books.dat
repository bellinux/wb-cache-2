40|$|Exhibitions and <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> and {{documents}} on shelves is revealed {{from the early}} Middle Ages on in paintings and illuminations, depicting studiolos, scriptoria, libraries, palaces and church interiors, dressed with book standards. The <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> referred to wealth, devotion and erudition. After the Ancien Regime, more particular {{in the second part}} of the 19 th century, medieval and early modern books were displayed to legitimate the national past. Exhibitions or the more or less permanent display of old books and manuscripts in showcases became fashionable in several European cities and main libraries. Furthermore, the presentation of archival and library material was connected with the growing concept of leisure time and tourism. World Exhibitions and Exhibitions of Medieval Art were popular platforms for display of documents in a historical context. One of the highlights was certainly the collection in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London and the prestigious exhibition of fine medieval art in Brussels in 1880. This major exhibition included a large number of medieval manuscripts and incunabula from all over Europe and proved to have considerable public appeal. Already in 1860 there was a growing interest, especially in England, in travelling to the Continent to see actual medieval relics, a trend that the development of the railways had made possible. On the other hand the interest and display of century old books encouraged the restoration and the rebinding policy. The Exhibitions of Industry were the best possible forum for the specialized workshops to present their pastiche bindings on historical material. In Paris, in addition to Gruel, there were other names famous for imitations, such as Trausz, Charles Capé and Thibaron-Joly. It was not only Parisian bibliophiles who came to them but also and especially American collectors, such as the industrial magnate Henry Walters (1848 - 1931), who bought scores of rebound manuscripts. For public collections, there was another challenge. After the Sankt-Gallen conference in 1898 one of the solutions proposed to protect original material was the making of reproductions. The starting point was the idea that the original would be handled less and thus would be better conserved. Photographic reproduction, it was argued, allowed the user to view and study a manuscript as much and for as long as he pleased, without any risk to the original. In this scope, facsimiles were additional used in exhibition display, as in the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. This lecture will present the context and evolution of display of historical documents in public places, as historical, didactical or artistic items, and the preparation, restoration, rebinding and care performed by the custodians to protect them before, during and after display. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Comprising paintings, {{drawings}} and a <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>books,</b> printed matter and other ephemera, ‘The Money Plot’, drew on autobiographical {{material from the}} artist’s own Soviet childhood as a starting point. The works plotted a serendipitous course through an imagined, personal history {{of the birth of}} modern consumer society. The thesis offered an empathic response to the vast, vital energies of capital flows that animate our world. The title of the exhibition was taken from an appendix of Balzac's novel La Cousine Bette, in which the editors provided a synopsis called ‘The money plot’ – a breakdown of debts, financial dependencies and connections between the protagonists. As the global financial crisis escalated in 2008, the project became charged with an uncanny cultural urgency. The exhibition was one major outcome for this large research project, which linked several artistic and cultural modes into an accompanying visual essay. It deployed a multidisciplinary approach to visual production that looked at literature, biography, design and architecture to create works that exist as contemporary art in conversation with the other disciplines. Related outcomes included the group shows ‘Natural Wonders, New Art From London’, Baibakov Art Projects, Moscow (2009) and ‘Il Faut Être Absolument Moderne’, Paradise Row, Istanbul (2009 – 10). ‘The Money Plot’ was extensively covered in the international art press, including: ‘Margarita Gluzberg’ (The Money Plot, Paradise Row), ‘Critic’s picks’ by Laura K. Jones for Artforum. com (2008); ‘The Money Plot’, by Charles Darwent, Art Review (2008); ‘Manifesting commerce’, interview with Eva Pelczer, New York Arts Magazine (2008); ‘The plot unfolds’, interview by Peter Carty, Mute magazine (2010); ‘Margarita Gluzberg’, feature, Citizen K International (2009); ‘The colour of money’ by Lee Johnson, Art India (2008); and ‘The fashion for modesty’, interview with Clare Carolin, Block Magazine (2010) ...|$|E
40|$|The C. Y. Thompson (CYT) Library {{enjoys a}} {{location}} central to east campus. This creates an ideal setting for CYT {{to serve as}} a hub for activities of all kinds. And, based upon the feedback from online surveys and face-to-face focus groups, {{there is no shortage of}} interest and ideas for how CYT can become the premier gathering place on UNL’s east campus for users from all backgrounds. In spite of this, the primary question needing to be addressed is ‘what is C. Y. Thompson’? Is it a building? Is it a library? Is it something entirely different? The task force members believe that CYT is a brand currently represented by a building. And, as such, the library should represent an important (but smaller) footprint within the building itself. University Libraries faculty and staff support this concept and embrace this change. They recognize that the value of the library is not in the static <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>books,</b> but in the connection between the information contained within the collections and users. And, they see great value in investing in CYT to create an inviting space that draws the maximum number of users representing the broadest interests. CYT is supremely positioned {{to serve as a}} third space for users. Not a user’s home or office, the task force envisions a vibrant gathering space where users feel creative ideas are planted, thoughts are openly discussed, and entrepreneurs are encouraged to pursue their interests. A place where stories of former Huskers are archived, and future stories are waiting to be written. A place where members of the university faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students, residents of local neighborhoods and citizens of Nebraska are welcome, and experience a connection with their land grant university. With this context in mind, the task force provides the following broad recommendations. More specific details for each of the five areas Library, Technology, Exterior Scape, Educational Space, and Community Space are located in the remainder of this report...|$|E
