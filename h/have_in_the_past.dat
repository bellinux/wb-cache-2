5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier than they <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> been assigned to D. b. helva, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than D. b. bicolor.|$|E
