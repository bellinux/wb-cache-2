25|$|Women’s {{fashion in}} the Regency era {{started to change}} drastically. It popularized the empire silhouette, which {{featured}} a fitted bodice and <b>high</b> <b>waist.</b> This “new natural style” emphasized {{the beauty of the}} body's natural lines. Clothing became lighter and easier to care for than in the past. Women often wore several layers of clothing, typically undergarments, gowns, and outerwear. The chemise, the standard undergarment of the era, prevented the thin, gauzy dresses from being fully transparent. Outerwear, such as the spencer and the pelisse, were popular.|$|E

25|$|The empire {{silhouette}} {{was created}} in the late 18th century to about early 19th century, and referred to the period of the First French Empire. This adoption had been linked with France’s Relation and adopted of Greek and Roman principles. The style was often worn in white to denote as a high social status. Josephine Bonaparte was the one of the figureheads for the Empire waistline, with her elaborated and decorated Empire line dresses. Regency women followed the Empire style along the same trend of raised waistlines as French styles, even when their countries were at war. Starting from 1780s and early 1790s, women’s silhouette became slimmer and the waistlines crept up. After 1795, waistlines rose dramatically and the skirt circumference was further reduced. Few years later, England and France started to show the focus of <b>high</b> <b>waist</b> style and this {{led to the creation of}} Empire style.|$|E

The primary aim {{of this study was to}} examine the association between serum zonulin levels and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and secondarily, between zonulin levels and anthropometric and metabolic factors. The offspring (n = 363) of the participants of the Malmö Diet and Cancer cardiovascular cohort (MDC-CV) were invited to an anthropometric and clinical examination, where fasting plasma glucose levels were measured. Questionnaires about lifestyle factors and medical history were completed along with the Visual Analog Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (VAS-IBS). Zonulin levels were measured in serum by ELISA. Neither GI symptoms nor GI diseases had any influence on zonulin levels. Higher zonulin levels were associated with <b>higher</b> <b>waist</b> circumference (p = 0. 003), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0. 003), and glucose levels (p = 0. 036). Higher zonulin levels were associated with increased risk of overweight (p < 0. 001), obesity (p = 0. 047), and hyperlipidemia (p = 0. 048). We cannot detect altered zonulin levels among individuals reporting GI symptoms or GI diseases, but higher zonulin levels are associated with <b>higher</b> <b>waist</b> circumference, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and increased risk of metabolic diseases...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate risk factors of obesity and its associated health problems in adolescence in Taiwan. Methods: We enrolled 559 adolescent volunteers with equal numbers of females and males in 2008. Participants were divided into two groups: obese (body mass index [BMI] ≧ 95 th percentile) and normal-weight adolescents (BMI: 15 th ~ 85 th percentile). Each of them completed a questionnaire about lifestyle and parents’ stature. Results: Obese mother had high likelihood of having obese girls and boys (P= 0. 001). Obese girls spent more time in watching TV (P= 0. 03) and had higher frequency of having sweetened soft drinks (P= 0. 016) than normal-weight group. Girls spent more time in TV watching associated higher frequency of having sweetened soft drinks (P= 0. 012). In boys, this associated with higher frequency of eating snick (P= 0. 018) and larger waist circumference (P= 0. 011).

Methods Six thousand {{one hundred and fifty}} six girls aged 6 - 19 were sampled.

All the subjects were divided into three groups: low class waist circumference, moderate class <b>waist</b> circumference and <b>high</b> class <b>waist</b> circumference. The menarche percentages were analyzed by using the status method. The menarche ages were analyzed by using the retrospective method.

Results The incidences of moderate class and <b>high</b> class <b>waist</b> circumstance were 20. 94 % and 25. 27 %, respectively.
