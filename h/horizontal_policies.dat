The main aim of the dissertation was to explore regional patterns of the allocation of public capital expenditure that has been distributed from the central level of public administration, i. e. the Government of the Czech Republic. The very importance of capital expenditure {{lies in the fact that}} they are dedicated to developmental activities and to actions increasing capital in general. Hence, the allocation of public capital funds induces dynamic / multiplier effects. Consequently, public capital expenditures are considered to be one of the key factors triggering socioeconomic development and contributing significantly to prosperity of regional economies. The issue was tackled from two main standpoints. Firstly, the premise of the regulative role of public finance (public policies) was questioned as one of the main starting points of the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} governments may use results-based budgeting to co-ordinate <b>horizontal</b> <b>policies,</b> {{and how a}} country's regime type may affect the incidence and success of such efforts. A rational choice institutional approach is used to frame the relations between "guardian " budget-makers in central budget agencies and "spender" civil servants in line departments. We undertake a quantitative analysis of primary budget documents of selected departments in the federal governments of Canada and the United States, and confirm our findings {{through a series of}} interviews with budget-makers, departmental officials and academics in both countries. Our findings suggest that, regardless of regime type, results-based budgeting is rarely used to help co-ordinate <b>horizontal</b> <b>policies,</b> for two main reasons. First, results-based budgeting's potential to co-ordinate is limited by methodological difficulties. In particular, {{it is often difficult to}} fully understand the causal theory behind programs and to fully measure all the relevant aspects of programs. Second, the motivation of budget-makers to so use results-based budgeting is limited by political disincentives. In particular, there are many disincentives to publicize the true objectives of programs and to reveal the actual performance of programs. On balance, the theoretical potential of and incentives to adopt "horizontal budgeting " is often outweighed by the practical difficulties and disincentives.

In this paper we compare benchmarking and peer review procedures as used by the EU with those used by the OECD. Different types of benchmarking and peer review are distinguished and pitfalls for (international) benchmarking are discussed. We find that the OECD has a clear single objective for its benchmarking and peer review activities (i. e. <b>horizontal</b> <b>policy</b> transfers) whereas the EU suffers from a mix of objectives (a. <b>horizontal</b> <b>policy</b> learning; b.

Moreover, in some areas benchmarking and peer review are not sufficient coordination tools, and are at best additional to those means of coordination that include enforceable sanctions...|$|R

It suggests that effective CPI {{in the land}} use sector requires i) internal climate policy coherence between mitigation and adaptation objectives and policies; ii) external climate policy coherence between climate change and development objectives; iii) vertical policy integration to mainstream climate change into sectoral <b>policies</b> and; iv) <b>horizontal</b> <b>policy</b> integration by overarching governance structures for cross-sectoral coordination. This framework is used to examine CPI in the land use sector of Indonesia. The findings indicate that adaptation actors and policies are the main advocates of internal policy coherence. External policy coherence between mitigation and development planning is called for, but remains to be operationalized. Bureaucratic politics has in turn undermined vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>policy</b> integration. Under these circumstances {{it is unlikely that}} the Indonesian bureaucracy can deliver strong coordinated action addressing climate change in the land use sector, unless sectoral ministries internalize a strong mandate on internal and external climate policy coherence and find ways to coordinate policy action effectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest how {{institutions}} can be created and modified to devise and implement industrial policy in the emerging market economies. Two main issues confronting industrial policy institutions are how to avoid regulatory capture, that is, having those policy-makers with a mandate to devise and implement industrial policy avoid being captured by particular interest groups; and how to make industrial policy consistent with international trade policy. The second section of this paper links institutions devising and implementing industrial and trade policies to the framework and timetable recently agreed upon in the Europe Agreements. The third section of the paper provides a framework for prescribing industrial policies, their interaction with trade policies, and institutions charged with policy formulation and implementation. At the heart of this framework is a clear distinction between sectoral policies, which essentially target the economic output of specific industries and even firms, and <b>horizontal</b> <b>policies,</b> which essentially focus on improving the quality of inputs in the production process. There are a number of reasons why industrial policy institutions of this second type are less likely to be subject to regulatory capture than industrial policy institutions of the first type. Regulatory capture is more likely to result when the benefits of industrial policy are concentrated upon a relatively few number of firms, as is the case of industrial targeting. By contrast, regulatory capture is less of a problem when the recipients tend to be more widely dispersed, as in the case of <b>horizontal</b> <b>policies.</b> Designing institutions of industrial policy and international trade to avoid, or at least to minimize regulatory capture is the subject of the fourth section. A number of administrative procedures which will serve to diminish the influence of political rent-seeking activities are introduced.

40|$|EU {{enlargement}} {{has increased}} {{the diversity of the}} European Union in a substantial way, in particular with respect to its capacities in the fields of science, technology and innovation (STI). The shares of both gross and business sector expenditures on R&D in GDP are increasingly diverging following EU enlargement, pointing at quite different levels of technological opportunities and absorptive capacity. Against this background, this paper tries to disentangle the rationales for STI policies at an EU level. Starting from the different policy rationales we assign different STI policy fields to levels of governance. Our discussion suggests that the European Union plays two quite distinct roles in EU STI policy. The first role is closely related to the assignment of policy competences and establishes the fields where the EU should act as policy maker and programme owner. But this alone is likely to be insufficient when it comes to managing and coordination of complex <b>horizontal</b> <b>policy</b> fields such as STI policy. Here the second role of the European Commission comes into its own. This second role is not related to policy making but to the "right" to fuel discussions to find coordinated solutions. This role is essentially political and relates to the job to stimulate activities in areas where the Commission has no mandate (due to missing clear rationales) to act alone.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} policy issues of {{knowledge}} spillovers via {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) to help positioning CEEC economies in global shift in production and innovation. CEEC economies successfully attracted some FDI in R&D. However, considerable misalignment between domestic and foreign technological accumulation exists. This is partly related to the heterogeneity of foreign subsidiaries but even more so to weak performance and governance of national innovation systems as well as poor coordination of FDI and policies {{in the field of}} science and technology (S&T). The paper reviews existing relevant policy areas such as linkage promotion, R&D capabilities and technological linkages, <b>horizontal</b> <b>policies,</b> training incentives, as well as industrial, technological and science parks. The paper argues that an increased policy focus on technological aspects would not only improve the potential for technological spillovers from FDI but also the absorption capability of domestic firms.

In this case, CEEC economies can use FDI as means to realign their national innovation systems with global knowledge creation and diffusion...|$|E

While these policies are easy to implement and can strengthen existing sectors, they do not contribute to creation of new sectors. For new sectors to emerge, specifically high technology ones that contribute to growth, resources have to be concentrated in that direction. This {{is very important for}} developing countries that are looking to reap comparative advantages in targeted sectors. These countries need to develop and apply vertical policies directed to selected sectors. Since we show in our analysis that the ICT sector takes the lead in the number of patents over the years for most countries, it would be worthwhile to target resources and efforts in this sector to boost national innovation. Stimulating local innovation lowers both a dependence on foreign collaboration and foreign patent ownership. This holds promise for countries looking to enhance the contribution to GDP. Additionally, with globalization, economies are moving towards service-based and knowledge-based industries that are primarily ICT-driven, encouraging new patterns of growth and innovation (Raghupathi et al. 2014).|$|E

Indeed, the comparative empirical analyses demonstrate that government ideological positions are not associated with the strictness and the timing of adoption of the smoking bans. On the other hand, economic factors like the scale of tobacco production in a country, smoking prevalence in society and public support for tough anti-smoking policy are all significantly related to the time it takes for a country to adopt smoking bans, and to the comprehensiveness and enforcement of these restrictions.
