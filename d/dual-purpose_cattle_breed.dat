A total of 80 individual milk samples were collected and milk casein fractions were detected and quantified with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis whereas MCP were determined with Formagraph. Sources of casein fractions variation and MCP were investigated using a linear model including herd, parity, and days in milk as fixed effects. Casein fractions showed increasing concentrations across days in milk, but not specific trends across parities. Milk coagulation properties exhibited better values in early than late lactation stages. Also, they deteriorated across parities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the current}} {{research}} was to evaluate the effects that temperament has on production and reproduction performances in Simmental <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breed.</b> Behavioral reactivity of cows significantly influenced (P ≤ 0. 05) the body weight, milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, protein content, and the calving interval of the cows included in the study-head, having more substantial effects (P ≤ 0. 001) on the milking speed {{and the number of}} steps per day, with calmer cows outperforming the nervous counterparts. However, temperament did not influence (P > 0. 05) traits such as days open, number of inseminations per gestation, fat percentage, somatic cell count, body condition score, cleanliness of udder and cleanliness of hindquarter. Significant negative phenotypic correlations were found between temperament and cows body weight (− 0. 19), milk yield (− 0. 19), fat yield (− 0. 14), protein yield (− 0. 18), and milking speed (− 0. 18). Current results suggest that selection for calm temperaments will translate into increased milk, fat, and protein yields in Simmental cattle, as well as shorter the calving interval and improved milk ejection...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{assessments}} {{of the effectiveness of}} GHG mitigation measures at farm level are scarce. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the GHG mitigation potential of selected measures on two typical organic farms in Switzerland. We built a single-farm model which enabled us to calculate the GHG emissions and energy consumption at farm level using a life cycle assessment approach. The model was used to calculate the effects of 13 different mitigation measures on a Swiss organic dairy and a Swiss organic mixed farm. At the dairy and mixed farm, respectively, 5. 4 % and 5. 5 % of mitigation in relation to the farms’ total GHG emissions could be realized by technical means and 15. 4 % and 12. 9 % with agronomic measures. Technical measures include the use of photovoltaics and heat recovery from milk cooling devices. The agronomic measures include conversion to full-grazing systems, composting livestock manure, and the use of <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds.</b> The total mitigation potential of the analysed measures is 20. 8 % less GHG emissions for the dairy farm and 18. 5 % less for the mixed farm. However, some agronomic measures may result in yield decreases, which reduce the total mitigation effect of the analysed portfolio of measures from an LCA perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the expected loss of genetic diversity and marginal diversities {{in a set of}} breeds within a defined future time horizon requires initial estimates of breed extinction probabilities. In this study, the extinction probabilities of 5 German <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> were estimated by population viability analysis. Regression was used to estimate the infinitesimal mean and variance of the population growth and this was based on the diffusion approximation of the density independent population growth (also known as the Dennis regression model). The annual number of milk-recorded cows in each breed was used as census data. Based on the regression results, the extinction probabilities and their confidence intervals were estimated {{for a wide variety of}} future time horizons using Monte Carlo time series simulations. The estimates of extinction probabilities were sensible, but in 2 cases they depended heavily on the time horizon considered. Additionally, the confidence intervals became very wide with an increased time horizon. We recommend the {{estimation of}} extinction probabilities for a set of future time horizons rather than for a single future time and the selection of an upper bound for this set that is not too large to be meaningful. The validity of the use of the number of milk-recorded cows as census data and of the model assumptions is discussed in detail.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to apply all {{available}} information (for time period 2011 to 2013) about the dual purpose <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> (Simmental and Pinzgauer) to the program package ECOWEIGHT and to suggest selection criteria for Slovak dairy and cow calf production systems. The main advantages of Ph. D. thesis were the calculation of economic weights with comprehensive consideration and updating of the current farming conditions, as well as the calculation of economic weights for new traits i. e. health and residual feed intake traits. For the calculations, the bio-economic model and the most common marketing strategy for given production system were used. The main comparative advantage of Simmental and Pinzgauer breeds, were the milk yield (dairy system) and proportion of sold calves per 100 cows (cow-calf system), respectively. For the both breeds and production systems the longevity of cows was detected as the weakness. The highest proportion in cost and revenues structure for the feeding and main products was observed, respectively. For both breeds and production systems, the profit (regardless of subsidies including) was not reached. For Simmental breed in dairy and cow calf system, the highest economic importance was observed for milk yield (19. 9 %) and fertility of cows (22. 5 %), daily gain of calves till weaning (age of 100 days; 16. 1 %) and weight of calves at 210 days of age (14. 3 %) and for the longevity of cows (11. 4 % and 12. 4 %), respectively. On the other hand, for SP breed the highest relative importance was observed for daily gain till weaning (100 days of age, 20. 3 %) and weight of calves at 210 days (100 days of age; 20. 3 %), milk yield (20. 2 %) and weight at 120 days of age (14. 4 %) and for longevity of cows (10. 1 % and 16. 8 %) in dairy and cow-calf population, respectively. Based on the results of Ph. D. thesis, it could be recommended to reconsider the current breeding objectives, as well as to redefine the selection indices of <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> in Slovakia. The emphasise should be based to growth and functional traits, with the aim to integrate preferences of consumers (environmental criterion and popularity of animal products), as well as to ensure the sustainability of animal production...|$|R
40|$|In cattle, caseins are {{subdivided}} into four main groups: αS 1 -, αS 2 -, ß- and k-caseins. k-caseins (CSN 2) considerably differ from other caseins in structure and other properties. Testing the A and B alleles is of practical importance, because the milk of cows that carry the B allele of CSN 3 {{has a better}} thermal resistance and shorter coagulation time, better curdles and contains micelles of different sizes. Iranian Sistani cattle (Bos indicus) are a heavy built breed and used as <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breed</b> in Eastern Iran. This breed is a genetic resource that shows special features of adaptation to rustic environments. One of the most distinctive features of Sistani cattle is its great capability to resist diseases {{which makes it a}} potential reservoir of germplasm useful for future crosses. Our main goal was to study DNA-polymorphism of the CSN 3 gene in the Iranian Sistani native cattle (Bos indicus) and analyze the information value of CSN 3 gene polymorphism as a genetic marker. We genotyped and analyzed 65 animals of this breed using PCR-RFLP. The frequencies of A and B alleles were 0. 6385 and 0. 3615 and those of AA, AB and BB genotypes were 0. 4000, 0. 4769 and 0. 1231, respectively. In the Sistani Zebu breed, frequency of B allele is higher than other Zebu breeds, indicating that intensive selection for dairy production have been done and indirectly influenced CSN 3 allele frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} if genomic variations associated with fatty acid (FA) composition are similar between the Holstein-Friesian (HF) and native dual-purpose breeds used in the Dutch dairy industry. Phenotypic and genotypic information were available for the breeds Meuse-Rhine-Yssel (MRY), Dutch Friesian (DF), Groningen White Headed (GWH), and HF. First, the reliability of genomic breeding values of the native Dutch <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> MRY, DF, and GWH was evaluated using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects estimated in HF, including all SNP or subsets with stronger associations in HF. Second, the genomic variation of the regions associated with FA composition in HF (regions on Bos taurus autosome 5, 14, and 26), were studied in the different breeds. Finally, similarities in genotype and allele frequencies between MRY, DF, GWH, and HF breeds were assessed for specific regions associated with FA composition. On average across the traits, the highest reliabilities of genomic prediction were estimated for GWH (0. 158) and DF (0. 116) when the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were included. With the same set of SNP, GEBV for MRY were the least reliable (0. 022). This indicates that on average only 2 (MRY) to 16 % (GWH) of the genomic variation in HF is shared with the native Dutch dual-purpose breeds. The comparison of predicted variances of different regions associated with milk and milk fat composition showed that breeds clearly differed in genomic variation within these regions. Finally, the correlations of allele frequencies between breeds across the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were around 0. 8 between the Dutch native dual-purpose breeds, whereas the correlations between the native breeds and HF were clearly lower and around 0. 5. There was no consistent relationship between the reliabilities of genomic prediction for a specific breed and the correlation between the allele frequencies of this breed and HF. In conclusion, most of the genomic variation associated with FA composition in the Dutch dual-purpose breeds appears to be breed-specific. Furthermore, the minor allele frequencies of genes having an effect on the milk FA composition in HF were shown to be much smaller in the breeds MRY, DF, and GWH, especially for the MRY breed...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} organic {{products}} in Europe is growing, especially organic products of animal origin. Organic dairy milk production requires grazing of cows, {{which results in}} a feed ration that is pasture-based. The breed that is kept {{by far the most}} for dairy production in Europe is the Holstein Friesian cow, a high-yielding dairy cow. This <b>cattle</b> <b>breed</b> has been developed in North America and was selected for its high milk yield. The disadvantages of this one-sided selection for production manifest in the health, fertility and longevity of the cow. More important, the high milk yield of the Holstein Friesian is only achieved when the cows are fed a diet of high quality and especially concentrates, which is not always possible in a pasture-based system. In this study the alternative for the Holstein Friesian breed is considered, namely the dual-purpose cow. Most countries feature indigenous cow breeds which were traditionally kept for both milk and meat. Because of the popularity of the Holstein Friesian breed these local breeds are less used in dairy production systems. An extensive literature study was carried out to compare the popular Holstein Friesian breed to the local <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds.</b> This showed that local dual-purpose breeds display in many traits such as health, fertility, meat quality and longevity an advantage over the Holstein Friesian. Additionally, dual-purpose cows are better able to cope with a harsh environment and a diet of low quality. Furthermore, the grazing behaviour of one of the Dutch dual-purpose breeds, the Dutch Friesian, was compared in the current study to the Holstein Friesian. For this purpose the monitoring system SensOor (AGIS) was used. SensOor registers the four main conducts of the cows, namely eating, ruminating, resting and other activity (such as walking, standing, etc.). The system expresses the time the cows spend on these conducts in percentages per hour or per day. In this study the SensOor system was validated under grazing conditions for the first time. Before, the SensOor system was only validated indoors or in a dirt pen. The validation under grazing conditions was done by observing the behaviour of the cows on the pasture, and comparing these observations with the SensOor output. The observation of the activity ‘grazing’ corresponded very well with the detection of the activity ‘eating’ (R² = 0. 97). As the validation of SensOor under grazing conditions was successful, the output of the system was used to compare the behaviour of the two <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds.</b> In the current study no significant differences in behaviour were found, which {{can be explained by the}} differences in size of the cows (HF: 650 kg, DF: 575 kg) which have therefore different energy requirements. Another explanation could be that the high quality of the grassland on the studied farm concealed the ability of dual-purpose cows to cope with low-quality roughages. Besides the study of the behaviour of the cows, the herbage production on two farms was estimated. This was done by the placement of grass cages on the pastures. The herbage growth under the cages was mown, weighed and analysed. In conclusion, the monitoring system SensOor is very suitable to monitor the grazing time of cows. The literature study showed that dual-purpose cows have advantages over the Holstein Friesian (especially in milk composition, meat quality, health and longevity). Concerning their grazing behaviour, dual-purpose cows might spend more time on grazing and constitute more grass in their diet. This difference in behaviour was not shown by the output of SensOor. The absence of this difference might be explained by the excellent environment of the Friesian pastures. It is expected that the advantage concerning grass and feed intake of dual-purpose cows are better demonstrated in a harsh environment with pastures of low quality...|$|R

The optimal weights of milk and beef characters depend on the marginal change in profit, and the time and number of realizations of genetic improvement of the traits.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was the {{comparison}} of slaughter value and muscle properties of <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>cattle</b> most common in Poland with that of beef type, from which high quality culinary meat is obtained. Four breeds were compared: {{two of them were}} dual-purpose type i. e. Holstein-Fresian of Black and White variety and Polish Red and the other two – of beef type i. e. Limousine and Hereford. There are discussed factors influencing cattle slaughter value and muscle properties, i. e. the impact of the utility type, gender, age, feeding systems, as well as maturation rate of animals. The slaughter value was presented using the dressing percentage and the content of main components in the carcass i. e. the muscle tissue, fat and bones. The tissue composition of analysed <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> and the share of main cuts in their carcasses were presented. Higher daily gains of beef type or dual-purpose breeds are connected with a higher number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia) and also with a bigger size of their diameter (hypertrophy). These phenomena are accompanied by increased lightness of meat colour what is the result of changes in the muscle fibers metabolism and the proportion of myosin heavy chains (MHC) of the I, IIa and IIx type. Observed differences in the slaughter value existed not only between breeds, but also inside them indicating the need for further improvement of animal selection and deeper analysis of factors influencing it. It was stated that the amount of culinary meat obtained from carcasses may be increased not only through the selection of corresponding genotypes, but also through the modification of the system of carcass cutting.
