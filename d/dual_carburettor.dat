50|$|In 1922 {{the highly}} {{sophisticated}} 30/40 Super Sports was launched, with a 4,400cc six cylinder engine, using twin overhead camshafts (dohc) operating four valves per cylinder. The aluminium alloy cylinders had steel liners and aluminium pistons, plus <b>dual</b> <b>carburettors</b> and dual-ignition. The car was also equipped with front-wheel brakes and a V-shaped radiator.|$|R
50|$|The 1500 cc {{engine was}} offered on the Plymouth Cricket, the 1250 {{being a little}} underpowered for American tastes. Side marker lamps (US DOT required) were added, and front disc brakes were standardised; these were {{originally}} optional in the UK. The single carburettor / manual choke combination was standard. From 1972, the single carburettor / automatic choke combination, <b>dual</b> <b>carburettors,</b> and air conditioning were all options.|$|R
50|$|The 1.6 L (1591 cc) 7R was {{produced}} from 1968 through 1971 with a twin throat down-draft carburettor.The 7R-B {{was produced}} from 1968 through 1969 with <b>dual</b> SU <b>carburettors</b> and higher compression.The 7R-LPG was produced from 1969 through 1970.|$|R
50|$|By 1959, the Tiger 110 was {{no longer}} Triumph's fastest model, the <b>dual</b> <b>carburettor</b> Bonneville T120 having taken its mantle. Triumph added the {{enclosed}} panels from the Twenty One which, resembling an upside-down Victorian slipper bathtub, earned the bike the nickname 'bathtub'.|$|E
50|$|Technical adaptations {{enabled the}} {{production}} of this engine in many displacements in single and <b>dual</b> <b>carburettor</b> forms, later with fuel injection, with or without turbo. The Cléon-Fonte was coupled initially to four-speed manual transmissions, and then later five speed and automatic gearboxes according to its applications and the natural progress of the automotive industry.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{available}} with [...] at 5200 rpm using a single carburettor, [...] at 5200 rpm using a <b>dual</b> <b>carburettor,</b> [...] at 5500 rpm using Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a turbocharged, fuel injected version with [...] at 5000 rpm. In 1986 an intercooled {{version of the}} turbo engine also became available, it produces [...] at 5500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Bentley and {{his team}} {{developed}} a modern dual overhead cam straight-6 engine. It initially displaced 2.6 L (2580 cc/157 in3) with an 78 mm (3.07 in) bore and 90 mm (3.543 in) stroke and produced roughly 105 hp (78 kW) with <b>dual</b> SU <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Honda CBX250RS was a {{motorcycle}} first sold by Honda in May 1983 in Japan as their new 250cc sports bike {{with a view}} to replacing the popular CB250RS. The engine was based on the XR series with particular links to the XR350 bottom end, including a six-speed gearbox and the same oil pump. The stroke is also the same, but the bore reduced to bring the capacity down to 249cc. The balance shaft was also discarded, with the engine instead being rubber mounted. Unlike any other XR engine the top was given two camshafts. The bike was also equipped with <b>dual</b> <b>carburettors,</b> only one of which was equipped with a pilot circuit and which open different amounts depending on how much the throttle is twisted.|$|R
5000|$|The Cyclone was {{the same}} basic machine as the Royal Star except fitted for high performance. The A50CC Cyclone Competition built for the US market model year 1964 had dual 1 1/16" [...] carburettors, higher 10.5:1 engine {{compression}}, magneto ignition, larger front brake, 2 gallon fuel tank and upswept open exhaust. Built for scrambles, this model had no road lights. The A50C Cyclone Road built for the US market model years 1964 and 1965 had 1 1/16" [...] <b>dual</b> <b>carburettors,</b> higher 9:1 compression engine and larger front brake. This model had battery ignition, full road lighting and the same 2 gallon fuel tank. Both models were available for the UK market with 9:1 engine compression, battery ingition and 4 gallon fuel tanks.1 ...|$|R
5000|$|The 250S was the {{entry-level}} vehicle {{fitted with}} a 2496 cm³ Straight-six M108 engine, with two <b>dual</b> downdraft <b>carburettors,</b> delivering [...] at 5400 rpm which accelerated the car to 100 km/h in 13 seconds (14 on automatic transmission) and gave {{a top speed of}} 182 km/h (177 on auto).|$|R
5000|$|The 2-door Crown Convertible was {{displayed}} at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show, based on the Crown 1900 sedan. Features included a hydraulically operated folding soft top and electric windows. The 1897 cc 3R engine had <b>dual</b> SU <b>carburettors</b> fitted, raising the power to [...] Transmission was by a 4-speed column shift manual gearbox. It was not put into production.|$|R
50|$|In its {{original}} form the Lagonda straight-6 had an 78 mm (3.07 in) bore and 90 mm (3.543 in) stroke, and produced about 105 hp (78 kW) with <b>dual</b> SU <b>carburettors.</b> The DB2 utilized it in a shortened {{version of the}} tube-frame chassis designed by Claude Hill for the Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports, with a fastback coupé body designed by Frank Feeley.|$|R
50|$|During the war W. O. {{worked on}} armaments at Lagonda. Towards {{the end of}} the war he began work on a new straight-6 engine, as it was clear that the V12 would be seen as too extravagant for the postwar market. The team {{developed}} a modern dual overhead cam straight-6 engine with an initial displacement of 2.6 L (2580 cc/157 in3). With a 78 mm (3.07 in) bore and 90 mm (3.543 in) stroke, it produced about 105 hp (78 kW) with <b>dual</b> SU <b>carburettors.</b> It would not reach the market until 1948.|$|R
5000|$|The GTAm (1969-1971) {{could produce}} up to [...] in the 2000 cc car - a car usually {{related to the}} GTA, but unlike the GTA derived from the GTV 1750 (US version). The 1750 GTAm (later called 2000 GTAm when the 2000 GTV was introduced) was created in 1969. There are two schools of thought about the [...] "Am" [...] moniker, neither one ever having been officially {{confirmed}} by Alfa Romeo: one expands Am to Alleggerita Maggiorata (Italian: lightened enlarged), the other America Maggiorata. The car had a full steel body modified with aluminium and / or plastic parts. Because of an increased minimum weight in 1971 (up from 920 to 940 kg), the GTAm's had less need for aluminium and / or plastic parts. The base for the GTAm was the 1750 GTV with a SPICA mechanical fuel injection system. The majority of the genuine GTAm's built by Autodelta have a chassis number starting with 105.51.XXXXXX. The European market 1750 GTV with <b>dual</b> <b>carburettors</b> from Dell'Orto or Weber carburetor and chassisnumbers starting with 105.44.XXXXXX was also used as a base. The {{same goes for the}} 2000 GTV and the 1300 GT Junior bodyshell that was lighter. Note that some racing teams and private workshops ordered the parts from Autodelta and other tuners and assembled the cars themselves on a new or existing bodyshell. The original 1750 engine block (actually 1779 cc) was used and by inserting a monosleeve instead of four individual cylinderliners, received 1985 cc and later to 1999 cc to participate in the 2000 cc class, explaining the [...] "maggiorata" [...] (enlarged). According to the sources, some 40 GTAm's were built by Autodelta and by private workshops. This number is difficult to verify as the GTAm's didn't have their own specific chassis number series. In the second revised edition of the book `Alleggerita` (written by Tony Adriaensens & Patrick Dasse), published in 2012 by Dingwort Verlag, you will find the most complete list available of GTAm's.|$|R
50|$|The {{fibreglass}} nose protected a 'bored-out' horizontal 950 cc three cylinder {{two stroke}} engine, with two <b>dual</b> Solex <b>carburettors</b> developing some 95 bhp - (one of the carburettors {{was cut in}} half, thus providing three chokes — {{one for each of}} the three cylinders). There was a cross-flow radiator, for cooling. The suspension was purpose-built, incorporating a unique type of tensile spring. The cars did not do very well in races, due to their cornering ability and their relatively low-powered engine (the later regulations allowed up to 1100 cc engines). Nonetheless, two first places and a track record (Stockholm) were achieved. The 70%-30% front-rear weight distribution created pronounced understeer. This was only partially overcome by designing the rear suspension to encourage the inside rear wheel to lift during cornering. Only two cars were built, as later regulations made them even less competitive. They were retired at the end of the 1961 racing season. History records them as having fulfilled an important developmental role for Saab's competition department.|$|R
5000|$|Stanguellini's cars {{competed in}} countless sports car racing events, minor and major (such as the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans) alike. Vittorio Stanguellini used his {{experience}} tuning Fiats in the pre-war days, and having raced {{them under the}} Squadra Stanguellini flag, he based his small racers on Fiat components. Focusing on the 750 & 1100 cc classes (winning numerous National victories), Stanguellini sports cars were beautifully engineered cars with light-alloy cylinder blocks, twin overhead camshafts (bialbero) and <b>dual</b> side-draught Weber <b>carburettors.</b> This would {{add up to a}} claimed [...] at 7500 rpm from the 741 cc sports engine and [...] at 7000 rpm from the larger engine, providing top speeds of around 180 km/h and 190 km/h respectively.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{the normal}} BX, Citroën {{produced}} the BX Sport from 1985 to 1987. During this period, Citroën produced 7,500 BX Sports; 2,500 in the first series, then an extra 5,000 due to its sales success. Rated at [...] at 5800 rpm and equipped with <b>dual</b> twin-barrel <b>carburettors,</b> the BX Sport was the most powerful BX in production at that time. The engine modifications, including a reshaped combustion chamber and larger valves, were developed by famous French tuner Danielson. It also stood out with its unique body kit, alloy wheels later also used on the GTi, a unique dashboard and Pullman interior. The seat fabric {{was the same as}} that used on the CX Turbo at the time. The body kit included a rear wing, side skirts, and fender extensions that added 10 cm to each side of the car in order to accommodate the larger wheels. The car was only available in LHD, so it was not sold in the United Kingdom. Period road tests complimented the ride quality (as usual with Citroëns) but complained that the driving characteristics were not all that sporty as a result, even though the suspension had also been modified.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} the B18 (B for the Swedish word for gasoline: Bensin; 18 for 1800 cc displacement) with <b>dual</b> SU <b>carburettors,</b> {{producing}} 118 hp (75 kW). This variant (named B18B) {{had a higher}} compression ratio than the slightly less powerful twin-carb B18D used in the contemporary Amazon 122S, {{as well as a}} different camshaft. The 'new' B18 was actually developed from the existing B36 V8 engine used in Volvo trucks at the time. This cut production costs, as well as furnishing the P1800 with a strong engine boasting five main crankshaft bearings. The B18 was matched with the new and more robust M40 manual gearbox through 1963. From 1963 to 1972 the M41 gearbox with electrically actuated overdrive was a popular option. Two overdrive types were used, the D-Type through 1969, and the J-type through 1973. The J-type had a slightly shorter ratio of 0.797:1 as opposed to 0.756:1 for the D-type. The overdrive effectively gave the 1800 series a fifth gear, for improved fuel efficiency and decreased drivetrain wear. Cars without overdrive had a numerically lower-ratio differential, which had the interesting effect of giving them a somewhat higher top speed (just under 120 mph) than the more popular overdrive models. This was because the non-overdrive cars could reach the engine's redline in top gear, while the overdrive-equipped cars could not, giving them a top speed of roughly 110 mph.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963 there {{started a}} program, led by Igor Gladilin and Lev Shugurov to design an engine for a true {{international}} Formula One car. The effect was the GD-1, an eight-cylinder 1500 cc DOHC engine {{which was to}} give [...] at 10,500 rpm. Moskvitch factory had no suitable test stand for high-rev engines, but already during tests the engine produced [...] at 6000 rpm. The engine was fitted with four <b>dual</b> Weber 280DKB <b>carburettors</b> and the total weight was 148 kg. The fibreglass body was designed using a wind tunnel. The engine and a five-gear gearbox were built in 1965 and a new G5 chassis was modified for test purpose, {{although it was not}} meant to be a final car. However, in 1965 a government funding was cut, and Moskvitch factory alone could not afford a program, so it was abandoned in 1967. Also, by that year more powerful 3000 cc engines were introduced to Formula One. Only the new gearbox, with four upper gears synchronised, was adapted for G5 cars.|$|R
