50|$|Before the {{compilation}} of such books, several books were used when celebrating Mass. These included the Gradual (texts {{mainly from the}} Psalms, with musical notes added), the <b>Evangelary</b> or Gospel Book, the Epistolary with texts {{from other parts of}} the New Testament, mainly the Epistles (letters) of Saint Paul, and the Sacramentary with the prayers that the priest himself said.|$|E
50|$|Ramiro I's daughter-in-law, Felicia, wife of King Sancho Ramírez, donated an <b>evangelary</b> to the nunnery. It is now lost, {{but either}} of two {{surviving}} silver-gilt plaques incorporating some Byzantine ivories {{is thought to}} have been its book cover. The covers, one of which bears Felicia's name, now reside in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Both may have at one time belonged to Santa María.|$|E
50|$|The Chaldean {{diocese of}} Mardin {{appears to have}} been founded {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth-century, either by Yohannan Sulaqa or (more probably) his {{successor}} Abdisho IV Maron, after Saluqa broke from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1553 AD. Tfinkdji gave the following list of supposed bishops of Mardin from 1194 to 1512, apparently contained in an <b>evangelary</b> copied in 1621: Yaqob of Amid (1194-1227); Isaac of Nisibis (1229-51); Marqos of Mardin (1252-75); Denha of Maiperqat (1280-1301); Quriaqos of Dunaysir to Tfinkdji the old name of the Mardin village of Tel Armen (1305-17); Stephen of Mardin (1319-40); Giwargis of Resh Aïna (1345-61); Eleazar of Kfartutha (1364-75); Samuel of Edessa (1378-95); Yohannan of Seert (1397-1400); Yahballaha of Gazarta (1400-09); Yalda of Amid (1410-29); Peter of Mardin (1431-45); Sabrisho of Gazarta (1448-68); Eliya of Mosul (1470-86); and Timothy of Hesna d'Kifa (1488-1512).|$|E
50|$|Vöge {{was born}} in Bremen. He studied art history under Anton Springer and Paul Clemen at the University of Leipzig, under Carl Justi, Karl Lamprecht and Henry Thode at the University of Bonn, where Aby Warburg and Hermann Ullmann were his classmates, and finally under Hubert Janitschek at the University of Strasbourg. In 1891 he wrote his {{groundbreaking}} Ph.D. dissertation on Ottonian painting, based on the Munich manuscript Cim. 58 ("the <b>Evangelary</b> of Otto III"), which established the group of painters known today as the Reichenau School (then however located in Trier). He became a friend of Heinrich Wölfflin. After a research trip in France, where he met the German medievalist Adolph Goldschmidt and the French scholars Gaston Maspero, Eugène Müntz, Camille Enlart, Paul Vitry, Albert Marignan and Louis Courajod, Vöge published a book on French medieval sculpture (Die Anfänge des monumentalen Stiles im Mittelalter, 1894). Then he went to Italy in order to write his Habilitationsschrift on Raphael and Donatello (1895).|$|E
