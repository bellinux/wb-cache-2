2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{wideband}} FM (WFM) requires a wider signal bandwidth than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this {{also makes the}} signal more robust against noise and interference. Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM {{was chosen as the}} modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term [...] "FM radio" [...] (although for many years the BBC called it [...] "VHF radio" [...] because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF band—the FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the capture effect, in which the tuner [...] "captures" [...] the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). However, <b>frequency</b> <b>drift</b> or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an adjacent channel. <b>Frequency</b> <b>drift</b> was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.|$|E

It was known that a multi-cavity resonant magnetron had been developed and patented in 1935 by Hans Hollmann in Berlin. However, the German military considered the <b>frequency</b> <b>drift</b> of Hollman's device to be undesirable, and based their radar systems on the klystron instead. [...] But klystrons could not at that time achieve the high power output that magnetrons eventually reached.

2500|$|Prior to {{widespread}} use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on manual tuning of a local oscillator, which used a resonant circuit composed of an inductor and capacitor, or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a variable capacitor, or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s. [...] However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable; [...] variations in temperature and aging of components caused <b>frequency</b> <b>drift,</b> causing the receiver to drift off the station frequency. Automatic frequency control (AFC) solves some of the drift problem, but manual retuning was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem.|$|E

We use energy criteria of wavelet packet transform (WPT) for optimization based tuning of the IIR filter parameters.

50|$|One can incoherently add the {{magnitudes}} of a {{time series}} of N-independent pulses to obtain a √N improvement in the signal to noise on the amplitude, but {{at the expense of}} losing the phase information. Instead coherent addition (adding the complex magnitude and phase) of multiple pulse waveforms would improve the signal to noise by a factor of N, not its square root, and preserve the phase information. The practical limitation is adjacent pulses from typical lasers have a minute <b>frequency</b> <b>drift</b> that translates to a large random phase shift in any long distance return signal, and thus just like the case for spatially scrambled-phase pixels, destructively interfere when added coherently.

If not accounted for, <b>frequency</b> and phase <b>drifts</b> will result in artifactual broadening of spectral peaks, distortion of spectral lineshapes, {{and a reduction in}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present herein a new method for estimating and correcting <b>frequency</b> and phase <b>drifts</b> in in vivo MRS data. METHODS: We used a simple method of fitting each spectral average to a reference scan (often the first average in the series) in the time domain through adjustment of frequency and phase terms. Due to the similarity with image registration, this method is referred to as "spectral registration. " Using simulated data with known <b>frequency</b> and phase <b>drifts,</b> the performance of spectral registration was compared with two existing methods at various SNR levels. RESULTS: Spectral registration performed well in comparison with the other methods tested in terms of both <b>frequency</b> and phase <b>drift</b> estimation. CONCLUSIONS: Spectral registration provides an effective method for <b>frequency</b> and phase <b>drift</b> correction. It does not involve the collection of navigator echoes, and does not rely on any specific resonances, such as residual water or creatine, making it highly versatile.
