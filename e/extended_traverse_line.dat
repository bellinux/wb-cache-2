30|$|The LOMGRAV survey, {{like most}} {{airborne}} surveys, includes {{a large number}} of parallel, densely spaced <b>traverse</b> <b>lines</b> and a number of tie-lines with larger line spacing flown orthogonal to the <b>traverse</b> <b>lines.</b> During line levelling, differences in data values at intersections of <b>traverse</b> <b>lines</b> with tie-lines (cross-over differences) are taken into account to reduce errors arising from data offsets between adjacent survey lines (e.g. heading errors) or imperfect temporal reduction which could otherwise lead to severe artefacts during gridding (Pilkington and Thurston, 2001).|$|R
30|$|In the LOMGRAV survey, however, also intersections of <b>traverse</b> <b>lines</b> exist, both in {{the main}} survey area and in the radial flight lines from and to the three airfields (Fig. 1 (a, b)). Additionally, some flights {{included}} sections {{from more than one}} <b>traverse</b> <b>line</b> or parts of <b>traverse</b> <b>lines</b> were flown more than once. Occasionally, intersecting or overlapping lines were flown at different altitudes. Furthermore, each of the three prominent tie-lines (North, Centre, South) are broken up into partly overlapping sections. To account for these features, some of the lines with deviating altitude were removed and an adaptive line levelling procedure was performed on the reduced survey data ΔFsurvey. In this procedure, we distinguish between tie-line cross-over differences and traverse-line cross-over differences. Firstly, the flight lines were split into separate <b>traverse</b> <b>lines</b> and tie-lines. Spacing is about 12 to 15 km for the <b>traverse</b> <b>lines</b> in the main survey area, 316 km between the North tie-line and the Centre tie-line and 240 km between the Centre and the South tie-line (Fig. 1 (b)). The North, Centre and South tie-line consists of two, three and four partly overlapping sections, respectively. Secondly, the sections of each tie-line were merged by shifting ΔFsurvey by a constant offset for each section such that the shifted data mean values are identical in the overlapping parts. The offsets are between − 3.9 nT and − 21.1 nT and the mean values are based on about 150 to 1200 measurements, which show a similar variation in the overlapping region. Thirdly, for each merged tie-line, the tie-line cross-over differences were calculated and the tie-line was adjusted by the straight line fit to the cross-over differences. The tie-line cross-over differences after adjustment and the traverse-line cross-over differences are shown in Fig. 1 (b). The fourth step is based on the adjusted tie-line cross-over differences. <b>Traverse</b> <b>lines</b> that intersect only two tie-lines were DC-shifted by the mean value of the two tie-line cross-over differences. <b>Traverse</b> <b>lines</b> that intersect three tie-lines were adjusted by a cubic spline function through the three tie-line cross-over differences plus two artificial end points equal to the most adjacent cross-over data, that were added to stabilise the fit. A fifth step is taking into account <b>traverse</b> <b>line</b> crossover differences from <b>traverse</b> <b>line</b> intersections or repeatedly flown <b>traverse</b> <b>lines,</b> that otherwise pose a problem for gridding, but also give an opportunity to make additional adjustments in the line levelling. This is especially an advantage for the <b>traverse</b> <b>lines</b> that only cross two tie-lines (adjusted by a DC shift in step four). One <b>traverse</b> <b>line</b> after the other was adjusted by a cubic spline similar as in step four, but this time the cubic spline was fitted to both tie-line cross-over differences as well <b>traverse</b> <b>line</b> cross-over differences.|$|R

5000|$|The {{butterfly}} loop, {{also known}} as lineman's loop, butterfly knot, alpine butterfly knot and lineman's rider, is a knot used to form a fixed loop {{in the middle of}} a rope. Tied in the bight, it can be made in a rope without access to either of the ends; this is a distinct advantage when working with long climbing ropes. The butterfly loop is an excellent mid-line rigging knot; it handles multi-directional loading well and has a symmetrical shape that makes it easy to inspect. [...] In a climbing context it is also useful for <b>traverse</b> <b>lines,</b> some anchors, shortening rope slings, and for isolating damaged sections of rope.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss several methods of {{significance}} calculation and point out {{the limits of their}} applicability. We then introduce a self consistent scheme for source detection and discuss some of its properties. The method allows incorporating background anisotropies by vetoing existing small scale regions on the sky and compensating for known large scale anisotropies. By giving an example using Milagro gamma ray observatory we demonstrate how the method can be employed to relax the detector stability assumption. Two practical implementations of the method are discussed. The method is universal and can be used with any large field-of-view detector, where the object of investigation, steady or transient, point or <b>extended,</b> <b>traverses</b> its field of view.
