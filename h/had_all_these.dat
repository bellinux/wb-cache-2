5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: [...] "I wanted to write something heavier than we'd ever done, still I <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't {{want to go to}} waste." [...] Jonas Renkse of Katatonia, a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.|$|E

[...] The director blamed piracy for the film's financial failure and felt that [...] "It's a film that, to some extent, needs the support of people who write about films.

500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, if I could just sit on the bench, that's all I care about.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} preceded by [...] "No Reflection", which was leaked by Manson to KROQ-FM on March 7, 2012. Cooking Vinyl CEO Martin Goldschmidt called the leak a [...] "masterstroke", saying [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> exclusives lined up around the world, and then Manson blew them all. [...] We're already getting more radio play than {{the whole of the}} last record." [...] The song spent {{fourteen}} weeks on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart, peaking at number twenty-six, making it the band's best-performing single there since [...] "Personal Jesus" [...] in 2004. Its music video, which was directed by Lukas Ettlin and starred Roxane Mesquida of Rubber, premiered on April 4 on VEVO. On Record Store Day, a limited edition 7" [...] white vinyl for the song was released exclusively in Europe.|$|E

500|$|The oldest {{composition}} on Astral Weeks is [...] "Ballerina", which Morrison {{composed in}} 1966 while still {{a member of}} Them. About {{the same time he}} first met his future wife, Janet. Inspired by [...] "a flash about an actress in an opera house appearing in a ballet" [...] (according to Morrison), former Them guitarist Jim Armstrong recalls the band working on the song between engagements. [...] " [...] <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> words", [...] Armstrong says, [...] "we sort of formalized it, 'cause there was no structure to it". [...] Them performed the song one night in Hawaii, but it was not recorded until Astral Weeks. On the full-length version of [...] "Ballerina" [...] which first appeared on the 2015 expanded edition, the left and right audio channels are opposite to those on the originally released edited version.|$|E
500|$|In December 2005, Radiohead asked {{producer}} Spike Stent, who {{had worked}} with artists including U2 and Björk, to help them work through their material. O'Brien told Mojo: [...] "Spike listened to the stuff we'd been self-producing. These weren't demos, they’d been recorded in proper studios, and he said, 'The sounds aren't good enough.'" [...] The collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful and ended in April 2006. In an effort to break the deadlock, Radiohead decided to tour {{for the first time since}} 2004; according to Yorke, [...] "We basically <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> half-formed songs, and we just had to get it together. And rather than it being a nightmare, it was really, really good fun, because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one's self-conscious because you're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again." [...] In May and June 2006, Radiohead toured major cities in Europe and North America and returned to Europe for several festivals in August, performing many new songs.|$|E
500|$|Kaling {{cast her}} own mother and father, a doctor and an {{architect}} respectively, as the parents of her character. Kaling was proud of their acting, though she admitted that their presence on set was at first [...] "mortifying." [...] She commented, [...] "Of course I sort of lapsed back into that pre-teen attitude of every single thing my parents do embarrasses me. But they were great about it. They were such pros – they <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> scenes with Steve Carell and they were completely unafraid. They got along effortlessly." [...] Kaling injected elements of Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice into her character's relationship with Ryan, with her parents attempting to persuade her to date an Indian doctor. She remarked, [...] "Kelly's family has, like, nine daughters, and if only they could marry them off it would be wonderful. But Kelly is {{the oldest and most}} idiotic of them all." ...|$|E

500|$|Since I Left You was {{originally}} developed to be a concept album. Chater described its initial theme as a love story, [...] "an international search for love {{from country to}} country. The idea of a guy following a girl {{around the world and}} always being one port behind. And that was just because we <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> records from all over the world, and we'd like to use all that stuff." [...] The concept album idea was abandoned when the group felt they should not make their themes too obvious. The album's sound was in response to dance music at that time, that Chater felt was [...] "about big drums, big production: think of a record like the Chemical Brothers [...] "Block Rockin' Beats", with those amazing drums, and how huge those records sounded". The Avalanches felt their early music could not compare to that sound and desired a recording with less bass that was influenced by 1960s music such as the Beach Boys and Phil Spector.|$|E
500|$|The FBI {{was quickly}} able to {{identify}} the hijackers, including leader Mohamed Atta, when his luggage was discovered at Boston's Logan Airport. Atta had been forced to check two of his three bags due to space limitations on the 19-seat commuter flight he took to Boston. Due to a new policy instituted to prevent flight delays, the luggage failed to make it aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as planned. The luggage contained the hijackers' names, assignments and al-Qaeda connections. [...] "It <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> Arab-language (sic) papers that amounted to the Rosetta stone of the investigation", said one FBI agent. Within hours of the attacks, the FBI released the names and in many cases the personal details of the suspected pilots and hijackers. On September 27, 2001, they released photos of all 19 hijackers, along with information about possible nationalities and aliases. Fifteen of the men were from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Egypt, and one from Lebanon.|$|E

In casting the role of Nucky Thompson (based upon real-life Atlantic City political boss Enoch L. Johnson), Winter wanted to stray from the real life Johnson as much as possible. [...] "If {{we were going to}} cast accurately what the real Nucky looked like, we'd have cast Jim Gandolfini." [...] The idea of casting Steve Buscemi in the lead role came about when Scorsese mentioned wanting to work with the actor, whom Winter knew well having worked with him on The Sopranos. Winter sent the script out to Buscemi, who responded very enthusiastically. [...] "I just thought, 'Wow. I'm almost sorry I've read this, because if I don't get it, I'm going to be so sad.' My response was 'Terry, I know you're looking at other actors'... and he said, 'No, no, Steve, I said we want you.

500|$|Songs on {{the album}} were {{produced}} by Brion, except [...] "In My Arms" [...] was produced and mixed by Marchand, and [...] "Millbrook" [...] and [...] "Baby" [...] were produced by Brion and Van Dyke Parks. Waronker served as the executive producer. Rufus Wainwright was recorded mostly in Los Angeles studiosOcean Way Three & Seven, Sunset Sound Factory, Sunset Sound, Media Vortex, Hook Studios, Groove Masters, Red Zone, Sony, The Palindrome Recorder, and NRG Recording Servicesalthough recording also took place in Marchand's Wild Sky in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Parks conducted his orchestrations at Studio B in the Capitol Studios complex. Wainwright and Brion did not always get along, the latter admitting to The New York Times: [...] "Rufus <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> beautiful songs but every time the vocals would kick in, he'd write some complicated keyboard part so you couldn't hear them. He wasn't interested in listening to ideas about simplifying arrangements." [...] The duo also contributed the songs [...] "Le Roi D'Ys" [...] and [...] "Banks of the Wabash" [...] (both [...] "contemporary" [...] cover versions) to the 1997 soundtrack to the film The Myth of Fingerprints. Brion later considered [...] "Le Roi D'Ys", recorded in around six hours, {{to be one of}} his favorite tracks by Wainwright.|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
