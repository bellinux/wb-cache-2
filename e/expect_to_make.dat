By tea, we had changed our minds because the score had only crept to only 185 and we could hardly <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 196 in two hours, even with Ted Dexter still in and looking for runs. At the close Barry Knight and I were still there with 100 needed. Benaud had made it practically impossible for us to win, or for them.|$|E

Since {{they did not}} need a fifth starter for two weeks, four starters, eight relievers, two catchers, six infielders and five outfielders made up the roster. Two players who did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the team when they began spring training were left-handed reliever Mario Hollands (who {{said he was in}} [...] "shock" [...] when he heard the news) and outfielder Tony Gwynn, Jr., ending a [...] "long road back to the majors".|$|E

There is no backward compatibility with songs or controllers from previous editions of the franchise; FreeStyleGames' developer Jamie Jackson justified the decision, explaining that Guitar Hero Live was a [...] "completely new game" [...] that existing content would not work with due to the change in core gameplay. There is not any traditional downloadable content for {{the game in the}} form of additional songs, instead using the streaming nature of GHTV to provide new songs.

2500|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Catalyst, a nonprofit {{that works to}} expand {{opportunities}} for women in business, {{of male and female}} MBA graduates found that after controlling for career aspirations, parental status, years of experience, industry, and other variables, male graduates {{are more likely to be}} assigned jobs of higher rank and responsibility and earn, on average, $4,600 more than women in their first post-MBA jobs.This affects women’s ability to pay off student loan debt since college isn’t cheaper for a woman even though she can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> less after she earns a degree than her male peers. This results in women being in disproportionately more debt than men. This extra debt makes having less income even more debilitating as women have a harder time paying off student loan debt.|$|E

2500|$|The finals of Ultra Street Fighter IV, held on Sunday, {{featured}} GamerBee and Eduardo [...] "PR Balrog" [...] Perez, despite {{both players}} already having announced their retirement and didn't <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Top 8. Yusuke Momochi entered the Street Fighter finals after having won the Capcom Cup the previous year, {{though he did}} not have much success throughout the start of 2015. Other players in the finals included younger players NuckleDu and Fuudo. A new player, AiAi, surprisingly cracked the Top 8, despite having not a single Capcom Pro Tour tournament win in the 2015 season on his name. Shacknews reported that Infiltration played strong matches against Momochi and Gamerbee, playing with characters nobody knew he had any experience with. Though he lost both matches, they were described as [...] "among the most suspenseful matches of the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amazon's initial {{business}} plan was unusual; {{it did not}} <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a profit for four to five years. This [...] "slow" [...] growth caused stockholders to complain {{that the company was}} not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long-term. When the dot-com bubble burst {{at the start of the}} 21st century and destroyed many e-companies in the process, Amazon survived and grew on past the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $5 million (i.e., 1¢ per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed. In 1999, Time magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year when it recognized the company's success in popularizing online shopping.|$|E
2500|$|The cost of {{the balloon}} and the {{arrangements}} under which it was funded also attracted criticism. The executive director of culture for the ACT Chief Minister’s directorate informed the media on 9 May that the balloon and its supporting website cost about $170,000. Documents released the next day showed that the total cost {{to the government of}} commissioning and operating The Skywhale over its lifespan will be $300,000, and the philanthropic Aranday Foundation will provide a further $50,000. Moreover, the balloon will remain the property of the Melbourne-based company Global Ballooning and only one flight was scheduled for Canberra at the time. In response, Jeremy Hanson stated that [...] "this $300,000 extravagance again shows out of touch the ACT Government is with Canberrans' priorities". Katy Gallagher has stated that the Government considered retaining ownership of the balloon during its development, but decided against this option as it would have also involved funding all of The Skywhales operating costs. Robyn Archer defended the project, arguing that the balloon's cost was relatively low, and represented [...] "a bargain for public art". Piccinini has also said that [...] "it's an aeronautical machine. People's lives depend on it. It has to function properly and that's what it costs, to make a balloon". While Global Ballooning owns The Skywhale, Piccinini retains the intellectual property to the balloon and the company does not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> much money from displaying and operating it. The director of Global Ballooning believes that The Skywhale will become self funding when international galleries begin to exhibit it.|$|E

2500|$|June 22, 2012 – One {{day before}} first pitch {{between the two}} teams at Citi Field, Mets closer Frank Francisco taunted the Yankees by calling them chicken. Francisco's {{teammates}} greeted him in the Mets club house {{the next day with}} the Chicken Dance and put up a pitcture of Derek Jeter's head on the body of a chicken. [...] "I can't wait to strike out those chickens, I want to strike out the side against them. I've done it before." [...] Francisco would later go on to say [...] "I make a simple comment, just that they complain a lotfor every call, for everything, I thought it was funny. I didn't <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a big deal." [...] Although he would not strike out the side and allow two base runners, Francisco did notch the save in {{the first game of the}} series before going on the disabled list. Mets reliever Tim Byrdak would go as far to bring a live chicken into the clubhouse and named it [...] "Little Jerry Seinfeld" [...] in honor of a Seinfeld episode. The chicken was used as an unofficial mascot and was donated to an animal farm sanctuary in upstate New York a few days later. Francisco later admitted he himself raised chickens and is an expert about them. Despite the Mets winning the opener, the Yankees wound up winning the next two games, including halting Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey's scoreless inning streak of [...] innings to win the series. Yankee outfielder Nick Swisher playfully quipped at the end of the series [...] "who's chicken now?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day's {{newspapers}} {{were full of}} the story of Reichelt's [...] "tragic experiment" [...] (...) complete with photographs; at least four newspapers, Le Petit Parisien, L'Humanité, Le Matin and La Croix, showed images of the fatal jump. Film of the attempt, including footage of Reichelt's body being removed and the onlookers measuring the depth of the hole created by his impact (15 centimetres; 5.9 in), was distributed by news organizations. Initial reports speculated on Reichelt's state of mind: none assumed he had been suicidal, but many called him reckless or foolish. A journalist in Le Gaulois suggested that only half the term [...] "mad genius" [...] applied to Reichelt – although the same report included an interview with one of Reichelt's friends, who claimed that the tailor had felt pressured into giving a dramatic demonstration to attract sponsors, without whom he could not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a profit before any patent expired. Reichelt's death was the first to result from a parachuting accident since Charles Leroux died giving a demonstration in Tallinn in 1889. In fact, on 2 February 1912 – two days prior to Reichelt's fatal jump – an American steeplejack, Frederick R. Law, had successfully parachuted from the viewing platform of the torch of the Statue of Liberty ( [...] above sea level and [...] {{from the base of the}} statue), seemingly on a whim. On 6 February, La Croix added a footnote to the report on Reichelt's death: another parachuting experiment was to take place on 18 or 25 February at Juvisy-sur-Orge, in which the aviator Camille Guillaume planned to leap from his Blériot monoplane at a height of [...] to test a parachute design (the plane would be allowed to crash).|$|E
