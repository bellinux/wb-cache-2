Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of the {{key issues}} {{limiting}} the commercialization of power SiC rectifiers and switches is the poor yield due {{to the absence of}} an effective and reliable edge termination. Efficient edge termination allows for a thinner and heavier doped voltage blocking layer, which directly reduces conduction losses. The focus of this work was to optimize the efficiency and reproducibility of the edge termination technique. For that purpose, 4 H-SiC PiN diodes were fabricated with Junction Termination Extension (JTE) created by B+ and Al+ implantation. The JTE-terminated 4 H-SiC PiN diodes fabricated in this work exhibited stable reverse bias operation with avalanche breakdown occurring at 1. 8 kV. This voltage corresponds to the maximum one-dimensional electric field of 2. 67 MV/cm in the blocking layer under the pn junction. <b>Forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> of 5 V and 8 V were associated with current densities of 1. 2 kA/cm 2 and 6. 5 kA/cm 2 respectively.

This allows the diode {{to operate at}} signal frequencies, {{at the expense of}} a higher <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> Gold-doped diodes are faster than other p–n diodes (but not as fast as Schottky diodes). They also have less reverse-current leakage than Schottky diodes (but not as good as other p–n diodes). A typical example is the 1N914.|$|E
25|$|The {{on-state}} <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> in IGBTs behaves {{very differently}} from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically {{of the order}} of 2V) increasing only with the log of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.|$|E
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{requirements}} for choosing a proper power electronic device for a converter is that it must possess a low specific on-resistance. The specific on-resistance of a bipolar device {{is related to the}} base width and doping concentration of the lightly doped drift region. This means that the doping concentration and the width of the lowdoped base region in a bipolar device must be carefully considered to achieve a desired avalanche breakdown voltage and on-resistance. In order to determine the technological parameters of a semiconductor device, a one dimensional analysis is used to calculate the minimum depletion layer width, Wmin, for a given breakdown voltage, VBD, in Si, SiC and GaN p + n- n + structures.
