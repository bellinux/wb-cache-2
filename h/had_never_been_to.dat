5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, {{pointing out that}} Champollion <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than the church-sanctioned chronology according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E
5|$|Sticky & Sweet Tour was {{the eighth}} concert tour by American singer Madonna to promote her {{eleventh}} studio album, Hard Candy. It began in August 2008 and was Madonna's first tour {{from her new}} recording and business deal with Live Nation. The tour was announced in February 2008, with dates for European and North American venues revealed. Though initially planned, the tour did not visit Australia due to financial problems and the financial recession. Costume designer Arianne Phillips designed the costumes, supported {{by a number of}} famous designers and brands. The stage for the main show was planned similarly to that of her previous 2006 Confessions Tour. After the tour concluded in 2008, Madonna announced plans of playing a second European leg in 2009 to play in territories she either <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> or had not played for a long time.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the production schedule was drawn up without a final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated too much time for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Sydney {{would not be able}} to tell the difference.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{the rank}} of brigadier, after the German {{surrender}} in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to Algiers where {{he was part of the}} staff committee planning the invasion of Italy. There, he learned that the India Office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> the country, he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first. As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the British 10th Corps. As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in Naples and then Capri, where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.|$|E
5|$|The Femme Fatale Tour was {{the eighth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It {{was launched in}} support of her seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011). It was officially announced in March 2011, with dates for North American venues revealed. The tour was initially planned as a co-headlining tour with Enrique Iglesias, but he canceled only hours after the announcement. The show is inspired by {{the concept of the}} femme fatale and femmes fatales throughout the ages. The setlist was mostly composed of songs from Femme Fatale, although Spears also performed hits from her previous albums for her fans. Fashion designer Zaldy Goco created the costumes. In July 2011, Spears announced plans of playing a South American leg in territories she either <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> or had not played for a long time. Spears has named the Femme Fatale Tour the best show of her career.|$|E

The show was to be written and executive produced by Jeff Eastin. Eastin, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> New York, wrote the 90-minute pilot script using Google Street View. A cast-contingent pilot order was announced on May 21, 2008, alongside an order for Royal Pains.|$|E

500|$|Corridor X locally {{corresponds}} to the M-1 motorway (E75), which is the longest Macedonian highway. It also {{corresponds to}} the Tabanovce-Gevgelija railway. Corridor VIII, less developed, {{corresponds to the}} M-4 motorway and the Kičevo-Beljakovce railway. Skopje is not quite on the Corridor X and the M-1 does not pass on the city territory. Thus the junction between the M-1 and M-4 is located some [...] east, close to the airport. Although Skopje <b>is</b> geographically close <b>to</b> other major cities, movement of people and goods is not optimised, especially with Albania. This <b>is</b> mainly due <b>to</b> poor infrastructure. As a result, 61.8% of Skopjans <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Tirana, while only 6.7% <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Thessaloniki and 0% to Sofia. Furthermore, 26% of Thessalonians, 33% of Sofians and 37% of Tiranans <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Skopje.|$|R

25|$|Drop-out {{rates were}} once very high among Negev Bedouin. In 1998 only 43 percent of Bedouin youngsters reached the 12th grade. Enforcement of {{mandatory}} {{education for the}} Bedouin was weak, {{particularly in the case}} of young girls. According to a 2001 study by the Centre for Women’s Health Studies and Promotion more than 75% of Bedouin women <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> or completed elementary school. This was due to a combination of internal Bedouin traditional attitudes towards women, lack of government enforcement of the Mandatory Education Law and insufficient budgets for Bedouin schools.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a vast {{majority}} of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> a church of any kind. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006. The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual, in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 George Bentham {{published}} {{the first volume}} of a seven volume series called Flora Australiensis which included descriptions for 8,125 taxa. This was the first detailed account of Australian flora which included many Western Australian species as the work covered the relationship between many of the larger plant families which occurred across the continent. As Bentham <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Australia, he based all his work on the material already collected, assisted by Ferdinand von Mueller Victoria's colonial botanist. Mueller made two visits to WA in 1867 and 1871 to collect material and 1,122 of the Western Australian species described by Mueller are still in use. In 1882, and revised in 1889, Mueller produced a census of WA flora listing 3,560 individual species.|$|E

25|$|In the summer: Hōkūlea and Hawai‘iloa sailed the West Coast of the United States. Both vessels {{were shipped}} from Hawaii to Seattle, Washington, {{after which they}} sailed to Vancouver, British Columbia. They visited {{intermediate}} ports, where local American Indian tribes often hosted them to a dinner and gift exchange. From Vancouver, Hawai‘iloa sailed {{as far north as}} Haines, Alaska. Hōkūlea sailed south to San Diego via Portland, Oregon, and the California ports of San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Long Beach. The voyaging canoes were shipped back to Hawaii: Hōkūlea from San Pedro; Hawai‘iloa from Seattle. This summer part of the voyage promoted cultural and educational exchanges with Hawaiians (some of whom <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii), Native Americans, and other people living on the United States West Coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of the film was unprecedented and cinemas played the film for longer runs than usual, often to packed houses, while some arranged additional screenings to meet demand. The film {{is thought to have}} achieved attendance figures of twenty million in its first six weeks of release. The film also attracted more middle-class audiences, some of whom <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> a cinema before. William Jury, as the film's booking director, initially charged exhibitors £40, with the fee decreasing by £5 a week; after two months, a reduced fee of £6 for three nights put the film within the price range of village halls wishing to show the film. By October 1916, the film had been booked by more than two thousand cinemas in Britain, earning over £30,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} officially named St Kilda in 1841. The first sale of Crown lands in St Kilda {{took place on}} 7 December 1842. The first block was bought by James Ross Lawrence, who had been master of the Lady of St Kilda until 1842. Lawrence had now settled in Melbourne. His block was bounded by three unmade roads. One of these roads he named Acland Street after Thomas Acland, who had been his {{employer}} until 1840 but who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Port Phillip District. The remaining two became Fitzroy Street and The Esplanade. (A plaque at the junction of Acland and Fitzroy Streets marks {{the site of the}} block.) By 1845, Lawrence had subdivided and sold the land on which he had built a cottage. The land on the sea-side of The Esplanade has continued to be Crown land.|$|E

25|$|Norman-Walker {{served in}} the Seychelles for {{less than two years}} when he arrived at Hong Kong on 29 March 1969 to serve as Colonial Secretary, taking over from Sir Michael Gass who was in turn {{appointed}} High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. The career background of Norman-Walker was a concern in Hong Kong when his appointment was first announced. Norman-Walker had never {{served in the}} Far East. He had visited Hong Kong once, briefly landing on the Kowloon side, but <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Hong Kong Island. Local people and even some senior officials in the government were concerned that his limited experience on the Far East might hinder his work as Colonial Secretary. Elsie Tu, an Urban Councillor, even commented that the post of Colonial Secretary should be held by a local Chinese. Yet, there were also comments that selecting Norman-Walker in lieu of a senior official from within the government of Hong Kong showed a lack of suitable local candidates {{from the point of view}} of the British government. In respond to these opinions, Norman-Walker said that he had served in Africa for many years and was well experienced in public administration. He said he was ready for the challenge and would build friendship with the Chinese people of Hong Kong.|$|E
