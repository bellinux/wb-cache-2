5|$|Chicago White Sox manager Al López {{watched the}} game {{along with his}} {{pitching}} coach to scout their potential NL opponents for the World Series. The start of Game 1 was delayed 45 minutes due to rain, leaving only 18,297 fans in the stadium once the game was underway. The Dodgers opened the game quickly as Charlie Neal singled with one out, advanced to second base on a ground out, and scored on a single by Norm Larker to give the Dodgers an early 1–0 lead. Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning,</b> but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a line out to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to bring home Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl Willey, the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on a ground out by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E
5|$|In , the Dodgers {{moved from}} the Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left field line, to pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. The new park had a large foul {{territory}} and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate beneficiary of the change, lowering his home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75. On June 30 against the expansion New York Mets, Koufax threw his first no-hitter. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning</b> of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. With the no-hitter, a 4-2 record, 73 strikeouts, and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award.

5|$|No {{player has}} ever hit a cycle {{in both the}} Central and Pacific Leagues; however, after Alex Ochoa hit his cycle with the Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, he became the only player to hit a cycle in both MLB and NPB. Ochoa hit his first and only cycle in the MLB eight years prior on July 3, 1996, while playing for the New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, hitting one in game2 of the 1992 series. Furuta's cycle is not {{considered}} an official NPB cycle as it occurred during an exhibition game. Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning</b> and hitting a {{home run in the}} fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have hit a grand slam as the home run of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{replaced}} Melky Cabrera {{on their}} postseason roster with Ramiro Peña {{due to his}} injury in Game4, while Brett Gardner took Cabrera's place in center field. A. J. Burnett, the Yankees' Game2 starter, started Game5 on three days rest, one less than the Phillies' Cliff Lee. The Yankees scored first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning,</b> with Johnny Damon reaching base with a single and then scoring on a two-out double by Alex Rodriguez. The Phillies responded {{in the bottom of}} the inning with a single by Jimmy Rollins, Shane Victorino reaching after being hit by a pitch, and finally a three-run home run by Chase Utley to take the lead. The Phillies added to their lead in the third inning with Utley and Ryan Howard drawing walks followed by RBI singles by Jayson Werth and Raúl Ibañez. With no outs in the inning, Burnett was relieved by David Robertson, who allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz ground out.|$|E
5|$|The two {{previous}} years' American League Cy Young Award winners started the game: CC Sabathia, for the Yankees; and Lee, for the Phillies. Sabathia, {{who had been}} 3–0 in the postseason to date, pitched seven innings and allowed two earned runs on four hits; Lee, however, pitched a complete game and allowed no earned runs to go the distance {{for the second time}} during the 2009 postseason. The Phillies offense was paced by Utley, who walked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning</b> to set a record of 26 consecutive postseason games reaching base, and hit solo home runs in the third and sixth innings. Philadelphia led 2–0 until the eighth inning, when an Ibáñez single scored Rollins and Victorino, and added two more runs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning on a Victorino single and a Howard double. The Phillies allowed an unearned run in the bottom of the ninth when Rollins committed a throwing error, tossing the ball past Howard at first base and into the Yankee dugout.|$|E

Eight years earlier, Ochoa had {{accomplished}} the same feat on July 3, 1996, while playing for MLB's New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, doing so in game 2 of the 1992 series. Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning</b> and hitting a {{home run in the}} fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around.

5|$|Zobrist {{scored the}} Royals' first run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning</b> on a force play. In {{the bottom of}} the first inning, Wright hit a two-run home run that also scored Granderson. For the Royals, Alex Ríos drove Salvador Pérez home in the second inning, and scored on a passed ball by d'Arnaud, giving the Royals a 3–2 lead. After a Syndergaard single, Granderson hit a two-run home run just over the right field wall in the third inning, and the Mets took a 4–3 lead. The Mets added a run in the fourth inning on an RBI single by Conforto, and four more in the sixth inning, {{including}} an RBI single by Juan Uribe, in his first at bat since September 20. The Royals made a few uncharacteristic mistakes in this game, the first coming in the fourth inning when pitcher Yordano Ventura forgot to cover the base on a ground ball to the first baseman, and the second in the sixth inning when Royals pitcher Franklin Morales triple-clutched Granderson's ground ball, allowing all runners to be safe, which led to a 2-run single by Wright.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>inning.</b> The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E
