40|$|The {{way how to}} <b>express</b> {{the dating}} <b>invitation</b> has {{been a kind of}} {{essential}} expression in a couple relationship, in this case, in different gender. It is because the dating invitation expression itself may be the initial step to build a further relationship between males and females. Unfortunately, my friends and I sometimes have difficulties in <b>expressing</b> dating <b>invitation</b> in order to show that we attract to someone in different gender. Thus, I am interested in studying more about what the elements that underlie the dating invitation made by males and females and the difference between them. In this study, I analyze the language functions, the types of sentences, and the topic as the theories which are often used by males and females based on their gender differences. After that, I analyze the similar and different ways of making dating invitation between males and females. The data are collected from males? and females? utterances based on the observation. Then, to back up the findings, I also interview several respondents. In conducting this research, I use the qualitative approach to study the dating invitation. In analyzing the data, I present the data into tables and compare them in order to find the similarities and/or differences of the invitation made by males and females. I find out that, in general, males tend to be direct in inviting females for a date by using interrogative. They use social language function. Therefore, their sentences are simple. Meanwhile, females tend to use complex sentence. It is affected by the their conventional style of language, that is more polite and indirect. They use descriptive language function which gives fact that relates to their invitation. In inviting, most of them talk about free time and entertainment...|$|R

Bernard Frank, a fellow forester, joined them later in the year; the men mailed an [...] "Invitation to Help Organize a Group to Preserve the American Wilderness" [...] to like-minded individuals.

As soon as that matter was {{temporarily}} arranged to the mutual satisfaction of all the parties concerned, Ronald walked over alone to Ernest's little lodgings at Holloway. He would sleep there that night, and send round a letter to Amelia, the housemaid, in the morning, asking her to pack up his things and forward them at once to Mrs. Halliss's.

6000|$|The {{proposal}} {{was made to}} old David by the gentleman so commissioned, {{on the second day}} after his daughter's pardon had reached Edinburgh. His resolution to leave St. Leonard's had been already formed; the honour of an <b>express</b> <b>invitation</b> from the Duke of Argyle to superintend a department where so much skill and diligence was required, was in itself extremely flattering; and the more so, because honest David, who was not without an exeellent opinion of his own talents, persuaded himself that, by accepting this charge, he would in some sort repay the great favour he had received {{at the hands of the}} Argyle family. The appointments, including the right of sufficient grazing for a small stock of his own, were amply liberal; and David's keen eye saw that the situation was convenient for trafficking to advantage in Highland cattle. There was risk of [...] "her'ship"* from the neighbouring mountains, indeed, but the awful name of the Duke of Argyle would be a great security, and a trifle of black-mail would, David was aware, assure his safety.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tennyson has {{a little}} son, and wrote me such three happy notes on the {{occasion}} that I really never liked him so well before. I do like men who are not ashamed to be happy beside a cradle. Monckton Milnes had a brilliant christening luncheon, and his baby was made to sweep in India muslin and Brussels lace among a very large circle of admiring guests. Think of my vanity turning my head completely and admitting of my taking Wiedeman there (because of an <b>express</b> <b>invitation).</b> He behaved like an angel, everybody said, and looked very pretty, I said myself; only he disgraced us all at last by refusing to kiss the baby, on the ground of his being 'troppo grande.' He has learnt quantities of English words, and is in consequence more unintelligible than ever. Poor darling! I am in pain about him to-day. Wilson goes to spend a fortnight with her mother, and I don't know how I shall be comforter enough.

6000|$|One catches one's breath a little, frankly, at {{what was}} to follow the above within a few days--implying as it does that she had drawn upon herself some fairly direct {{statement}} of her correspondent's reserves of view as to her human or [...] "intellectual" [...] composition. To have had such reserves at such an hour, and to {{have responded to the}} <b>invitation</b> to <b>express</b> them--for <b>invitation</b> there had been--is something that our actual larger light quite helps us to flatter ourselves we shouldn't have been capable of. But what was of the essence between these admirable persons was exactly the tone of truth; the larger light was all to wait for, and the real bearings of the hour were as unapparent as the interlocutors themselves were at home in clearness, so far as they might bring that ideal about. And whatever turn their conversation took is to the honour always of the generous girl's passion for truth. As this long letter admirably illustrates that, I withdraw from it almost nothing. The record of the rare commerce would be incomplete without it; all the more perhaps for the wonder and pain of our seeing the noble and pathetic young creature have, of all things, in her predicament, to plead for extenuations, to excuse and justify herself.|$|R
30|$|Instead, {{the concept}} of co-existence is offered (McGregor 2004 b), which {{suggests}} the importance of balancing indigenous and non-indigenous aspirations of governance into the evaluation of collaboration. In this case, one might be inclined to think cynically that {{it is all about}} labels. But there is much more going on than preferences about labels. We need to consider the role played by concepts like co-management and co-existence in facilitating or discouraging collaboration. People who reject {{the concept of}} co-management based on the contexts they are familiar with see in it problematic assumptions about how indigenous and non-indigenous institutions should work together. Non-indigenous people may not see how the concept of co-management might encourage these assumptions, even though, perhaps, co-management is the preferred concept in some contexts. Those who reject the concept of co-management and wish to replace it with the concept of co-existence are inviting non-indigenous people to learn more about cross-cultural and cross-situational divides. This is the role that concepts like co-management and co-existence play. The concept of co-existence does not in itself contain enough meaning for non-indigenous persons to suggest in advance exactly how a collaborative process should play out. What proponents of co-existence are saying is that there is much learning to do. The concept of co-existence suggests a very different possibility for collaboration than what non-indigenous peoples may be used to. Work on co-existence <b>expresses</b> an <b>invitation</b> to learn about cross-cultural and cross-situational divides so as to achieve better collaborations in particular contexts.|$|R
6000|$|YOU GO ON WEDNESDAY, THEN?--"Loss of {{time was}} one of the losses Friedrich could least stand.

'Well, I am sorry: but I will lay no {{constraint}} on you. Pleasant moments cannot last forever!' And sometimes, after this had been agreed to; he would say: 'But cannot you stay till Thursday, then? Come, one other day of it!'--'Well, since your Majesty does graciously press!' And on Thursday, not Wednesday, on those curious terms, the visit would terminate. This trait is in the Anecdote-Books: but its authenticity does not rest on that uncertain basis; singularly enough, it comes to me, individually, by two clear stages, from Friedrich's Sister the Duchess of Brunswick, who, if anybody, would know it well!"

60|$|The {{position}} of sections and interests {{which ended in}} the Revolution of Thermidor, {{is one of the}} most extraordinarily intricate and entangled in the history of faction. It would take a volume to follow out all the peripeteias of the drama. Here we can only enumerate in a few sentences the parties to the contest and the conditions of the game. The reader will easily discern the difficulty in Robespierre's way of making an effective combination. First, there were the two Committees. Of these the one, the General Security, was thoroughly hostile to Robespierre; its members, as we have said, were wild and hardy spirits, with no political conception, and with a great contempt for fine phrases and philosophical principles. They knew Robespierre's hatred for them, and they heartily returned it. They were the steadfast centre of the changing schemes which ended in his downfall. The Committee of Public Safety was divided. Carnot hated Saint Just, and Collot d'Herbois hated Robespierre, and Billaud had a sombre distrust of Robespierre's counsels. Shortly speaking, the object of the Billaudists was to retain their power, and their power was always menaced from two quarters, the Convention and Paris. If they let Robespierre have his own way against his enemies, would they not be at his mercy whenever he chose to devise a popular insurrection against them? Yet if they withstood Robespierre, they could only do so through the agency of the Convention, and to fall back upon the Convention would be to give that body an <b>express</b> <b>invitation</b> to resume the power that had, in the pressure of the crisis a year before, been delegated to the Committee, and periodically renewed afterwards. The dilemma of Billaud seemed desperate, and events afterwards proved that it was so.|$|E
