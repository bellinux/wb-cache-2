Students are also given the chance to experience the difficulty involved in cataloging and reorganising the Archives' items.|$|E

25|$|In {{a meeting}} with the British Ambassador Goschen, Bethmann Hollweg made the flagrantly false {{statement}} that Germany was trying to pressure Austria to abandon the war against Serbia. As Prince Henry of Prussia pretended that King George V had promised him that Britain would remain neutral, the Kaiser rejected Bethmann Hollweg's offer of a naval agreement with Britain, stating that Germany did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> Britain anything now that King George had apparently promised his country's neutrality.|$|E

Some clubs offer open mic slots, where newer acts are allowed to learn the craft, unpaid; this {{is not the same as}} pay-to-play. Many comedians are against pay-to-play schemes, which they consider exploitative.|$|E

25|$|Mate {{guarding}} tactics {{employed by}} males {{tend to be}} hiding the female from intrasexual threats; this could be not bringing the mate to social events in which other competing males may be present.

Males may also demonstrate the quality of resources they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> (e.g. buying the mate gifts, or paying for a meal).

25|$|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers {{long-term}} {{nursing and}} care. While Dutch residents are automatically insured {{by the government}} for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If you don't take out insurance, you risk a fine. Insurers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> a universal package for everyone {{over the age of}} 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.|$|E
25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E
25|$|In his poems, Solon portrays Athens {{as being}} under {{threat from the}} {{unrestrained}} greed and arrogance of its citizens. Even the earth (Gaia), the mighty mother of the gods, had been enslaved. The visible symbol of this perversion of the natural and social order was a boundary marker called a horos, a wooden or stone pillar indicating that a farmer was in debt or under contractual obligation to someone else, either a noble patron or a creditor. Up until Solon's time, land was the inalienable property of a family or clan and {{it could not be}} sold or mortgaged. This was no disadvantage to a clan with large landholdings since it could always rent out farms in a sharecropping system. A family struggling on a small farm however could not use the farm as security for a loan even if it owned the farm. Instead the farmer would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> himself and his family as security, providing some form of slave labour in lieu of repayment. Equally, a family might voluntarily pledge part of its farm income or labour to a powerful clan in return for its protection. Farmers subject to these sorts of arrangements were loosely known as hektemoroi indicating that they either paid or kept a sixth of a farm's annual yield. In the event of 'bankruptcy', or failure to honour the contract stipulated by the horoi, farmers and their families could in fact be sold into slavery.|$|E

500|$|Yancey was {{inspired}} to write What's So Amazing About Grace? after President Bill Clinton asked him, [...] "Why do Christians hate so much?" [...] Although Yancey initially intended to call the book What's So Amazing About Grace: and Why Don't Christians Show More of It?, Zondervan, its publisher, objected to this title despite the author's contention that he wrote the book to communicate the belief that grace {{is one of the}} best quality Christians, like himself, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> but are not necessarily identified with it. The book was successful at secular and Christian stores, selling more than 15million copies by 2006 and becoming Yancey's best-known book. In it, Yancey coined the phrase [...] "scandal of grace", referring to the idea that God forgives some of the worst people, citing the conversion of Paul the Apostle.|$|E

500|$|The War of the Spanish Succession {{was finally}} settled in 1713 {{by a series}} of {{treaties}} and agreements. Under the Treaty of Utrecht, which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the Southern Netherlands, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia to Austria; Sicily and some Milanese lands to Savoy; and Gibraltar and Menorca to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish slave trading in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called asiento. With regard to Gibraltar (...) , the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain [...] "for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever." [...] The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the territory to Spain.|$|E
