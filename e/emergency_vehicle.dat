5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With {{the surge of}} rescue personnel who converged on the area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. <b>Emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} {{traffic light}} systems {{are unable to}} detect the presence of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the road, especially in the emergency situation. The delay cause due to this situation can affect {{the life of the}} person in need of the <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> while delivering ther best service to the society. A wireless traffic light controller can resolve this problem. With a certain operating range (80 m- 1500 m) the receiver and transmitter can correspond to each other to enable green light on the path of the travelling <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles.</b> A simple approach using this method is done by using two wireless X-Bee modules, Basic Stamp Microcontroller and a Digital Compass. Upon using this system, the delay caused waiting for the green light can be reduced. This reduction in delay can increase the efficiency of the <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> and have a better potential to safe the life of person in need of the <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> service...|$|R
50|$|In lieu of {{preemptive}} mechanisms, in most jurisdictions, <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> are {{not required}} to respect traffic lights. However, <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> must slow down, proceed cautiously and activate their emergency lights to alert oncoming drivers to the preemption when crossing an intersection against the light.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For {{controlling}} urban transportations, {{traffic lights}} show similar behavior for {{different kinds of}} <b>vehicles</b> at intersections. <b>Emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> need special behavior at intersections, so traffic lights should behave in different manner when <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> approach them. At the present time, intelligent traffic lights control urban transportations intelligently. In this paper the ethical aspect of this topic is considered. A model is proposed for adding special component to <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> and traffic lights for controlling traffic in ethical manner. The proposed model is simulated by JADE...|$|R
25|$|Amber : For any <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle,</b> amber lights can be {{used with}} or without blue, to warn other drivers the <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> is stopped or slow. Non-emergency {{vehicles}} allowed to use amber include agricultural, construction, utility, oversized, tow and airport vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Red {{almost always}} denotes an <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> if {{the lights are}} facing forward.|$|E
25|$|While certain {{colors are}} customarily used by {{different}} services, often other colors are optionally used, such as amber and white. Sometimes, {{this is done}} to satisfy particular regulations; for example, California requires a steady red light facing forward and a flashing amber light to the rear on every <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>Vehicles</b> if {{delayed for}} a couple of seconds can cause a major loss for some. In this paper, a {{technique}} is proposed for movement of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Vehicles</b> that is Fire brigade and Ambulances in least time. The objective is to direct Fire brigades and Ambulances from source to Destination point in most efficient and effective time. Movement of these vehicles should be safe and vehicles should follow shortest path. The proposed method can help in selecting <b>Emergency</b> <b>Vehicles</b> from n-number of available <b>Emergency</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> Directing the shortest safest and least crowded path for the vehicles so that it can reach the accident point in least time. To make the movement of vehicles efficient, all traffic control signals should guide traffic to move in favour of clearing the emergency vehicle‟s route. Check condition are made for assigning priority to <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> and higher priority <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> are facilitated first at a particular traffic control signal, if more than one vehicles waiting on a traffic square. The proposed technique avoids problems that usually arise with standard traffic control system. The Large number of vehicles on traffic square requires routing needs assignment of priority number, judgement and decision. Avoiding bottleneck at a traffic control signal, tracking based techniques will help for routing higher priority vehicles first...|$|R

25|$|Usage of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{lighting}} is restricted in the United Kingdom through the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989. It is illegal for any vehicle {{to show a}} flashing colored light (with {{the exception of the}} normal direction indicators or a green anti-lock brake warning indicator), unless it is an emergency or other authorized vehicle. However recently pedal cycles can exhibit a flashing rear red lamp and flashing white front lamp.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the blue}} {{emergency}} light originates in Germany during World War II. As {{a result of the}} ‘Verdunkelung’, a measure for aerial defense from 1935, cobalt blue was regulated to replace the red color used until 1938 in <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> lights. Due to the scattering properties of the blue color, it is only visible to lower altitudes and is therefore less easily spotted by enemy airplanes.|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{services}} in Norway use mostly blue lighting. If a blue flashing light {{is seen in}} either traffic or the sea, other vehicles must yield to let that vehicle pass. Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue flashing light must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> operator and have a ‘code 160’ endorsement on their driver's license. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren {{may not be used}} alone. The operator of an <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> may disregard speed limits and traffic lights with caution. Amber lights, however, are not regulated, but are used for any vehicle that need special attention, such as tow-trucks, snow plows, and parking enforcement. Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Several Mustang SSPs were {{converted}} by the CHP to EVOC (<b>Emergency</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Operations Course) track vehicles. These EVOC vehicles {{were used for}} training the cadets how to drive at high speeds. The Mustangs were known for their 140+- mile per hour top speed. Modifications include a full roll cage, racing harnesses, and tuned front suspension(for high speed driving and cornering). The EVOC vehicles were highly maintained to ensure safety while on the track.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{lighting}} is generally used {{to clear the}} right of way for emergency vehicles, or to warn approaching motorists of potential hazards, such as a vehicle that is stopped or moving slower than the rate of traffic, or a car that has been pulled over. It may also be used to provide specific directions to motorists, such as a command to pull over. Some vehicles incorporate a small arrow board to direct traffic.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the other}} New England {{states do not}} have {{legislation}} regulating the color of lights on <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles.</b> They only generalize red and blue lights as being restricted to <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles.</b> However, most police, fire, and ambulance services in these other New England states voluntarily follow the same scheme as Massachusetts.|$|R

25|$|Speed {{cushions}} are a type {{of speed}} hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across {{the width of the}} road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.|$|E
