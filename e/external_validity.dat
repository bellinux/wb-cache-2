25|$|Critics of the BCS National Championship {{argued against}} the {{internal}} validity of a so-called national championship being {{awarded to the}} winner of a single postseason game. Critics lamented that the participants were selected based upon polls, computer rankings, popularity and human biases, and not by on-field competition, as in other major sports and all other levels of college football, which employed tournament-format championships. Often, the BCS system led to controversies in which multiple teams finished the season with identical records, and voters distinguished the worthiness of {{their participation in the}} BCS National Championship with no set of formal criteria or standards. The end of the 2010 season {{was one of the best}} examples of this. Without any objective criteria for evaluation of the teams, the BCS forced voters to impose their own standards and tiebreakers. Critics noted that the system inherently fostered selection bias, and therefore lacked both internal validity and <b>external</b> <b>validity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Because it {{is usually}} {{impossible}} to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a sample of persons from the wider population. Social psychologists frequently use survey research when {{they are interested in}} results that are high in <b>external</b> <b>validity.</b> Surveys use various forms of random sampling to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like structural equation modeling are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data. Some psychologists, including Dr. David Sears, have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.|$|E

If background factor X treatment interactions exist of which the researcher is unaware (as seems likely), these research practices can mask a substantial lack of <b>external</b> <b>validity.</b> Dipboye and Flanagan (1979), writing about industrial and organizational psychology, note that the evidence is that findings from one field setting and from one lab setting are equally unlikely to generalize to a second field setting. Thus, field studies are not by their nature high in <b>external</b> <b>validity</b> and laboratory studies are not by their nature low in <b>external</b> <b>validity.</b> It depends in both cases whether the particular treatment effect studied would change with changes in background factors that are held constant in that study.

40|$|Abstract Background Clinical outcome {{measures}} are important tools to monitor patient improvement during treatment {{as well as}} to document changes for research purposes. The short-form Bournemouth questionnaire for neck pain patients (BQN) was developed from the biopsychosocial model and measures pain, disability, cognitive and affective domains. It {{has been shown to be}} a valid and reliable outcome measure in English, French and Dutch and more sensitive to change compared to other questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to translate and validate a German version of the Bournemouth questionnaire for neck pain patients. Methods German translation and back translation into English of the BQN was done independently by four persons and overseen by an expert committee. Face validity of the German BQN was tested on 30 neck pain patients in a single chiropractic practice. Test-retest reliability was evaluated on 31 medical students and chiropractors before and after a lecture. The German BQN was then assessed on 102 first time neck pain patients at two chiropractic practices for internal consistency, <b>external</b> construct <b>validity,</b> <b>external</b> longitudinal construct <b>validity</b> and sensitivity to change compared to the German versions of the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPAD). Results Face validity testing lead to minor changes to the German BQN. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for the test-retest reliability was 0. 99. The internal consistency was strong for all 7 items of the BQN with Cronbach α's of. 79 and. 80 for the pre and post-treatment total scores. <b>External</b> construct <b>validity</b> and <b>external</b> longitudinal construct <b>validity</b> using Pearson's correlation coefficient showed statistically significant correlations for all 7 scales of the BQN with the other questionnaires. The German BQN showed greater responsiveness compared to the other questionnaires for all scales. Conclusions The German BQN is a valid and reliable outcome measure that has been successfully translated and culturally adapted. It is shorter, easier to use, and more responsive to change than the NDI and NPAD. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the 14 -item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) in the UK veterinary profession by the application of Rasch analysis, and to assess the <b>external</b> construct <b>validity</b> of the derived interval scale measurements. METHODS: Data sets were derived from two independent cross-sectional surveys of the veterinary profession (n = 8, 829 and n = 1, 796). Rasch analysis (n = 500) included response option thresholds ordering, tests of fit, differential item functioning, targeting, response dependency, and person separation index (PSI). Unidimensionality was evaluated by principal component analysis of residuals. The findings were validated across further subsamples from both data sets. The <b>external</b> construct <b>validity</b> of the Rasch-fitting item set was evaluated by associations with other measures of psychological health or psychosocial work characteristics. RESULTS: Data for the original 14 items deviated significantly from Rasch model expectations (chi-square = 558. 2, df = 112, P = < 0. 001, PSI = 0. 918). A unidimensional 7 -item scale (Short WEMWBS, SWEMWBS) with acceptable fit to the model (chi-square = 58. 8, df = 56, P = 0. 104, PSI = 0. 832) was derived by sequential removal of the most misfitting items. The <b>external</b> construct <b>validity</b> of SWEMWBS was supported. CONCLUSIONS: SWEMWBS has robust interval-level measurement properties which support its suitability as an indicator of population mental health and well-being in this occupational group with elevated suicide risk. <br/...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Finding {{the best}} outcome {{measures}} {{for research and}} quality assurance purposes in terms of validity, sensitivity to change, length and ease of completion is crucial. The Bournemouth questionnaire for neck pain patients was recently translated and validated into German and {{found to be more}} sensitive to change than other commonly used questionnaires. However, the low back pain version is not yet available in German. Therefore {{the purpose of this study}} was to translate and validate the Bournemouth Questionnaire (BQ) for low back pain (LBP) into German. METHODS: The translation was done in 4 steps, translated and back-translated by two independent people and adapted and approved by an expert committee. Face validity was then done by 30 people who checked the questionnaire for comprehension. Test-retest reliability (reproducibility) was tested using 30 stable back pain patients. Internal consistency was tested using 108 low back patients. <b>External</b> construct <b>validity,</b> <b>external</b> longitudinal <b>validity</b> and responsiveness was tested against the German versions of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the SF- 36 questionnaire using 108 patients from 5 different chiropractic clinics. RESULTS: The BQ showed high test-retest reliability (ICC > 0. 91) for all items and strong internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha = 0. 86 at baseline and 0. 94 at 4 weeks). CONCLUSION: The BQ for LBP was successfully translated and adapted into German. It was successfully tested for validity, consistency, and responsiveness against the German versions of the ODI and the SF- 36.

The sample included 251 persons with PD (mean age 70 [SD 9] years). Data collection comprised a self-administered postal survey, structured interviews, and clinical assessments at home visits. Results. Data completeness was 99. 6 % and the mean PADLS score was 2. 1. Floor and ceiling effects were 22 % and 2 %, respectively. PADLS scores were more strongly associated (rs> 0. 5) with perceived functional independence, ADL dependency, walking difficulties, and self-rated PD severity than with variables such as PD duration and cognitive function (rs< 0. 5). PADLS scores differed across H&Y stages (Kruskal-Wallis test, p< 0. 001).
