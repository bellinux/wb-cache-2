40|$|Background:Mosquito {{control is}} {{becoming}} increasingly difficult because of the development ofvector resistance to conventional insecticides. Many {{efforts were made to}} search for insecticides of natural origin as safe alternative to synthetic insecticides. Pesticides derived from plants have the potential {{to play a major role}} in pest management and control of larvae of different species of mosquito. They are renewable, non- persistent in the environment and relatively safe to natural enemies. The lack of adequate drainage in many areas even the provision of drainageandwater stagnation is promoting the breeding of Culex quinquefasciatus. The study aimed to compare the susceptibility of larval stages of Culex quinquefasciatusto temphos,diazinon and Acacia nilotica <b>fruits</b> <b>water</b> extract. Methods:Susceptibility of Culex quinquefasciatuslarvae totemphos (Abate), diazinon and Acacia nilotica <b>fruits</b> <b>water</b> extracts, was carried out, following WHO standard susceptibility tests. The larvae of the 3 rd and 4 th stage of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito were collected from the breeding sites of polluted water with organic matter. e. g sewage water and rainy season swamps in JebalAwalia Locality. Larvae were exposed to a series of temphos, diazinon and Acacia nilotica <b>fruits</b> <b>water</b> extract concentrations. Data was subjected to probit analysis and values of LC 50 and LC 98 of experimental larvae were calculated. Results:The average percentage death for Culex quinquefasciatuslarvae in the four experiments in temphos ranged Please purchase PDFcamp Printer on [URL] to remove this watermark. IV between 16 % and 96 %. The LC 50 and LC 98 for temphos were 0. 087 ppb and 53. 1 ppb, respectively. The average percentage death for Culex quinquefasciatuslarvae in the four experiments in diazinon ranged between 11 %and 100 %. The LC 50 and LC 98 for diazinon were 0. 22 ppb and 10. 8 ppb, respectively. The average percentage death for Culex quinquefasciatuslarvae in the four experiments in Acacia nilotica <b>fruits</b> <b>water</b> extract ranged between 12 % and 85 %. The LC 50 and LC 98 for Acacia nilotica <b>fruits</b> <b>water</b> extract 8 ppband 3851. 7 ppb, respectively. The study revealed low susceptibility ofCulex quinquefasciatuslarvae toAcacia nilotica <b>fruits</b> <b>water</b> extract, high susceptibility to diazinon and higher susceptibility to temphos. Conclusion:The current results of Acacia nilotica <b>fruits</b> <b>water</b> extract were considered promising to proceed in studying thebioactive plants which represent an environmentally safe alternative to thesynthetic larvicides. Temphos was more toxic than diazinon on Culex quinquefasciatus larvae under laboratory condition. Finally the following recommendations were made: The extraction procedures of Acacia nilotica fruits need to be improved to separate active ingredients foremore deep testing. Monitoring susceptibility of mosquitoes to insecticides must be repeated more thanonce per year...|$|R

50|$|The kamidana is {{typically}} placed {{high on a}} wall and contains {{a wide variety of}} items related to Shinto-style ceremonies, the most prominent of which is the shintai, an object meant to house a chosen kami, thus giving it a physical form to allow worship. Kamidana shintai are most commonly small circular mirrors, though they can also be stones (magatama), jewels, or some other object with largely symbolic value. The kami within the shintai is often the deity of the local shrine or one particular to the house owner's profession. A part of the kami (bunrei) was obtained specifically for that purpose from a shrine through a process called kanjō. Worship at the kamidana typically consists of the offering of simple prayers, food (e.g., rice, <b>fruit,</b> <b>water)</b> and flowers.

50|$|A. citrulli causes {{disease in}} the Cucurbitaceae family, with the most {{significant}} losses in melon and watermelon. It also affects pumpkin, zucchini and cucumber {{but these are not}} as economically devastated by fruit blotch as the melons. A. citrulli’s economic hosts are cucurbits, but the bacteria can also infect volunteer seedlings of other families. This makes it easier for the pathogen to spread. Symptoms of melon with BFB include water soaked lesions on cotyledons, and hypocotyls, leading to collapse and death. Lesions will look necrotic and may be near veins. On <b>fruit,</b> <b>water</b> soaked lesions will be small and irregular (they average 1 cm diameter and may be sunken) but then progress through the rind. The fruit then decays and cracks when the pathogen causes necrosis. These lesions open the plant to secondary infections as well. A. citrulli then colonizes the pulp, eventually allowing the seed to become contaminated. On adult leaves, the symptoms appear the same as the ones left by other abiotic or biotic stressors so diagnosis is not as straight forward. They include large irregular leaf lesions which are brown to black in watermelon and reddish brown in melon. Bacterial fruit blotch lesions spread along main midrib in adult leaves.|$|E
40|$|Fruit {{placed into}} storage delayed longer than 48 hours after picking have a {{significant}} increase in ripe rots. This is thought to be due to the delayed fruit being at a more advanced physiological stage of ripening after storage. Our working hypothesis was that high rates of water loss before storage affected fruit quality. Imbibing fruit with water had the opposite effect of water loss slowing down ripening. As the amount of water imbibed could be considered as a measure of <b>fruit</b> <b>water</b> status experiments were conducted to investigate if the <b>fruit</b> <b>water</b> status or changes in <b>fruit</b> <b>water</b> status were affecting ripe fruit quality. <b>Fruit</b> <b>water</b> status was increased after rain or by irrigation but the effect on ripening times differed depending on how the <b>fruit</b> <b>water</b> status was changed or maintained. Irrigation would be expected to keep <b>fruit</b> <b>water</b> status at a higher level while rain causes large rapid changes in <b>fruit</b> <b>water</b> status.
