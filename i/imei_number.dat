5000|$|Individual GSM, WCDMA, iDEN {{and some}} {{satellite}} phone devices are uniquely identified by an International Mobile Equipment Identity (<b>IMEI)</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> {{is used by}} a GSM {{network to}} {{identify}} valid devices and therefore {{can be used for}} stopping a stolen phone from accessing that network. For example, if a mobile phone is stolen, the owner can call their network provider and instruct them to blacklist the phone using its <b>IMEI</b> <b>number.</b> This renders the phone useless on that network and sometimes other networks too, whether or not the phone's subscriber identity module (SIM) is changed.|$|E
50|$|Mobile Standards Alliance of India (MSAI) is the {{official}} Reporting Body of GSMA for providing Genuine <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers</b> to GSM Devices and mobile Handsets in India. MSAI also provides IMEI related assistance to regulatory bodies, network operators and security agencies.|$|R
5000|$|A company {{spokesperson}} {{stated that}} it had received 35 reports of battery failure, which [...] "account for less than 0.1 {{percent of the entire}} volume sold". Samsung stated that the hazard was limited to a small fraction of phones manufactured, and released a tool on its website on 19 September to identify affected units by their unique <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In any of {{the above}} cases, the first two digits of the TAC are the Reporting Body Identifier, which {{identifies}} the GSMA-approved group that allocated the TAC. The RBI numbers are allocated by the Global Decimal Administrator. <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers</b> being decimal allows them to be distinguished from an MEID, which is hexadecimal and always has 0xA0 or larger as its first two hexadecimal digits.|$|R

50|$|When {{entering}} a Venue Pro's <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> into an IMEI checking facility {{the manufacturer of}} the device is reported as Qisda Corporation, a subsidiary of BenQ. The involvement of a third party is also apparent in the 'EM' phone management app.|$|E
50|$|A Central Equipment Identity Register is a {{database}} of the IMEI numbers of blacklisted handsets. If a device's ESN or <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> is listed on a CEIR, it {{is not supposed to}} work on member service providers' networks; only paying members may access the database.|$|E
25|$|The assailants were {{suspected}} {{to belong}} to the Islamic terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The investigating team tracked the phone calls made from the cell phones carried by the terrorits using the <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers.</b> The Police recovered a single RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher, five Type 56 assault rifles, five M1911 pistols, several M67 grenades and some jihadi documents. Rehan Alam, the jeep driver, was detained by the police for further investigations.|$|R
50|$|All UK Police forces, {{including}} the Metropolitan Police Service actively check <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers</b> of phones found involved in crime, against the National Mobile Property Register (NMPR). The NMPR draws its information from many property databases. One of the databases consulted is Immobilise, which allows optional (and free) registration of devices by the public. Such registration ensures that a device coming into police possession may be easily reunited with its registered owner.|$|R

50|$|On June 6, 2013, the {{day after}} Snowden's revelations, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper {{released}} a statement admitting the NSA collects telephony metadata on millions of Americans telephone calls. This metadata information included originating and terminating telephone number, telephone calling card number, <b>IMEI</b> <b>number,</b> time and duration of phone calls.|$|E
50|$|It allocates {{official}} <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> ranges to all {{manufacturers of}} 3GPP compliant devices and records these ranges and device model {{information in a}} database. It offers a device look up and identification service based on this database that allows authorised third-party organisations to identify the manufacturer and model of a mobile device using the IMEI.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day, Clapper {{acknowledged that}} the NSA collects telephony metadata on millions of Americans’ telephone calls. This metadata information included originating and terminating telephone number, telephone calling card number, International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (<b>IMEI)</b> <b>number,</b> time, and duration of phone calls, but {{did not include the}} name, address, or financial information of any subscriber.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{serial numbers}} (ESNs) {{were created by}} the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to uniquely {{identify}} mobile devices, {{from the days of}} AMPS in the United States starting in the early 1980s. The administrative role was taken over by the Telecommunications Industry Association in 1997 and is still maintained by them. ESNs are currently mainly used with CDMA phones (and were previously used by AMPS and TDMA phones), compared to International Mobile Equipment Identity (<b>IMEI)</b> <b>numbers</b> used by all GSM phones.|$|R
5000|$|The Luhn {{algorithm}} or Luhn formula, {{also known}} as the [...] "modulus 10" [...] or [...] "mod 10" [...] algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card <b>numbers,</b> <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers,</b> National Provider Identifier numbers in the United States, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers, Israel ID Numbers and Greek Social Security Numbers (ΑΜΚΑ). It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and described in U.S. Patent No. 2,950,048, filed on January 6, 1954, and granted on August 23, 1960.|$|R
40|$|Data leakage from {{mobile phones}} and LBS is {{increasing}} with the exponential growth of technology, {{resulting in an}} innate risk of privacy threats. To address this issue, a novel method to protect user privacy is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithms, namely SSET and SIMET, provide efficient means to encrypt the SIM and <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers</b> respectively, thus protecting user identity. The reverse procedure to retrieve the numbers {{is provided by the}} algorithms SSDT and SIMDT and illustrated with examples. The main objective of this work is to secure the privacy of mobile phone users by employing optimal cryptographic techniques...|$|R
50|$|The Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN), Iridium and Thuraya {{satellite}} phone networks all use IMEI numbers on their transceiver units {{as well as}} SIM cards {{in much the same}} way as GSM phones do. The Iridium 9601 modem relies solely on its <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> for identification and uses no SIM card; however, Iridium is a proprietary network and the device is incompatible with terrestrial GSM networks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> is not {{supposed}} to be easy to change, making the CEIR blacklisting effective. However, this is not always the case: a phone's IMEI may be easy to change with special tools. In addition, IMEI is an un-authenticated mobile identifier (as opposed to IMSI, which is routinely being authenticated by home and serving mobile networks.) Spoofed IMEI can thwart all efforts to track handsets, or target handsets for lawful intercept.|$|E
50|$|Cloning {{has been}} shown to be {{successful}} on CDMA, but rare on GSM. However, cloning of a GSM phone is achieved by cloning the SIM card contained within, but not necessarily any of the phone's internal data. GSM phones do not have ESN or MIN, only an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (<b>IMEI)</b> <b>number.</b> There are various methods used to obtain the IMEI. The most common methods are to hack into the cellular company, or to eavesdrop on the cellular network.|$|E
25|$|As the unbranded Chinese {{cell phones}} {{which do not}} have International Mobile Equipment Identity (<b>IMEI)</b> <b>numbers</b> pose a serious {{security}} risk to the country, Mobile network operators therefore suspended the usage of around 30 million mobile phones (about 8% of all mobiles in the country) by 30 April. Phones without valid IMEI cannot be connected to cellular operators. 5–6 years the average monthly subscribers additions were around 0.05 to 0.1 million only and the total mobile subscribers base in December 2002 stood at 10.5 millions. However, {{after a number of}} proactive initiatives taken by regulators and licensors, the total number of mobile subscribers has increased rapidly to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012.|$|R
50|$|According to SIMPLE Mobile {{customer}} service representatives, {{they are unable}} to submit <b>IMEI</b> <b>numbers</b> to the global stolen phones database or comply with law enforcement subpoenas to track stolen phones or those belonging to abduction victims, missing persons at risk or dangerous fugitives. Simple Mobile is an MVNO on T-Mobile's Network. This means that all information is stored on T-Mobile's servers. A law enforcement professional would need to give the subpoena/court order to the Law Enforcement Relations Group. They will be able to process the subpoena. This applies to all MVNO's since their hosted carrier supports all the network and backend. Simple Mobile should refer the parties direct to their host entity T-Mobile US.|$|R

50|$|The {{existence}} of a formally allocated <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> range for a GSM terminal {{does not mean that}} the terminal is approved or complies with regulatory requirements. The linkage between regulatory approval and IMEI allocation was removed in April 2000, with the introduction of the European R&TTE Directive. Since that date, IMEIs have been allocated by BABT (or one of several other regional administrators acting on behalf of the GSM Association) to legitimate GSM terminal manufacturers without the need to provide evidence of approval.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{companies}} offer an online unlocking service. This service requires {{that individuals who}} wish to unlock a handset provide their <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> and sometimes also country and operator details to the company, either via email or a web site. The company will then provide the unlock code for the handset. For some brands such as Nokia and Samsung various services also offer special remote unlock software with instructions where a cable is needed to remove the SIM lock at home. Such companies may email the unlocking code or software which will remotely unlock the device. Some companies also offer unlocking services that require sending <b>IMEI</b> <b>number.</b> Other companies sell unlocking hardware, including devices which fit between the SIM card and the phone to spoof the original network id during registration and devices to read and edit the handset's firmware. The pricing for unlocking a device will {{vary depending on the}} network it is locked to and the model itself, as each unlock code is unique to the handset. On average it typically costs around 15 depending on model and make, but for newer phones the price can go as high as $50 (for Apple unlocking even as high as $150). Some service providers offer unlocking services for their subscribers worldwide. The I-Unlock sim can be bought from many retail stores for $9.99 RRP. This sim allows you to unlock your phone to work with any network, the sim works with all iPhones.|$|E
50|$|All {{mobile phones}} {{have a unique}} {{identifier}} called IMEI. Anyone can report their phone as lost or stolen with their Telecom Carrier, and the IMEI would be blacklisted with a central registry. Telecom carriers, depending upon local regulation can or must implement blocking of blacklisted phones in their network. There are, however, {{a number of ways}} to circumvent a blacklist. One method is to send the phone to a country where the telecom carriers are not required to implement the blacklisting and sell it there, another involves altering the phone's <b>IMEI</b> <b>number.</b> Even so, blacklisted phones typically have less value on the second-hand market if the phones original IMEI is blacklisted.|$|E

50|$|In 2010 it was {{revealed}} that the phones of both Baransu and his wife, Esra Baransu, had been tapped by the Turkish Gendarmerie on false pretences. The Gendarmerie had obtained warrants for the phone taps by falsely representing the <b>IMEI</b> code <b>numbers</b> of the Baransus' phones as belonging to fictional Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) suspects. In 2011 five military officers were each sentenced to five years in jail for these actions. In 2011 a voice recording posted online, allegedly by a military official, said that Baransu should be killed as a warning to others.|$|R
3000|$|... “Burners” are {{temporary}} {{mobile phones}} which have sim cards registered with false {{names and addresses}} {{making it difficult for}} police to link to a particular person (Salinas-Edwards 2013). Drug dealers frequently swap their burners to evade wire taps and the geo-location trails that can establish their involvement in crime and support successful criminal prosecutions. The international mobile equipment identity (<b>IMEI)</b> <b>numbers</b> that Max refers to are unique codes that are assigned to all cellular mobile devices to identify them. These codes allow signal towers to recognise devices in the service network and establish their geographical location. This information can help the police track criminals and prove their whereabouts in court (Bennett 2012). If distributors make the mistake of putting a sim card that is registered in their name in a phone they were using to sell drugs, the police can tie the sim to that particular device. Nonetheless, the monitoring of cellular devices can actually benefit criminals if they use them intelligently. A heroin dealer called Teeth, for example, created digital alibis by leaving his registered phone turned on at his home address whilst he went out about his business in the city. By using these methods, drug dealers are essentially blocking and subverting the process in which criminogenic information is digitised and monitored. Berry (Forthcoming) observes a similar phenomenon in his study of the electronic monitoring of offenders.|$|R
5000|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{filed an}} {{application}} with the FISC to compel Verizon to produce telephony metadata from its customers' calls for 90 days. According to the FISA order, telephony metadata includes [...] "comprehensive communications routing information, including {{but not limited}} to session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, International Mobile station Equipment Identity (<b>IMEI)</b> <b>number,</b> etc.), trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers, and time and duration of call. Telephony metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication, as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2510(8), or the name, address, or financial information of a subscriber or customer." ...|$|E
50|$|The unlock code is {{verified}} by the handset and {{is generated by}} the manufacturer, typically by an algorithm such as a one way hash or trapdoor function. Sometimes big telecom providers change the original factory unlock codes as an extra layer of security against unlocking services. For various big brands such as Samsung and Motorola there is no algorithm but just a random code generator where the unlock codes are programmed in the phone itself and then saved in a big database managed by the manufacturer. For the other brands where the unlock codes are still based on algorithms those {{are based on the}} <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> and the MCC code and have been reverse-engineered, stolen or leaked. Some handsets can be unlocked using software that generates an unlock code from an <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> and country and operator details using the algorithm specific to the handset. Other manufacturers have taken a more cautious approach, and embed a random number in the handset's firmware that is retained by the network on whose behalf the lock was applied and the manufacturer. These handsets can still be unlocked by online services that have access to either inside people with the manufacturer or with the telecom networks, or they need to be connected to the computer with a cable where specific software will bypass the security and SIM-unlock the phone. Sometimes this is done by advanced calculations to bypass the security the official way and other times using exploits or overwriting parts of the firmware where the lock status is kept, and often even recover a phone that is bricked or completely damaged in the software sense.|$|E
50|$|The UR Safe {{feature of}} the TCP {{application}} empowers the elderly and the vulnerable, especially women, to get quick help from the Trivandrum police just by a long press of the volume rocker (down) key of their mobile phones. The police control room receives the alert along with information of the location, the subscriber ID and the <b>IMEI</b> <b>number</b> of the mobile. The police then immediately dispatches help via the police CRV (Control Room Vehicle) that is nearest to the distress location. Once iSafe sends an alert to the control room, its position can be tracked until the situation is resolved. The position of the caller is visible to the police at the control room and also on tablets that the police force carries.|$|E
30|$|Compared with TaintDroid, the TaintChaser system {{proposed}} by this paper could monitor more user privacy information, not only <b>IMEI,</b> phone <b>number,</b> location information, photos, and audio, but also communication, SMS, email, {{and other important}} information, detected as pollution point sources. At the same time, the system achieves a more fine-grained taint tracking mode through the detection of each byte in memory content. The system detects more privacy leakage points (socket communication, HTTPS encryption communication, SMS, or Bluetooth communication), gives the path information of the detected program executed in detail, and has automatic tests of procedures [14].|$|R
