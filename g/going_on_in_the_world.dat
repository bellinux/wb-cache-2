For shorter time frames (less than a few days), algorithms can be devised to predict prices. It is understood from the above models that many macroeconomic factors affect the exchange rates {{and in the end}} currency prices are a result of dual forces of demand and supply. The world's currency markets {{can be viewed as a}} huge melting pot: in a large and ever-changing mix of current events, supply and demand factors are constantly shifting, and the price of one currency in relation to another shifts accordingly. No other market encompasses (and distills) as much of what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> at any given time as foreign exchange.|$|E
25|$|The Harmonites were Christian pietist Separatists who {{split from}} the Lutheran Church {{in the late}} 18th century. Under the {{leadership}} of George Rapp, the group left Württemberg, Germany, {{and came to the}} United States in 1803. Due to the troubles they had in Europe, the group sought to establish a more perfect society in the American wilderness. They were nonviolent pacifists who refused to serve in the military and tried to live by George Rapp's philosophy and literal interpretations of the New Testament. They first settled and built the town of Harmony, Pennsylvania, in 1804, and established the Harmony Society in 1805 as a religious commune. In 1807, celibacy was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming Millennium. Rapp believed that the events and wars <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and he also viewed Napoleon as the Antichrist. In 1814, the Society sold their first town in Pennsylvania and moved to the Indiana Territory, where they built their second town. In 1824, they {{decided it was time to}} leave Indiana, sold their land and town in Indiana, and moved to their final settlement in Western Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|Willis's review, written {{more than}} half a century past the {{original}} writing of the volume, is in some respects a gentler way of phrasing the work's immediate reception. One of Russell's contemporaries wrote: [...] "As a contribution to social science... or to the study of government, the volume is very disappointing... In this pretentious volume, Russell shows only the most superficial familiarity with progress made in the study of social phenomena or in any special field of social research, either with techniques of inquiry, or with materials assembled, or with interpretations developed... it seems doubtful that the author knows what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of social science." [...] (Merriam, 1939) Indeed, the very preface of the work candidly states: [...] "As usual, those who look in Russell's pronouncements for dotty opinions will be able to find a few". (Russell 1938:x) Still, some scholars, like Edward Hallet Carr, found the work of some use. (Carr 2001:131) ...|$|E
500|$|A {{fruitful}} {{conceptualization of}} mu waves in pediatric use that {{is independent of}} their frequency is that mu wave suppression is a representation of activity <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and is detectable in the frontal and parietal networks. A resting oscillation becomes suppressed during the observation of sensory information such as sounds or sights, usually within the [...] (motor) cortical region. Measured in this way, the mu wave is detectable during infancy as early as four to six months, when the peak frequency the wave reaches can be as low as 5.4 Hz. There is a rapid increase in peak frequency {{in the first year}} of life, and by age two frequency typically reaches 7.5Hz. The peak frequency of the mu wave increases with age until maturation into adulthood, when it reaches its final and stable frequency of 8–13Hz. These varying frequencies are measured as activity around the central sulcus, within the Rolandic cortex.|$|E

It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me.

2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> right now". Likewise, {{he notes that the}} album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so {{this is one of the}} main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
