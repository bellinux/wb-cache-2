25|$|Australia has {{excellent}} wind {{resources by}} world standards. The southern coastline {{lies in the}} roaring forties and hundreds of sites have average wind speeds above 8 or even 9m/s at 50m above ground (the <b>hub</b> <b>height</b> of a modern wind generator). The southwest of Western Australia, southern South Australia, western Victoria, northern Tasmania and elevated areas of New South Wales and Queensland have good wind resources. Several states engaged in systematic wind speed monitoring in the 1980s and 1990s, the results of which are publicly available. Australian wind farms produce on average capacity factors of 30–35%, making wind an attractive option. South Australia's large share (along with nearby Victoria) means most of Australia's wind power occurs around the same time.

40|$|As of January 2010, the {{installed}} capacity of onshore wind power in Germany was over 25 GW. However, {{there is still}} a huge potential to further develop onshore wind energy. New tower technology allows the realisation of <b>hub</b> <b>heights</b> significantly exceeding 100 m and to tap wind resources over forests.

This paper presents a project that aims to explore the wind characteristics at great <b>hub</b> <b>heights</b> over forested hills. Furthermore, the project seeks to test and improve lidar measurements in complex terrain and great <b>hub</b> <b>heights</b> as a new option to complement or eventually replace mast mounted measurements. Within the project a 200 m met mast will be installed at a hilly woodland site. The mast will be equipped with anemometers at ten different heights. Additionally the measurements of three lidar systems will be c ompared to that of sensors mounted at the met mast. The installation of the mast is scheduled for summer 2010. Until then, the three lidar systems will be tested at several locations using different configurations. At the moment the lidars are placed next to a 200 m met mast in flat terrain.

30|$|Technical {{electricity}} generation assessment and economic analysis of six wind energy conversion {{systems in the}} categories small, medium, and large (with power ratings of 20, 35, 275, 500, 1, 000, and 2, 000 kW) were examined in this study. Electricity cost values were estimated based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and present value cost (PVC) methods for six locations selected across all the geopolitical zones of Nigeria. This was done using wind speed data that span between 25 and 37 years, measured {{at the height of}} 10 m. The result showed that the annual average energy output ranges from 2.242 MW h in Uyo with P 10 - 20 turbine to 12, 521.55 MW h in Kano using Vestas V 80 - 2 MW wind turbine. Furthermore, of all the selected sites, Kano gave the least costs of electricity production per kilowatt hour with Vestas V 80 - 2 MW model at 67 -m <b>hub</b> <b>heights,</b> while the highest is obtained in Uyo with GEV-HP (1 MW) model at 70 -m <b>hub</b> <b>heights</b> for the LCOE and PVC height for both the LCOE and PVC methods.

40|$|Modern wind {{turbines}} with high <b>hub</b> <b>heights</b> enable an economical energy production for locations with lower wind speed, complex terrain or in forests. High <b>hub</b> <b>heights</b> result in high {{requirements for the}} performance of turbine towers. For power production, the towers have to feature distinct static and dynamic properties. The feasibility of conventional, welded tubular steel towers faces technical and economical limits and alternative tower concepts are applied. For alternative steel towers concepts, friction connections with preloaded bolts have several advantages, but also raises new questions. The load bearing capacity of a friction connection depends on the coefficient of static friction and the applied pretension. During the turbine lifetime, the friction connection will be subject to a loss of pretension that needs to be considered. According to current design standards for steel constructions, the loss of pretension cannot be included in the design phase, but must be accounted for by means of maintenance. This article presents an advanced design method for friction connection in steel constructions that is based on the VDI guideline 2230 for bolted connections in machinery structures and includes a possibility to consider loss of pretension. In addition, friction connections with drilled and punched holes are considered. It can be shown, that for preloaded friction connections, the punching of holes leads to no adverse effects for fatigue resistance. On the basis of this design method, it was possible to issue a type approval for a maintenance free steel shell tower that consists of steel plates, which are joined by friction connections...|$|R
