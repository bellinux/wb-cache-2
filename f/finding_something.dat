5|$|The episode {{features}} alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) accompanied by Rory's father, Brian (Mark Williams), Queen Nefertiti (Riann Steele), and John Riddell, a British big-game hunter (Rupert Graves). The group lands on a large spaceship that contains dinosaurs and discover {{that it is a}} Silurian ark, though the Silurians have been murdered by Solomon (David Bradley), a black market trader who is intent on <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> of value.|$|E
5|$|The series {{concerns}} Phineas's {{attempts to}} avoid boredom by <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> new {{to do for}} each day of his summer vacation. His sister's name is Candace Flynn, who tries to reveal their outrageous creations, but to no avail. He does this with his less-talkative stepbrother Ferb, and often with many other neighborhood children. The activities they devise usually involve outlandish contraptions, including roller coasters, haunted houses, roller rinks, and a backyard beach etc. which Phineas designs and Ferb builds.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, the {{problems}} with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but the politics and the economics. In the 1880s, the BR and the Erie shared locomotive facilities at Clarion Junction. They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service {{to each other on}} the basis of whose engine was first up at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push. After some years of this, the BR management realized that their engines were doing most of the work. The Erie crews had acquired the knack of <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> wrong with their engines, keeping them conveniently immobilized {{when it was time for}} work. The agreement ended.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{colonies of}} insects such as ants and bees, {{researchers}} are modeling {{the behavior of}} swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots {{can be considered as}} one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism, exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors. Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly.|$|E

25|$|Paul suffers some {{financial}} difficulties with his businesses – Lassiter's Hotel and PirateNet, a local radio station. To help ease his problems, he transfers $100,000 from the Lassiter's Corporation into the PirateNet accounts and tells his wife, Rebecca, {{that it is}} from an anonymous benefactor. Rebecca's son, Declan, believes Paul has been embezzling money from Lassiter's and contacts Diana Marshall about his suspicions. Diana is sent to Erinsborough to investigate Paul's dealings, on behalf of Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), who owns a significant stake in Lassiter's. Paul hires Toadfish Rebecchi to be his lawyer and Toadie discovers Paul's embezzlement. Paul tries to cover up what he has done, but his son, Andrew, accidentally gives Diana proof of the crime. After learning that Diana knows everything, Paul asks her {{to join him in}} taking over the company. To prove to her that he is serious, Paul has sex with her, but Diana tells him that she is going to take his job. Paul hires a private investigator to bug Toadie's phone in the hope of <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> to blackmail him with. He learns that Toadie is helping Stephanie Scully to cover up {{the fact that she is}} pregnant by her best friend's husband. Paul then asks Toadie to make it look like Diana embezzled the money instead. Toadie later agrees to help Diana bring Paul down. Paul learns Toadie and Diana are working together, so to punish Toadie, he reveals his and Steph's secret over the radio.|$|E
500|$|In 1607, Fuller began {{challenging}} the Court of High Commission yet again, an ecclesiastical court {{established by the}} monarch with near unlimited power. The High Commission was vastly unpopular amongst both common lawyers and Members of Parliament, as the idea of [...] "prerogative law" [...] challenged both authorities. The appointment of Richard Bancroft as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1604 caused the issue to grow in importance; Bancroft's zeal and strictness [...] "could hardly fail to produce an atmosphere in which principles and issues would crystallize, in which logic would supplant reasonableness". The judges, particularly Sir Edward Coke, began to unite with Parliament in {{challenging the}} High Commission. The High Commission tried people for heresy, based on their internal thoughts and private beliefs, in [...] "a trap to catch unwary or ingenuous men - 'an unlawful process of poking about in the speculation of <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> chargeable'".|$|E
500|$|Various sources {{considered}} {{the media coverage}} prior to Webster's arrest {{to be focused on}} <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> to blame other than her murderer. After Webster's arrest the media continued to search for any outside agency that might have been responsible for the event. From the beginning, media reports highlighted the lack of parental supervision at the party, and in sentencing Webster, Justice Wood made comments criticising the lack of parental supervision. Researchers Jonathan Morrow and Mehera San Roque in the Sydney Law Review wrote that Wood's comments [...] "might as well have been quoted from the very newspapers that were covering the crime"; his comments, in turn, were heavily reported in the media. Webster's sentencing also received considerable media coverage, possibly due to his youth and the length of his sentence, as well as curiosity about the newly established [...] "truth-in-sentencing" [...] principles. His appeal regarding the length of his sentence received similar coverage.|$|E

500|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The one thing I noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I looked at all the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E
500|$|Once {{he had the}} sound, {{he rolled}} off the bottom to [...] "take the muddiness out". It was {{actually}} double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, {{and the rest of}} the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was [...] "a little unorthodox" [...] and therefore, he tried to refine it. Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, [...] "... and in all honesty, whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> you like about it, and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play." [...] Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in [...] "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that [...] " [...] could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers." [...] Swivel further said that it started with [...] "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" [...] kick, and he then added a little thump to it.|$|E
500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E

60|$|He {{agreed with}} her that they were society people, {{but she could not}} at once accept his theory that they had {{themselves}} been the objects of an advance from them because of their neutral literary quality, through which they were of no social world, but potentially common to any.

500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "The Rock Show", is the opposite: {{an upbeat}} [...] "effervescent celebration of love, life and music". It was written as a [...] "fast punk-rock love song" [...] in the vein of the Ramones and Screeching Weasel. The song {{tells the story}} of two teenagers meeting a rock concert, and, despite failing grades and disapproving parents, falling and staying in love. It was inspired by the band's early days in San Diego's all-ages venue SOMA. [...] "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] follows and is written about divorce {{from the point of view}} of a helpless child. Inspired by DeLonge's parents' divorce, it is one of the band's darker songs. [...] "Roller Coaster" [...] was written when Hoppus had a nightmare when he and his wife, Skye, first began dating; the song is about <b>finding</b> <b>something</b> ideal but fearing for its certain departure. [...] "Reckless Abandon" [...] was penned by DeLonge as a reflection on summer memories, including parties, skateboarding and trips to the beach. [...] "Everytime I Look for You" [...] has no specific lyrical basis, according to Hoppus, and [...] "Give Me One Good Reason" [...] was written about punk music and nonconformity in a high school setting. [...] "Shut Up", a [...] "broken-family snapshot", revisits the territory of youthful woes, described by Shooman as a [...] "fairly familiar rites-of-passage tale" [...] that [...] "adds to general themes of isolation, alienation and moving on to a new place that pervade Take Off Your Pants and Jacket". [...] "Please Take Me Home" [...] concludes the standard edition of the album and was written about the consequences of a friendship developing into a relationship.|$|E

The series had one major theme: however strange, mystical, or even supernatural a particular phenomenon may seem at first, {{it is capable of}} being traced to human agency with the determined application of reason and logic. This theme was compromised on four occasions by Carey: in The Invisible Dog, she canonizes astral projection; in The Mystery of Monster Mountain, the boys encounter Bigfoot; in The Mystery of the Scar-Faced Beggar, a woman has genuine prophetic dreams; and in the final book of the original run, The Mystery of the Cranky Collector, a young woman's ghost returns to haunt her former employer's mansion.|$|E
