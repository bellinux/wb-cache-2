40|$|The goal of {{our work}} {{is to develop a}} {{methodology}} for automatically predicting potential pilot errors during the design of mode-based systems for modern cockpits. The main ingredient of this methodology is a cognitive model of pilot behaviour allowing to predict misconceptions in the pilot's mental procedure model based on a cognitive process called “learned carelessness”. In a first stage we use this model inside a simulation platform to automatically degrade a normative procedure model in a psychological plausible way. In a second stage we apply formal verification techniques to exhaustively analyse what human errors can be caused by the <b>degraded</b> <b>procedure.</b> In this text we describe a case study conducted at the Lufthansa Flight Training Centre where we analysed a Piper Cheyenne autopilot. 1 Human Error Analysis in Early Stages of Safety Critical System Design It is often cited that 60 - 80 % of commercial aircraft accidents are caused by the flight crew. What is the reason of this high percentage? The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted a study to investigate the interaction between flight crews and modern cockpit systems (like flight management and autopilot (AP) systems). One major concern highlighted in the study is a general lack of mode awareness that exists independent from the manufacturer, operator, or airplane type (Lyall & Wilson, 1997).

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{reactive}} local search-based algorithm for the disjunctively constrained knapsack problem (DCKP). DCKP is {{a variant of}} the standard knapsack problem, an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, with special disjunctive constraints. A disjunctive constraint is a couple of items for which only one item is packed. The proposed algorithm is based upon a reactive local search, where an explicit check for the repetition of configurations is added to the search process. Initially, two complementary greedy procedures are applied in order to construct a starting solution. Second, a <b>degrading</b> <b>procedure</b> is introduced in order (i) to escape to local optima and (ii) to introduce a diversification in the search space.

A matter of grave concern to us, {{and a threat}} to the public reputation of the World Medical Association, has brought us together in this perhaps unprecedented medical initiative. We wish to publicly protest and appeal against the recent appointment of Dr Yoram Blachar, longstanding President of the Israeli Medical Association, as President of the World Medical Association. We believe that his Presidency makes a mockery of the principles on which the WMA was founded in 1947, which was as a response to egregious abuses by German and Japanese doctors in World War Two. The WMA's own Declaration of Tokyo (1975) specifies that "physicians shall not countenance, condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or <b>degrading</b> <b>procedures,</b> and in all situations, including armed conflict and civil conflict". The WMA Annual General Assembly of 2007 made it clear that inaction was not an option, stating that "this is the first time the WMA has explicitly obliged doctors to document cases of torture of which they become aware. The absence of documenting and denouncing such acts might be considered as a form of tolerance and of non-assistance to the victims". (1) There are still more recent calls from authoritative academic sources for the international medical community to go much further in actively allying itself with efforts to suppress mistreatment of prisoners. (2) Amnesty International concluded as long ago as 1996 that Israeli doctors working with the security services "formed part of a system in which detainees are tortured, ill treated and humiliated in ways that place prison medical practice in conflict with medical ethics". (3) Dr Blachar, already IMA President, took no action. Amnesty's briefing to the UN Committee against Torture in September 2008 "focuses on Amnesty International's (continuing) concerns about Israel's failure to implement the Convention against Torture in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the intensification of measures amounting to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment".

Our results show that the identification of decreased spaced strings was slower than normally spaced strings (crowding effect). More importantly, decreasing distance between letters impaired more nonwords than words identification, showing a possible top-down modulation on crowding effect. Since sublexical identification and decoding are crucial for reading development, an increased crowding could be an important factor underling reading difficulties typically shown in dyslexic children...|$|R
40|$|With the {{discovery}} of the prion protein (PrP), immunodiagnostic procedures were applied to diagnose Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). Before development of the conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI), all immunoassays for the disease-causing PrP isoform (PrPSc) used limited proteolysis to digest the precursor cellular PrP (PrPC). Because the CDI is the only immunoassay that measures both the protease-resistant and protease-sensitive forms of PrPSc, we used the CDI to diagnose human prion disease. The CDI gave a positive signal for PrPSc in all 10 – 24 brain regions (100 %) examined from 28 CJD patients. A subset of 18 brain regions from 8 patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD) was examined by histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the CDI. Three of the 18 regions (17 %) were consistently positive by histology and 4 of 18 (22 %) by IHC for the 8 sCJD patients. In contrast, the CDI was positive in all 18 regions (100 %) for all 8 sCJD patients. In both gray and white matter, ≈ 90 % of the total PrPSc was protease-sensitive and, thus, would have been <b>degraded</b> by <b>procedures</b> using proteases to eliminate PrPC. Our findings argue that the CDI should be used to establish or rule out the diagnosis of prion disease when a small number of samples is available {{as is the case with}} brain biopsy. Moreover, IHC should not be used as the standard against which all other immunodiagnostic techniques are compared because an immunoassay, such as the CDI, is substantially more sensitive...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{structure}} prediction {{results of a}} new composite pipeline for templateâ based modeling (TBM) in the 11 th CASP experiment. Starting from multiple structure templates identified by LOMETS based metaâ threading programs, the QUARK ab initio folding program is extended to generate initial fullâ length models under strong constraints from template alignments. The final atomic models are then constructed by Iâ TASSER based fragment reassembly simulations, followed by the fragmentâ guided molecular dynamic simulation and the MQAPâ based model selection. It {{was found that the}} inclusion of QUARKâ TBM simulations as an intermediate modeling step could help improve the quality of the Iâ TASSER models for both Easy and Hard TBM targets. Overall, the average TMâ score of the first Iâ TASSER model is 12 % higher than that of the best LOMETS templates, with the RMSD in the same threadingâ aligned regions reduced from 5. 8 to 4. 7 Ã. Nevertheless, there are nearly 18 % of TBM domains with the templates deteriorated by the structure assembly pipeline, which may be attributed to the errors of secondary structure and domain orientation predictions that propagate through and <b>degrade</b> the <b>procedures</b> of template identification and final model selections. To examine the record of progress, we made a retrospective report of the Iâ TASSER pipeline in the last five CASP experiments (CASP 7 â 11). The data show no clear progress of the LOMETS threading programs over PSIâ BLAST; but obvious progress on structural improvement relative to threading templates was witnessed in recent CASP experiments, which is probably attributed to the integration of the extended ab initio folding simulation with the threading assembly pipeline and the introduction of atomicâ level structure refinements following the reduced modeling simulations.

A relatively large number of distinct polypeptidic fragments between 10 and 100  kDa indicated a moderate degradation. As this fraction consisted of soluble polypeptides, the absence of components with higher molecular mass is self-explainable. Upon rising the temperature by only 10 ° and using stirring, the same extraction procedure led to significant degradation, both in the product that was precipitated by freeze-drying from the initial supernatant (Fig.  2, lane 7) and in the initial spontaneous precipitate, what we called the primary precipitate (Fig.  2, lane 8). However, polypeptidic fragments with higher molecular masses (in excess of ~ 300  kDa), therefore insoluble in water, were abundant in the latter but poorly defined. As a comparison and a test of our electrophoretic analysis, the solution of a commercially available sericin sample, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, was also analyzed, resulting in the pattern shown in Fig.  2 (lane 9). Clearly, this product was significantly <b>degraded</b> during isolation <b>procedure,</b> and the molecular mass distribution (10 – 40  kDa) suggests that alkaline extraction was the method used for its isolation.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Determining how {{individuals}} solve arithmetic problems {{is crucial for}} our understanding of human cognitive architecture. Elderly adults are supposed to use memory retrieval more often than younger ones. However, they might backup their retrieval by reconstructive strategies. In order to investigate this issue, we used the operand-recognition paradigm, which capitalizes {{on the fact that}} algorithmic <b>procedures</b> <b>degrade</b> the memory traces of the operands. Method. Twenty-three older adults (M = 70. 4) and 23 younger adults (M = 20. 0) solved easy, difficult, and medium-difficulty addition and comparison problems and were then presented with a recognition task of the operands. Results. When one-digit numbers with sums larger than 10 were involved (medium-difficulty problem), it was more difficult for younger adults to recognize the operands after addition than comparison. In contrast, in older adults, recognition times of the operands were the same after addition and comparison. Discussion. Older adults, in contrast with younger adults, are able to retrieve the results of addition problems of medium difficulty. Contrary to what was suggested, older participants do not seem to resort to backup strategies for such problems. Finally, older adults' reliance on the more efficient retrieval strategy allowed them to catch up to younger adults in terms of solution time...|$|R

However, this method using tumor cell-containing blood/tissue is difficult to evaluate the whole tumor cell burden in the body. In order to establish an efficient method to evaluate the whole tumor cell burden in the body, we tried to quantify tumor-associated mRNA existing in plasma/serum instead of leukemia cell-containing blood cells in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and compared the levels of BCR-ABL mRNA between plasma/serum and peripheral blood cells. mRNA of BCR-ABL, WT 1 or GAPDH (control molecule) was detected by real-time RT-PCR using RNA {{extracted from}} plasma/serum of almost all the patients with CML. Copy numbers of BCR-ABL mRNA were significantly correlated between plasma/serum and peripheral blood cells.

40|$|Determining adults’ and children’s {{strategies}} in mental arithmetic constitutes {{a central issue}} {{in the domain of}} numerical cognition. However, despite the considerable amount of research on this topic, the conclusions in the literature are not always coherent. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} carry on the investigation, and this is the reason why we developed the operand recognition paradigm (ORP). It capitalizes on the fact that, contrary to retrieval, calculation <b>procedures</b> <b>degrade</b> the memory traces of the operands involved in a problem. As a consequence, the use of calculation procedures is inferred from relatively long recognition times of the operands. However, it has been suggested that recognition times within the ORP do not reflect strategies but the difficulty of switching from a difficult task (calculation) to a simpler one (recognition). In order to examine this possibility, in a series of 3 experiments we equalized switch-cost variations in all conditions through the introduction of intermediate tasks between problem solving and recognition. Despite this neutralization, we still obtained the classical effects of the ORP, namely longer recognition times after addition than after comparison. We conclude that the largest part of the ORP effects is related to different strategy use and not to difficulty-related switch costs. The possible applications and promising outcomes of the ORP in and outside the field of numerical cognition are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{recently}} demonstrated that chicken egg-yolk immunoglobulin Y (IgY) has many immunological properties {{not only on}} avian, but also on mammalians, such as human [1]. Since {{it is easy to}} insulate (directly from egg yolk – where it is present at a concentration of 10 mg/mL), recently scientists proposed new immunotherapies based on the addiction of IgY to medicine or food both for animals and humans [1]. In addition, eggs are very common ingredients in all diets, so {{it is important to understand}} if it is possible to obtain such immunological properties from every day foods, or if IgY <b>degrades</b> during cooking <b>procedures</b> and temperature changes. For this reason, we developed an electrochemical immunosensors based on Au-nanoelectrodes ensemble (NEE) as transducer, able to identify IgY in different matrices. NEEs are prepared via template electroless deposition of gold in a polycarbonate (PC) membrane. Polycarbonate is affine to proteins and antibodies and, for these reason NEEs are very suitable to be used both as electrodes and as protein-receiver material [2]. IgY, the biological molecular recognition element, is immobilized directly on the PC surface of the electrode. It is recognized by the secondary antibody anti-IgY labelled with HRP, an electroactive enzyme that reacts with his substrate (H 2 O 2) and a redox mediator (methylene blue), originating the electrocatalytic cycle. Only the reduction of the oxidated form of methylene blue is an electrochemical reaction, so it is possible to observe an electrocatalytic peak. The proposed immunosensor was tested on different samples, starting from standard IgY, then on analytes collected from yolk or egg-white, and following from more complex food samples containing egg yolk or full cooked eggs. In this communication, the obtained results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A new {{airtightness}} {{test procedure}} {{has been developed}} for separating exterior envelope air leakage from interior partition leakage, when testing a single zone within a multi- zone building. Historically, envelope leakage from a single zone within a multi-zone building could only be measured if exact equalization was achieved of the pressure differentials across all interior partition surfaces using a masking blower(s). Experimentally, this {{has proven to be}} problematic with the result that the procedure is seldom used. The new technique, called the "Parallel Flow Airtightness Test" method (PFAT) permits partition leakage to be measured and subtracted from the total leakage of the test zone thereby allowing the exterior envelope leakage to be isolated and quantified. However, instead of requiring exact equalization of the interior partition pressure differentials, the new technique only requires that they be modified from their original values. Experimentally, this is a much easier condition to achieve and offers significant advantages to practitioners. As part of this thesis, the PFAT test procedure was proposed, validated in a series of laboratory trials and then applied to three different buildings to assess its practicality under real-world conditions. Using the results of the laboratory and field work, guidelines were then developed for applying the methodology to other structures. Under laboratory conditions (with no wind or indoor-to-outdoor pressure differentials to account for), the PFAT method was capable of measuring the exterior envelope air leakage with a maximum error of about 2 % at 75 Pa, when a second blower was used to modify the pressure regimes in the adjacent, buffer zone. When the pressure regimes in the buffer zone were modified by simply sealing or unsealing a duct to the buffer zone, the accuracy of the <b>procedure</b> <b>degraded</b> significantly, producing errors of up to 26 %. The field trials were then carried out on three multi-zone buildings in Winnipeg. From these trials it was concluded that the procedure seems well suited to field work and offers advantages, in terms of time and equipment, over the traditional pressure-masking technique. However, greater skill and better planning are required relative to that needed for a conventional, single-zone airtightness test. Overall, it was concluded that for many applications the PFAT method provides a workable method of separating interior partition air leakage from exterior envelope buildin...|$|R
40|$|An {{immunoglobulin}} M kappa-chain murine {{monoclonal antibody}} (CAB) reacted in a Western blot (immunoblot) with approximately 30 polypeptides from a whole-cell lysate of several American and European Borrelia burgdorferi strains. The reactive antigen {{with the highest}} M(r) was measured at 93 kDa (p 93) and had an NH 2 -terminal sequence {{identical to the one}} previously reported for this antigen. The lowest reactive antigen had an M(r) of 16, 000. All antigens recognized by CAB had isoelectric points within a narrow acidic range, between 5. 4 and 6. 2. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the broad reactivity of CAB could be due to degradation of the antigen with the highest M(r), since such spontaneous degradation of p 93 has already been reported, and to determine whether CAB could recognize shared epitopes in different antigens. Treatment of B. burgdorferi with protease inhibitors did not result in changes in CAB reactivity, indicating that if such degradation existed, it was most likely not due to the action of endogenous proteases. Likewise, protease treatment of intact organisms and recovery of the antigens in the insoluble fraction of a Triton X- 114 partition indicated that they were internal and thus less likely to be <b>degraded</b> by experimental <b>procedures.</b> Amino-terminal sequences of other reactive polypeptides showed one approximately 72 -kDa polypeptide to be identical to the DnaK homolog of B. burgdorferi. Two other antigens at approximately 49 and 47 kDa were blocked to Edman degradation. Finally, one sequenced polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 38. 5 kDa had a strong identity with glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase of other bacteria and vertebrates. Thus, while it cannot be ruled out that some of the CAB reactivity may be due to fragmentation of p 93, there is strong evidence to indicate the presence of a shared epitope in at least three, possibly five, unrelated antigens of B. burgdorferi. A linear epitope within amino acid residues 357 to 371 of p 93 was identified. Evidence is presented for a discontinuous epitope in the carboxy-terminal region of the DnaK homolog, which bears strong amino acid identity with the p 93 epitope. The conserved amino acid sequences necessary for these shared epitopes indicate possible genetic and/or functional relatedness among these various antigens...|$|R

Research was conducted to assess the feasibility of using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) technology to predict fractional protein utilization in cattle on forage based diets. Forage samples were obtained from esophageal and ruminal cannulated cattle grazing native forage (warm and cool season), while fecal samples were acquired from non-fistulated animals grazing the same pastures as the fistulated animals Laboratory analysis for crude protein (CP), 20 -hr in vitro protein digestibility, and acid detergent fiber nitrogen (ADFN) were conducted on extrusa, and calculated on a percent dry matter (%DM) basis. Indigestible intake protein (IIP) was considered to be the nitrogen (N) content in the residue from the ADF <b>procedure.</b> <b>Degraded</b> intake protein (DIP) and digestible undegraded protein (DUP) were calculated from ADFN, 20 -hr in vitro, and CP content. Fecal sample spectra and forage laboratory analysis provided the dependent and independent variable data needed to conduct stepwise regression analysis and obtain predictive NIRS equations. Standard error of calibration (SEC) for warm-season DIP, DUP, and IIP were 0. 96, 0. 36, and 0. 25, respectively. While coefficients of determination (W) for the same fractions were 0. 81, 0. 94, and 0. 97, respectively. Wavelengths selected were biologically explainable, therefore the equations were deemed satisfactory for first generation predictive technology. Cool-season equations were found to be less encouraging and yielded le values for DIP, DUP, and IEP of 0. 90, 0. 39, and 0. 78, respectively, while SEC values were 0. 95, 0. 50, and 0. 24, respectively. The cool-season calibrated equations for DLTP and IIP were deemed unsatisfactory and need future work. A more robust dataset with greater standardization of lab technique and stricter sampling methods will be required to improve the DUP and IIP cool-season equations. NIRS technology proved to be a feasible means of providing estimations for protein utilization of distinct protein fractions in the gastrointestinal tract of freeranging cattle. However, the stability of these predictions is heavily dependent on forage type. These equations serve as first-generation predictive equations and should be upgraded through enhanced research to provide cattle producers with answers to increasing questions about the nutritional status of cattle on grazinglands...|$|R
