25|$|Their strength, stiffness, {{and high}} melting points are {{consequences}} of the strength and stiffness of the covalent bonds that hold them together. They are also characteristically brittle because the directional nature of covalent bonds strongly resists the shearing motions associated with plastic flow, and are, in effect, broken when shear occurs. This property results in brittleness for reasons studied {{in the field of}} <b>fracture</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Network covalent solids vary from insulating to semiconducting in their behavior, depending on the band gap of the material.|$|E
25|$|Rupture {{propagation}} {{is generally}} modeled using a <b>fracture</b> <b>mechanics</b> approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity {{is a function}} of the fracture energy in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70–90% of the S-wave velocity, and this is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These supershear earthquakes have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as slow earthquakes. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.|$|E

A literature review also suggests that there is no general agreement among various investigators on the relative significance of different variables affecting the crack width, despite the large number of experimental work carried out during the past few decades. An analytical method is developed to determine the concrete stress distribution near flexural cracks in reinforced concrete one-way slabs and used to investigate the effects of various variables on the spacing and width of cracks. The formula is developed using a large number of curvature values calculated from the concrete and steel strains at various sections between adjacent cracks for a number of composite precast deck slabs. The present method of incorporating the tension stiffening effect is verified by comparing calculated <b>fracture</b> <b>mechanic</b> and those measured by other investigators. The curvature values at sections between adjacent cracks are calculated using an empirical formula. Development of this formula is based on the curvature values calculated using the concrete and steel strains at various sections between successive cracks, for a number of composite precast deck slabs. Using the curvature values evaluated by the proposed formula, short-term deflections were determined for a large number of flexural members and the results were compared with those measured by other investigators.
