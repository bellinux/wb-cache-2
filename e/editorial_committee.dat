25|$|In January 1900, {{with the}} start of a new Convorbiri Literare series, Bassarabescu was co-opted onto the journal's <b>editorial</b> <b>committee,</b> overseen by {{geographer}} Grigore Antipa. According to Ornea, the panel membership evidenced in itself that political Junimism had mutated into eclecticism: Antipa was a National Liberal, and one regular member, Dimitrie Voinov, a socialist. Like other Convorbiri Literare contributors, Bassarabescu saw his work published in the more radical right-wing Sămănătorul magazine, but he did not necessarily identify with the Sămănătorul agenda. He was invited to publish there by his mentor Vlahuță, who rewarded his contribution with an original canvas by painter Nicolae Grigorescu. In 1903, he answered a similar call from Livescu, publishing in the new magazine Revista Teatrelor.|$|E
