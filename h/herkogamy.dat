40|$|The {{evolution}} of mating systems, which exhibit an extraordinary diversity in flowering plants, is of central interest in plant biology. <b>Herkogamy,</b> the spatial separation of sexual organs within flowers, {{is a widespread}} floral mechanism that {{is thought to be}} an adaptive trait reducing self-pollination in hermaphroditic plants. In contrast with previous studies of <b>herkogamy</b> that focused on plants with relatively large floral displays, we here characterized <b>herkogamy</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant with a strong selfing syndrome. Developmental features, reproductive consequences, and genetic architecture of <b>herkogamy</b> were exploited using naturally variable A. thaliana accessions, under both greenhouse and natural conditions. Our results demonstrate that the degree of <b>herkogamy</b> can strongly influence the mating patterns of A. thaliana: approach <b>herkogamy</b> can effectively promote outcrossing, no <b>herkogamy</b> is also capable of enhancing the opportunity for outcrossing, and reverse <b>herkogamy</b> facilitates efficient self-pollination. In addition, we found that the expression of <b>herkogamy</b> in A. thaliana was environment-dependent and regulated by multiple quantitative trait loci.

40|$|Backgrounds and Aims The spatial {{separation}} of stigmas and anthers (<b>herkogamy)</b> in flowering plants functions to reduce self-pollination and avoid interference between pollen dispersal and receipt. Little {{is known about}} the evolutionary relationships among the three main forms of <b>herkogamy</b> - approach, reverse and reciprocal <b>herkogamy</b> (distyly) - or about transitions to and from a non-herkogamous condition. This problem was examined in Exochaenium (Gentianaceae), a genus of African herbs that exhibits considerable variation in floral morphology, including the three forms of <b>herkogamy.</b> Methods Using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods, the evolutionary history of herkogamic and non-herkogamic conditions was reconstructed from a molecular phylogeny of 15 species of Exochaenium and four outgroup taxa, based on three chloroplast regions, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1 and 2) and the 5 · 8 S gene. Ancestral character states were determined and the reconstructions were used to evaluate competing models for the origin of reciprocal <b>herkogamy.</b> Key results Reciprocal <b>herkogamy</b> originated once in Exochaenium from an ancestor with approach <b>herkogamy.</b> Reverse <b>herkogamy</b> and the non-herkogamic condition homostyly were derived from heterostyly. Distylous species possessed pendent, slightly zygomorphic flowers, and the single transition to reverse <b>herkogamy</b> was associated with the hawkmoth pollination syndrome. Reductions in flower size characterized three of four independent transitions from reciprocal <b>herkogamy</b> to homostyly. Conclusions The results support Lloyd and Webb's model in which distyly originated from an ancestor with approach <b>herkogamy.</b> They also demonstrate the lability of sex organ deployment and implicate pollinators, or their absence, as playing an important role in driving transitions among herkogamic and non-herkogamic condition...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{separation}} {{of male and}} female reproductive structures (<b>herkogamy)</b> is a widespread floral trait that has traditionally been viewed as an adaptation that reduces the likelihood of self-pollination. Here we propose that increased herkoga- my may also influence another important aspect of plant mating: the diversity of pollen donors siring seeds within fruits. We test this hypothesis in Narcissus longi- spathus, a wild daffodil species with extensive variation in anther–stigma separa- tion. To study the morphological basis of variation in <b>herkogamy,</b> floral measurements were undertaken in 16 populations of N. longispathus. We then quantified multilocus outcrossing rates and the correlation of outcrossed paternity in three of these populations sampled over several years. Mating system estimates were calculated for each population and year, and also separately for groups of plants that differed markedly in <b>herkogamy</b> within each population and year. In N. longispathus <b>herkogamy</b> was much more variable than other floral traits, and was more closely related to style length than to anther position. Averaged across populations and years, plants with high <b>herkogamy</b> had similar outcrossing rates (0. 683) to plants with intermediate (0. 648) or low <b>herkogamy</b> (0. 590). However, a significant linear trend was found for correlation of outcrossed paternity, which increased monotonically from high <b>herkogamy</b> (0. 221), through intermediate herk- ogamy (0. 303) to low <b>herkogamy</b> (0. 463) plants. The diversity of pollen donors sir- ing seeds of high <b>herkogamy</b> Narcissus flowers was thus consistently greater than the diversity of pollen donors siring seeds of low <b>herkogamy</b> flowers.

40|$|Mixed mating {{systems in}} plants occur when both out {{crossing}} and self-fertilization {{occur in the}} same population. Costs of inbreeding and benefits of insuring reproduction for example in absence of pollinator are expected to maintain mixed-mating system.

On the other hand, inbreeding depression can be lowered by repeatedly exposing deleterious genes to selection via repeated events of inbreeding, a mechanism referred to as purging. In this study, I tested whether auto-fertilization rate was negatively correlated with the level of <b>herkogamy</b> and whether populations with a low level of <b>herkogamy</b> (sASD) showed lower level of inbreeding depression due to higher opportunity for purging. I analyzed the effect of different level of <b>herkogamy</b> on the auto fertilization rate between two populations of the Neotropical vine Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae).

We also found a considerable variation among populations in the relative position of stigmas and anthers and a significant effect of breeding system (facilitated autogamy, spontaneous autogamy or xenogamy) on fruit set and seed production.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISISelf-pollination {{mechanisms}} are often invoked to explain plant reproduction in environments devoid of pollinators. However, populations may evolve a diverse variety of strategies {{depending on the}} ecological context of pollination. In this study we examined the pollination environment, inbreeding depression, and <b>herkogamy</b> of Mimulus luteus (Phrymaceae) in two consecutive years {{in an attempt to}} evaluate {{the extent to which these}} factors determine the current level of autogamy in this population. Results indicate that pollinators were almost absent in the study site in 2005 and 2006. Likewise, no evidence of significant inbreeding depression for seed production and seed germination was detected in the 2 years. Because M. luteus presents hermaphrodite flowers with ‘movement herkogamy’ (touch-sensitive stigmata that close upon contact), and anther–stigma separation, we evaluated the role of these traits in self-fertilization. First, we assessed the effects of pollen source (self- and xenogamous pollen, and control solution) on stigmata dynamics after pollen deposition, and seed production. We observed that stigmata that received pollen (self- and xenogamous hand-pollinated) remained closed for a longer time than flowers that received no pollen (control flowers). Seed production, however, was unaffected by pollen source, indicating that movement <b>herkogamy</b> does not prevent self-fertilization in this population. Second, a phenotypic selection analysis revealed that seed production increased with a reduction of anther–stigma separation in absence of pollinators (bagged flowers), suggesting that low <b>herkogamy</b> levels are promoted in this population. Our results indicate that lack of inbreeding depression, ineffective movement <b>herkogamy,</b> and selection against anther–stigma separation are factors that may contribute to the prevalence of autogamous reproductive mechanisms when M. luteus faces environments with scarce mating opportunity.

40|$|International audienceFloral {{traits that}} reduce {{self-pollination}} in hermaphroditic plants have usually been interpreted as mechanisms that limit the genetic consequences of self-fertilization. However, {{the avoidance of}} sexual conflict between female and male function (self-interference) may also represent an important selection pressure {{for the evolution of}} floral traits, particularly in self-incompatible species. Here, we use experimental manipulations to investigate self-interference in Narcissus assoanus, a self-incompatible species with a stigma-height dimorphism in which the degree of spatial separation between sex organs (<b>herkogamy)</b> differs strikingly between the long- and short-styled morphs (hereafter L- and S-morphs). We predicted that weak <b>herkogamy</b> in the L-morph would cause greater self-pollination and hence self-interference. Experimental self-pollination reduced seed set when it occurred prior to, or simultaneously with, cross-pollination in the L-morph, but only if it occurred prior to cross-pollination in the S-morph. In the field, autonomous self-pollination was greater in the L-morph than the S-morph, but we found no evidence that self-interference reduced maternal or paternal fitness in either morph. One-day-old flowers of the L-morph have reduced stigma receptivity and hence exhibit protandry, whereas stigma receptivity and anther dehiscence are concurrent in the S-morph. This suggests that the two style morphs have alternative strategies for reducing self-interference: dichogamy in the L-morph and <b>herkogamy</b> in the S-morph. These results provide insight into the mechanisms that reduce sexual conflict in hermaphrodite plants and are of significance for understanding the evolution and maintenance of sexual polymorphisms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Evolution of <b>herkogamy</b> {{has been}} {{ascribed}} to preventing autonomous selfing within flowers, but this argument has received challenges {{due to the}} negative effects of sexual interference on reproductive success of plant species. We examined the effects of the two contrastingmodes of <b>herkogamy,</b> detailed by the different patterns of style movement, on the foraging time of pollinators on flowers, pollen removal, and deposition in two Chamerion species. Our results suggested that the duration of foraging time of bumblebees was generally higher in C. angustifolium (L.) Holub than in C. conspersum (Hausskn.) Holub during the male‐phase of flowers, but the reverse during the female‐ phase of flowers. As a result, stigma interfered with pollen removal more in C. conspersum than in C. angustifolium, based on examinations of pollen removal after one visit by a pollinator. However, this negative effect on total pollen removal was covered by the high pollinator diversity and the possible high visitation rate in the study sites. In contrast, we found that almost no difference existed in pollen deposition rate after one visit of a pollinator between the two Chamerion species, and emasculation did not increase the total pollen deposition in either species, indicating that anthers did not interfere with pollen deposition in the two Chamerion species. Our results suggested that, compared with C. conspersum, the derived mode of <b>herkogamy</b> in C. angustifolium reduced interference of stigmas in pollen removal. This might contribute to the wide distribution of C. angustifolium, to some degree, in environments of pollinator scarcity and low activity in newly colonized habitats...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, stamen {{movement}} {{is defined as}} the movement of stamens with their own energy, either automatically or stimulated by pollinator or other forces, except the forced movement of stamen under the pressure of pollinators. Four main types of stamen movements are classified: stimulated, simultaneous and slow, quick and explosive and cascade. Stimulated {{movement is}} normally caused by touching of visiting insects, which can enhance the contact probability of anther/pollen with pollinators or promote contact of anther with self pistil. Simultaneous and slow movement can alter the extent of <b>herkogamy</b> and modify reproductive patterns, and in some plants the stamen can move the anther directly to the self stigma to promote autogamy. Quick and explosive movement can release the pollen rapidly to the air or adhere to visiting insects to promote wind and/or insect dispersal of pollen grains. In cascade movement–in Ruta graveolens (Rutaceae), Tropaeolum majus (Tropaeolaceae), and plants of Loasaceae and Parnassiaceae – the stamens can move one by one and anthers dehisce individually when positioning at the center of flowers. The adaptive significances of cascade movement have not been studied, but, according to ‘pollen presentation theory’, cascade movement can alter the <b>herkogamy</b> and control the pace of pollen presentation and distribute pollen among pollinators by either packaging or dispensing mechanisms, which cangreatly enhance pollen removal efficiency. Furthermore, the interferences between stamens and pistil and among individual stamens can be decreased as a result of obvious <b>herkogamy</b> and spatial separation of each stamen caused by cascade movement. In Ruta graveolens, all the stamens move together to the center of flower after the cascade movement, this two-time, multiple-direction stamen movement probably is the most complex stamen movement presently known. Future emphasis in the field of stamen movement should include 1) the effects of stamen movement, especially the cascade movement, on sexual interference and interference among individual stamens, 2) the interaction of stamen movement with dichogamy (temporal separation of male and female funtion) and <b>herkogamy</b> (spatial separation of anthers and stigma), both of which can be modified by stamen movement and 3) the physiology and development of stamen movement...|$|E

However, empirical evidence showing that the mating system may promote reproductive isolation in co-occurring species is limited. The mechanisms by which the mating system can act as a reproductive isolation barrier are also largely unknown. Methods: Here we studied progeny arrays genotyped with microsatellites and patterns of stigma–anther separation (<b>herkogamy)</b> to understand the role of mating system shifts in promoting reproductive isolation between two hybridizing taxa with porous genomes, Pitcairnia albiflos and P. staminea (Bromeliaceae).

40|$|A morphometric {{study of}} 13 floral traits in hermaphrodites and females of Kosteletzkya virginica was {{conducted}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that sexual dimorphism in corolla size can be explained entirely by size of the androecium (vestigial in females), as predicted by the corolla-androecium developmental correlation hypothesis. Hermaphrodites of K. virginica significantly exceeded females in size for most corolla dimensions. Overall, size of the corolla thus appears to be primarily a stamen-correlated trait. These results are consistent with the corolla-androecium developmental correlation hypothesis that the androecium is an important regulatory organ for floral development and that one pleiotropic effect of male sterility in K. virginica has been a reduction in corolla size. However, style length and basal diameter of the stamen column did not conform to this pattern, indicating that these traits are more independent of androecium function than most dimensions of corolla size. <b>Herkogamy</b> in K. virginica was 3. 31 ± 0. 04 mm (n = 760), ranging from 0. 9 mm to 7. 4 mm. <b>Herkogamy</b> is highly variable within the naturalised population of K. virginica, and not correlated with all measured floral traits in hermaphrodites and females.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common trends in plant evolution, loss of {{self-incompatibility}} and ensuing increases in selfing, is generally assumed to be associated with a suite of phenotypic changes, notably a reduction of floral size, termed the selfing syndrome. We investigate whether floral morphological traits indeed decrease in a deterministic fashion after losses of self-incompatibility, as traditionally expected, using a phylogeny of 124 primrose species containing nine independent transitions from heterostyly (heteromorphic incompatibility) to homostyly (monomorphic self-compatibility), a classic system for evolution of selfing. We find similar overall variability of homostylous and heterostylous species, except for diminished <b>herkogamy</b> in homostyles. Bayesian mixed models demonstrate differences between homostylous and heterostylous species in all traits, but net effects across species are small (except <b>herkogamy)</b> and directionality differs among traits. Strongly drift-like evolutionary trajectories of corolla tube length and corolla diameter inferred by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models contrast with expected deterministic trajectories toward small floral size. Lineage-specific population genetic effects associated with evolution of selfing may explain that reductions of floral size represent one of several possible outcomes of floral evolution after loss of heterostyly in primroses. Contrary to the traditional paradigm, selfing syndromes may, but do not necessarily evolve in response to increased selfing...|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{transitions}} from outcrossing to selfing occur commonly in heterostylous genera. The morphological polymorphisms that characterize heterostyly {{provide opportunities for}} different pathways for selfing to evolve. Here, we investigate the origins and pathways by which selfing has evolved in tristylous Eichhornia paniculata by providing new evidence based on morphology, DNA sequences and genetic analysis. The primary pathway from outcrossing to selfing involves the stochastic loss of the short-styled morph (S-morph) from trimorphic populations, followed by the spread of selfing variants of the mid- styled morph (M-morph). However, the discovery of selfing variants of the long- styled morph (L-morph) in Central America indicates a secondary pathway and distinct origin for selfing. Comparisons of multi-locus nucleotide sequences from 27 populations sampled from throughout the geographical range suggest multiple transitions to selfing. Genetic analysis of selfing variants of the L- and M-morphs demonstrates recessive control {{of the loss of}} <b>herkogamy,</b> although the number of factors appears to differ between the forms. Early stages in the establishment of selfing involve developmental instability in the formation of flowers capable of autonomous self-pollination.

40|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{is assumed to}} be a central factor contributing to the stability of plant mating systems. Predicting the fitness consequence of inbreeding in natural populations is complicated, however, because it may be affected by the mating histories of populations generating variation in the amount of purging of deleterious alleles. Furthermore, the level of inbreeding depression may depend on environmental conditions and the intensity of pollen competition. In a greenhouse experiment comparing four populations of the neotropical vine Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae), we tested whether inbreeding depression for early-life fitness depended on the inferred mating history of each population, as indicated by genetically determined differences in <b>herkogamy</b> and autofertility rates. We also tested whether the intensity of pollen competition and the level of stress encountered by the seeds and seedlings affected the amount of inbreeding depression observed. <b>Herkogamy</b> was a good predictor of autofertility in each population. However, we found only limited evidence for inbreeding depression in any population, and inbreeding depression varied independently of the intensity of pollen competition and amount of stress encountered by the seeds and seedlings. Thus, the population's rate of autofertility did not predict the amount of inbreeding depression. Overall, we found no evidence supporting the expectations that more inbred populations experience less inbreeding depression, and that pollen competition reduces the cost of inbreeding. These results suggest that additional factors may be responsible for the maintenance of the mixed mating systems of D. scandens populations...|$|E

When available, phylogenetic hypotheses concerning the taxa studied can be merged with {{variation in}} their developmental patterns to identify possible evolutionary pathways by which new morphologies emerge (e.g., Guerrant [1982]; Hufford [1995]; Kellogg [1990]; Friedman and Carmichael [1998]; Cohen [2011]). With respect to <b>herkogamy</b> and one stably polymorphic form, distyly, understanding evolutionary change has been hampered by a need to track developmental change in floral development (Cohen et al. [2012]).|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} multivariate {{evolution}} on the floral phenotype assume that traits evolve independently one from each other, ignoring the modular structure {{that results from}} genetic correlations or developmental constraints. In this paper we describe the interdependence of nine floral traits in the herb Mimulus luteus var. luteus (Phrymaceae), {{as an attempt to}} characterize functional modules on which natural selection can potentially act upon. Using edge exclusion deviance analysis, we detected four modules: (a) an attractiveness module, (b) a stigma behavior module, (c) a stigma surface module, and (d) a <b>herkogamy</b> module. Consequences of these findings for future studies of natural selection in this species are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPlants with {{hermaphrodite}} flowers risk {{conflict between}} male and female sexual function due to close proximity of sexual organs. Heterostyly, a genetic floral polymorphism characterized mainly by reciprocal <b>herkogamy,</b> may reduce this sexual conflict by increasing the precision of pollen transfer between morphs. This sexual organ reciprocity is often associated with various ancillary characters and a heteromorphic incompatibility system. Here we describe the morphometrics associated with heterostyly and ancillary characters in Plumbago auriculata. Using controlled pollination experiments, we show that this species has a heteromorphic incompatibility system. We also document the fauna of long-proboscid fly and butterfly pollinators in a P. auriculata population in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{breeding}} system, floral morphology, morph frequency, biomass allocation to floral whorls, pollination {{and reproductive}} efficiency {{were examined in}} four distylous and three monomorphic Melochia species. Monomorphic species were self-compatible and distylous species were self-incompatible. Flowers of homomorphic species were longer than those of distylous species. <b>Herkogamy</b> was significantly higher in pin than in thrum morphs of the two distylous species, and monomorphic species exhibited the lowest values of <b>herkogamy.</b> Pollen/ovule ratios were similar between monomorphic and dimorphic species, irrespective of the self-incompatibility level. Biomass allocation to flowers was biased toward non-sexual struc-tures, attraction and support. Androecium biomass and androecium/gynoecium biomass ratio were larger in thrum than in pin flowers of distylous species indicating maleness in the thrum morph and femaleness in the pin morph. There was no clear difference between fruit set of monomorphic and dimorphic species; however, the greatest fruit set {{was found in the}} monomorphic species, M. pyramidata, which is a self-compatible species. Fruit set was significantly higher in pin than in thrum morphs in three out four distylous species and fecundity was only significantly higher in pin morphs of M. caracasana and M. parvifolia. Melochia species have generalist pollination systems. According to the taxonomic classes and number of pollinator species, M. caracasana and M. parvifolia have similar generalist pol-lination systems. Our comparative analyses of the charac-ters between floral morphs of distylous species and the relationship with these characters in monomorphic species allow divergences and similarities to be established and different evolutionary trends to be postulated in the breed-ing systems of Melochia species. Specifically, M. parvifolia and M. caracasana are apparently biased toward mono-morphy and dioecy, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from cross-fertilisation (outcrossing) to self-fertilisation (selfing) frequently coincides with changes towards a floral morphology that optimises self-pollination, the selfing syndrome. Population genetic {{studies have reported}} the existence of both outcrossing and selfing populations in Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae), which is an emerging model species for studying the molecular basis of perenniality and local adaptation. It is unknown whether its selfing populations have evolved a selfing syndrome. Using macro-photography, microscopy and automated cell counting, we compared floral syndromes (size, <b>herkogamy,</b> pollen and ovule numbers) between three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps and three selfing populations from the Western and Central Alps (Maritime Alps and Dolomites). In addition, we genotyped the plants for 12 microsatellite loci to confirm previous measures of diversity and inbreeding coefficients based on allozymes, and performed Bayesian clustering. Plants from the three selfing populations had markedly smaller flowers, less <b>herkogamy</b> and lower pollen production than plants from the three outcrossing populations, whereas pistil length and ovule number have remained constant. Compared to allozymes, microsatellite variation was higher, but revealed similar patterns of low diversity and high Fis in selfing populations. Bayesian clustering revealed two clusters. The first cluster contained the three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps, the second contained the three selfing populations from the Maritime Alps and Dolomites. We conclude that in comparison to three outcrossing populations, three populations with high selfing rates are characterised by a flower morphology that {{is closer to the}} selfing syndrome. The presence of outcrossing and selfing floral syndromes within a single species will facilitate unravelling the genetic basis of the selfing syndrome, and addressing which selective forces drive its evolution...|$|E
