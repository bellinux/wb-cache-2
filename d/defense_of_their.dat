5|$|Maximilian of Habsburg, who {{had also}} laid claim to Hungary after Matthias Corvinus's death, invaded Hungary in November. He {{borrowed}} 30,000 gold florins from the wealthy Ernuszt and offered the Archbishopric of Salzburg to him. Ernuszt entered into negotiations with Reinprecht von Reichenburg, the commanders of Maximilian's army in Hungary, but refrained from providing military assistance to him against Vladislaus' troops. Instead, he stayed at Pécs and Đurđevac and came to an agreement with Ladislaus Egervári, Ban of Croatia, over the mutual <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> estates.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{started the}} <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> title in 1954 with an opening day {{loss to the}} Washington Senators in the {{presence}} of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Even though the Yankees won 103 games, the most regular season victories they would have under Stengel, they lost by 8 games to the Indians, managed by Stengel's old friend Al Lopez. In spite of the defeat, Stengel was given a new two-year contract at $75,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{abortive}} {{attack on}} Montreal {{led to the}} full mobilization of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.|$|E

60|$|The Sabines, {{on their}} part, could not accede to these proposals. Being, however, still {{reluctant}} to commence hostilities, they continued the negotiations--though while engaged in them {{they seemed to}} anticipate an unfavorable issue, for they were occupied {{all the time in}} organizing troops, strengthening the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> villages and towns, and making other vigorous preparations for war.|$|R
5|$|As the {{convention}} began, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, the floor {{leader for the}} Grant forces (known as the Stalwart faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from {{the convention}}. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> right to reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more than ever {{that he was the}} only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions {{along with}} the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna. News of a {{breakthrough}} at Dobro Pole prompted the defenders of Doiran to abandon their positions and rush to the <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> homeland, {{in order to prevent}} a future occupation by the Entente. On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached Krivolak, thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania. The 2nd Bulgarian Army headed towards the Kosturino Pass avoiding direct engagement with the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The Old School faction was {{convinced}} that the Plan of Union with the Congregational churches had undermined Presbyterian doctrine and order. At the 1837 General Assembly, the Old School majority successfully passed resolutions removing all judicatories found under the Plan from the Presbyterian Church. In total, three synods in New York and one synod in Ohio along with 28 presbyteries, 509 ministers, and 60 thousand church members (one-fifth of the PCUSA's membership) were excluded from the church. New School leaders reacted by meeting in Auburn, New York, and issuing the Auburn Declaration, a 16-point <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Calvinist orthodoxy.|$|E
50|$|Parasitoid wasps face a {{range of}} {{obstacles}} to oviposition, including behavioral, morphological, physiological or immunological <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hosts. An example <b>of</b> immunological <b>defense</b> against endoparasitic wasps would be the encapsulation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> eggs. To thwart this immunological protection system, some wasps inundate their host with their eggs so as to overload the encapsulation response. Another way of hindering a host's defense is to introduce a virus which interferes with the immune system.|$|R
50|$|Michod et al. have {{reviewed}} {{evidence that}} RecA-mediated transformation is an adaptation for homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage in B. subtilis, {{as well as}} in several other bacterial species (i.e. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans and Helicobacter pylori). In the case of the pathogenic species that infect humans, it was proposed that RecA-mediated repair of DNA damages may be of substantial benefit when these bacteria are challenged by the oxidative <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> host.|$|R

The third, fourth, {{and fifth}} (Lev. xxvi. 40, Numb. v. 7, Nehem. i. 6) refer all to {{national}} humiliation for definite idolatry, accompanied with an entire abandonment of that idolatry, and of idolatrous persons. How soon that form of confession {{is likely to}} find a place in the English congregations the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> main idol, mammon, in the vilest and cruelest shape of it--usury--with which this book has been defiled, show very sufficiently.|$|R
5|$|Andrew II of Hungary was {{extremely}} favorably disposed towards the Templars. During {{his participation in}} the Fifth Crusade, he appointed Pontius de Cruce, Master of the Order in the Hungarian Kingdom, as a regent in Croatia and Dalmatia. After his return in 1219, {{in recognition of the}} great logistical and financial support which the Order had given him during the campaign, he granted the Order the estate of Gacka. Even before his departure from the city of Split in 1217, he had made over to the Templars the castle of Klis (Clissa), a strategic point in the hinterland of Split (Spalato), which controlled the approaches to the town. The king Andrew was reluctant to entrust the castle of Klis to any of the local magnates, knowing what great harm could come from that castle. It was the king's will that Split receive the castle of Klis for the <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> city. The city of Split showed little interest in the royal favors, so the king entrusted Klis into Templars hands. Shortly after this, the Templars lost Klis, and, in exchange, the king gave them the coastal town of Šibenik (Sebenico).|$|E
5|$|Nest mate {{recognition}} is widespread in many eusocial insects. However, {{when there are}} no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials, many can no longer discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics. Recently, however, it has been indicated that many insects have the ability to discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non-relative counterpart. Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus, former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring. Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives. In Polistes exclamans, it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non-relatives, even having lived in identical environments, is possible. This was found by Allen, Schulze Kellman, and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments. As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased, the more clumps were formed in the box. This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from nonrelative, an adaptive ability in the <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nest.|$|E
5|$|The Crimson Tide {{began their}} <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> 2010 BCS {{championship}} {{at home against}} the San Jose State Spartans, and before a record crowd in a newly expanded Bryant–Denny Stadium, Alabama was victorious 48–3. Alabama scored a touchdown on their first possession on a one-yard Trent Richardson run to complete an eight-play, 71-yard drive. The Spartans responded on the next drive with their only points of the game on a 31-yard Harrison Waid field goal to make the score 7–3. On the ensuing drive the Alabama extended their lead to 14–3 with a 48-yard Greg McElroy touchdown pass to Marquis Maze. Alabama again reached the endzone {{early in the second}} quarter on a 39-yard Richardson run and a 29-yard AJ McCarron pass to Julio Jones to make the score 28–3. Cade Foster scored the final points of the half as time expired on a 31-yard field goal to bring the halftime score to 31–3.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has driven}} the origination and diversification of the toxins {{to counter the}} <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> prey. Once toxins have been recruited into the venom proteome, they form large, multigene families and evolve via the birth-and-death model of protein evolution, {{which leads to a}} diversification of toxins that allows the ambush predators the ability to attack a wide range of prey. The rapid evolution and diversification is thought {{to be the result of}} a predator-prey evolutionary arms race, where both are adapting to counter the other.|$|R

50|$|Cryptococcus neoformans and Ustilago maydis are {{examples}} of pathogenic basidiomycota. Such pathogens {{must be able to}} overcome the oxidative <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> respective hosts in order to produce a successful infection. The ability to undergo meiosis may provide a survival benefit for these fungi by promoting successful infection. A characteristic central feature of meiosis is recombination between homologous chromosomes. This process is associated with repair of DNA damages, particularly double-strand breaks. The ability of C. neoformans and U. maydis to undergo meiosis may contribute to their virulence by removing the oxidative DNA damages caused by <b>their</b> host’s release <b>of</b> reactive oxygen species.|$|R

40|$|Summary: Like for all microbes, {{the goal}} of every {{pathogen}} is to survive and replicate. However, to overcome the formidable <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hosts, pathogens are also endowed with traits commonly associated with virulence, such as surface attachment, cell or tissue invasion, and transmission. Numerous pathogens couple their specific virulence pathways with more general adaptations, like stress resistance, by integrating dedicated regulators with global signaling networks. In particular, many of nature's most dreaded bacteria rely on nucleotide alarmones to cue metabolic disturbances and coordinate survival and virulence programs. Here we discuss how components of the stringent response contribute to the virulence {{of a wide variety}} of pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
