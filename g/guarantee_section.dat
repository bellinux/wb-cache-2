40|$|In {{the long}} run, {{programs}} should be written from the start with verification in mind. Programs written {{in such a way}} are likely to be much easier to verify. They will avoid hard-to-verify features, may have better designs, will be accompanied by full formal specifications, and may be annotated with verification information. However, even if {{programs should be}} written this way, not all of them will. In the short run, it is crucial to verify the legacy programs that make up our existing computing infrastructure, and to provide tools that assist programmers in performing verification tasks and — equally importantly — in shifting their mindset to one of program verification. I propose approaches to verification that may assist in reaching these goals. The key idea underlying the approaches is specification inference (Section 1). This is a machine learning technique that produces, from an existing program, a (likely) specification of that program. Specifications are very frequently missing from real-world programs, but are required for verification. The inferred specification can serve as a goal for verification. I discuss three different approaches that can use such inferred specifications. One uses a heavyweight proof assistant (Section 2), one uses an automated theorem prover (Section 3, and one requires no user interaction but provides no <b>guarantee</b> (<b>Section</b> 4). 1 Inference of likely specification...|$|E
40|$|Background: In July 2004, the Commission {{presented}} a new {{proposal for a}} Council Regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) for the programming period 2007 – 2013 which has been agreed upon in June 2005 (European Commission 2005 a, Council of the European Union 2005 a and 2005 b). The explanatory memorandum of the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) presented by the European Commission mentions that {{after a period of}} reforms of the First Pillar of the CAP, now focus will be led on the reform of rural development policy. However, this does not mean a paradigm shift but rather a consolidation and administrative simplification making rural development policy more efficient and coherent (Wehrheim 2005). Compared to current Council Regulation (EC) 1257 / 1999, the new RDP considers in Article 6 to strengthen the partnership approach through close consultation of competent regional, local and other public authorities as well as Non-governmental organisations and private bodies representing civil society (European Commission 2004 b). The regulation seeks dovetailing policies of first and second pillar: e. g. through modulation. On the other side, EU rural development policy should move towards a more strategic approach, reinforcing it and simplifying its implementation (European Commission, 2004 a). To ensure the sustainable development of rural areas, the new RDP focuses on a limited number of core priority objectives relating to agriculture and forestry (European Commission, 2004 b) : 1. improving the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry by means of support for restructuring, development and innovation 2. improving the environment and the countryside by means of support for land management 3. improving {{the quality of life in}} rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity: Each of these core objectives relates to one thematic axis for which each a range of measures are proposed: Axis 1 : Improving the competitiveness of the agriculture and forestry sector Axis 2 : Improving the environment and the countryside Axis 3 : The quality of life in rural areas and diversification of the rural economy In addition a fourth overarching axis is introduced which relates to all three objectives: Axis 4 : “LEADER” Axis While so far the 2 nd Pillar of the CAP was funded by two different financial sources (EAGGF Guidance and <b>Guarantee</b> <b>section),</b> the new regulation envisages the creation of only one new fund for Pillar 2 : The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Thus, current differences of Guidance and <b>Guarantee</b> <b>section</b> as concerns programming, administration and monitoring will be dispensed, which might lead to a significant ease of administrative tasks (Grajewski 2004). The resources available for the period 2007 to 2013 amount according to Article 70 of the Council proposal to 88, 75 billion Euro at constant 2004 prices (European Council, 2005). The minimum EU fund contribution at axis level shall be 20...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Each year the federal government funds numerous affordable housing and community and economic development initiatives through an array of programs, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Section 108 Loan <b>Guarantee</b> (<b>Section</b> 108) program. Yet, the need for federal money to fund these initiatives has continued to grow, while the federal budget increasingly has been strained by other competing funding priorities. To help finance their initiatives and achieve program goals, recipients of funding under these federal programs often have combined or "leveraged" their funds with other federal, state, local, and private sector resources. While leveraging is generally recognized favorably by public and private sector officials, its use in federal programs has not been widely analyzed. This report responds, in part, to Congress's request that we examine leveraging {{as it relates to}} federal housing, community, and economic development programs. Specifically, this interim report (1) examines the perspectives of stakeholders [...] government and industry officials, academics, and others with knowledge of or experience with leveraging [...] on the use, implications, and measurement of leveraging in housing and community and economic development programs and (2) describes the type of data HUD collects {{that could be used to}} determine the extent of leveraging in the Section 108 program. Additionally, enclosure II describes how federal funds may have been or could be leveraged in the Section 108 program. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{administration}} of the relevant part of EAGGF Guarantee expenditure, which {{accounts for more than}} 50 % of the budget of the European Communities follows shared management arrangements. Shared management means that member states pay and control the expenditure for agricultural and rural development subsidies and the Commission is responsible for the {{administration of}} payments and for auditing the control system of member states. The communication on the expenditure effected by accredited paying agencies takes place via a comprehensive financial reporting system and monthly EAGGF Committee meetings. These meetings provide scope for the reconciliation of any disagreement concerning the monthly advances reimbursed by the Commission to member states and also give an overview on actual budget implementation. The new member states which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 have started to apply the comprehensive financial reporting system following an intensive cooperation period in the form of training seminars provided to them by the Commission for setting up the reporting systems of paying agencies. The first expenditure from the EAGGF <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Section</b> was executed in July 2004 and reported to the Commission during the following month. The pioneer new member states were the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, followed by Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia a month later. Until the end of August approximately 6 million Euros have been withdrawn from the Fund, used in a fifty-fifty percent split for export restitutions for milk and milk products, beef and veal, live animals and eggs to countries outside the European Union and for other market intervention measures, such as supply of food from intervention stocks for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community, production refunds on sugar used in the chemical industry, aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and school milk. By the end of the 2004 financial year (15 October 2004) some other new member states, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus also intend to start paying agricultural subsidies to their beneficiaries. The total estimated value of expenditure to be withdrawn from EAGGF Guarantee by the new member states in the 2004 financial year and charged therefore to the 2004 budget is circa an additional 14 million Euros. Therefore, the aggregated amount of the subsidy withdrawn by the EU- 10 countries charged to the 2004 budget will be ca. 20 million Euros, which is a minor amount compared to the budget appropriations included in the 2004 budget for EAGGF Guarantee as a whole. A speeding up of subsidy withdrawals is necessary for new member states to make the best use of benefit from CAP. It is possible to achieve this goal by the withdrawal of subsidies for direct aids. Direct aids can be paid to farmers in the framework of the Single Area Payment Scheme from {{the first day of the}} 2005 financial year (16 October 2004) in case of new member states (except Malta and Slovenia). The advances to member states will be reimbursed in January 2005 and charged therefore to the 2005 budget. As it was the case for earlier enlargements of the European Union, the first months of subsidy withdrawals are being used mainly to get acquainted with the administration and to test the operation of the paying agency systems. However, this period should be considered strictly as an interim phase and significant effort should be made by the national agricultural administrations to widen the â€œpenetrabilityâ€ of the subsidy handling, that is to increase the amount of subsidy withdrawn from the EU by the paying agency systems already operating in the new member states to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. withdrawn from the EU Funds, target branches, paying agency systems, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E
