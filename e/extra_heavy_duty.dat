2500|$|The 1972 Charger {{introduced}} a new [...] "Rallye" [...] option to replace the R/T version. The SE was differentiated from other 1972 Chargers by a unique formal roof treatment and hidden headlights. The 383 engine was replaced with a lower compression 4-barrel 400, while the 440 engine was still available, with lowered compression and downrated to net [...] instead of the previous [...] gross. The ratings went down as the net horsepower measure was more realistic. Also beginning in 1972, all engines featured hardened valve seats to {{permit the use of}} regular leaded or unleaded gasoline rather than leaded premium fuel as in past years due to tighter emissions regulations. Though the 440+6 (designating a triple 2-barrel carb setup and [...] was listed in the early 1972 sales literature, it was found in the August 1971 testing that this engine would not meet the new and more stringent 1972 emissions laws, although some early Dodge literature (August 1971 press) stated that this engine was available for 1972, and a few (six is the accepted number) factory installed six-pack Chargers were built, the engine was dropped out of production by September 1971. [...] The optional Pistol-Grip 4-speed Hurst manual shifter could be coupled to the 340, 400, and 440 Magnum engines. The Ramcharger hood scoop was discontinued, as well as optional lower geared performance rear axle ratios and <b>extra</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> suspensions. It was also the final year for the Dana 60 differential, and was available only in combination with the 440/4 speed, heavy duty suspension, and the 3.54:1 rear axle ratio.|$|E

For all 4x4 models, the 2-speed transfer case 4x4-LOW range has a gear reduction of 2.72:1. Brazilian and Venezuelan versions had only the ESOF transfer case.|$|R

40|$|The Indiana House Enrolled Act 1481 (HEA- 1481) {{requires}} that the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) adopt final rules by December 31, 2014, for the issuance, fee structure and enforcement of permits for overweight divisible loads, fee structure of permits for loads on <b>extra</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> highways, and fee structure of permits for overweight loads. On December 26, 2013, INDOT adopted the Emergency Rules regarding these items, as required by HEA- 1481, effective January 1, 2014. HEA- 1481 requires INDOT to use {{the results of this}} impact study to inform the setting of final rules. Three different fee structures were considered: Pre-HEA- 1481 fee structures were in place prior to HEA- 1481; Interim Policy fee structures were in place between June 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013; these were superseded by Emergency Rules which took effect January 1, 2014. INDOT commissioned this study to evaluate the impacts of overweight divisible load permits on revenue, asset consumption, alternative transportation modes, Indiana’s economic development, and economic competitiveness relative to other Midwestern states. The results of the analysis indicate that overall, the overweight commodities divisible permit structure arising from HEA- 1481 is not expected to change dramatically the consumption of pavement and bridge assets, lead to a slight increase in the revenue collected per permit and a slight decrease in the gap between consumption and revenue. However, the gap between revenue and consumption is still significant. From an operations standpoint, it was estimated that HEA- 141 will lead to a net decrease in safety but a net increase in mobility of the traffic stream, due to the twin but opposing effects of traffic impairment and trip substitution associated with overweight vehicle operations. Also, HEA- 1481 is expected to lead to little or no shift in the modal share across truck and rail, but significant shift in the specific configurations of vehicles used in trucking operations. The Act is expected to increase the economic competitiveness of trucking operations Indiana, compared to the pre-HEA 1481 situation. Finally, the Act is expected to increase economic development at least in the long term by reducing the cost of transportation, an essential expenditure item of most major businesses in Indiana. Overall, HEA- 1481 is expected to protect the highway bridge and pavement infrastructure by providing incentives for less-damaging loading behavior, reduce the gap between revenue and consumption, generally have slightly adverse net impacts on safety and slightly beneficial impacts of mobility, increase the economic competitiveness of trucking operations relative to other states, and provide grounds for increased economic development...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> (voiced by Keith Ferguson) - Corporal Hershel Dalton is the estranged {{cousin of}} Roadblock.

[...] It's revealed that <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> doesn't like Roadblock because of something that went wrong in the past. That's why <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> moved away from his hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi and moved away {{to go to college}} and later live in Idaho. While on the hunt for his cousin, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> manages to ambush Roadblock after their grandfather's remembrance (Captain Jefferson Hinton, who served as a pilot in the Tuskegee Airmen and considered an honored son of Biloxi). Then the two are ambushed by Major Bludd and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> handcuffs himself to Roadblock. He drags Roadblock into his vehicle which leads them into a car chase until Major Bludd blows up the bridge. Due to Major Bludd firing his laser onto the car as it was sinking, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> loses the keys to his handcuffs. But manages to pull himself and Roadblock out of the river, however they end up in the swamp while evading alligators. Luckily, Roadblock was able to fight off the alligator by wrestling it much to the surprise of <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty.</b> Major Bludd then attacks them in a swamp boat as Roadblock saves <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> from a large snake. After a brief fight, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> try to break the handcuffs as Major Bludd arrives and captures them. While Major Bludd prepares a trap for the others, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> work to get out of the handcuffs.

40|$|AbstractOverweight {{goods are}} kind of special goods and must be loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars when transported by railway. However, this sort of car is not taken {{consideration}} when the track structure is designed. In order to have knowledge regarding {{the action of the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars on the track structure and correctly organize the transportation of the overweight goods, the strength of track was studied with the action of the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars according to the basic theory of static mechanical calculation. Taking the D 2 car as an example of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and selecting the traditional track of railway, the finite element calculation model of track was established. With the software ANSYS, the forces and deformations of track structure were calculated under several parameters and conditions of different load position, spring rigidity coefficient and rail type. Then, the D 32, D 38 type of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and several common locomotives were selected and the forces and deformations with these loads were calculated and compared. The results show that the static extrema of forces and deformations of track structure have different laws under different parameters and conditions. The <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars loaded overweight goods generally make the track structure engender greater forces and deformations than those common locomotives do, and the D 2 car is of all the most adverse to the track. This indicates that <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars probably bring the bad effect to the lines. Therefore, when transporting overweight goods loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars, adaptable measures and correct transport scheme are to be taken to decrease the damage to the lines...|$|R
