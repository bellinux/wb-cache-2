5000|$|An {{interesting}} aspect {{was the use}} of {{what was}} called an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Palette</b> graphics system (created by CBS and Ampex) for a painting-like aspect to several visual graphics; such as the game intro, starting lineups and bumpers going into or coming out of a commercial break. CBS would also unveil what was known as the [...] "Action Track"; showing the trail of a football that had been kicked during replays. Also, when the planned lead-in, the Phoenix Open golf tournament was halted due to poor weather, CBS Sports president Robert Wussler (in New York) and producer Barry Frank (at the Superdome) ended up filling the time period with an impromptu look at how the game would be produced.|$|E
50|$|In May 2011 {{the band}} {{released}} I Was Here for a Moment, Then I Was Gone, their third full-length record. According to press releases, the band approached the record {{as if it}} were their first album - ignoring any criticism of their previous work, be it positive or negative, and distancing themselves from any expectation of what they might produce. Produced by Jamie Ward the record was the first to be recorded in traditional studio spaces and consequently is more polished than any previous recordings. Live strings and brass were provided by members of Her Name Is Calla and Fight Fire With Water, adding more organic sounds to the bands <b>electronic</b> <b>palette.</b> The album received universally positive reviews from the music press, was played in its entirety twice on Kerrang Radio and gained Maybeshewill Rock Sounds Band of the Week accolade two weeks running.|$|E
5000|$|Spin Andrew Unterberger {{praised the}} album, stating: [...] "By {{giving us the}} best album of his career, and {{subsequently}} re-ascending to Top 40's mountaintop, Bieber's answered his own question: In pop music, it's {{never too late to}} say you’re sorry." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator agreed, claiming that the album [...] "is no doubt Justin's best collective LP thus far and shows that he is finally confident in revealing his true artistry. And that is nothing to be sorry about, so keep your needy apologies to yourselves." [...] Patrick Ryan of USA Today praised the [...] "collaborative muscle and confidence" [...] on the album, noting that they show [...] "an artist who is completely unafraid to reinvent himself and create the very definition of a comeback album ... With Purpose, he proves himself as one of today's most forward-thinking pop stars, and because of that, we're newly converted Beliebers." [...] Al Horner of NME magazine gave the album three out of five stars commenting that Purpose [...] "is certainly a start at reinvention" [...] and that [...] "plenty of good choices have been made here." [...] In her review for The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan noted that [...] "the musical direction owes much to co-producer Skrillex, whose unexpectedly subtle <b>electronic</b> <b>palette</b> complements Bieber's affectedly breathy voice," [...] arguing that [...] "the voice soon palls, but the songs are often interesting." [...] While analysing Bieber's Purpose and One Direction's Made in the A.M., Jon Caramanica of The New York Times argued that [...] "even though Mr. Bieber is younger than all of the men of One Direction, he sounds exponentially more experienced, and exponentially more fatigued on Purpose," [...] complimenting the album for showing that it proves that Bieber is [...] "the best singer of the bunch, and the one with a clear vision for his sound, even if he's being largely denied it here." [...] For The National, the album [...] "functions as a coming of age album in the worst way: learn how to emotionally abuse women, and then you’ll be a man," [...] adding [...] "Bieber's strategy is a Janus-faced one. He simultaneously apologises for and doubles down on his dislikeability - but cunningly, now manifests the latter in more socially acceptable ways." ...|$|E
40|$|The General Studies Program at New York University (NYU), an {{interdisciplinary}} two-year liberal arts program, seeks a Level II Start-up grant {{to finish a}} prototype and begin implementation of Simonides, a hybrid tool that combines the collaborative capabilities of blogs and wikis with the repository features of an e-portfolio. This tool will provide students with a flexible <b>electronic</b> <b>palette</b> for storing and annotating digital humanities materials from their coursework, {{as well as for}} building and sharing their own multimedia documents created with these materials. The Simonides project will re-center instructional technology on the educational experience of the individual student, making the way a student understands the connections between his or her work in the humanities the pedagogical focus. The result will be an instrument of dynamic learning that will embody the spirit of our liberal arts program: to give students a personal stake in the cultural traditions investigated by our curriculum...|$|E
40|$|Meeting {{capture and}} support is an {{important}} research field in ubiquitous computing and human computer interaction. We have a built a note-taking application, which lets meeting facilitators and note takers organize the material they place on an <b>electronic</b> <b>palette.</b> This application stores all transactions, so that the note-taking process can be played back in real time along with the captured audio and video. Eventually, this captured note organization {{can be used for}} topic searches and information extraction. We have also built a browsing program to let users find meetings based on properties like time and location. This program can also create meetings which go into the same data space. The data space lets agents representing a meeting automatically find capture hardware to capture and index meetings without user intervention. The data space is enabled by a highly scalable distributed, object-oriented, semantic database. by Harold Fox. Thesis (S. M.)
