40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use enzyme interesterification to produce two hard stocks which were based on hard stocks used in the manufacture of margarine and pastry fats. Both of these two hard stocks produced need to be fast crystallizers; one with a low melting point for spreadable margarine whiles the other with a higher melting point for pastry fats. Commercial hard stocks were provided by Bakels Edible oil (BEO) Ltd. The study was divided into three stages. In the first stage, three commercial lipase enzymes supplied by Novozymes, including Novozyme 435, Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme TL IM, were used to interesterify tallow stearin, palm stearin and fully <b>hardened</b> coconut <b>oil</b> mixed in different ratios. The most promising fat blend with the lipase enzyme was selected for optimisation trials in stage two of the study. In stage two, the amount of lipase enzyme was investigated along with the time required to process these fats in order to optimise the interesterification method as both enzymes and production time are cost factors associated with the successful application of this hard stock. The commercial lipase enzymes are the key to the interesterification process and are expensive hence in stage three of this study, the reusability of the enzymes was looked into in order to determine the maximum number of uses that can take place for one dose of enzyme during batch processing. The resulting interesterified fats at the end of each stage were tested for physical properties such as melting point, solid fat content, rate of crystallization, and change in specific heat during crystallization and chemical composition of triglyceride content. The best result for spreadable margarine was a blend of palm stearin and fully <b>hardened</b> coconut <b>oil</b> at 50 %: 50 % and interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme TL IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C. The best processing method for pastry margarine was blend of tallow stearin and fully <b>hardened</b> coconut <b>oil</b> at 70 %: 30 % interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme RM IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C. Both of these interesterified hardstocks were also fast crystallisers as determined using differential scanning colorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance instrumentation.

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of dietary {{fats and oils}} from 14 European countries was analyzed with particular emphasis on isomerictransfatty acids. The proportion oftransfatty acids in typical soft margarines and low-fat spreads ranged between 0. 1 and 17 % of total fatty acids and that ofcis-unsaturated fatty acids between 55 and 81 %. Hard household margarines and industrial fats for cooking and baking (shortenings) had slightly higher proportions oftransfatty acids and highest amounts, up to 50 %, were found in fats for deep frying. Vegetable oils contained only small amounts oftransfatty acids, usually less than 1 %. Isomers of C 18 : 1 comprised up to 94 % of thetransfatty acids in <b>hardened</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> and 52 - 68 % in butter, whereas <b>hardened</b> fish <b>oils</b> showed a more even distribution oftransmonoenoic fatty acids between C 16 : 1 and C 22 : 1, and C 18 : 1 isomers contributed by 28 - 42 % to totaltransfatty acids.

50|$|Cactus juice can {{increase}} plaster's workability {{and its ability}} to be formed into the desired shape. Workability depends on the water content, the shape and size distribution of its aggregate (such as rock, sand, natural fiber, etc.), the age of the plaster, and the amount of other natural binder(s) (such as lime, wheatpaste, cactus juice, <b>hardening</b> vegetable <b>oil,</b> casein and other proteins, etc.) Altering the water content, changing the aggregate mix, soaking the clay, or changing the binders will increase or decrease the plaster's workability. Excessive water will lead to increased bleeding (surface water) and/or segregation of aggregates (when the natural binder and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting plaster having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low workability, which cannot be readily made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water or binder.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of synthetic immersion oils in the 1940s, cedar tree oil was widely used. Cedar oil has an index of refraction of approximately 1.516. The numerical aperture of cedar tree oil objectives is generally around 1.3. Cedar oil {{has a number of}} disadvantages however: it absorbs blue and ultraviolet light, yellows with age, has sufficient acidity to potentially damage objectives with repeated use (by attacking the cement used to join lenses), and diluting it with solvent changes its viscosity (and refraction index and dispersion). Cedar oil must be removed from the objective immediately after use before it can harden, since removing <b>hardened</b> cedar <b>oil</b> can damage the lens. In modern microscopy synthetic immersion oils are more commonly used, as they eliminate most of these problems. NA values of 1.6 can be achieved with different oils. Unlike natural oils synthetic ones do not harden on the lens and can typically be left on the objective for months at a time.|$|R
