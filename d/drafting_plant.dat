40|$|The Plant Breeder’s Right (PBR), {{also known}} as Plant Variety Protection (PVP), {{is a form of}} {{intellectual}} property afforded to breeders of newly bred plant varieties. In South Africa, intellectual protection of new plant varieties is afforded through the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act, 1976 (Act No. 15 of 1976) as amended in 1996. The writer has been Registrar: Plant Breeders’ Rights since November 2007. Over the years the writer has interacted with several stakeholders with interest in plant breeders’ rights, including breeders, farmers, patent attorneys, growers, plant breeders’ rights administrators from other countries and civil society organisations. Although South Africa has had Plant Breeders’ Rights legislation since 1976, it has been observed that this piece of legislation is relatively unknown and often misunderstood even by the users of the system. In engagements with various stakeholders, it has been established that there are conflicting views amongst the stakeholders on pertinent issues related to the plant breeders’ rights system. There are views, among others, include: that the plant breeders’ rights system is only relevant and benefits breeders from big multinational companies such as Monsanto and farmers can never benefit in such a system; that the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act is synonymous with genetically modified organisms; that indigenous plants are neglected, and that the system only promotes protection of foreign varieties. The most contentious issue is however around the impact of plant breeders’ rights on the tradition of farmers to save, sell and exchange seed. Very little is documented on the South Africa plant breeders’ rights system, more so from the administrator’s perspective. This study explored some aspects of the plant breeders’ rights system that may need policy interventions and legislation amendments, such as matters around the plant breeders’ rights system in relation to farmers’ rights, possible dual protection of Genetically Modified varieties in terms of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1976 and the Patents Act 1978, as well as the participation of indigenous ornamental crops in the plant breeders’ rights system. On the issue of the farmers’ rights: results of this work show that the current provision in the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act deals with Farmers’ Rights in a narrow sense, i. e. with the rights of farmers to save seed. It was established that this provision is inadequate for both the breeders and the farmers. A survey was also conducted among smallholder farmers from four provinces, namely Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo, and Western Cape. The interesting finding was that although there is so much debate around the impact of the plant breeders’ rights system on farmers’ rights, the majority of the farmers from this study group have never heard of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act. There are farmers who are continuing with the practice of seed saving; however some farmers have indicated that they do not save seed they believe that this practice lowers yield. Those who do save seed mostly save their traditional seed, i. e. locally adapted seed lacking formal crop improvement as opposed to modern commercial seed. Some farmers have indicated that they do develop varieties through their own selections and believe that their varieties could qualify for protection in terms of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act. It is evident that both government and the civil society organisations need to do more to educate smallholder farmers about laws and policies that impact their livelihood. Based on this study, a proposal was made to have the farmers’ privilege provisions in the current Plant Breeders’ Right Act amended to allow the Minister responsible for Agriculture to prescribe among others: the crops in which this provision will apply; the category or categories of farmers that would benefit; the circumstances under which royalties should be paid. This proposal was welcomed by most stakeholders and has since been incorporated in the <b>draft</b> <b>Plant</b> Breeders’ Rights Bill. It is envisaged that specific details around these factors will be included in the Regulations to the Act after extensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders. There is a gap in policy and legislation with regard to the recognition of Farmers’ Rights as envisaged in the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). As such there are calls from some stakeholders including the civil society organisations that legislation on plant breeders’ rights must address these gaps and/or an alternative sui generis (of its own kind) system should be explored as the International Union for the Protection of New Plant Varieties (UPOV) system is not tailored for developing © University of Pretoria vii countries. In South Africa, legislation dealing with some aspects pertaining to Farmers’ Rights is spread over different government departments, e. g. Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries dealing with intellectual property protection only in as far as plant breeders’ rights; Department of Trade & Industry being custodians of intellectual property laws in South Africa and administrators of, among others the Patents Act; Department of Environmental Affairs dealing with Access and Benefit Sharing matters; Department of Science and Technology dealing with Indigenous Knowledge Systems and intellectual property protection emanating from publicly funded research institutions. More discussions are needed on South Africa becoming a member of the ITPGRFA as these will pave the way for further discussions and policy interventions addressing Farmers’ Rights in a broad sense. As far as the Genetically Modified Organisms are concerned, South Africa has approved only three Genetically Modified (GM) crops for commercialization in terms of the GMO Act, 1997, namely cotton, maize, and soybean. This is contrary to some statements made by members of the public that much more crops, including pumpkin, potato, banana and tomato are genetically modified. In terms of intellectual property protection, {{of the total number of}} GM varieties protected by plant breeders’ rights per crop: 60 % of varieties are GM for cotton, 61 % for yellow maize, 34 % for white maize and 63 % for soybean. Currently there are no GM events used in these crops protected in terms of the Patents Act 1978, which effectively means that there is currently no dual protection for these crops. Dual protection is however one of the most hotly debated issues because of the impact it might have on the rights of farmers to save seed. It has been argued that in South Africa dual protection is possible. Scrutiny of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1976, the Patents Act 1978 and the draft National Policy on Intellectual Property shows that all are silent on the issue of dual protection of plant varieties. The Departments of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries together with the Department of Trade and Industry need to initiate discussions around dual protection as well the use of Technology Agreements, between technology holders and technology users, in protecting GM varieties and the impact thereof for all role players in the value-chain in order to come up with the country position in this regard. This study showed that ornamental plants attract the highest number of plant breeders’ rights applications. Of the applications received between 2000 and 2010 about 20 % are of varieties developed from indigenous plants. Of plant breeders’ rights in ornamental plants, 84 % are owned by foreign entities. Of the 16 % owned by local entities, 12 % are privately owned and 4 % are owned by public research institutions. Some of the challenges facing this industry include the fact that there is inadequate turnover to allow for breeding programs and research initiatives; this is exacerbated by plant breeder’s rights infringements which lead to further revenue losses. Other challenges the industry face include high labor costs and lack of market information. The national Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries together with the other relevant departments, e. g. the Department of Labour and the Department of Trade and Industry need to engage more with the floricultural industry stakeholders to discuss the challenges facing the industry and come up with policies that would be conducive for the further development of the industry in order for South Africa to benefit from its unique biodiversity. Literature study has also established that breeders are keen on developing varieties of medicinal plants that are uniform and stable. This would call for domestic legislation on intellectual property protection that is aligned with legislation on Biodiversity and Access and Benefit-Sharing. This study highlights the importance of engaging stakeholders from both the formal and informal sector and brings attention to gaps in our policies and legislation. This study has already made a major contribution in the <b>draft</b> <b>Plant</b> Breeders’ Rights Bill through the inclusion of the revised provision on farmers’ privilege. This revision is aimed at ensuring that the legitimate interests of the breeder are protected whilst the rights of the farmers are recognized. It is hoped that this study will make a positive contribution to future policy developments and will lay a foundation for future studies pertaining to the plant breeders’ rights system and its impact in the agricultural sector.

The chosen option from this study will be executed to meet the mercury-specific requirements of the recently negotiated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit for the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant. Four previous ``mercury use`` buildings at the Y- 12 Plant {{have been identified as}} primary contributors to these discharges and are scheduled to undergo upgrades to mitigate them as sources. They are 9201 - 2, 9201 - 4, 9201 - 5, and 9204 - 4. These buildings contain mercury-contaminated pipes and sumps that discharge to EFPC. The current requirements for limiting mercury discharges to EFPC are defined in the <b>draft</b> Y- 12 <b>Plant</b> NPDES Permit, which is expected to become effective in July 1994. The main requirement related to mercury in the permit is to reduce the downstream mercury concentration to 5 g/day or less.

Water after passing through the runner has very high kinetic energy but lags in pressure energy. To recover pressure head and utilize kinetic energy of water, draft tubes are installed at outlet of turbine. Draft tube can be of gradually increasing cross-sectional type (commonly called conical diffuser type), simple elbow type or elbow with varying cross- section. Conical diffuser type draft tubes are simple in construction, simple to install, simple in designing and easy to maintain. The diffuser angle is less than Ten Degree to prevent flow separation and cavitation. The length to inlet diameter ratio is one of the most important parameter in designing of draft tube. For variation in the ratio, inlet diameter of draft tube cannot be altered as variation in diameter may not fit site conditions. So the only length of draft tube can be varied for finding the best optimum length. In present work, three conical diffuser type draft tube with length (22. 45 m, 30. 4 m and 38. 4 m) have been modeled with a diffuser half angle of (4 °) The velocity of water at inlet of draft tube has been kept as 9. 17 m/s in axial direction, in radial direction as 0. 14215 m/s and in tangential direction as 4. 35 m/sec.

40|$|Not {{cultivating}} soil, rotating crops {{over the}} years, and leaving crop residues {{on the surface}} {{in the practice of}} zero tillage/conservation agriculture (ZT/CA) reverses the historically accelerating degradation of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil structure, while increasing soil biological activity by a factor of 2 to 4. The results of this are many: (a) not cultivating reduces soil compaction, leaving old root holes to facilitate internal drainage, averts the pulverization of soil aggregates and formation of pans, reduces <b>draft</b> power for <b>planting</b> and gives shelter, winter food and nesting sites for fauna, (b) crop residues on the surface practically eliminate wind and water erosion, reduce soil moisture loss through the mulch effect, slow spring warm-up (possibly offset by a lower specific heat demand with less water retention in surface soil) and act as a reserve of organically-compounded nutrients (as they decompose to humus), (c) more SOM means higher available water and nutrient retention, higher biological activity year round (enhancing biological controls), higher levels of water-stable aggregates and a positive carbon sink in incremental SOM. The positive impacts for society are: (i) more and cheaper food, (ii) reduced flood and drought-induced famine risks, (iii) a positive carbon sink in SOM and possible reductions in NO 2 emissions, (iv) cleaner water and greater aquifer recharge due to reduced runoff, (v) cleaner air through effective elimination of dust as a product of cultivation (vi) less water pollution and greater aquifer recharge from reduced rainfall runoff, (vii) farm diesel consumption halved, (viii) reduced demand for (tropical) de-forestation, by permitting crop expansion on steeper lands, (ix) increased wildlife populations (skylarks, plovers, partridge and peccaries) and (x) an improved conservation mindset in farmers. It is notable that, in spite of successful practitioners in all European countries, mainstream adoption is still to come: Europe 0 s ZT/CA area is 1. 35 million hectares, while the world area is now some 125 million and growing at a rate of 7 million hectares per year. More scientific measurements of the benefits of this system are required, both to assist adoption and to trigger policy measures. In the EEC, CAP reform (greening) needs to consider making environmental services payments for these social benefits since a reduction in single farm payments is ineluctable and carbon footprint reduction is of the essence, in the face of constantly-rising fuel prices and the need to cut GHG emissions. Therefore, as the principal farm tool which offers an effective and immediate solution towards positive changes in soil quality, productivity and sustainability, ZT/CA adoption needs financial incentives, which have high economic and environmental returns to society...|$|R

Various overview studies have been published providing wider results and questions, which can provide further guidance (Ellstrand 2003; Andow & Zwahlen 2006; Chapman & Burke 2006; Chandler & Dunwell 2008). A compilation of such studies will provide a checklist of identified potential hazards which could be falsified using experimental data and model based explorations in time and space. It is such approach which is promoted in the proposed new EFSA guidance document on ERA of genetically modified plants (EFSA 2010). The framework I am using here is based on this guidance, leading through a hierarchical set of questions which I group into the following: (i) indications within biological information of the species itself and it wild relatives for invasiveness (ii) potential persistence of the transgene in plants under agricultural conditions; (iii) potential persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment in ferals and (iv) potential persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment in closely related species. Using biological information: asking whether a GM plant can grow and reproduce under current conditions and whether it can hybridize with sympatric plants (relatives or native ferals). This asks for basic but full life-cycle information about the species, reproduction and survival ability, both above and below ground (Hails & Morley 2005). Certainly the outcrossing pathway has been well described for many species (Ellstrand 2003; Armstrong et al. 2005). Hence the ability crops and wild relatives to hybridize is now generally accepted for most major crops and has been found even over long distances up to 21 km (Watrud et al. 2004; Reichman et al. 2006). However, this still could mean that de ERA for invasiveness could not potentially stop here: in the EU, corn has no wild relatives, which could make a difference in ERA in comparison to e. g., Northern America. Testing for persistence of the transgene in plants under agricultural conditions, i. e., volunteers and gene flow to other crops. Studies such as Warwick et al. (2008) and D’Hertefeldt et al. (2008) found transgenic plants to persist for several generations in agricultural fields. Simulation models as Genesys (Colbach et al. 2001) show that in systems including various crops, planted in rotations, such volunteers could persist and potentially spread through a whole area within 10 s of years (see also Claessen et al. 2005; Hooftman 2006). Even when volunteer populations do not become weedy, they could act as a genetic bridge between different cultivars and towards wild relatives (Hall et al. 2000; Reagon & Snow 2006). Transgenes have been found to persist for several years in and around agricultural fields through storage in volunteers and feral crop plants (Pessel et al. 2001; Pivard et al. 2008), potentially presenting such a hazard on a larger temporal scale. Appropriate estimation of the risks involved will vary much dependent {{on the quality of the}} life-cycle data available, in which it is important to gather all life-cycle data from repeated single experiments under non-optimal conditions (Hails & Morley 2005). Next to these simulation approaches, a wide range of population models has been developed over the last years, both matrix and integral models, which can be very useful for modelling population persistence: some examples are Bullock (1999); Thompson et al. (2003); Hall et al. (2006); Allainguillaume et al. (2006); Hooftman et al. (2007) and Damgaard & Kjaer (2009). The main question for volunteers to answer seems whether and how much populations decrease in the other crops in the years between growing the GM crop of interest. Persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment. For feral populations, second generation transgenes, like biotic stress tolerance, could differ fundamentally from first generation transgenes. The stress situation likely exists outside the field as well, whereas e. g., an herbicide tolerance is less likely to provide an advantage unless the herbicide is present. However, the non-agricultural environments are likely much more diverse than within agricultural fields, making controlled-environment studies (greenhouse and lab) less applicable. Field-based studies seem necessary here to a range of conditions to test for environment x genotype interactions (Mercer et al. 2006; Ridley & Ellstrand 2009). Garnier & Lecomte (2006 a; 2006 b) developed a further set of matrix approaches that can be used, next to the ones mentioned above. Potential persistence of the transgene outside the agricultural environment in closely related species. Few studies have shown a direct relationship of transgenes with fitness in early hybrid generations (e. g., Snow et al. 2003). More likely, the initial persistence of the transgene depends strongly on processes surrounding plant fitness, which are transgene related. However, certainly with transgenes for tolerance for abiotic stress, the transgene is likely to be part of a, limited, package of genes which could provide a fitness advantage over time. So any test for differences between transgenic and non-transgenic races likely has to follow the same methods as most studies done on non-GM crops. Fitness analyses and the long-term persistence of such hybrids has been studied to a large extent in species such as Lactuca (Hooftman et al., 2005; 2007), Brassica (Allainguillaume et al. 2006; Jorgensen et al. 2009), Helianthus (Reagon & Snow 2006; Rieseberg et al. 2003; 2007) and Raphanus (Snow et al. 2001; 2010; Campbell et al. 2006; 2009; Ridley & Ellstrand 2009). A wide variety of population models as mentioned above is available for analyses. However, fitness analyses are far from straightforward in hybrids in terms of experiments. Recent studies by Campbell et al. (2009) and Hooftman et al. (2010) have shown that experiments should take multiple generations under selective conditions, since sorting among genotypes could lead to better performance than assumed on early generation hybrids only. This can have clear effects on the population structure and the total presence of the transgene in populations, certainly under a relative invariable selection pressure as an adverse abiotic stress will provide (Hooftman et al. 2008). Also the competive ability of hybrids compared to the parental species might be altered (Hauser et al. 2003; Vacher et al. 2004) or even differ under varying levels of stress (Mercer et al. 2007). Recently genetic hitchhiking and position of transgenes on the genome have gained increasing attention (see Uwimana et al. in this session). Furthermore, recent evidence in Brassica points to large scale difference in introgression rate and fitness of hybrids between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA fragments (Allainguillaume et al. 2009). In conclusion, all the experimental evidence on both transgenic and non-transgenic crop systems indicates that an integrative approach asking a hierarchical range of ecological questions is needed. Assuming the phenotypic change, caused by the transgene in the crop, will be similar in plants after escape is often proved plainly wrong. Many methods exist to get a better understanding. Abiotic stress presents certainly new challenges in environments and interactions to deal with, since it could provide substantial niche shifts of plant species. Regulators, industry and other stakeholders will have to decide how to acknowledge those interactions between environments, the transgene and plant biology in general. In this we will have to realize that GM plants might present other risks than their conventional counterparts or present new hazards not provided by such counterparts.
