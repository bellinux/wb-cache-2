A bleached kraft pulp from mixed hardwoods (LBKP) was carboxymethylated, then crosslinked with polyethylene glycol <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (PEGDGE) with different degrees of polymerization under different conditions. A crosslinking agent with longer chain length might be advantageous for preparing a water absorbent with high water retention, and water retention could be improved at lower molar ratio of the crosslinking agent to the glucose unit. Isolation of carboxymethylated LBKP before crosslinking was advantageous for higher water absorbence. A water absorbent with a water retention value of as high as 500 times its weight was obtained.|$|R

50|$|Aliphatic {{epoxy resins}} are {{typically}} formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting resins may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ether),</b> or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity {{at room temperature}} (10-200 mPa.s) and are {{often referred to as}} reactive diluents. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term ‘modified epoxy resin’ to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.A related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays low viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required.|$|E

All seven lead polymers showed highest transgene expression at a polymer:pDNA weight ratio of 5 : 1 in the MIA PaCa- 2 pancreatic cancer cell line. Among the conditions studied, transgene expression efficacy correlated with minimal polymer cytotoxicity but not polyplex sizes. In addition, this study indicated that methylene spacing between amine centers in the monomers, amine content, and molecular weight of the polymers are all significant factors and should be considered when designing polymers for transgene delivery. A lead effective polymer was employed for coating gold nanorods, leading to theranostic nanoassemblies that possess combined transgene delivery and optical imaging capabilities, leading to potential theranostic systems. </p...|$|R

50|$|N-Terminal domain AR {{antagonist}}s are a {{new type}} of AR antagonist which, unlike all currently marketed AR antagonists, bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR rather than the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Whereas conventional AR antagonists bind to the LBD of the AR and competitively displace androgens, thereby preventing them from activating the receptor, AR NTD antagonists bind covalently to the NTD of the AR and prevent protein-protein interactions subsequent to activation that are required for transcriptional activity. As such, they are non-competitive and irreversible antagonists of the AR. Examples of AR NTD antagonists include bisphenol A <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BADGE) and its derivatives EPI-001 and EPI-506. These drugs are currently under development for the treatment of prostate cancer, and it is thought that they may have greater efficacy as antiandrogens relative to conventional AR antagonists. In accordance with this notion, AR NTD antagonists are active against splice variants of the AR, which conventional AR antagonists are not, and AR NTD antagonists are immune to gain-of-function mutations in the AR LBD that convert AR antagonists into AR agonists and which commonly occur in prostate cancer.|$|E

To {{reduce the cost}} of preparation, the modification was also carried out using kraft cooking black liquors, since the alkali species were retained and acted as catalysts [149]. Uraki et al. [143] produced amphiphilic lignin derivatives from acetic acid lignin (AL) via reaction with polyethylene <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (PE) and lignin-based gels by increasing the lignin concentration in the same reaction [144]. The gel with a PE/AL ratio of 0.57 exhibited unique swelling properties against aqueous ethanol. It swelled with increasing ethanol concentrations, and reached the maximal swollen state at 50 – 60  %. Nonaka et al. [147] reported the viscoelastic properties of kraft lignin-based epoxy resins using PE cured with dialiphatic amines. The peak temperature of the loss modulus increased with increasing kraft lignin contents and decreasing ethylene oxide chains of the PEs. Those resins exhibited very broad relaxations due to the glass transition, thus they could be applied as adhesives or damping materials to reduce the emitted noise and vibrations.

However, they are known to commonly cause skin allergy. This research describes a number of alternative ERMs, designed {{with the aim of}} reducing the skin sensitizing potency while maintaining the ability to form thermosetting polymers. The compounds were designed, synthesized, and assessed for sensitizing potency using the in vivo murine local lymph node assay (LLNA). All six epoxy resin monomers had decreased sensitizing potencies compared to those of DGEBA and DGEBF. With respect to the LLNA EC 3 value, the best of the alternative monomers had a value approximately 2. 5 times higher than those of DGEBA and DGEBF. The diepoxides were reacted with triethylenetetramine, and the polymers formed were tested for technical applicability using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Four out of the six alternative ERMs gave polymers with a thermal stability comparable to that obtained with DGEBA and DGEBF. The use of improved epoxy resin monomers with less skin sensitizing effects is a direct way to tackle the problem of contact allergy to epoxy resin systems, particularly in occupational settings, resulting in a reduction in the incidence of allergic contact dermatitis...|$|R

The PEG/OCT-modified epoxy systems were further modified with 1, 3, and 5 wt% of organoclay. The thermal behavior of organoclay-filled PEG/OCT-modified epoxy matrices were characterized using differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravi-metric analysis, and dynamic mechanical analysis. Mechanical properties were studied as per ASTM standards. Three percent organoclay-filled PEG-modified epoxy possesses high storage modulus (6240 MPa) compared to 3 % organoclay-filled OCT-modified epoxy (5064 MPa). The values of impact strength for 3 % organoclay filled PEG and OCT modified epoxy systems are 122 and 85. 5 J/m, respectively. Homogeneous and heterogeneous morphology was ascertained from scanning electron microscope. From the X-ray diffraction analysis, {{it was observed that}} the absence of d 001 reflections in organoclay-filled PEG/OCT-modified epoxy systems indicated the formation of exfoliated nanohybrids. The significant improvement in impact strength was achieved without any reduction in glass transition temperature (Tg) due to the addition of organoclay. Thermal stability with better char yield and improved impact strength were attained during the formation of nanocomposites due to the increment of organoclay in PEG/ OCT-modified epoxy systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} improvement of the flammability of epoxy resins, bisphenol-A polycarbonate poly(butylene terephthalate), and Nylon 6. 6 by introducing halogens and loop functionality into the flame retardants is described. The phthalides (the loop functionality containing molecules) include 3, 3 -bis(4 -bromophenyl) -phthalide, 3, 3 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) phthalide, and phenolphthalein. The phthalide containing epoxy resins are synthesized and characterized in comparison with the bisphenol-A epoxy resins in terms of flammability in the copolymer systems. The resins include <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ethers</b> of phenolphthalein, bisphenol-A. tetrabromobisphenol-A, and tetraoromophenolphthalein. The vaporization of the phthalide additive in the polymers is observed in Thermal Gravimetric Analysis. The flame retardancy is primarily due to the presence of halogens. In the poly(butylene terephthalate) system, the cleavage of the C(sub aromatic) -B bond of the flame retardant additive enhances the crosslinking react ions between the aromatic rings resulting in an increase of char formation. In the epoxy resin systems, loop functionality contributes to char formation to a larger extent. The interaction between the epoxy resin and poly-(butylene terephthalate) follows the mechanism of insertion of the oxirane ring into the ester bond. This mechanism is studied by FT-IR. The investigation of the thermal properties of the char-forming phenol-formaldehyde resins is conducted to provide information for the systematic design of high temperature flame-resistant phenolics.

40|$|Background: To improve {{quality of}} surgery in oncology, it is {{necessary}} to completely remove the tumor, including its metastases, to minimize injury to normal tissues and to reduce duration of an intervention. Modern methods of detection based on radiological computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can identify a tumor after its volume has become big enough, i. e. it contains more than 10  billion cells. Therefore, an improvement of sensitivity and resolution ability of diagnostic tools to identify early stages of malignant neoplasms seems of utmost importance. Aim: To demonstrate the potential of a new class of anti-Stokes luminescence nanoparticles for deep optical imaging with high contrast of malignant tumors. Materials and methods: Upconversion nanoparticles with narrow dispersion and a  size of 70 to 80   nm, with a  core/shell structure of NaYF 4 :Yb 3 +:Tm 3 +/NaYF 4 were used in the study. The nanoparticles have an intensive band of anti-Stokes photoluminescence at a wavelength of 800   nm under irradiation with a  wavelength of 975   nm (both wavelengths are within the transparency window for biological tissues). The conversion coefficient of the excitation radiation into the anti-Stokes luminescence was 9 %. To increase the time during which nanoparticles can circulate in blood flow of small animals, the nanoparticles were covered by a  biocompatible amphiphilic polymer shell. As a  tumor model we used Lewis epidermoid carcinoma transfected to mice. Results: We were able to obtain stable water colloids of nanoparticles covered with amphiphilic polymer that could preserve their initial size at least for one month. The use of upconversion nanoparticles with a  hydrophilic shell made of intermittent maleic anhydride and octadecene co-polymer with subsequent coating with <b>diglycidyl</b> polyethylene glycol <b>ether</b> allowed for reduction of non-specific reaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins. In its turn, it resulted in an increased time of their circulation in blood flow of small animals for up to 1  hour. With the Lewis lung carcinoma transfected to mice model we demonstrated аn in-life transportation of upconversion nanoparticles into the tumor with a  high degree of localization due to a passive EPR effect. The contrast of luminescent signal in the tumor compared to adjacent tissues was at least 70 %. The possibility of visualization of upconverted nanoparticles up to 15  mm of biological tissue was shown. Conclusion: The optical imaging techniques with anti-Stokes photoluminescent markers ensure a  high contract real-time detection of tumor tissues that allows for their use for intra-operative diagnostics...|$|R
