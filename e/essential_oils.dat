Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the chemical composition of the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> of Artemisia vestita and to determine the antibacterial activity of the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> and its two major components, grandisol and 1, 8 -cineole, against certain respiratory infection-causing bacterial strains, in vitro and in vivo. The chemical composition of the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A micro-well dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> and its major constituents. A model of Streptococcus pyogenes infection in mice was used to determine its in vivo activities. Lung and blood samples were obtained to assess bacterial cell counts. Toxicity evaluation of the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> and its components was completed by performing biochemical analysis of the serum, particularly monitoring aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, urea and creatinine. The <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> exhibited potent anti-bacterial activity, whereas the two major constituents were less potent. The <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> exhibited MIC values between 20 and 80 µg/ml, while the values of the two constituents were between 130 and 200 µg/ml. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrated that the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> inhibited biofilm formation and altered its architecture. Survival curves indi-cated that the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> led to a reduction in the viability of different bacteria. The <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> also induced significant leakage of potassium ions from S. pyogenes. The <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> (100 µg/mouse) and grandisol (135 µg/mouse) significantly reduced the number of viable bacterial cells in the lungs (P< 0. 01). However, intake of 100 µg/mouse of <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> or grandisol 135 µg/mouse once or twice each day for 9 days did not produce any toxic effects in the mice.

The <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> can thereby serve as an inhibitor of melanin synthesis and could also act as a natural antioxidant...|$|R
30|$|Ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> {{is known}} as {{immunomodulator}} agent. The effect of ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> on cellular immune response {{was the subject of}} different investigations. 0.001 - 10 ng/ml ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> had significant inhibitory effects on T lymphocyte proliferation. Also, the number of total T lymphocytes and T helper cells decreased in a dose dependent. The percentage of T suppressor cells to the total T lymphocyte increased in mice after treatment with ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> IL- 1 α secretion by mice peritoneal macrophages, which implicated on its anti-inflammatory effects, was inhibited by ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> In animal model, reduction in delayed type of hypersensitivity response to 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene was observed in sensitized mice after oral administration of 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 g/kg ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> Oral administration of ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> had significant effects on reduction of thymus and spleen index [48]. The results of this study confirmed the effects of ginger <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> on cell mediated immune response and nonspecific proliferation of T lymphocyte.|$|R
