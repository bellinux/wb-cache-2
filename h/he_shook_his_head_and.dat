500|$|While {{serving as}} museum chair, Marcus was once called upon by Fred Florence, then {{chairman}} of a major local bank and a fellow Temple Emanu-El leader, to explain his inclusion of [...] "a lot of Communist art" [...] he'd been told would be included in an upcoming DMFA [...] "Sports in Art" [...] exhibit, co-sponsored by Sports Illustrated and United States Information Agency as a fund-raiser for the 1956 Olympic team. Artists represented in the show included four supposed Communist supporters, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, and William Zorach. Asking Florence to indicate which pieces were being questioned, Marcus dismissed each claim one by one: [...] "I don't know how anybody could think hitting a baseball was communist," [...] Marcus said when shown Shahn's [...] "The National Pastime." [...] His response to Zorach's [...] "Fisherman" [...] was similar, as <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> remarked, [...] "I don't think too many people think fishing is communist either." [...] Marcus followed up by going to local newspapers The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald and getting the publishers of both to agree {{that they would not}} stand for censorship in the arts.|$|E
