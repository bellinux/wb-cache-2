5000|$|A {{sewing machine}} {{might have a}} single walking foot, or two walking feet with {{alternating}} action. A walking foot may be combined with another feed mechanism, such as a <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> or a needle feed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> {{mechanism}} {{is used by}} almost all household machines and involves a mechanism below the sewing surface of the machine. When the needle is withdrawn from the material being sewn, a set of [...] "feed dogs" [...] is pushed up through slots in the machine surface, then dragged horizontally past the needle. The dogs are serrated to grip the material, and a [...] "presser foot" [...] is used to keep the material {{in contact with the}} dogs. At the end of their horizontal motion, the dogs are lowered again and returned to their original position while the needle makes its next pass through the material. While the needle is in the material, there is no feed action. Almost all household machines and the majority of industrial machines use <b>drop</b> <b>feed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Differential feed is a {{variation}} of <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> with two independent sets of dogs, one before and one after the needle. By changing their relative motions, these sets of dogs {{can be used to}} stretch or compress the material {{in the vicinity of the}} needle. This is extremely useful when sewing stretchy material, and overlock machines (heavily used for such materials) frequently have differential feed.|$|E

40|$|Summary Objective: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} three different types of gestation <b>feed</b> <b>drops.</b> Materials and methods: Econo, Accu, and Ultra <b>feed</b> <b>drops</b> (Automated Production Systems, Assumption, Illinois) were attached to feed lines at three angles (90 ˚, 75 ˚, and 60 ˚). Feed was collected and weighed at settings of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 lb (0. 9, 1. 8, 2. 7, 3. 6, and 4. 65 kg) for the Econo and Accu <b>feed</b> <b>drops</b> and 2, 4, 6, and 8 lb for the Ultra <b>feed</b> <b>drops.</b> Results: There was a drop type × angle × feed level interaction (P <. 01) for the feed settings versus the actual amount dropped. At 90 ˚, {{the relationship between the}} feeder setting (x) and actual quantity of <b>feed</b> <b>dropped</b> was best described by the regression equation (1. 156 x + 0. 244) for the Econo, (1. 010 x + 0. 072) for the Accu, and (1. 009 x + 0. 231) for the Ultra <b>feed</b> <b>drops.</b> At 75 ˚, the regression equations were (1. 014 x – 0. 139) for the Econo, (0. 997 x + 0. 057) for the Accu, and (1. 005 x + 0. 156) for the Ultra <b>feed</b> <b>drops.</b> At 60 ˚, the regression equations were (0. 689 x – 0. 076) for the Econo, (0. 989 x – 0. 249) for the Accu, and (0. 951 x + 0. 026) for the Ultra <b>feed</b> <b>drops.</b> Implications: The type of <b>feed</b> <b>drop</b> and its angle relative to the feed line influences the amount of feed dispensed at a feeder setting. The Accu and Ultra <b>feed</b> <b>drops</b> more accurately dispense the correct amount of feed than the Econo <b>feed</b> <b>drops...</b>|$|R
50|$|Concerns about {{potential}} cattle losses prompted Colorado to airlift hay to {{the hardest hit}} areas, {{including the use of}} UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from the Colorado National Guard and a C-130 from the Wyoming National Guard. Losses in a similar storm in 1997 resulted in over 27,000 cattle fatalities with an economic loss of $27 million. Final losses were estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 cattle in Colorado. Overall, National Guard units, including ones from Wyoming and Oklahoma, <b>dropped</b> <b>feed</b> to an estimated 345,000 cattle stranded by ten foot drifts.|$|R
50|$|A walking foot is a {{mechanism}} for feeding the workpiece through a sewing machine as it is being stitched. It is most useful for sewing heavy materials where needle feed is mechanically inadequate, for spongy or cushioned materials where lifting the foot out of contact with the material helps in the feeding action, and for sewing many layers together where a <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> will cause the lower layers to shift out of position with the upper layers.|$|E
50|$|A walking foot {{replaces the}} {{stationary}} presser foot with one that moves along with whatever other feed mechanisms the machine already has. As the walking foot moves, it shifts the workpiece along with it. It is most useful for sewing heavy materials where needle feed is mechanically inadequate, for spongy or cushioned materials where lifting the foot {{out of contact}} with the material helps in the feeding action, and for sewing many layers together where a <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> will cause the lower layers to shift out of position with the upper layers.|$|E
50|$|A {{manual feed}} is used {{primarily}} in freehand embroidery, quilting, and shoe repair. With manual feed, the stitch length and direction is controlled entirely by {{the motion of}} the material being sewn. Frequently some form of hoop or stabilizing material is used with fabric to keep the material under proper tension and aid in moving it around. Most household machines can be set for manual feed by disengaging the <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> dogs. Most industrial machines can not be used for manual feed without actually removing the feed dogs.|$|E

50|$|Kenmore Appliances is a {{brand of}} {{household}} appliances sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. The brand first appeared on a four-drawer <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> sewing machine sold from 1913 to 1919. The first Kenmore washing machine was introduced in 1927. The first Kenmore vacuum cleaners were introduced in 1932. Kenmore's upscale line of appliances {{is known as the}} Elite line. Kenmore also has a professional line of appliances called Kenmore Pro. In 1976, Sears expanded the Kenmore name to its line of refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, and dehumidifiers, which were previously branded as Coldspot.|$|E
50|$|A needle feed, {{used only}} in {{industrial}} machines, moves the material while the needle {{is in the}} material. In fact, the needle may be the primary feeding force. Some implementations of needle feed rock the axis of needle motion back and forth, while other implementations keep the axis vertical while moving it forward and back. In both cases, there is no feed action while the needle {{is out of the}} material. Needle feed is often used in conjunction with a modified <b>drop</b> <b>feed,</b> and is very common on industrial two needle machines. Household machines do not use needle feed as a general rule.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the basic}} motion of needles, loopers and bobbins, the {{material}} being sewn must move {{so that each}} cycle of needle motion involves {{a different part of}} the material. This motion is known as feed, and sewing machines have almost as many ways of feeding material as they do of forming stitches. For general categories, there are: <b>drop</b> <b>feed,</b> needle feed, walking foot, puller, and manual. Often, multiple types of feed are used on the same machine. Besides these general categories, there are also uncommon feed mechanisms used in specific applications like edge joining fur, making seams on caps, and blindstitching.|$|E
40|$|Data feed {{management}} {{is a critical}} component of many data intensive applications that depend on reliable data delivery to support real-time data collection, correlation and analysis. Data is typically collected {{from a wide variety of}} sources and organizations, using a range of mechanisms- some data are streamed in real time, while other data are obtained at regular intervals or collected in an ad hoc fashion. Individual applications are forced to make separate arrangements with feed providers, learn the structure of incoming files, monitor data quality, and trigger any processing necessary. The Bistro data feed manager, designed and implemented at AT&T Labs-Research, simplifies and automates this complex task of data feed management: efficiently handling incoming raw files, identifying data feeds and distributing them to remote subscribers. Bistro supports a flexible specification language to define logical data feeds using the naming structure of physical data files, and to identify feed subscribers. Based on the specification, Bistro matches data files to feeds, performs file normalization and compression, efficiently delivers files, and notifies subscribers using a trigger mechanism. We describe our feed analyzer that discovers the naming structure of incoming data files to detect new <b>feeds,</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>feeds,</b> feed changes, or lost data in an existing feed. Bistro is currently deployed within AT&T Labs and is responsible for the real-time delivery of over 100 different raw feeds, distributing data to several large-scale stream warehouses...|$|R

5000|$|Industrial {{lockstitch}} {{machines with}} two needles, each forming an independent lockstitch {{with their own}} bobbin, are also very common. There are different types of lockstitch industrial machines. The most commonly used are the <b>drop</b> <b>feed</b> for light and medium duty, and walking foot for medium and heavy duty like the Class 7 with an impressive 3/4" [...] foot lift. This makes the Class 7 able to stitch through heavy materials up to 3/4" [...] with threads as strong as 57 lbs. Originally made by Singer in the US and Europe for supplying the demand of heavy duty clothing for the troops, for many {{years after the war}} this class was not available as new because the market was filled. With the outsourcing of many sewing manufacturing jobs, nowadays many Chinese Class 7 machines are available and built by Federal Specifications giving them equal performance to the original ones (FSN:3530-3111-1556, FSN: 3530-3111-3675, FSN: 3530-311-1556, FSN: 3530-3111-3075).|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the accuracy of three different gestation feed drops. Each drop was tested at three different angles (90, 75, 60 °) from the feed line. Feed was collected and weighed at feeder settings of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 lb for the Econo- Drop and Accu-Drop feed dispensers. Samples were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 lb for the Ultra- <b>Drop</b> <b>feed</b> dispenser due to a smaller storage capacity for feed with this feed drop. There were five replications (five drops of each type) at each feed setting. There was a drop type by angle interaction (P< 0. 01) for the feed dispenser settings versus the actual pounds of feed dropped. At angles of 90 or 60 degrees, the Accu-Drop and the Ultra-Drop feed dispensers more (P< 0. 10) accurately dropped the correct amount of feed at the respective feeder settings. The amount of feed dropped at each dispenser setting was influenced more by angle to the feed line with the Econo-Drop than with the Accu-Drop or Ultra- <b>Drop</b> <b>feed</b> dispensers. This study demonstrated that the Accu-Drop and the Ultra-Drop feed dispensers are more accurate than the Econo-Drop feed dispenser. Therefore, producers should consider the additional feed cost over the lifetime of the feed drops and not rely solely on initial price...|$|E
40|$|Since April 2010, {{a severe}} {{outbreak}} of duck viral infection, with egg <b>drop,</b> <b>feed</b> uptake decline and ovary-oviduct disease, has {{spread around the}} major duck-producing regions in China. A new virus, named BYD virus, was isolated in different areas, and a similar disease was reproduced in healthy egg-producing ducks, infecting with the isolated virus. The virus was reisolated from the affected ducks and replicated well in primary duck embryo fibroblasts and Vero cells, causing the cytopathic effect. The virus was identified as an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a size of approximately 55 nm in diameter. Genomic sequencing of the isolated virus revealed that it {{is closely related to}} Tembusu virus (a mosquito-borne Ntaya group flavivirus), with 87 – 91 % nucleotide identity of the partial E (envelope) proteins to that of Tembusu virus and 72 % of the entire genome coding sequence with Bagaza virus, the most closely related flavivirus with an entirely sequenced genome. Collectively our systematic studies fulfill Koch’s postulates, and therefore, the causative agent of the duck egg drop syndrome occurring in China is a new flavivirus. Flavivirus is an emerging and re-emerging zoonotic pathogen and BYD virus that causes severe egg-drop, could be disastrous for the duck industry. More importantly its public health concerns should also be evaluated, and its epidemiology should be closely watched due to the zoonotic nature o...|$|E

40|$|A 6 -week {{feeding trail}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of varying levels of yam peel meal (CP; 8. 07 % and ME; 2701 kcal/kg) on the laying performance of Japanese quails. One hundred and fifty 4 - week old female quails divided into 4 groups having 3 replicates of 12 birds each were used in this study. Four isonitrogenous (20 % CP) diets incorporating graded levels (0, 10, 20 and 30 %) of yam peel meal were compounded. The diets, however, varied in energy levels having 2, 626 (Diet A), 2, 553 (Diet B), 2, 480 Diet C and 2, 406 kcalME/kg (Diet D) respectively. Each diet was replicated three times. Average daily feed intake (34. 77, 31. 13, 31. 50 and 33. 23 g/bird) and hen-day production (30. 06, 22. 17, 18. 81 and 16. 19 %) were significantly (p 0. 05) affected.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJim L. NelssenThe overall {{objective}} of these experiments {{was to develop}} management and feeding programs to increase sow longevity and productivity by improving welfare conditions. In Exp. 1, 208 gestating sows and 288 gestating gilts were utilized {{to determine the effect}} of feeding frequency (2 vs. 6) on performance and welfare issues. Feeding frequency had no affect on growth and reproductive performance in gestating sows; however, increasing the feeding frequency did improve the welfare measurements in this trial. Gilts fed six times a day did have increase ADG during d 0 to 42; however, there was no affect on performance from d 42 to farrowing. In Exp. 2 (630 pigs in 4 studies), increasing the feeding frequency (2 vs. 6) of a restricted feeding level increased growth performance of finishing pigs. This affect is likely due to the increase of available energy above maintenance when compared with the gestating sows. In Exp. 3, different <b>feed</b> <b>drops</b> used for delivering feed were evaluated. The Accu and the Ultra <b>feed</b> <b>drops</b> were more accurate than the Econo <b>feed</b> <b>drop</b> at angles of 90, 75, and 60 °. The difference in accuracy is potentially related to the way that the drops attach to the feed line. However, the amount of feed that is collected in each drop appears to increase linearly as the feeder settings are increased. Thus, regression equations for the angle of the <b>feed</b> <b>drop</b> can be developed to adjust for the variability in the amount of accumulated feed. In Exp. 4, Alimet® was used to determine the TID TSAA:Lys ratio for ADG and G:F of 63 and 66 % for Genetiporc and 61 and 56 % for PIC pigs weighing between 10 to 20 kg.
