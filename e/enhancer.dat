40|$|<b>Enhancers,</b> <b>enhancers</b> – {{from their}} {{discovery}} to today’s universe of transcription <b>enhancers</b> Abstract: Transcriptional <b>enhancers</b> are short (200 – 1500 base pairs) DNA segments that {{are able to}} dramatically boost transcription from the promoter of a target gene. Originally discovered in simian virus 40 (SV 40), a small DNA virus, transcription <b>enhancers</b> were soon also found in immunoglobulin genes and other cellular genes as key determinants of cell-type-specific gene expression. <b>Enhancers</b> can exert their effect over long distances of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of base pairs, either from upstream, downstream, or from within a tran-scription unit. The number of <b>enhancers</b> in eukaryotic genomes correlates with the complexity of the organism; a typical mammalian gene is likely controlled by several <b>enhancers</b> to fine-tune its expression at different devel-opmental stages, in different cell types and in response to different signaling cues.

Compared to other tissues studied at this time-point, most candidate heart <b>enhancers</b> are less deeply conserved in vertebrate evolution. Nevertheless, the testing of 130 candidate regions in a transgenic mouse assay revealed that most of them reproducibly function as <b>enhancers</b> active in the heart, irrespective of their degree of evolutionary constraint.

In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human <b>Enhancer</b> of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling.

25|$|Two {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for the regulation of GLUT-4 expression at a transcriptional level – myocyte <b>enhancer</b> factor 2 (MEF2) and GLUT4 <b>enhancer</b> factor (GEF). Mutations in the DNA binding regions for either of these proteins results in ablation of transgene GLUT-4 expression. These results prompted a study in 2005 which showed that AMPK directly phosphorylates GEF, but it doesn’t seem to directly activate MEF2. AICAR treatment has been shown, however, to increase transport of both proteins into the nucleus, as well as increase the binding of both to the GLUT-4 promoter region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mouse E 11. 5 {{embryonic}} heart <b>enhancers</b> {{were found}} to exhibit exceptionally weak sequence conservation during vertebrate evolution compared to <b>enhancers</b> of other developing organs. However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon is due to elevated mutation rates, or {{is a consequence of}} natural selection. Results In this study, based on the aligned orthologous genomic sequences of mouse and other closely related mammals, the substitution rates of fourfold degenerate sites or intron sequences in neighboring genes were used as neutral references to normalize substitution rates of mouse <b>enhancers.</b> Subsequent comparisons indicated that heart enhancers' evolutionary rates were increased by natural selection. Correspondingly, the results of Fisher's exact tests to examine the differential enrichment of substitutions between <b>enhancers</b> and neutral sequences suggest that both relaxed purifying selection and positive selection caused the rapid evolution of heart <b>enhancers.</b> Analyses on recombination rates and substitution patterns indicated that GC-biased gene conversion does not contribute to evolutionary rate variations among <b>enhancers.</b> In general, pleiotropic <b>enhancers</b> and <b>enhancers</b> in proximity to weakly expressed genes, tend to evolve slowly. Although heart <b>enhancers</b> are less pleiotropic and are adjacent to highly expressed genes, these biases do not account for the rapid evolution observed. Conclusions In combination, {{the results of the present}} study suggest that factors associated with functions or characteristics of the tissue may exert direct and profound effects on the intensity and direction of the natural selection applied to regulatory DNAs, such as <b>enhancers.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the rat alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene has three upstream <b>enhancers</b> that stimulate the AFP promoter additively in HepG 2 cells (1). In this paper, deletion analysis demonstrated that a promoter-linked segment from - 178 to - 155 was required for full activity when the <b>enhancers</b> were distant from the promoter, even at less than their normal genomic distances, but dispensable when the <b>enhancers</b> were moved close to the promoter. This 'promoter-coupling element' appears to interact simultaneously with all three <b>enhancers.</b> Deletion analysis also localized a transcription stimulatory and a negative region in the promoter. Though these latter regions controlled {{the strength of the}} isolated promoter, they did not affect 'coupling' to the distant <b>enhancers,</b> and transcription stimulation by these distal promoter elements was small compared to the distant <b>enhancers.</b> Overall, the distant <b>enhancers,</b> acting through the promoter-coupling element, accounted for 70 % of the activity of the transfected AFP gene. Footprint analysis with HepG 2 nuclear extracts demonstrated protein binding at two sites near the promoter-coupling element. The data indicate a positive transcription control mechanism by which distant <b>enhancers</b> stimulate the AFP promoter through a specific promoter-linked element...|$|R
40|$|For, 30 million years, {{the eggs}} of Hawaiian Drosophila were laid in ever-changing environments caused by {{high rates of}} island formation. The {{associated}} diversification of the size and developmental rate of the syncytial fly embryo would have altered morphogenic gradients, thus necessitating frequent evolutionary compensation of transcriptional responses. We investigate the consequences these radiations had on transcriptional <b>enhancers</b> patterning the embryo to see whether their pattern of molecular evolution is different from non-Hawaiian species. We identify and functionally assay in transgenic D. melanogaster the Neurogenic Ectoderm <b>Enhancers</b> from two different Hawaiian Drosophila groups: (i) the picture wing group, and (ii) the modified mouthparts group. We find that the binding sites in this set of well-characterized <b>enhancers</b> are footprinted by diverse microsatellite repeat (MSR) sequences. We further show that Hawaiian embryonic <b>enhancers</b> in general are enriched in MSR relative to both Hawaiian non-embryonic <b>enhancers</b> and non-Hawaiian embryonic <b>enhancers.</b> We propose embryonic <b>enhancers</b> are sensitive to Activator spacing because they often serve as assembly scaffolds for the aggregation of transcription factor activator complexes.
