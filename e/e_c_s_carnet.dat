Following exposure to procaine (0. 05 - 0. 1 mM) at pH 7. 4, the decay of m. <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> rapidly became biphasic, and {{could be described as}} the sum of two exponential components. When the same concentrations of procaine were applied at pH 9. 9, the development of biphasic m. <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> took much longer. Reversal of the effect upon washing out the procaine was much slower at pH 9. 9 than at pH 7. 4. A rapid change in pH from 7. 4 to 9. 9 during exposure to a constant concentration of procaine quickly reduced the effect of procaine on m. <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> The effect gradually returned after prolonged exposure to procaine at pH 9. 9. These results suggest that procaine applied at high pH, where it is predominantly in uncharged form, may be diffusing to a site of action which is not directly accessible from the external surface of the membrane. The voltage-dependence of procaine action was similar whether it was applied at pH 7. 4 or 9. 9. Intracellular injection of procaine rapidly produced biphasic m. <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s,</b> whether the extracellular pH was 7. 4 or 9. 9.

Like tubocurarine, lobeline causes nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The half-time of decay (t½) of endplate currents (<b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s)</b> recorded at a holding potential (Vm) of - 90 mV was significantly shorter in endplates treated with lobeline (50 μM; mean t½ ± SEM = 0. 41 ± 0. 02 ms) or tubocurarine (11. 4 μM; t½ = 0. 64 ± 0. 04 ms) than in those treated with Mg 2 + (13 mM; t½ = 1. 39 ± 0. 11 ms) or a low concentration of tubocurarine (3 μM; t½ = 0. 87 ± 0. 05 ms). Similarly, lobeline (10 μM) shortened the t½ of untreated miniature <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> by 35 %; tubocurarine, however, abolished miniature <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> at the concentration required to observe its actions on <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> decay kinetics. The t½ of <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> recorded from preparations treated with Mg 2 + (13 mM), tubocurarine at low concentrations (3 μM), or untreated miniature <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> was logarithmically related to Vm, being slower at more hyperpolarized values. By contrast, the t½s of <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> recorded in either lobeline (50 μM) or tubocurarine (11. 4 μM) were independent of voltage in the range - 150 to - 80 mV. The ability of lobeline to shorten t½ and to remove the voltage dependence of t½ was partially antagonized by Mg 2 + (13 mM). As expected, when lobeline or tubocurarine {{was removed from the}} bath or when acetylcholine release from the motor nerve terminals was increased by 4 -aminopyridine (20 μM) and Ca 2 + (10 mM) (in the presence of lobeline or tubocurarine), the amplitude of <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> increased as a function of time. However, the t½ of the decay phase of the <b>e.</b> p. <b>c.</b> <b>s</b> remained shortened (i. e., unaltered from the earlier treatment).

Similar two-component ACh noise spectra were observed in the neurones not treated with atropine. tau N 1 and tau N 2 components revealed temperature dependences similar to each other and close to that of tau d. The values of tau N 1 and tau N 2 and the ratio between the contributions of the tau N 1 and tau N 2 components to the ACh noise spectrum did not depend on the dose of ACh.
