We use the deep (2100 s per beam) HI Parkes Zone of Avoidance survey which includes 3 RRLs (H 166 α, H 167 α and H 168 α) within its bandwidth. The region ℓ = 36 to 44, b = - 4 to + 4 is chosen to include emission from the Local, Sagittarius and Scutum arms. An 8 × 8 data cube centred at (ℓ, b) = (40, 0) is constructed of RRL spectra with velocity and spatial resolution of 27 and 15. 5 arcmin, respectively. Well-known regions are identified as well as the diffuse RRL emission on the Galactic plane. A Galactic latitude section of the integrated RRL emission across the Galactic plane delineates the brightness temperature (T_b) distribution which has a <b>half-power</b> <b>width</b> in latitude of ≃ 15. A value of the electron temperature T_e≃ 8000 K is derived from a comparison with the WMAP free-free MEM model.

In this paper we demonstrate that diffuse ionized emission on the Galactic ridge can be recovered using RRLs from the ZOA survey.

40|$|The {{sea surface}} {{directional}} wave spectrum was measured {{for the first}} time in all quadrants of a hurricane in open water using the NASA airborne scanning radar altimeter (SRA) carried aboard one of the NOAA WP- 3 D hurricane hunter aircraft at 1. 5 km height. The SRA measures the energetic portion of the directional wave spectrum by generating a topographic map of the sea surface. At 8 Hz, the SRA sweeps a radar beam of 1 ' <b>half-power</b> <b>width</b> (two-way) across the aircraft ground track over a swath equal to 0. 8 of the aircraft height, simultaneously measuring the backscattered power at its 36 GHz (8. 3 mm) operating frequency and the range to the sea surface at 64 positions. These slant ranges are multiplied by the cosine of the off-nadir angles to determine the vertical distances from the aircraft to the sea surface. Subtracting these distances from the aircraft height produces the sea surface elevation map. The sea surface topography is interpolated to a uniform grid, transformed by a two dimensional FFT, and Doppler corrected. The open-ocean data were acquired on 24 August 1998 when hurricane Bonnie was east of the Bahamas and moving toward 330 deg at about 5 m/s. Individual waves up to 18 m height were observed and the spatial variation of the wave field was dramatic. The dominant waves generally propagated at significant angles to the downwind direction. At some positions there were three different wave fields of comparable energy crossing each other. The NOAA aircraft spent over five hours within 180 km of the eye, and made five eye penetrations. On 26 August 1998, the NOAA aircraft flew at 2. 2 km height when hurricane Bonnie was making landfall near Wilmington, NC, documenting the directional wave spectrum in the region between Charleston, SC and Cape Hatteras, NC.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{interstellar}} medium and the interplay between the atomic and molecular components in a low-metallicity environment, we present a complete high angular and spectral resolution map and position-position-velocity data cube of the 12 CO(J = 2 - 1) emission from the Local Group galaxy Messier 33. Its metallicity is roughly half-solar, such that we can compare its interstellar medium {{with that of the}} Milky Way with the main changes being the metallicity and the gas mass fraction. The data have a 12 ″ angular resolution (~ 50 pc) with a spectral resolution of 2. 6 km s- 1 and a mean and median noise level of 20 mK per channel in antenna temperature. A radial cut along the major axis was also observed in the 12 CO(J = 1 - 0) line. The CO data cube and integrated intensity map are optimal when using H i data to define the baseline window and the velocities over which the CO emission is integrated. Great care was taken when building these maps, testing different windowing and baseline options, and investigating the effect of error beam pickup. The total CO(2 - 1) luminosity is 2. 8 × 107 K km s- 1 pc 2, following the spiral arms in the inner disk, with an average decrease in intensity approximately following an exponential disk with a scale length of 2. 1 kpc. There is no clear variation in the CO(2 - 1 / 1 - 0) intensity ratio with radius and the average value is roughly 0. 8. The total molecular gas mass is estimated, using a N(H 2) /ICO(1 - 0) = 4 × 1020 cm- 2 /(K km s- 1) conversion factor, to be 3. 1 × 108 M⊙, including helium. The CO spectra in the cube were shifted to zero velocity by subtracting the velocity of the H i peak from the CO spectra. Stacking these spectra over the whole disk yields a CO line with a <b>half-power</b> <b>width</b> of 12. 4 km s- 1. As a result, the velocity dispersion between the atomic and molecular components is extremely low, independently justifying the use of the H i line in building our maps. Stacking the spectra in concentric rings shows that the CO linewidth and possibly the CO-H i velocity dispersion decrease in the outer disk. The error beam pickup could produce the weak CO emission apparently from regions in which the H i line peak does not reach 10 K, such that no CO is actually detected in these regions. Using the CO(2 - 1) emission to trace the molecular gas, the probability distribution function of the H 2 column density shows an excess at high column density above a log-normal distribution...|$|E

The observatory is located at 46. 4 {degrees}N, 119. 6 {degrees}W at an elevation of 1088 m above mean sea level. The photometer measures the attenuation of direct solar radiation for different wavelengths using 12 filters.

Total optical depths for the five wavelength bands were derived from solar irradiance measurements taken at the observatory from August 5, 1979, to September 2, 1994; these total optical depth data are distributed with this numeric data package (NDP). To determine the contribution of atmospheric aerosols to the total optical depths, the effects of Rayleigh scattering and ozone absorption were subtracted (other molecular scattering was minimal for the five filters) to obtain total column aerosol optical depths. The total aerosol optical depths were further decomposed into tropospheric and stratospheric components by calculating a robustly smoothed mean background optical depth (tropospheric component) for each wavelength using data obtained during periods of low stratospheric aerosol loading. By subtracting the smoothed background tropospheric aerosol optical depths from the total aerosol optical depths, residual aerosol optical depths were obtained.
