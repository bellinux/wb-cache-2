Hit by a rogue wave when approaching the Horn, the boat pitchpoled (i.e. somersaulted <b>end-over-end).</b> Although they survived, {{and were able to}} make repairs in Talcahuano, Chile, they attempted the passage again, only to be rolled over, and dismasted for a second time, by another rogue wave, which again they miraculously survived.|$|E
25|$|A Slinky is a toy precompressed {{helical spring}} invented by Richard James {{in the early}} 1940s. It can perform a number of tricks, {{including}} travelling {{down a flight of}} steps <b>end-over-end</b> as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum, or appear to levitate {{for a period of time}} after it has been dropped. These interesting characteristics have contributed to its success as a toy in its home country of United States, resulting in many popular toys with slinky components in a wide range of countries.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, 1979, Hinton {{was racing}} the RB-51 in the Reno Air Races when a {{capacitor}} in the magneto failed, causing {{the engine to}} run on half its spark plugs. Not knowing what was wrong, Hinton pushed the plane to full throttle. This resulted in the supercharger carrying the extra pressure. Eventually, a bearing in the supercharger failed. Hinton finished the race in second place and moved to make an emergency landing. The supercharger failure resulted in a shaft failure, however; that shaft drove the oil pump, which in turn controlled the propeller pitch. The propellers went flat, acting as a huge air brake. The RB-51 crashed short of the runway. The wings were sheared off as the plane came down between two piles of rock and the fuel erupted in a fireball. The cockpit was thrown <b>end-over-end</b> away from the fire, yet Hinton survived with a broken back, leg, and ankle. His survival is attributed {{by one of the}} lead engineers, Pete Law, to additional braces and a roll bar installed on the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{is widely}} {{credited}} with two important innovations {{in the development}} of the modern game of American football. [...] First, he is credited with having invented the spiral snap. [...] Before Schulz, centers passed the ball to one of the backs in an <b>end-over-end</b> manner.|$|E
500|$|Fitch {{continued}} {{to control the}} aircraft's descent by adjusting engine thrust. With the loss of all hydraulics, the crew were unable to control airspeed independent from sink rate. On final descent, the aircraft was going 220 knots and sinking at 1,850 feet per minute (approximately 407km/h forward and 34km/h downward speed), while a safe landing would require 140 knots and 300 feet per minute (approximately 260km/h and 5km/h respectively). Fitch needed a seat for landing; Dvorak offered up his own, {{as it could be}} moved to a position behind the throttles. Dvorak sat in the cockpit's jump seat for landing. Fitch noticed the high sink rate and that the plane started to yaw right again, and pushed the throttles to full power in an attempt to mitigate the high sink rate and level the plane. There wasn't enough time for the flight crew [...] to react. The tip of the right wing hit the runway first, spilling fuel, which ignited immediately. The tail section broke off from the force of the impact, {{and the rest of the}} aircraft bounced several times, shedding the landing gear and engine nacelles and breaking the fuselage into several main pieces. On the final impact, the right wing was shorn off and the main part of the aircraft skidded sideways, rolled over onto its back, and slid to a stop upside-down in a corn field to the right of Runway 22. Witnesses reported that the aircraft [...] "cartwheeled" [...] <b>end-over-end,</b> but the investigation did not confirm this. The reports were due to misinterpretation of the video of the crash that showed the flaming right wing tumbling <b>end-over-end</b> and the intact left wing, still attached to the fuselage, rolling up and over as the fuselage flipped over.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{braking force}} of {{standard}} upright bikes {{comes from the}} front wheel. As the analysis above shows, if the brakes themselves are strong enough, the rear wheel is easy to skid, while the front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip the rider and bike over the front wheel. This is called a stoppie if the rear wheel is lifted but the bike does not flip, or an endo (abbreviated form of <b>end-over-end)</b> if the bike flips. On long or low bikes, however, such as cruiser motorcycles and recumbent bicycles, the front tire will skid instead, possibly causing a loss of balance. [...] Assuming no loss of balance, {{it is possible to}} calculate optimum braking performance depending on the bike's geometry, the location of center of gravity of bike and rider, and the maximum coefficient of friction.|$|E
2500|$|One of Emerson's memorable live show stunts with ELP {{involved}} {{playing a}} piano suspended 15 to 20 feet in mid-air and then rotated <b>end-over-end</b> with Emerson sitting at it. This was purely for visual effect, as according to Greg Lake, the piano was fake {{and had no}} works inside. In a 2014 interview with Classic Rock Music journalist Ray Shasho, Emerson {{was asked about the}} origin of the 'flying piano' and about the difficulty of performing while spinning in the air. He explained: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Thunderceptor {{design was}} one of two swept-wing {{modifications}} based on the original Republic F-84 Thunderjet, the other being the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak which was developed later. A serious problem with most swept wing designs of the era was dangerous performance at low speeds and high angle of attack. The stagnant airflow over the wing tended to [...] "slide" [...] towards the wingtips, which caused them to stall before the rest of the wing. In this situation the center of lift would rapidly shift forward relative to the center of mass, pitching the nose up and leading to an even greater angle of attack or, in extreme cases, <b>end-over-end</b> tumbling of the aircraft. Aircraft caught in this regime would often stall and crash, and a rash of such accidents with the North American F-100 Super Sabre led to the term [...] "Sabre dance".|$|E
2500|$|Knievel set most jump records {{using the}} XR-750, but since 2008, most jump records {{are held by}} stunt {{performer}} Bubba Blackwell. [...] Currently, the longest jump on the XR-750 by Bubba Blackwell was successfully made in 1999, when he jumped 15 buses at 157 feet. On August 6, 2015 the daredevil stunt performer Doug Danger [...] at the Sturgis Bike Rally at the Buffalo Chip, broke Knievel's record for most cars jumped on a XR-750 with 22 cars. [...] Knievel attempted this feat of 22 cars in Monroe, Washington on September 1, 1972 and cleared 21 cars but landed on the safety deck covering the 22nd car. Bubba Blackwell attempted the same 22-car jump In 2001 with horrible consequences. He flipped <b>end-over-end</b> when he missed the landing, nearly died and {{was in a coma}} for months. Danger accomplished this feat on Evel Knievel’s actual vintage 1972 Harley-Davidson XR-750. With no modification to the bike other than relocating foot pegs to accommodate Doug's height.|$|E
2500|$|A Slinky or [...] "Lazy Spring" [...] is a toy {{consisting}} of a helical spring that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling {{down a flight of}} steps <b>end-over-end</b> as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer Richard T. James while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs {{that could be used to}} support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a stack of books, to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the Gimbels, a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day.|$|E

If the caber {{lands on}} its end but falls {{back towards the}} thrower, the score is lower than for any <b>end-over-end</b> throw but {{is based upon the}} maximum {{vertical}} angle that the caber achieved (side-judging may involve a second judge).|$|E

50|$|End over end - Occasionally rafts will flip {{end over}} end.

To a skilled juggler, there is only a slight chance of being burned, but they are still dangerous.|$|E
