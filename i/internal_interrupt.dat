The IRQL values are specific to the x86, IA64 and AMD64 processor architectures that Windows can run on, though theoretically they can support other CPUs that use a similar interrupt scheme (such as the DEC Alpha and MIPS, which were supported briefly on early versions of Windows). What this essentially means is that APCs (Asychronous procedure calls), user threads and kernel mode operations can be interrupted and the system must run them at an IRQL lower than the thread scheduler (or [...] "dispatcher").|$|E

The {{source of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>interrupts</b> are hardware components inside the MCU (like the Timers). Using the timer/counter interrupts, you can trigger events at specific time intervals (without using functions like delay and millis). Because these interrupts have an asynchronous behavior, the main program flow can be executed normally and only when a temporal threshold is reached a specific ISR is executed. The timer increments a counter register, and when its maximum counting capacity is reached an overflow bit (flag) is set. The flag can be manually checked or it can trigger an interrupt request. At the ISR execution the fag is reset.

Here we describe and experimentally verify two novel stwintrons of the potato pathogen Helminthosporium solani. One instance involves alternative splicing of an <b>internal</b> intron <b>interrupting</b> the donor domain of an external intron and a second one interrupting the acceptor domain of an overlapping external intron, both events leading to identical mature mRNAs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{spliceosome}} is an RNA/protein complex, {{responsible for}} intron excision from eukaryotic nuclear transcripts. In bacteria, mitochondria and plastids, intron excision {{does not involve}} the spliceosome, but occurs through mechanisms dependent on intron RNA secondary and tertiary structure. For group II/III chloroplast introns, "twintrons" (introns within introns) have been described. The excision of the external intron, and thus proper RNA maturation, necessitates prior removal of the <b>internal</b> intron, which <b>interrupts</b> crucial sequences of the former. We have here predicted analogous instances of spliceosomal twintrons ("stwintrons") in filamentous fungi. In two specific cases, where the <b>internal</b> intron <b>interrupts</b> the donor of the external intron after the first or after the second nucleotide, respectively, we show that intermediates with the sequence predicted by the "stwintron" hypothesis, are produced in the splicing process. This implies that two successive rounds of RNA scanning by the spliceosome are necessary to produce the mature mRNA. The phylogenetic distributions of the stwintrons we have identified suggest that they derive from "late" events, subsequent to {{the appearance of the}} host intron. They may well not be limited to fungal nuclear transcripts, and their generation and eventual disappearance in the evolutionary process are relevant to hypotheses of intron origin and alternative splicing...|$|R

5000|$|Developed in 1935 by Rheinmetall-Borsig as a {{commercial}} venture as the MG-101 (later designated MK 101, with the [...] "MK" [...] abbreviating the term Maschinenkanone, as an autocannon), the MK 101 cannon was a 30 mm (1.18 in), long-barreled automatic cannon capable of firing nine different types of 30x184B mm ammunition (ranging from basic high explosive to tungsten-cored armor-piercing rounds). Featuring pneumatic cocking and fired by percussion via an electrical solenoid, the MK 101 was recoil-operated. In operation, the barrel and bolt recoiled 30 mm (1.18 in) to the rear after each shot. The bolt locked via a Stange-type machined sleeve with <b>internal</b> <b>interrupted</b> threads, similar to some Solothurn weapons such as the 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 30 light machine gun. The locking system was strong, but rate of fire was limited to a rather slow 230-260 rpm, which limited its use against other aircraft. Powerful and accurate for its day, it was carried primarily on the Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, commencing in late 1941. Fed by a 10-round (early versions) or a 30-round box magazine, the MK 101 could penetrate 75 mm (3 in) of armor at 300 m (330 yd) range. The dozen examples created of the Heinkel He 177A-1/U2 Zerstörer ("Destroyer") experimental prototype attack aircraft used twinned MK 101s on a forward-aimed limited-traverse mount, located in the extreme lower nose {{at the front of}} a dramatically enlarged Bola inverted-casemate gondola emplacement under the nose, and was intended for anti-shipping and possible [...] "train-busting" [...] use, but was never deployed in combat. When it was used from beneath an Hs 129's central fuselage as a ventral gun pod-mounted anti-tank weapon, the MK 101's tungsten-cored AP round was capable of penetrating the turret and side armor of the Soviet KV-1 heavy tank. An electrically-fired version of the MK 101 cannon was later developed and designated the MK 103.|$|R

40|$|In {{hurricane}} eyewalls, {{the vertical}} stretching effect tends {{to produce an}} annular ring of high vorticity. Idealized, unforced nondivergent barotropic model results have suggested such rings of vorticity are often barotropically unstable, leading to strong asymmetric mixing events where vorticity is mixed inward into a more stable configuration. Such mixing events most often result in weakened maximum winds. The manner in which forcing modifies these unforced simulations remains an open question. In the current study, a forced, two-dimensional barotropic model is used to systematically study the sensitivity of vorticity rings to ring geometry and spatially and temporally varying forcing. The simulations reveal an <b>internal</b> mechanism that <b>interrupts</b> the intensification process resulting from vorticity generation in the hurricane eyewall.

40|$|AbstractGeochemical {{trapping}} {{is regarded}} as one of the promising geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Also carbonate mineralization takes advantage of permeability reduction to seal formations with decreasing CO 2 leakage risk and increasing storage safety. As precipitation rates tend to be faster and the solubility product shows lower value at higher temperature, the calcite- and kaolinite- rich rock produced through CO 2 -water-rock interaction is expected to form the scale in geothermal reservoirs. Ca 2 + released from rocks could be removed as carbonate minerals (CaCO 3) during CO 2 sequestration into aquifer rocks. However, when, where, and how much calcite deposits at the reservoir. For this reason, flow experiments and numerical calculation of advection-reaction model have been done to predict where and when the mineral deposits and permeability changes. The experimental and numerical results provided that fluid velocity change between fracture and porous media have more than one-order discrepancy at isothermal condition. When the fluid velocity in fracture exceeds the critical velocity, surface erosion allows re-entrainment.

The NGOs' effectiveness can be amplified by ensuring accountability. The study was initiated to address a vital issue: how NGOs' are ensuring accountability to diverse stakeholders. The study carried out in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has possibly been the most important hearth on the world for non-governmental organizations. NGOs in Bangladesh have shown a significant success over last few decades. In spite of significant achievements, NGOs have been under attack from different bodies like bureaucrats, politicians, business community, religious groups and even civil society. Thus, NGO accountability has become a critical issue. The present study tries to examine the accountability practice of NGOs in Bangladesh. The analytical framework of the study grounded on the Najam's stakeholder's approach. Here accountability has been scrutinized with regard to government, donor, internal governance and beneficiaries. This framework was supplemented by principal-agent model and resource dependency theory. In addition, Kilby's accountability schema and the concept of participation ladder were employed to see the level of downward accountability. The study collected primary data from four different NGOs. Also, evidence was collected from secondary sources whenever it was necessary. The study applied case study as a research strategy, and the research approach was entirely qualitative using in-depth interview, observation, focus group discussion and wide range of document review. The study findings indicate that NGO bureau Bangladesh has wide range of regulatory framework and mechanisms to oversee NGOs. Despite of having well-structured legal framework, bureau are suffering of limited human resource and other logistics supports. These shortcomings hinder NGO bureau to keep a close tab on NGOs activity. On the top of that, some NGOs have a political ally with government that deteriorated the situation more. Compared with bureau, donors are more tactical in ensuring their partner NGOs' accountability. Donors provide more elaborate guidelines and maintain more intensive follow up on NGOs activity to ensure that NGOs are implementing programme/project according to donors' prescription. Donors' financial edge plays a pivotal role in donor-NGO relations. The pattern of accountability to donors varies donor to donor depending on their types and nature. With regard to internal accountability, the <b>internal</b> accountability is <b>interrupted</b> due to hierarchical and poor governance practice of NGOs.
