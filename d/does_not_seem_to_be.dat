5|$|When Europeans first {{contacted}} Native Americans, some bows, {{especially in}} the area that became California, already had sinew backing. After the reintroduction of horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were often given sinew backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and sinew <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with sinew backing are not recorded before European contact.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} {{the text of}} the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark {{is found}} off {{southern}} India and Sri Lanka, {{as well as}} from southern China and Taiwan to Java and Borneo. It may also occur in the Philippines and the Red Sea, though specimens from these regions need to be compared taxonomically with those from its confirmed range. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very common naturally. This species inhabits continental and insular shelves from inshore waters to at least a depth of , and usually swims close to the sea floor.|$|E

5|$|This {{indicates}} {{the existence of}} two groups: Lucius Gellius Publicola eventually attacked Crixus {{and a group of}} some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. Plutarch describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. While this factional split is not contradicted by classical sources, there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any direct evidence to support it.|$|E
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was {{maintained}} between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher; and her mother came to live there. It is recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any authoritative statement as to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but {{it is likely to}} have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.|$|E

5|$|Lydford Castle <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{primarily}} designed {{to have a}} military function, although in 1199 when King John succeeded to the throne he had the castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in the region. The castle lacked the usual military features of the time, such as external gatehouses, and its design {{seems to have been}} intended to evoke the authority of a traditional defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack. Instead, as well as helping to deal with the wider problems in 1195, the castle appears to have been built with the intention of enforcing the stannary and forest law in Devon. It is possible that the Crown originally intended that the castle took over the stannary law across the whole of Cornwall and Devon, although in practice its role extended only to governing the Devon stannaries.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, but it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals {{with a little help}} from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E
