40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the findings of}} a qualitative study that sought to identify the changing role of the child health nurse within the contemporary health service environment. Using a case study design, a picture of contemporary child health nursing services in Brisbane and surrounding areas was established. Contemporary services include both individual consultations with mothers and their children, group education sessions, parent management clinics and parenting programs. These contemporary services represent a significant shift in focus from original <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> established in the early 20 th century but are also similar in their aim of providing education and support for women and their families in the community setting...|$|E
40|$|These four {{publications}} vary {{significantly in}} their geographical coverage and general subject matter, {{but it is}} still possible to identify a number of common themes. They are particularly important for what they reveal about the links between formal welfare provision, protective legislation, family care, and the standard of living. They also yield many individual insights into such matters as family reconstitution, migration, child labour, working conditions, municipal welfare services, the decline of infant and maternal mortality, and the possible existence of a demographic threat to the viability of modern welfare states.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this Ecoso Exchange is to present some ideas on work-based, work-related and {{community}} child-care issues {{with the aim of}} ensuring: 1. That the initiatives that are being taken by trade unionists are linked with community movements; 2. Strengthening local government’s role in providing social services. Background Information to this is that the new Federal Government child care funding arrangements were announced in last year's Budget (1988). These provided incentives (mainly tax deductions) to encourage industry to invest in the provision of child care for their employees. Thus 1, 000 of the 4, 000 new centre based child care places will be earmarked for a "co-operative venture" with industry. These "co-operative ventures" could be for work-based care, or a combination of work based and community care.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Irish and Jewish mothers' {{experience of}} maternity provision and infant care services in East London {{in the years}} 1870 - 1939. As newcomers these immigrants not only {{had to cope with}} poverty but also the barriers of language and different cultural customs. Leaving their family and kinship networks behind them, Irish and Jewish mothers had to find new sources of support when incapacitated through pregnancy or childbirth. Living in one of the poorest areas of London and unfamiliar with the local medical and welfare services, these immigrants might be expected to have suffered very poor health. On closer examination, however, Irish and Jewish immigrants appear to have had remarkably low rates of infant and maternal mortality. Despite the difficulties they faced as newcomers, Irish and Jewish mothers had certain advantages over the local population in East London. They were not only able to rely on the prolific and diverse services already present in East London, but could also call upon their own communal organisations. This provision offered a wide range of care and was a vital support to the newcomers. After examining the social and economic background to Irish and Jewish emigration and settlement the thesis examines what impact this had on their health patterns, particularly infant and maternal mortality. The following chapters explore what forms of support were available to married Irish and Jewish mothers through their own family and local neighbourhood and communal agencies. Chapter five concerns the unmarried mother and what provision was made specifically for her. The care offered by the host society to immigrant mothers and their infants is explored in chapters 6 to 8. Institutions covered by these chapters include voluntary hospitals, Poor Law infirmaries, and charitable organisations such as district nursing associations and medical missions. The thesis examines not only the services available to Irish and Jewish mothers, but also the attitudes of health professionals and philanthropists towards immigrants and how these affected the accessibility and acceptability of maternity and <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> to Irish and East European Jewish mothers. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{explanation}} of the development of pre-school children 2 ̆ 7 s services (infant welfare, kindergartens and child care) at local government level in Victoria. The critical framework of analysis focuses on three dimensions of public policy: 1) the socio-historical environment; 2) the political processes involved {{in the development of the}} specific children 2 ̆ 7 s service; and 3) the major individuals and groups that exerted pressure for children 2 ̆ 7 s service, The argument is threefold. Firstly it is argued that the political environment of children 2 ̆ 7 s services has been dominated by the practice of separate spheres of public and private, in which the care of children is primarily the role of women. Secondly, it is argued that the political processes surrounding the development of local children 2 ̆ 7 s services have involved all levels of government in what is termed a local state. Thirdly, it is argued that the development of these children 2 ̆ 7 s services in local government has resulted mainly from the work of women both individually and collectively. Since the three services of infant welfare, kindergartens and child care all became a normal function of children 2 ̆ 7 s services at different times, the circumstances that surrounded each development exhibited different aspects of the three major arguments. The periodisation is broken into four phases: 1) the establishment of local government with no children 2 ̆ 7 s services in the nineteenth century; 2) the establishment of <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in local government in the early part of the twentieth century; 3) the incorporation of kindergartens into local government after the second world war; and 4) the incorporation of child care into local government in the 1970 s and 1980 s. The thesis concludes by arguing that the existence of children 2 ̆ 7 s services in local government in Victoria is testimony to the remarkable work of those women who have pursued the issue both individually and collectively. It has been the identification of children 2 ̆ 7 s services as a women 2 ̆ 7 s issue in Australian politics that has enabled women 2 ̆ 7 s groups at different times to influence the policy makers in diverse ways. However, while the establishment of children 2 ̆ 7 s services as a legitimate political concern brings the matter onto the public agenda, the separate spheres still remains a contested issue in the public policies of children 2 ̆ 7 s services...|$|E

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} {{research}} project, we interviewed ten parents with refugee backgrounds about their experiences of contact with child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in Norway. Despite parents describing both positive and negative experiences, and trust as well as distrust, we found that fear of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> was a central theme. Thematic analyses showed that fear of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> was not primarily related to the interviewees' own negative experiences, but to a variety of perceptions or representations of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> that informants described as common or prevalent among people from ethnic minorities in general. We found that the representations of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> could be categorized into the following themes: 1) child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> primarily take children away from parents, 2) child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> do not go into dialogue with parents, and 3) child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> discriminate against ethnic minority families. The analysis is discussed critically in light of Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser's understandings of recognition and social justice. We suggest that the parents’ fear of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> can be understood as fear of experiencing humiliation and disrespect through contact with child welfare services; fear of losing their children, becoming invisible and being discriminated against. A key implication of the study is the need for further research that examines the fear of child welfare among people from ethnic minorities, as well as measures that address distrust of services in parts of the population...|$|R

40|$|The <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> {{movement}} in Britain has received considerable scholarly attention but continues to generate controversy and debate. Many {{of the services}} began with nineteenth-century voluntary initiative but were later developed by local authorities. Critics have drawn attention to the limitations of such provision; arguing that it was predicated on unattractive assumptions about class and gender roles. Under this interpretation working-class mothers were viewed with suspicion and targeted for advice aimed at inculcating middle-class standards of childcare and housekeeping. This paper accepts {{that there was an}} authoritarian character to much of the early welfare work but suggests that over time this gave way to more inclusive approaches that sought to provide clients with the services that met their real rather than assumed needs.

40|$|<b>Welfare</b> <b>service</b> work is {{traditionally}} understood to comprise embodied, situational and social practices {{of care that}} are central to a worker’s professional self-image. Over the past few decades, public management reforms have called for reassessment of <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> workers’ professional accountability through practices of medico-managerial service management. These practices promote the production of transparency and accountability in <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> work through checking-based trust and disembodied professional practices. This article argues that {{the changes in the}} nature of trust toward <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> professionals have implications for care work cultures and workers’ professional agency that has traditionally built on the idea of the embodied, situational and social practice of <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> work. Drawing on an interview study with Finnish <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> workers (n= 25), the article analyses front-line workers’ descriptions of medico-managerial management in the social and health care sector. The results point to the significance of embodied practices of care in creation of client trust and for workers’ professional self-images.
