The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and <b>intercellular</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

25|$|Low {{molecular}} weight PAHs, with 2 to 4 aromatic hydrocarbon rings, are more potent as co-carcinogens during the promotional stage of cancer. In this stage, an initiated cell (i.e., a cell that has retained a carcinogenic mutation {{in a key}} gene related to cell replication) is removed from growth-suppressing signals from its neighboring cells and begins to clonally replicate. Low {{molecular weight}} PAHs that have bay or bay-like regions can dysregulate gap junction channels, interfering with <b>intercellular</b> <b>communication,</b> and also affect mitogen-activated protein kinases that activate transcription factors involved in cell proliferation. Closure of gap junction protein channels is a normal precursor to cell division. Excessive closure of these channels after exposure to PAHs results in removing a cell from the normal growth-regulating signals imposed by its local community of cells, thus allowing initiated cancerous cells to replicate. These PAHs {{do not need to}} be enzymatically metabolized first. Low molecular weight PAHs are prevalent in the environment, thus posing a significant risk to human health at the promotional phases of cancer.|$|E
40|$|Citrullinemia and argininosuccinic aciduria are two {{disorders}} {{resulting from}} defects in two consecutive enzymes of the urea cycle, argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase. Fibroblast cell lines {{were derived from}} patients with these disorders and the diagnoses, which had been {{made on the basis}} of amino acid levels in plasma and urine, were confirmed by demonstrating that the cell lines were unable to incorporate 14 c-citrulline into protein. DNA from the argininosuccinate synthetase-deficient (ASS⁻) cells was analysed by restriction enzyme digestion and hybridisation to a cDNA probe which had been cloned from human argininosuccinate synthetase mRNA. No defect in the patient's DNA could be demonstrated, indicating that no major deletions in the argininosuccinate synthetase genes were present in this patient. Co-cultures of the ASS⁻ and argininosuccinate lyase-deficient (ASL⁻) fibroblasts were able to incorporate 14 citrulline into protein at rates comparable to normal fibroblasts. This complementation did not require cell fusion, was dependent on cell contact, and was not the result of exchange of metabolites or enzymes via the culture medium. These results indicated that complementation occurred by the exchange of metabolites via intercellular junctions between the two cell types. Co-cultures of ASS⁻ and ASL⁻ cells were used as an assay system for measuring <b>intercellular</b> junctional <b>communication.</b> This allowed quantitation of the effects of pH and extracellular divalent cations on junctional communication. Tumor promoters such as phorbol esters and organochlorine pesticides have been reported to inhibit <b>intercellular</b> junctional <b>communication</b> in other systems, and this inhibitory activity may be related to the mechanism of tumor promotion. The organochlorine pesticide 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) was shown to be an inhibitor of junctional communication in ASS⁻/ASL⁻ cocultures. This inhibition was reversible, of rapid onset, and independent of extracellular calcium. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12 - 0 -tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 - acetate (TPA) also rapidly induced inhibition of junctional communication. However, co-cultures between Chinese hamster V 79 cells, which are deficient in ASS⁻, and ASL⁻ human fibroblasts were more sensitive to inhibition by TPA than the original ASS⁻/ASL⁻ co-cultures. Refractoriness to TPA occurred following prolonged treatment with high concentrations of TPA. Retinoic acid and other retinoids also inhibited junctional communication, and the inhibitory effects of retinoic acid and TPA were additive. The significance of these results in relation to the anti-tumor-promoting activity of retinoic acid is discussed. It is concluded that co-cultures of ASS⁻ and ASL⁻ cells constitute a useful system for providing quantitative measurements of <b>intercellular</b> junctional <b>communication</b> under a wide range of experimental conditions...|$|R

Intracellular calcium was expressed as the fura 2 ratio. The diameter was measured using a digital image acquisition system. Stimulation of SMCs with the alpha(1) -agonist phenylephrine (PE) caused not only an increase in the free intracellular calcium concentration of the SMCs as expected but also in the ECs, suggesting a calcium flux from the SMCs to the ECs. The gap junction uncoupler palmitoleic acid greatly reduced this increase in calcium in the ECs on stimulation of the SMCs with PE. This indicates that the signaling pathway passes through the gap junctions. Similarly, although vasomotion originates in the SMCs, calcium oscillates in both SMCs and ECs during vasomotion, suggesting again a calcium flux from the SMCs to the ECs...|$|R

Materials and methods.   The study was done using the original neurovascular unit model  in vitro. The NVU consisted of three cell types: neurons, astrocytes, and cerebral endothelial cells derived from rats. Hypoxia was induced by incubating cells with sodium iodoacetate for 30 min at 37  °C in standard culture conditions. Results.   We investigated the role of connexin 43 in the regulation of cell interactions within the NVU in normal and hypoxic injury  in vitro.  We found that astrocytes were characterized by high levels of expression of Cx 43 and low level of CD 38 expression, neurons demonstrated high levels of CD 38 and low levels of Cx 43. In hypoxic conditions, the expression of Cx 43 and CD 38 in astrocytes markedly increased while CD 38 expression in neurons decreased, however no changes were found in endothelial cells. Suppression of Cx 43 activity resulted in down-regulation of CD 38 in NVU cells, both in physiological conditions and at chemical hypoxia. Conclusion.   Thus, the Cx-regulated <b>intercellular</b> NAD+-dependent <b>communication</b> and secretory phenotype of astroglial cells that are the part of the blood-brain barrier is markedly changed in hypoxia. </span...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that people who consume diets with a high content of {{vegetables}} have a re-duced risk of degenerative diseases such as specific cancers, cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degenerative dis-ease (AMD), and cataracts. There is no convincing evidence that the protective role of vegetables against cancer and cardio-vascular disease is due to carotenoids.

Increased use of cooked tomato products also has been shown to reduce prostate cancer risk as a result of increased bioavailability of cis-lycopene.

40|$|<b>Intercellular</b> {{electrical}} <b>communication</b> between {{smooth muscle}} and endothelial cells was examined in guinea-pig mesenteric arterioles using the whole-cell patch-clamp method. The time {{course of the}} current required to impose a 10 mV voltage clamp step {{was used to determine}} the extent of electrical coupling between them. Currents recorded from both smooth muscle and endothelial cells relaxed in a multi-exponential manner, indicating the existence of electrical coupling between cells. 18 β-Glycyrrhetinic acid, a gap junction blocker, quickly blocked electrical communication at 40 μM, while neither heptanol nor octanol did so at concentrations of up to 1 mM. In the current clamp mode, repetitive spikes, induced by 10 mM Ba 2 + solutions, could be recorded from both kinds of cells. After blocking gap junctions, spikes could only be recorded from the smooth muscle cell layer, indicating that they had been conducted through myoendothelial junctions. In endothelial cells, acetylcholine (ACh, 3 μM) induced hyperpolarizing responses, which had two phases (an initial fast and a second slower phase) in the current clamp condition. This ACh response persisted in the presence of 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid, although this compound seemed to make the membrane slightly leaky. After blocking gap junctions, the membrane potential of a single cell in a multicellular preparation could be well clamped. Thus, 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid may be useful in studying the function of both arteriolar smooth muscle and endothelial cells while they remain located within a multicellular preparation...|$|R
40|$|D. J. N. and V. M. contributed {{equally to}} this work. ABSTRACT Many {{filamentous}} cyanobacteria produce specialized nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts, which are located at semiregular intervals along the filament with about 10 to 20 photosynthetic vegetative cells in between. Nitrogen fixation in these complex multicellular bacteria depends onmetabolite exchange {{between the two}} cell types, with the heterocysts supplying combined-nitrogen compounds but dependent on the vegetative cells for photosynthetically produced carbon compounds. Here, we used a fluorescent tracer to probe intercellular metabolite exchange in the filamentous heterocyst-forming cyanobacte-rium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. We show that esculin, a fluorescent sucrose analog, is incorporated by a sucrose import sys-tem into the cytoplasm of Anabaena cells. The cytoplasmic esculin is rapidly and reversibly exchanged across vegetative-vegetative and vegetative-heterocyst cell junctions. Our measurements reveal the kinetics of esculin exchange and also show that <b>intercellular</b> metabolic <b>communication</b> is lost in a significant fraction of older heterocysts. SepJ, FraC, and FraD are proteins located at the intercellular septa and are suggested to form structures analogous to gap junctions. We show that a sepJ fraC fraD triple mutant shows an altered septum structure with thinner septa but a denser peptidoglycan layer. Intercellular diffusion of esculin and fluorescein derivatives is impaired in this mutant, which also shows a greatly reduced frequency of nanopores in the intercellular septal cross walls.
