A new redundant array of independent memory (RAIM) technology is being introduced to provide protection at the dynamic random access memory (DRAM), <b>dual</b> <b>inline</b> <b>memory</b> module (DIMM), and memory channel level. Three full DRAM failures per rank can be corrected. DIMM level failures, including components such as the controller application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), the power regulators, the clocks, and the board, can be corrected. Memory channel failures such as signal lines, control lines, and drivers/receivers on the MCM can be corrected. Upstream and downstream data signals can be spared using two spare wires on both the upstream and downstream paths. One of these signals can be used to spare a clock signal line (one upstream and one downstream). Together these improvements are designed to deliver System z's most resilient memory subsystem to date.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Technology scaling {{has led to}} {{significant}} variability in chip performance and power consumption. In this work, we measured and analyzed the power variability in dynamic random access memories (DRAMs). We tested 22 double date rate third generation (DDR 3) <b>dual</b> <b>inline</b> <b>memory</b> modules (DIMMs), and found that power usage in DRAMs depends on both operation type (write, read, and idle) as well as data, with write operations con-suming more than reads, and 1 s in the data generally costing more power than 0 s. Temperature had little effect (1 – 3 %) across the 50 C to 50 C range. Variations were up to 12. 29 % and 16. 40 % for idle power within a single model and for different models from the same vendor, respectively.

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} status of the NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Double Data Rate 2 (DDR 2) Reliability effort for FY 2012. The task expanded the focus of evaluating reliability effects targeted for device examination. FY 11 work highlighted the need to test many more parts and to examine more operating conditions, in order to provide useful recommendations for NASA users of these devices. This year's efforts focused on development of test capabilities, particularly focusing on those {{that can be used to}} determine overall lot quality and identify outlier devices, and test methods that can be employed on components for flight use. Flight acceptance of components potentially includes considerable time for up-screening (though this time may not currently be used for much reliability testing). Manufacturers are much more knowledgeable about the relevant reliability mechanisms for each of their devices. We are not in a position to know what the appropriate reliability tests are for any given device, so although reliability testing could be focused for a given device, we are forced to perform a large campaign of reliability tests to identify devices with degraded reliability. With the available up-screening time for NASA parts, it is possible to run many device performance studies. This includes verification of basic datasheet characteristics. Furthermore, it is possible to perform significant pattern sensitivity studies. By doing these studies we can establish higher reliability of flight components. In order to develop these approaches, it is necessary to develop test capability that can identify reliability outliers. To do this we must test many devices to ensure outliers are in the sample, and we must develop characterization capability to measure many different parameters. For FY 12 we increased capability for reliability characterization and sample size. We increased sample size this year by moving from loose devices to <b>dual</b> <b>inline</b> <b>memory</b> modules (DIMMs) with an approximate reduction of 20 to 50 times in terms of per device under test (DUT) cost. By increasing sample size we have improved our ability to characterize devices that may be considered reliability outliers.

40|$|A new {{passive sensor}} for remote {{measurement}} of water content in sandy soil was designed, using a {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) reflective delay line. Information from this sensor {{can be obtained by}} an interrogation device via a radio link operating in the European 434 -MHz industrial-scientific-medical band. The SAW device, manufactured on the YZ cut of LiNbO 3, is mounted and sealed in a standard <b>dual</b> <b>inline</b> 16 package and contains four electroacoustic transducers. One transducer is connected to an external antenna to pick up an RF request signal from the interrogation device and to send back an RF response. The second transducer operates as a reflector. The bus bars of this transducer are connected with two measuring rods through an electrical transmission line. These rods can be inserted into sandy soil. The final two transducers operate as reflectors and are included for reference purposes. The transmission line and the two rods spanning the sand-water mixture have a ch aracteristic impedance Zload, which loads the second transducer. Changes in the soil water content are observed as a change of the total permittivity due to the high permittivity of free water, which, in turn, affects Zload as well. The amplitude and phase of the acoustic reflection at the second transducer changes due to a variation of the terminating Zload. This then results in a difference in attenuation and phase of the corresponding peak in the time domain. Thus, the RF response of the sensor carries information about the water content between the rods, which, therefore, can be detected by and evaluated in the interrogation unit...|$|R
