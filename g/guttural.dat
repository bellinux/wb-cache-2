5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. <b>Guttural</b> grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Kehaar: A {{black-headed gull}} who is forced, by an injured wing, to take refuge on Watership Down, and befriends the rabbits when they help him. He is {{characterized}} by his frequent impatience, <b>guttural</b> accent and unusual phrasing. After discovering the Efrafa warren and helping the rabbits, he rejoins his colony, but promises to visit. According to Adams, Kehaar {{was based on a}} fighter from the Norwegian Resistance in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Devourment is an American death metal {{band from}} Dallas, Texas. Formed in 1995, the band has split up and {{reformed}} three times leaving Brad Fincher {{as the only}} original member. The current lineup is Ruben Rosas, Chris Andrews, Dave Spencer and Brad Fincher.

Devourment has also had albums re-released by other labels.|$|E

50|$|Phlegeton has {{a diverse}} vocal register, {{encompassing}} many extreme styles, from deep <b>gutturals</b> {{to clean and}} raspy high-pitched vocals.|$|R
5|$|Progressive rock {{elements}} {{appear in}} other metal subgenres. Black metal is conceptual by definition, {{due to its}} prominent theme of questioning the values of Christianity. Its <b>guttural</b> vocals are sometimes used by bands who can be classified as progressive, such as Mastodon, Mudvayne and Opeth. Symphonic metal {{is an extension of}} the tendency towards orchestral passages in early progressive rock. Progressive rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as post-rock, post-metal and avant-garde metal, math rock, power metal and neo-classical metal.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a <b>guttural</b> hiss emitted when alarmed, which is {{interspersed}} with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a <b>guttural</b> voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low <b>guttural</b> rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the <b>guttural</b> sound of their accents.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, {{producing}} {{a range of}} raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male {{producing a}} loud cackle and the female a whistling call. The male's cackle is loudest between 1and 3kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles {{that may or may}} not ascend in tone and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single chock note that may be harsh and <b>guttural</b> or have 4–5 harmonics. This is thought to be a contact call. These calls all carry over long distances.|$|E

25|$|Secretarybirds {{associate}} in monogamous pairs. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with <b>guttural</b> croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing {{each other with}} their wings up and back, much {{like the way they}} chase prey. They usually mate on the ground, although some do so in Acacia trees.|$|E
25|$|Chinese opera {{has been}} a popular form of {{entertainment}} for many centuries, from the Nanxi of Song Dynasty to the Beijing opera of today. The music is often <b>guttural</b> with high-pitched vocals, usually accompanied by suona, jinghu, other kinds of string instruments, and percussion. Other types of opera include clapper opera, Pingju, Cantonese opera, puppet opera, Kunqu, Sichuan opera, Qinqiang, ritual masked opera and Huangmei xi.|$|E

25|$|Cynic's 2008 album Traced in Air melded {{together}} the styles and influences heard on 1993's Focus {{with the more}} progressive-oriented Portal approach. The result had Cynic put less emphasis on its extreme metal elements, with new <b>guttural</b> vocalist Tymon Kruidenier playing a smaller role than Tony Teegarden did on Focus. Additionally, Paul Masvidal all but abandoned his vocoder robotic vocals, opting instead for a more natural singing voice, with a subtler —although noticeable— vocoder layer that increases an octave his voice.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that 'QC over-identifies with an 'exotic' militant punk persona to interrogate category-driven capitalist networks, through staging and virally inserting her artistic practice within pop culture, traversing music venues, forging protests and entering art galleries in order to emulate and interrupt the operations of these cultural zones'. Quilla Constance stages interventions across an interdisciplinary practice of paintings, lectures, photographs, live performances, costumes and music videos. Her live performance work has been noted for its 'unflinching physical narrative performed entirely through breath, posture and non-verbal sounds: panting like a dog, sex noises, then laughter, pure <b>guttural</b> anger, and back again'.|$|E
