25|$|Celsus writing late in {{the second}} century {{produced}} the first full-scale attack on Christianity. Celsus' document has not survived but in the third century Origen replied to <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> is known of Celsus' writing is through the responses of Origen. According to Origen, Celsus accused Jesus of being a magician and a sorcerer. While the statements of Celsus may be seen as valuable, they have little historical value, given that the wording of the original writings can not be examined.|$|E
25|$|Food versus fuel is {{the dilemma}} {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production {{to the detriment of}} the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics try to {{illustrate}} Bond's psyche in Casino Royale, described by Cornell as a conflicted and tough spy with more emotional depth, not the [...] "superconfident, seemingly invincible, winking kinda ladies' man superspy" [...] {{of the previous}} incarnations. Cornell {{tried to focus on}} the existential dilemmas and possible sacrifices of secret agents - [...] "There's an isolation in that; the stakes are very high. I've done a lot of living in my 42 years, and it wasn't hard for me to relate to that." [...] The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title [...] "You Know My Name" [...] - dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, [...] "introducing himself to what may be {{the rest of his life}} and how he will live <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it will mean." ...|$|E

[...] The family of Gordie Howe also commented on the damage to Gordie's star. The Canadian Press reported that [...] "A number of celebrities' stars are looking a bit rough around the edges." [...] The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage {{was due to the}} freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe's damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Darren Gawle of Drop-D magazine criticised the lyrics for their vague observations about obvious truths, stating: [...] "The only shocking thing about Black Eye {{lies in a}} band trying to pass themselves off as Riot Grrls {{when in fact they}} pack as much 'Grrr' as a slightly vexed Yorkshire Terrier." [...] In contrast, Colin Weston of Drowned in Sound commented: [...] "The thing about Fluffy, is they aren't the most lyrically challenging of bands, but their music more then [...] makes up for <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they DO say, you understand immediately... not messing about with 'Deep and meaningful' lyrics, these girls have got something to say, and say it the only way they know how... in your face!!!"

[...] In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all [...] "entertaining, and satirically quite sharp", but [...] "the art world has chosen not to think .... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed all three of Swift's prior music videos. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she felt that since Fanjoy directed her prior videos, {{she knew how to}} deviate from <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> new grounds to cover. As opposed to their previous collaborations, the video was conceptualized to be edgy and comical. Swift herself was styled edgier than usual, sporting clothing, hair, and jewelry she was not accustomed to. She was intended to wear thigh-length boots, but was not able to find a pair to correspond with her height. Instead, her stylist sewed black fabric to strap onto black high heels to give the illusion of thigh-length boots. The video's plot was conjectured to involve rampaging and seeking revenge on her ex-boyfriend. Swift chose football player Justin Sandy to portray her ex-boyfriend in the video, believing he had a classic and suspiciously perfect demeanor; she described him as [...] "real like Ken". Swift desired to portray her backup band's sense of humor, and thus enlisted them for the video. Swift's real-life best friend Abigail Anderson also made a cameo appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011 {{press reports}} had {{indicated}} that the party was unlikely to run a candidate both for financial reasons and also because {{it was unlikely that}} a Fianna Fáil nominee could be successful. In early August 2011 there was press speculation that RTÉ broadcaster Gay Byrne might seek a nomination. On 6 August Micheál Martin rang Byrne at his holiday home to indicate that Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members would facilitate his nomination. Byrne indicated that he had yet to make a decision on whether to put his name forward, but said that if he did so he would not run under the Fianna Fáil banner but as an independent, albeit {{with the assistance of the}} party's organisation. [...] "Fianna Fáil are convinced no matter who they put up will be unelectable, so they're giving me their support" [...] he told the Irish Independent. Éamon Ó Cuív, the party's deputy leader and member of the committee tasked with deciding on their strategy for the election stated that [...] "I know of no approach to Gay Byrne... Nobody has discussed the issue with me— good, bad or indifferent." [...] On 13 August Byrne informed Martin that he would not be going forward for nomination. He stated that the idea of running had been [...] "foisted on him and he had not known anything about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it would involve". This followed unease among Fianna Fáil parliamentary party Oireachtas members, with a number unhappy that a candidate was being imposed by the leadership without discussion.|$|E

"And Then There Were Fewer" [...] {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} viewers, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "solidly funny, well-plotted, and nearly perfectly executed". In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff commented that he enjoyed [...] "the 'a bunch of people go to an isolated place and start getting killed' murder mystery subgenre", and that the episode [...] "made fun of the conceits of the genre". In the conclusion of his review VanDerWerff called the episode [...] "excellent and fun", and [...] "full of surprisingly gorgeous animation and a nicely creepy feel that hung over all of the jokes" [...] and rated it as a B+, the best rating between The Simpsons episode [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] and The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Browner". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the episode's writers for doing a [...] "solid job of creating a genuine mystery throughout the hour, keeping us guessing as to who did <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> their motive may have been". Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's numerous guest stars, and compared its portrayal of Diane Simmons to that of The Simpsons character Sideshow Bob. Natalie Zutter of Ology also praised the episode, calling it, [...] "Surprisingly, {{the best of the}} evening." [...] In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a [...] "fun murder mystery that lets us see all our favorite Quahog folks", while continuing to wonder whether the characters who were killed off would remain dead.|$|E

He can also attack enemies {{while in the}} air or while standing by simply holding the sword in position.

Players collect gems in order to [...] "bribe" [...] the creature who guards the entrance to the next level; if players do not have enough gems, they cannot progress to the next level.

Kuros has a life meter which decreases as time passes and when he sustains damage from enemies. Players loses a life when Kuros' life meter runs out, but upon restarting they keep all the items they have obtained up to that point. The game ends when all three lives have been lost, but players have the choice to continue and restart at the level in which they lost their last life; upon continuing, players keep all their items obtained up to that point, but their score goes back to zero. Along the way, players can replenish Kuros' life meter by collecting pieces of meat scattered throughout the levels.|$|E
