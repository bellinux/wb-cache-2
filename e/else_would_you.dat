500|$|Calgary Sun {{columnist}} Eric Francis called McMahon's {{decision to}} continue the event [...] "sick, disrespectful and wrong. But what <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> expect from the WWF?" [...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on as if nothing had happened, is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2005 interview, Rowling {{added that}} Draco, unlike Harry, never feels remorse for his actions: [...] "I thought of Draco {{as someone who}} is very capable of compartmentalising his life and his emotions, and always has done. So he's shut down his pity, {{enabling}} him to bully effectively. He's shut down compassionâ€” how <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> become a Death Eater?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE BYSTANDER [inept at definition] It's a--well, it's a copper's nark, as {{you might}} say. What <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> call it? A sort of informer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} think I haven't {{got it in}} me to care very much for one person only. Some one <b>else</b> <b>would</b> make <b>you</b> a better wife. I can imagine you very happy with some one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jake," [...] he said, [...] "is most too mean to live. He {{strikes you}} a dollar for your breakfast {{and another for}} supper, though anybody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> give <b>you</b> a square meal for a quarter. Guess that may have {{something}} to do with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} {{have told me}} this," [...] she said. [...] "Since nothing <b>else</b> <b>would</b> {{convince}} <b>you,</b> it will enable me to talk plainly; I don't consider it an honour--not in the least. Can't you {{see that it is}} wholly and altogether out of the question that I should ever think in that way of you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir,' returns Twemlow, {{with his}} {{wristbands}} bristling a little, 'YOU repeat the word; I repeat the word. This lady. What <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> call her, if the gentleman were present?' ...|$|E
60|$|Q. What <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> advise me to in {{this great}} work?--A. When we confess sin, tears, shame, and {{brokenness}} of heart becomes us (Jer 50:4; Isa 22:12; Psa 51:17; Jer 31:19).|$|E
6000|$|An Apparition! Madam, said I, yes, to be sure; why you know, you {{are nothing}} else but an Apparition; and what <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> be, {{when it is}} so {{infinitely}} to your Advantage? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you are going into danger, Reuben; <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not have all those great guns they say there are, on board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be a friend, and I knew no one <b>else</b> who <b>would.</b> <b>You</b> won't be afraid, Lord Nidderdale, that I shall {{ever think}} {{any more of}} all those things which he was planning?' She paused a moment, {{but he was not}} ready enough to have a word to say in answer to this. 'You know what has happened?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By that subtle sense {{which every}} human being has. And you did guess it, Crystal, <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not have hated me as you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} have. Goodness gracious me! Why <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> come? You have got Buston, which I suppose is two {{thousand}} a year. At any rate {{it has that}} name. But it isn't your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; you wouldn't expect {{anything}} <b>else,</b> <b>would</b> <b>you?</b> You see, one doesn't {{go through that}} for nothing. I think I was a dreadful little fool--" [...] She stopped, with her spoon {{on its way to}} her mouth--"and yet--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fool!--and slow {{of heart}} to believe! Where <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> see Him but in {{yourself}} {{and in the}} world? They are all things cognisable to you. Where else, but everywhere, would you see Him whom no man hath seen, or can see?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Kinnaird, [...] "I {{want you}} to feel quite sure that he loved you. Without that nothing <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have counted. <b>You</b> will believe it, won't you? It is due to my son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can we?" [...] {{retorted}} Tom, with unwonted gravity. [...] "It's {{clear that}} you've {{never seen the}} rainy season, <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not speak of it so lightly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've {{nothing to}} tell,' said Owen, with alarmed impetuosity; 'only that I'm a fool, like every one <b>else,</b> and--and--if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> only double that--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sinful!' said my mother, bristling up {{when her}} son was attacked; 'sure we're all sinners; and it's you, Mr. Jowls, who have given me the inexpressible blessing {{to let me know}} THAT. But how <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have had the poor child behave?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "where <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> come to? Whenever {{you want}} it there's room here for you. Walter, take his horse, and then spread his {{blankets}} out near the fire. Tom, you'll get another trout and fill the kettle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] {{he broke}} in. [...] "The temptation would be irresistible. What <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> expect from two enterprising youngsters like these, {{who have no}} doubt been {{studying}} detective literature and the exploits of other young men in the brave old jayhawking days?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] {{said the}} Baroness, with a meaning look, [...] "that you {{are but a}} recreant knight, or <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not part with a lady's glove so easily." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{am not a}} Labor Leader; I do {{not want}} you to follow me or anyone else; {{if you are looking}} for a Moses to lead you out of this {{capitalist}} wilderness, you will stay right where <b>you</b> are. I <b>would</b> not lead <b>you</b> into the promised land if I could, because if I led you in, some one <b>else</b> <b>would</b> lead <b>you</b> out. You must use your heads as well as your hands, and get yourself out of your present condition.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell you," [...] she said. [...] "I haven't {{any words}} left. It is all so wonderful. You {{have never been}} to our home at Wellham Springs, or <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Plague in Bombay!" [...] the Captain burst out, his burly voice resounding {{down the}} saloon. [...] "Why, bless your soul, ma'am, where <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> expect it? Plague in Bombay! It's been there these five years. Better? Not quite. Going ahead like mad. They're dying by thousands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> call it, Eugenia? Wouldn't you {{be ashamed}} if you opened your Sunday paper and {{came upon a}} full page article about your nephew having got {{intoxicated}} at the races and fought a book-maker--having broken up a political meeting--having been sued for breach-of-promise by a barmaid [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call it crime!" [...] cried Morris, {{his voice}} {{vibrating}} with passion. [...] "You have seen {{little of it}} {{if you can call}} it anything else. Was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs? Was that crime--or what <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> call it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "you are a {{stranger}} in this place, or <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> know that no youth so chosen to sup with the queen ever returns to his home again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What can I do {{to comfort}} you most, Joe? I'll send my good Ben {{to help you}} to bed, and will be here myself when the surgeon goes his rounds. Is there {{anything}} <b>else</b> that <b>would</b> make <b>you</b> more easy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said these}} men {{belonged to a}} Pomeranian regiment. Had they left before you got there? But I suppose not, or <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not have been wounded. How was it that you heard of the attack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll be glad enough {{presently}} if you {{can keep}} going even at that rate," [...] he retorted with his air of conscious virtue. [...] "And there's another thing: a man should stand up to his bad luck, to his mistakes, to his conscience and all that sort of thing. Why--what <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have to fight against." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, old man, {{and what}} <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have me? Nobody could ever alter me, you know; {{and why should}} I alter myself? Here I am, after all, alive and jolly; and there is old daddy, as {{comfortable}} as he ever can be on earth: and {{so it will be}} {{to the end of the}} chapter. There! let's talk of something else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will answer}} you frankly," [...] she said, [...] "Yes, they have meant {{something}} to me! And yet, listen. I am {{going to say something}} unkind.

Yet there is something <b>else.</b> <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> be very angry, I wonder, if I told the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The king replied: 'Such {{knowledge}} {{would be}} of no benefit to you, for if I granted it {{to you and you}} told any one of it, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> immediately die; ask me rather for whatever <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> most like to possess, and it shall be yours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{very great}} nation, without a doubt," [...] Norgate acknowledged, [...] "but my {{quarter of an hour}} is coming to an end. Tell me what <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect from me if I {{accepted}} this post?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Professor Gilroy is not satisfied," [...] said she, {{glancing up}} at me with her strange little eyes. [...] "My poor fan is to get the credit of that experiment.
