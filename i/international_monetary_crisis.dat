The destabilizing shocks affected the entire world, but in an uneven manner, in different geographical areas and at different times, being felt most acutely, with devastating economic and social effects, in Third World countries. 	Although the developed countries were affected as well, they always had means to combat or to diminish the adverse effects of the crises, leading to "gentler" consequences.

This system, {{which has been in}} operation in Belgium for over 15 years, has recently found new supporters, as is indicated by the fact that during the <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>crisis</b> of May 1971 the EEC Commission counselled its adoption. The author first analyses the reasons which may justify restrictions on the freedom of capital movements, both in the short run and in the longer term. Some of the technical characteristics of a two-tier foreign exchange market are then examined before the well-known Mundell analysis of the efficiency of monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy is extended to the case of a country with such a system. Finally, the author draws some conclusions and compares a two-tier system with other instruments designed to reduce the undesired repercussions of high capital mobility.

40|$|Traditional {{studies on}} {{demand for money}} have often ignored {{influence}} of foreign monetary developments. The literature on international capital mobility, on the other hand, focuses {{on the impact of}} adjustments in international reserves on domestic money supply with the implicit assumption that aggregate demand for money is inelastic with respect to foreign monetary developments such as changes in exchange and foreign interest rates. These two views have often led to the conclusion that domestic monetary policy is fairly ineffective, and domestic financial markets are highly vulnerable to changes in foreign monetary developments. In this paper, the formulation of a demand function for real cash balances generalizes the traditional demand functions for money which explicitly take into account changes in exchange rates, foreign interest rates, and inflationary expectations. The underlying theoretical model is a general portfolio mode of asset holding which specifies the channels through which the influence of monetary developments abroad are transmitted to the supply and demand for money in a particular country. The demand function for real cash balances derived from this model is estimated using the tile series data for the period 1960 - 75 for Canada, United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. The results indicate that foreign monetary developments affect demand for money significantly, and considerable misspecification occurs when they are ignored. The results indicate that demand for real cash balances is not, as the traditional theory suggests, inelastic with respect to changes in foreign financial developments, and is fairly stable over the stressful period of 1970 - 75 when significant <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>crises</b> came in succession. ...|$|R

When the quadrupling of the oil price took place at the end of 1973 it was widely believed that this would bring about an <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>crisis,</b> in consequence of huge trade surpluses being realised by the OPEC countries and corresponding deficits by the industrialised (OECD) countries. In fact, the very rapid rate of growth of imports of goods and services by OPEC countries coupled with a sharp decline in the demand for oil by the industrialised countries has led to a situation which the "petrodollar" surplus has been much less than had been feared.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the British art {{world in the}} period 1976 - 1981. The first section explores the crises in the artworld triggered by the <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> Fund <b>Crisis</b> of February 1976. Central to this analysis is the Labour and Conservative Party's ideological shift from culturalist paternalism to monetarist liberalism, the history and function of the Arts Council of Great Britain, the press scandals surrounding the Tate Gallery's purchase of Carl Andre's Equivalent VIII and the ICA's exhibition of COUM Transmission's Prostitution. The opportunist populist polemics of the 'crisis critics' (Richard Cork, Andrew Brighton, Peter Fuller and John Tagg) are then introduced alongside {{a discussion of the}} colossal changes in the British art press. This is followed by an analysis of Cork's defence of Conrad Atkison's work and of the Royal Oak murals. The second section looks at the postmodernism rejected by Cork and the populist crisis critics, namely, the scripto-visual work of John Hilliard, Victor Burgin, and John Stezaker. The influence of photoconceptualism on community artists and feminist artists is then examined. This is followed by an analysis of Art & Language's critique of 'Semio-Art'. This section concludes with an analysis of the 'new art history' in relation to the practices of Jo Spence and Terry Atkinson. The following section looks at 'conservative'/populist postmodernism as outlined in exhibitions such as The Human Clay (1976), Towards Another Picture (1978), Lives (1979) and Narrative Painting (1979). This includes extensive discussion of the work of David Shepherd, Peter Blake, Ron Kitaj, David Hockney, Steven Campbell, Women's Painting (Images of Men), and The School of London (The Hard Won Image). The final section opens with a lengthy examination of the agitational performances of COUM Transmissions, investigating their decision to abandon the publicly subsidised artworld in order to become the industrial band Throbbing Gristle. This is followed by an examination of British pro-Situationism, punk and new wave subcultures in the 1970 s, relating them to the growth of the entrepreneurial art market of the early 1980 s...|$|R

The framework for coordination of ehe monetary policy on the International scale is provided by the provisions of the agreement on the IMF, especially rules concerning concerning currency exchange rates and supervision of the Fund over {{the monetary}} policy of its members. On the other hand, the rules for coordinating the monetary policy of the EEC countries are contained In relevant provisions of the Treaty of Нов» and the principles of operation of the European Monetary System. The article discusses main forms and methods of coordinating the monetary policy and their implications for the monetary policy of the member countries of the IMF and the EEC. There was also performed some evaluation of the effectiveness of this coordination. In particular. It was pointed out that it was easiest to coordinate the monetary policy within the EEC. The coordination of the monetary policy at the IMF level prevented <b>monetary</b> <b>crises</b> and it was contributing to a bigger order in the <b>International</b> <b>monetary</b> relations. Within the EEC, the most effective form of coordination of the monetary policy proved tp be the currency exchange and Credit mechanism of the European Monetary System. Its legal functioning is safeguarded by the central banks in the EEC countries. Since 1985 a new form of coordinating the monetary policy on the international scale have been periodical meetings of the countries belonging to Croup 5 and Group 7. There should be noted the agreement reached by Croup 5 in September 1985 concerning the lowering of the US dollar exchange rate and the agreement of Group 7 from February 1987 about fixing admissible margins of deviations of the exchange rates of the main convertible currencies, as well as Joint interventions undertaken on the money markets during the periods of tensions on them.
