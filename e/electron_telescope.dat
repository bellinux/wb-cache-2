High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some cello C strings are wound with tungsten. The extra density gives this string more projection and often cellists will buy just this string and use it with three strings from a different set.

40|$|During early November 2013, the {{magnetosphere}} experienced concurrent {{driving by}} a coronal mass ejection (CME) during an ongoing high-speed stream (HSS) event. The relativistic electron {{response to these}} two kinds of drivers, i. e., HSS and CME, is typically different, with the former often leading to a slower buildup of electrons at larger radial distances, while the latter energizing electrons rapidly with flux enhancements occurring closer to the Earth. We present {{a detailed analysis of}} the relativistic electron response including radial profiles of phase space density as observed by both Magnetic Electron and Ion Sensor (MagEIS) and Relativistic <b>Electron</b> Proton <b>Telescope</b> instruments on the Van Allen Probes mission.

These observations suggest that during this time period, both radial transport and local in situ processes are involved in the energization of electrons.

40|$|The Cosmic Ray <b>Electron</b> Synchrotron <b>Telescope</b> (CREST) {{instrument}} is a balloon payload {{designed to measure}} the flux of primary cosmic ray electrons at energies greater than 2 TeV. As electrons at these energies lose energy very rapidly during propagation through the insterstellar medium, their detection would indicate the existance of sources which are nearby on a galactic scale. In order to obtain the needed large exposure time and apperture of the detector, we use an apporach {{that depends on the}} detection of synchrotron photons emitted whne the electrons travel through the earth’s magnetic field. Such photons have energies in the x-ray and gamma ray region, hence CREST incorporates an array of inorganic scintillators. The primary electrons do not need to pass through the detector, allowing for an effective detection area that is much larger than the actual detector array size. 	This work focuses on three subjects: prototype detector development, prototype CREST flight (CREST-I), and insturment detection simulation. To accomplish σ = 1 ns or less timing resolution for identification of the interaction time with the detector, initial development of the BaF 2 crystal and photomultiplier tube assembly was performed. The measured result shows that the timing resolution is approximately 0. 7 ns. In 2005, the CREST-I flight successfully measured the diffusive and atmospheric x/γ-rays to estimate the background for real events.

However, the acceleration of near-relativistic electrons by shocks in the interplanetary medium is often questioned.
