25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} accused {{of trying to}} take Australia {{back to the days of}} the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E

5000|$|In 1999, under {{parliamentary}} privilege, Senator Kim Carr {{referred to}} a number of institutions including St Clements University which, in his opinion, were operating from Australia as [...] "degree mills". He said that when a member of his staff contacted the company identified as administering St Clements it was discovered that it was also a whisky distributing company and alleged educational services company. [...] Senator Carr subsequently referred to St Clements as reminiscent of [...] "the famous pirates of old ... using legal devices and incompetence by government ministers and making a bridgehead <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> educational institutions" [...] and as being operated out of a [...] "grog shop" [...] (Australian slang for a liquor store).|$|R

[...] The Times recorded that [...] "potatoes chipped and fried in the French manner were introduced in Lancashire with great success about 1871." [...] Fish and chip shops in the 1920s were often run by Jews or Italians. A slightly earlier date is available for chips in London, however, as Dickens's 1859 A Tale of Two Cities mentions [...] "husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil".|$|E

50|$|A {{consequence}} of the communist attitude towards the bourgeoisie elites in general, was the creation, {{for the first time}} in Romania's history, of a diaspora. Three individuals emerged as the most important Romanians abroad: playwright Eugen Ionescu (1909-1994) (who became known in France as Eugène Ionesco), creator of the Theatre of the Absurd and eventual member of the Académie française; religious historian and writer Mircea Eliade (1907-1986); and the essayist and philosopher Emil Cioran (1911-1996), the greatest French-writing master of style after Pascal. Fellow Romanian Ioan Petre Culianu continued Eliade's work with great success, in the United States. Another member of the diaspora who distinguished himself was the philosopher and logician Stephane Lupasco.The communist rule in Romania, unlike most of the other countries of the Eastern bloc permanently repudiated the Romanians who had left their country and labelled them as traitors to the motherland. So, neither Mircea Eliade, nor Eugène Ionesco, nor Emil Cioran, whose works would be published in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> sporadically after 1960, could see their native land again.

2500|$|We cannot {{precisely}} {{ascertain the}} time when tithes were first introduced <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> [...] Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, {{about the end of}} the fifth century. [...] But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.|$|E
2500|$|The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 {{was one of}} {{the first}} laws passed by the new Australian parliament. This centrepiece of the 'White Australia Policy' aimed to {{restrict}} immigration from Asia (especially China), where the population was vastly greater and the standard of living vastly lower and was similar to measures taken in other settler societies such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand. It found strong support in the national parliament, arguments ranging from economic protection to simple racism. The law permitted a dictation test in any European language to be used to in effect exclude non-"white" [...] immigrants. While the law allowed for the use of any European language, the English version was standardised and became known as the [...] "Stewart" [...] test after the Federal MP Stewart Parnaby who originally penned the exam. The Labor Party wanted to protect [...] "white" [...] jobs and pushed for clearer restrictions. A few politicians spoke of the need to avoid hysterical treatment of the question. MP Bruce Smith said he had [...] "no desire to see low-class Indians, Chinamen or Japanese...swarming <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>country...</b> But there is obligation...not (to) unnecessarily offend the educated classes of those nations". Donald Cameron, a member from Tasmania, expressed a rare note of dissension in the parliament, saying that no race on earth had been [...] "treated in a more shameful manner than have the Chinese...". Outside parliament, Australia's first Catholic cardinal, Patrick Francis Moran was politically active and denounced anti-Chinese legislation as [...] "unchristian". The popular press mocked the cardinal's position and the small European population of Australia generally supported the legislation and remained fearful of being overwhelmed by an influx of non-British migrants from the vastly different cultures of the highly populated empires to Australia's north.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{separation}} of church and state is fundamental to American identity. It is etched deeply <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> communal disposition and present in its national documents. The Constitution and its First Amendment rights affect American interaction with theocratic governments around the world, interaction among citizens nationally, and entitlement to free speech and religious practice. The natural assumption would be that this concept developed on the eve of the Revolution as a way to rein in the power of a future federal government—but, in fact, the 1663 Charter of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations first introduced a policy advocating the {{separation of church and}} state into American life. It is one of the earliest government documents anywhere creating a wall of separation between church and state. The phrases “Religious Toleration” and “Lively Experiment” are synonymous with Rhode Island because the inclusion of these phrases in the Charter allowed the Colony to become the first royally sanctioned secular government in North America. It is also because of these phrases that the Charter occupies a place in contemporary debate, even while the majority of obsolete colonial charters have fallen out of memory...|$|R

2500|$|Usually, {{the trials}} {{took place in}} England, {{due to the fact}} that the [...] "Admiralty feared that {{officials}} in the far-flung outposts of the empire could be bribed." [...] However, an issue with holding trials in England was that the pirates would have to be transported [...] "across vast distances." [...] The law regarding piracy trials was changed at the beginning of the eighteenth century, granting more relaxed rules and allowing for trials to take place in English colonies, so long as a Court of Admiralty was available. Pirates faced greater danger of being executed when the law changed, as it stated if a pirate was taken at sea, an official trial was not necessary, but the end result of execution was to be the same. An act in 1700 allowed for the expansion of the definition of piracy to include not just those [...] "who committed robbery by sea," [...] but also the [...] "mutineer who ran away with the ship" [...] as well as the [...] "sailor who interfered with the defense of his vessel" [...] under a pirate siege. In both 1717 and 1718, pardons were granted in order to [...] "rid the sea of robbers."
