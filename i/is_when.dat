5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E
5|$|The main {{failure mode}} for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other failure modes are heat {{checking}} and thermal fatigue. Heat checking <b>is</b> <b>when</b> surface cracks {{occur on the}} die due to a large temperature change on every cycle. Thermal fatigue <b>is</b> <b>when</b> surface cracks occur on the die due to {{a large number of}} cycles.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck <b>is</b> <b>when</b> {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period}} of time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E

50|$|According to {{cognitive}} dissonance theory, {{there are three}} types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant relationships. Consonant relationships <b>are</b> <b>when</b> two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant relationships <b>are</b> <b>when</b> two elements <b>are</b> not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant relationships <b>are</b> <b>when</b> two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.|$|R

5|$|High-dose rate (HDR) {{brachytherapy}} <b>is</b> <b>when</b> {{the rate}} of dose delivery exceeds 12Gy·h−1. The most common applications of HDR brachytherapy are in tumours of the cervix, esophagus, lungs, breasts and prostate. Most HDR treatments are performed on an outpatient basis, but this {{is dependent on the}} treatment site.|$|E

5|$|King Louis XIV {{danced in}} Isaac de Benserade's Ballet royal de Flore in February 1669 at the Tuileries, {{possibly}} in the Salle des Ballets {{located on the}} first floor of the pavilion. It has been suggested that this <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the name Pavillon de Flore came into use, although the earliest known written mention is in 1726. Pavillon de Flore is the name used today, although other names have been used in between.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life <b>is</b> <b>when</b> exactly life begins and ends.

5|$|Overdifferentiation <b>is</b> <b>when</b> phonemic distinctions from one's primary {{language}} are {{imposed on the}} sounds of the second system where they are not required; underdifferentiation of phonemes occurs when two sounds of the second system are not maintained because they are not present in the primary system.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{of malaria}} can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, {{recurrence}} {{can be classified}} as either recrudescence, relapse, or reinfection. Recrudescence <b>is</b> <b>when</b> symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood {{as a result of}} inadequate or ineffective treatment. Relapse <b>is</b> <b>when</b> symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells. Relapse commonly occurs between 8–24 weeks and is commonly seen with P.vivax and P.ovale infections. P.vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite. Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure. People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.|$|E

5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>when</b> a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E
