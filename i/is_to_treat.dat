5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> shock and preserve kidney function. Initially {{this is done}} through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E
25|$|In his {{introduction}} film director del Toro affirms his and Mignola’s admiration of Velasco’s “clean, propulsive narrative, draftsmanship, and artistic skills” and {{states that the}} intention of this title <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the film’s opening narrative as a mini-epic and give the artist the opportunity to tell it with unlimited budget and shooting time.|$|E
25|$|A {{more fully}} Bayesian {{approach}} to parameters <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> parameters as additional unobserved variables and to compute a full posterior distribution over all nodes conditional upon observed data, then to integrate out the parameters. This {{approach can be}} expensive and lead to large dimension models, so in practice classical parameter-setting approaches are more common.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out through a semi-structured {{interview}} with respondents via the 'snowballing' technique in Kampung Benoni, Papar, Sabah. There were about 43 species of medicinal plants found used by the Brunei community <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> 15 type of diseases. The {{findings of this study}} show that one plant <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> eye diseases; two plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the otorhinolaryngologic disease; three plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the stomatognathic disease; four plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> endocrine system diseases; six plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> skin diseases and substance-related disorders; eight plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> bacterial infections, mycoses, and viruses, musculoskeletal diseases, hemic and lymphatic diseases, pregnancy complications and female urogenital disease; nine plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> occupational diseases; 13 plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> digestive system diseases, immune system diseases and respiratory tract diseases; and 19 plants <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> wounds and injuries. The most common part of plants used in preparing herbal medicine is the leaves. The most common method of preparation is decoction and poultice. The plants came from 29 families. This study <b>is</b> helpful <b>to</b> assist us in recognising other potentials of the plants {{that can be used for}} medicinal purposes. The information in this paper will serve as baseline data for future phytochemical and pharmacological studies...|$|R
25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow {{direction}} and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along {{the ebb and}} flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{this project}} of Éric Mouquet, a member of Deep Forest, and Guilain Joncheray <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> Breton music {{in the same way}} that Deep Forest treated African music, with {{traditional}} lyrics and electronic accompaniments. Michel Sanchez, the other member of Deep Forest, also worked on the album, recorded and mixed by Erwin Autrique. Breton singers Arnaud Maisonneuve and Manu Lann Huel also appear on the album, as well as Tri Yann. It is Prigent's first experience combining Breton lyrics and electronic music.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonable}} guideline <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> {{people age}} >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If {{the person is}} diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter {{the course of the}} illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. Antibiotics when used early decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.|$|E

25|$|Homeopathy {{is fairly}} common in some {{countries}} while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated {{in some countries}} and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training programme, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> any illness.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{original}} goals of tone mapping was {{to be able to}} reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the issue as an optimization problem.|$|E
25|$|For {{particles}} {{in a system}} with periodic boundary conditions two particles can be neighbours {{even though they are}} {{on opposite sides of the}} system. This occurs often in molecular dynamics simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> each coordinate, x and y and/or z, as if it were on a circle instead of a line.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{cardinal}} rules in object handling <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> every object {{as if it}} is fragile and easily breakable. Museum technicians, curators, and conservators are trained to prepare a moving plan before an object is even touched that way minimal damage can occur when handling or moving an object. In the museum field is it a known fact that a vessel, or any object, should be held and handled by its strongest part, such as the base, and with both hands. Areas such as the handle or neck of a vessel tend to be the weakest points and may break if picked up by these components.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the underlying cause, if any.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, {{most of whom are}} young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> patients and that beds must be allocated to the ones {{who are most likely to}} survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.|$|E

5|$|Clindamycin <b>is</b> used {{primarily}} <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin may <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It <b>is</b> also used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> mild <b>to</b> moderate acne.|$|R
50|$|Dicloxacillin <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> mild-to-moderate staphylococcal infections.

25|$|One approach, {{suggested}} by {{writers such as}} Stephen D. Unwin, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> (particular versions of) theism and naturalism {{as though they were}} two hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously {{suggested by}} proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Headgear is not {{permitted}} in professional bouts, and boxers are generally {{allowed to take}} much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ cutmen, whose job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.|$|E

50|$|Hartlib was {{interested}} in theories and practices that modern science would deem irrational, or superstitious - for example, sympathetic medicine. Sympathetic medicine {{was based on the}} concept that things in nature that bear a resemblance to an ailment could <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> that ailment. Hence, a plant that looked like a snake might <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> snakebites, or a yellow coloured herb might <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> jaundice.|$|R

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could {{be summed up in}} three words: [...] "work, discipline, and feeding". Xenophon's advice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour. For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.|$|E
500|$|..... a basic {{principle}} of triage <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> victims {{having the most}} life-threatening injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize limited medical personnel {{in a manner that}} will provide maximum effectiveness. However, the Safety Board is also aware that in recent years a number of victims of cold water drowning have been successfully resuscitated. They survived after periods of underwater, including sea water, as long as one hour or more. In view of these facts, the Safety Board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.|$|E
