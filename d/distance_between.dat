Given this <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E

Classic Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) takes a matrix of pair-wise <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> all points, and computes a position for each point. Isomap assumes that the pair-wise distances are only known between neighboring points, and uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the pair-wise <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> all other points. This effectively estimates the full matrix of pair-wise geodesic <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> all of the points.
