What are the conclusions about statistical practice? Proportional-hazards models are frequently used to analyze data from randomized controlled trials. This is a mistake. Randomization does not justify the models, which are rarely informative. Simpler analytic methods should be used first. With observational studies, the models would help us disentangle causal relations if the assumptions behind the models could be justified.

Using a validation data set which includes both error-prone self-reported family history and error-free validated family history, we propose a method to adjust for misreporting of family history. We estimate the measurement error process in a validation data set (from University of California at Irvine (UCI)) using nonparametric smoothed <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimators,</b> and use Monte Carlo integration to implement the adjustment.

40|$|Objective. To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} care-delivery delays on survival among women with breast cancer. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 854 women attending 11 hospitals from 2007 - 2009 was carried out. <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimators</b> and a Cox proportional-risk model were employed. Results. A total of 10. 5 % of cases were diagnosed in stage I. 82 % of sampled women delayed care for more than 67 days between noticing a symptom and initiating treatment. The median time from receipt of results of the mammography to biopsy was 31 days (IQR 14 - 56). Compared with those who were in quartile I (Q 1), survival was lower among those in Q 3 and Q 4 (HR= 1. 68, 95 %CI 0. 94 - 3. 00; HR= 1. 76, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 2. 98, respectively). Conclusions.

50|$|The <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimator</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used methods of survival analysis. The estimate may be useful to examine recovery rates, the probability of death, and the effectiveness of treatment.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{generate}} a <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimator,</b> at least two pieces of data are required for each patient (or each subject): the status at last observation (event occurrence or right-censored) and the time to event (or time to censoring).

40|$|In {{a unified}} framework, we provide estimators and {{confidence}} bands {{for a variety}} of treatment effects when the outcome of interest, typically a duration, is subjected to right censoring. Our methodology accommodates average, distributional, and quantile treatment effects under different identifying assumptions including unconfoundedness, local treatment effects, and nonlinear differences-in-differences. The proposed estimators are easy to implement, have close-form representation, are fully data-driven upon estimation of nuisance parameters, and do not rely on parametric distributional assumptions, shape restrictions, or on restricting the potential treatment effect heterogeneity across different subpopulations. These treatment effects results are obtained as a consequence of more general results on two-step <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimators</b> that are of independent interest: we provide conditions for applying (i) uniform law of large numbers, (ii) functional central limit theorems, and (iii) we prove the validity of the ordinary nonparametric bootstrap in a two-step estimation procedure where the outcome of interest may be randomly censored...|$|R

In this note, it will pointed out that when X(n) is censored {{is based on a}} defective distribution, and therefore can badly underestimate. We derive an explicit formula for the delete- 2 jackknife estimate. However, on comparing the expressions of and, their difference is negligible.

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} attempts to analyse a statistical problem involving censored data was Daniel Bernoulli's 1766 analysis of smallpox morbidity and mortality data to demonstrate the efficacy of vaccination. An early paper to use the <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimator</b> for estimating censored costs was Quesenberry et al.

50|$|The <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimator,</b> {{also known}} as the product limit estimator, is a {{non-parametric}} statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. In medical research, it is often used to measure the fraction of patients living for {{a certain amount of time}} after treatment. In other fields, Kaplan-Meier estimators may be used to measure the length of time people remain unemployed after a job loss, the time-to-failure of machine parts, or how long fleshy fruits remain on plants before they are removed by frugivores. The estimator is named after Edward L. Kaplan and Paul Meier, who each submitted similar manuscripts to the Journal of the American Statistical Association. The journal editor, John Tukey, convinced them to combine their work into one paper, which has been cited about 50,000 times since its publication.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE To (a) {{evaluate}} {{the response of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to chemoembolization after initial nonresponse, as determined with European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and (b) compare posttreatment survival of initial nonresponders versus that of initial responders. MATERIALS AND METHODS The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, which was compliant with HIPAA. A total of 116 consecutive patients (96 men, 20 women; mean age, 63 years) with unresectable HCC who underwent at least two chemoembolization procedures were included. The chemoembolization mixture consisted of 100 mg of cisplatin, 50 mg of doxorubicin, and 10 mg of mitomycin C mixed 1 : 1 with iodized oil. Tumor response at magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated after each chemoembolization procedure according to EASL criteria and mRECIST. The survival rate in each subgroup was calculated and correlated with response. The Wilcoxon {{test was used to}} test group comparability. <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimators</b> were used to generate survival curves and compared by using the log-rank test.

40|$|AbstractIn {{competing}} risks studies, the <b>Kaplan–Meier</b> <b>estimators</b> {{of the distribution}} functions (DFs) of lifetimes and the corresponding estimators of cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) are used widely when no prior information is available for these distributions. In some cases better estimators of the DFs of lifetimes are available when they obey some inequality constraints, e. g., if two lifetimes are stochastically or uniformly stochastically ordered, or some functional of a DF obeys an inequality in an empirical likelihood estimation procedure. If the restricted estimator of a lifetime differs from the unrestricted one, then the usual estimators of the CIFs will {{not add up to}} the lifetime estimator. In this paper we show how to estimate the CIFs in this case. These estimators are shown to be strongly uniformly consistent. In all cases we consider, when the inequality constraints are strict the asymptotic properties of the restricted and the unrestricted estimators are the same, thus providing the asymptotic properties of the restricted estimators essentially “free of charge”. We give an example to illustrate our procedure...|$|R
40|$|Both {{industry}} and firm characteristics influence {{the survival of}} a firm in an industry over time. Aging, size, structure are factors often discussed in the literature, but public intervention effects - through public quality labeling for example - may also have an effect that is examined here. We use data on French firms producing cheese under public quality label or not over the period 1990 - 2006. We perform a nonparametric estimation using <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimators</b> as well as proportional hazard rate models {{to assess the impact}} of such factors on firms survival. Our results confirm existing finding on firm survival determinants. We also shed light on the effect of public intervention into that industry. More precisely, our focus on public quality labeling in the French cheese industry shows that quality label reduces the risk of exiting for firms and more particularly for small firms. In other words, public intervention in this industry is well designed to increase the competitiveness of small firms enabling the coexistence on the market of both small and large firms.
