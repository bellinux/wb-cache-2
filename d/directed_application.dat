40|$|As a {{chemical}} free technology for removing particles during fluid flow, {{this paper describes}} how filters/strainers have taken a step forward in their manufacture through direct fabrication using additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Replacing the conventional manufacturing route of punching, rolling and seam-welding, improvements in filter support geometries have been achievable using AM by designing and manufacturing custom-made filters of different sizes and shapes that are bespoke for process specific applications with optimised fluid flow. Flexibility in design is achieved due to the geometric freedom that AM technology permits. The Selective Laser Melting AM technology utilised works by the layer-wise addition of powdered material that is melted in a geometric cross-section of the design, layer-by-layer, through the <b>directed</b> <b>application</b> of energy from a laser. Currently, both the filter supports and the mesh are being manufactured using this technology, but this paper covers only the advancement of the filter support.

The application of a pre-or postemergence herbicide alone was not effective in controlling weeds. Regarding the selectivity of PPI herbicides, EPTC, butylate and trifluralin were applied and incorporated at normal and 2 x rates; the cassava was planted either in ridges or level ground. Butylate was more selective than EPTC. Planting in ridges reduced the selectivity of the thiocarbamates but not of trifluralin, which was selective atthe 2 x rate.

Parameters such as secondary structures of the target molecules and steric hindrance were investigated {{to better understand the}} mechanisms underlying a microarray hybridization reaction, with focus on their influence on the specificity of hybridization. With adequate hybridization conditions, false-positive signals could be almost completely prevented, resulting in clear data interpretation. Among 199 potential nonspecific hybridization events, only 1 false-positive signal was observed, whereas false-negative results were more common (17 of 41). Subsequent parameter analysis revealed that this was mainly an effect of reduced accessibility of probe binding sites caused by the secondary structures of the target molecules. False-negative results could be prevented and the overall signal intensities could be adjusted by introducing a new optimization strategy called <b>directed</b> <b>application</b> of capture oligonucleotides. The small number of false-positive signals in our data set is discussed, and a general optimization approach is suggested.

An emerging theory suggests that MI works through the combination of a relational component and the goal <b>directed</b> <b>application</b> of MI methods to evoke and reinforce change talk (Miller & Rose, 2009). A process study was conducted on an adaptation of MI for offenders, the Short Motivational Programme (SMP). The SMP combines MI and cognitive behavioural content across five sessions to enhance motivation for change among medium risk offenders (Devereux, 2009). A single-case design and descriptive statistics were employed and supplemented with inferential statistics. The MI Skills Code 2. 1 (Miller, Moyers, Ernst, & Amrhein, 2008) was used to rate the language of 12 facilitators and 26 offenders during 98 video-recorded SMP sessions. There was some evidence that facilitators were less able to use specific MI methods during sessions that included cognitive behavioural content. Offendersâ ambivalence about changing offending behaviour was most pronounced during sessions that included cognitive behavioural content. Offendersâ change and committing change talk was highest during sessions without cognitive behavioural content. Offenders who completed the SMP with more commitment to change demonstrated less ambivalence during earlier sessions. The relational component of MI appeared to be related to whether offenders completed the SMP. There was some evidence to support a relationship between the use of MI consistent methods and offender change talk. The use of MI inconsistent methods and a lack of MI consistent methods were related to ambivalence about changing criminal behaviour and premature exit from the SMP. These results suggested that facilitators should judiciously avoid the use of MI inconsistent methods and strategically employ MI consistent methods to reduce offendersâ ambivalence about change. The integration of cognitive behavioural content and MI needs to be carefully considered in reference to the aim of each session, the subsequent session, and the programmeâs overall goal...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus sanguinis is {{the second}} most common causative agent of {{bacterial}} infective endocarditis (IE). Risk of S. sanguinis IE is dependent on pre-disposing damage to the heart valve endothelium, which results in deposition of clotting factors for formation of a sterile thrombus (referred to as vegetation). Despite medical advances, high mortality and morbidity rates persist. Molecular characterization of S. sanguinis virulence determinants may enable development of prevention methods. In a previous screen for S. sanguinis virulence determinants by signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) an attenuated mutant was identified with a transposon insertion in the nrdD gene, encoding an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. Evaluation of this mutant, as well as an nrdD in-frame deletion mutant, JFP 27, by a soft-agar growth assay confirmed the anaerobic growth sensitivity of these strains. These studies suggest that an oxygen gradient occurs at the site of infection which selects for expression of anaerobic-specific genes at the nexus of the vegetation. The random STM screen failed to identify any favorable streptococcal surface-exposed prophylactic candidates. It was also apparent that additional genetic tools were required to facilitate the in vivo analyses of mutant strains. As it was desirable to insert antibiotic resistance markers into the chromosome, we identified a chromosomal site for ectopic expression of foreign genes. In vitro and in vivo analyses verified that insertion into this site did not affect important cellular phenotypes. The genetic tools developed facilitated further in vivo screening of S. sanguinis cell wall-associated (Cwa) protein mutants. A <b>directed</b> <b>application</b> of STM was employed for a comprehensive analysis of this surface protein class in the rabbit model of IE. Putative sortases, upon which Cwa proteins are dependent for cell surface localization, were also evaluated. No single S. sanguinis Cwa protein was determined essential for IE by STM screening; however competitiveness for colonization of the infection site was reduced for the mutant lacking expression of sortase A. The studies described here present a progressive picture of S. sanguinis IE, beginning with surface protein-dependent colonization of the vegetation in early IE, that later shifts to a bacterial persistence in situ dependent on condition-specific housekeeping genes, including nrdD...|$|E

40|$|Fluorinated {{amino acids}} {{represent}} useful {{building blocks for}} the construction of novel peptide and protein structures. The unique properties of fluorine and its absence from the pool of canonical amino acids offer a wide range of applications. Due to the observation that fluorinated amino acids often enhance the proteolytic stability as well as the hydrophobicity and membrane permeability of peptides, these building blocks are interesting tools for drug design. However, the <b>directed</b> <b>application</b> of fluorinated amino acids in the development of peptide based drugs is limited by the narrow knowledge of the biological properties of fluorinated building blocks. Particularly, the interactions with natural amino acids within a native protein environment are poorly investigated. In this thesis a parallel coiled coil heterodimer was designed, which enables the investigation of the interaction properties of fluorinated amino acids within a native protein environment. Based on this model a phage display based screening system was developed to determine preferred interaction partners of fluorinated amino acids and to achieve detailed information of possible interactions of these residues. Accordingly, the non canonic amino acids were incorporated at a central a- or d-position of one of both peptide strands (screening peptide) while in the opposite peptide (library peptide) the positions which directly interact with the substituted amino acids were randomized. Binding between screening peptide and the library peptide displayed on the surface of bacteriaphage M 13 was shown and a peptide library of sufficient size was constructed. Based on the coiled coil interaction the best binding partners for the screening peptide were selected out of the pool of potential interaction partners. First, the selection strategy was tested and optimized using the unsubstituted screening peptide. The sensitivity of the selection procedure was successfully tested using different canonical amino acids and the procedure was applied to the selection of preferred interaction partners of fluorinated amino acids. Thereby, difluoroethylglycine, difluoropropylglycine and trifluorglycine, which were used in the group of Professor Koksch before, were investigated. However, even though significant differences in steric demand and polarity were shown for these amino acids before, no differences regarding preferred interaction partners were observed. Incorporated within the hydrophobic core of a Î±-helical coiled coil, the fluorinated amino acids investigated in this thesis prefere the same binding partners as native hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and valine which naturally occur in these positions...|$|E

Second, synthetic studies towards the diperene obtusanal shown in part II. Third, the analysis, characterization, and synthesis of coronene derivatives towards their application in organic batteries shown in part III. 	Significant synthetic progress towards viridin {{has been made}} in our laboratory. We showcased the first total synthesis <b>directed</b> <b>application</b> of a proline sulfonamide-catalyzed, asymmetric Yamada-Otani cyclization as a key step to enantioselectively form the A ring of viridin from acyclic achiral aldehyde and enone precursors. In addition, we demonstrate an unprecendented, palladium-mediated oxidative furan formation to install the hallmark furan moiety from a diol and alkene functional groups. 	Significant progress towards obtusanal {{has been made in}} our laboratory culminating in the synthesis of the complete carbon bicyclic scaffold of obtusanal. In addition to using a common synthetic intermediate from the viridin project, we established several key transformations. First, a sequential two-step palladium-catalyzed functionalization of the bromo,chloro aromatic moiety. We successfully functionalized the aromatic moiety in high yield across multiple substrates through a Negishi cross-coupling selectively for the aryl bromide with minimal Î²-hydride elimination, followed by a palladium-catalyzed oxygenation of the aryl chloride. Second, we show a biomimmetically-inspired intramolecular aldol cyclization to set the complete scaffold of obtusanal as a single diasteromer. The intramolecular aldol reaction appears to be mediated by silica gel on an intermediate bearing a silyl enol ether and aldehyde functionality. 	The dense and functionally diverse structure of the intermediates leading to obtusanal necessitated careful reagent selection and intermediate functional group selection. All told, we examined five separate approaches towards obtusanal, and synthetized an advanced intermediatebranched from the second generation âOMe seriesâ sequence, differing from obtusanal only by differing a C 6 alkene versus aldehyde, and C 12 -OMe verses OAc. 	We report the synthesis of a new carbonylated PAH coronenehexaanhydride {{to be used as a}} cathode material in batteries and conducted NMR analysis of the coronene-based materials within organic batteries.

40|$|According to the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST), {{the normal}} aging process is {{associated}} with a greater emphasis on self-regulation of emotional states, and this fosters a bias in cognitive processing for information that is positively valenced (e. g., pleasant images and autobiographical events, happy faces), such that older adults have better memory for, and pay greater attention to, positive relative to negative valenced information (a âpositivity effectâ). Two hypotheses have recently emerged which differ in the cognitive mechanism proposed to account for the emergence of aging-related positivity effects. The first, termed the âcognitive controlâ hypothesis, suggests that positivity effects arise from older adults' <b>directed</b> <b>application</b> of cognitive efforts to preferentially process positive information, essentially a top-down explanation. The second is a bottom-up hypothesis, suggesting that positive information is relatively easier (more fluent) for older adults to detect and process, compared to negative information, due to changes in amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli, and is termed the "processing fluency" hypothesis. To evaluate these hypotheses, I conducted a suite of memory and attention experiments and compared performance of younger and older adults. I used five different tasks (three different memory tasks, and two different attention tasks) which varied with respect to the degree to which each allowed for the use of cognitive control, and was reflective in nature, or emphasized fluency (i. e., speed of processing and output). In Experiments 1 and 2, I examined the effect of age on two different types of memory task that differed with respect to the degree to which participants must rely on cognitive control/reflective processing or processing fluency to successfully complete the task. Clear positivity effects were found on the task that was reflective in nature (autobiographical memory task) but not on the task that relied more heavily on fluency (phonemic fluency task). In Experiment 3, I examined whether older adults strategically select positive information to later remember (i. e., use cognitive control to regulate encoding of positive material), by asking participants to judge the likelihood of remembering positive, negative, and neutral pictures for a later memory test. In line with a strategic bias, older, but not younger, adults showed a positivity effect {{in terms of the number}} of pictures selected as particularly memorable, though both age groups showed a positivity effect in picture recall. Within the domain of attention-based tasks, in Experiments 4 a and 4 b I used a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm to examine whether older adults were more likely to detect (or have attention captured by) rapidly presented positive, than negative or neutral, pictures compared to younger adults. Given the rapid rate of presentation in this paradigm, it is unlikely that participants would be able to use cognitive control to strategically direct attention to positive stimuli, thus performance was taken to measure fluency-mediated biases for the pictures of different valence. Results showed little evidence for a positivity effect. In Experiments 5 a and 5 b, again within the domain of attention, I examined whether older adults preferentially oriented attention toward positive, and/or away from negative, relative to neutral stimuli, on a dot probe task in which trial timings were long enough to allow for strategic control. Experiment 5 a used faces whereas Experiment 5 b used pictures as stimuli, in an effort to determine whether findings could generalize across different types of stimuli. Some evidence of positivity effects were found, as older adults were less biased to attend to negative (angry) faces compared to younger adults. Results across this series of experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that positivity effects in older adults' memory and attention stem from the strategic application of effortful, reflective, cognitive processing, rather than a bottom-up difference in processing fluency. 1 yea...|$|E
