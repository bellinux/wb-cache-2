5|$|Higher {{education}} did not fare as {{well under}} Carroll. He cut the proposed {{budget for the}} state's Council on Higher Education by 40 percent. Because of the considerable political clout of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle</b> (Lexington, Louisville and Covington), the University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, and Northern Kentucky University were spared the more severe budget cuts imposed on the state's regional universities.|$|E
5|$|Growth, {{employment}} and household income have lagged behind the South, {{and the five}} most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The picture is not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle</b> which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle,</b> centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam {{is one of the}} wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just {{on the other side of}} the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity.|$|E
5|$|Poh Ern Shih {{is located}} on the top of Chwee Chian Hill, off Pasir Panjang Road, on Singapore's {{southern}} coast. Facing the hilltop is Bukit Chandu ('Opium Hill' in Malay), where the British East India Company had an opium factory to process raw opium from the <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle</b> for sale to China and South East Asia in the 19th century. To protect its military facilities in the vicinity, the British colonial government placed heavy artillery guns on Chwee Chian Hill before the onset of the Second World War, in anticipation of seaborne attacks by the Japanese off the coast of Pasir Panjang.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{industrial}} base {{continued to grow}} in the post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle,</b> Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.|$|E
5|$|Downtown San Diego {{is located}} on San Diego Bay. Balboa Park {{encompasses}} several mesas and canyons to the northeast, surrounded by older, dense urban communities including Hillcrest and North Park. To the east and southeast lie City Heights, the College Area, and Southeast San Diego. To the north lies Mission Valley and Interstate 8. The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Rancho Bernardo. The far northeast portion of the city encompasses Lake Hodges and the San Pasqual Valley, which holds an agricultural preserve. Carmel Valley and Del Mar Heights occupy {{the northwest corner of}} the city. To their south are Torrey Pines State Reserve and the business center of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle.</b> Further south are the beach and coastal communities of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Ocean Beach. Point Loma occupies the peninsula across San Diego Bay from downtown. The communities of South San Diego, such as San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, are located next to the Mexico–United States border, and are physically separated {{from the rest of the}} city by the cities of National City and Chula Vista. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.|$|E

50|$|Hyrule {{was formed}} by three goddesses (Mihashira no Megami) Din (ディン), Farore (Faroru), and Nayru (Nēru). According to Hylian legend as {{depicted}} in Ocarina of Time, Din created the physical geography of the realm, Nayru created the physical laws to govern the land, and Farore created the races to uphold {{the law and the}} flora and fauna that inhabit the world. Once the goddesses had completed their tasks, they departed for the heavens, and left behind three <b>golden</b> <b>triangles.</b> In these, they put their power to govern all things; this relic became known as the Triforce. The realm itself was eventually named after its dominant race, the Hylia.|$|R
30|$|The {{art work}} “The Mona Lisa” (Fig.  4) {{is a perfect}} example of golden ratio, whether one {{measures}} the length and width of the painting or draws a rectangle around the object’s face. In photography, we often use visual weight balance or aspect ratio. Zhou et al. [9] and Datta et al. [10] consider that the image size and aspect ratio are crucial factors affecting photographs’ aesthetics. In their opinion, approximating the golden ratios, 4 : 3 and 16 : 9, can make viewers pleasing and comfortable. Obrador et al. [13] also uses photograph composition features, such as Rule of Thirds, the golden mean and the <b>golden</b> <b>triangles</b> based on edges instead of regions [14].|$|R

500|$|Santikhiri's {{early history}} {{centered}} on the <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle's</b> opium trade, in which its distinctive population [...] the [...] "lost army" [...] of the Republic of China Army's 93rd Division [...] became involved. At {{the conclusion of the}} Chinese Civil War in 1949, some remnants of the anti-communist Kuomintang (KMT) forces refused to surrender, including 278th Regiment of the 93rd Division and 709th Regiment of the 237th Division (led by General Li Kuo-hui). The troops fought their way out of Yunnan in south-western China, and its soldiers lived in Burma's (now Myanmar) jungles. The army grew and part of it returned to Taiwan under international pressure. The remaining troops were led by Gen Tuan Shi-wen (also known as Chiwan Khamlue) and sought asylum in Mae Salong later. In exchange for their asylum, they fought for Thailand until 1982, helping to counter the communist insurgency on the Thai frontier. In reward, the Thai government granted citizenship to most of the KMT soldiers and their families.|$|R
500|$|The soldiers' war {{did not end}} {{after their}} own [...] "long march" [...] from Yunnan to Möng Hsat in Burma's Shan State. The Burmese soon {{discovered}} that a foreign army was camped on their soil, and launched an offensive. The fighting continued for 12 years, and several thousand KMT soldiers were eventually evacuated to Taiwan. When China entered the Korean War, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had a desperate need for intelligence on China. The agency turned to the two KMT generals, who agreed to slip some soldiers back into China for intelligence-gathering missions. In return, the agency offered arms to equip the generals to retake China from their bases in the Shan State. The KMT army tried on no fewer than seven times between 1950 and 1952 to invade Yunnan, but was repeatedly driven back into the Shan State. The ending of the Korean War in 1953 was {{not the end of}} the KMT's fight against the communist Chinese and Burmese armies, which continued on for many years, supported by Washington and Taiwan and subsequently funded by the KMT's involvement in the <b>Golden</b> <b>Triangle's</b> drug trade.|$|R
