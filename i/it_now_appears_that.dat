25|$|The {{extent to}} which mild 3β-HSD CAH can cause early {{appearance}} of pubic hair {{and other aspects of}} hyperandrogenism in later childhood or adolescence is unsettled. Early reports about 20 years ago suggesting that mild forms of 3β-HSD CAH comprised significant proportions of girls with premature pubic hair or older women with hirsutism have not been confirmed and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> premature pubarche in childhood and hirsutism after adolescence are not common manifestations of 3β-HSD CAH.|$|E
25|$|The Lophotrochozoa, evolved within Protostomia, {{include two}} of the most {{successful}} animal phyla, the Mollusca and Annelida. The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids. They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the Entoprocta, the Phoronida, and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals.|$|E
500|$|Their abdomens bear {{appendages}} {{that have}} been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands. Spider webs vary widely in size, shape {{and the amount of}} sticky thread used. <b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the spiral orb web {{may be one of the}} earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders. Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets. True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder, the Mesothelae.

60|$|Here fate {{put in a}} {{touch of}} satire. For <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> all our trouble was quite gratuitous.

500|$|Radio-telescope {{images taken}} in 1998 confirm that Betelgeuse has a highly complex atmosphere, with a {{temperature}} of , similar to that recorded on the star's surface but much lower than surrounding gas in the same region. The VLA images also show this lower-temperature gas progressively cools as it extends outward. Although unexpected, {{it turns out to}} be the most abundant constituent of Betelgeuse's atmosphere. [...] "This alters our basic understanding of red-supergiant star atmospheres", explained Jeremy Lim, the team's leader. [...] "Instead of the star's atmosphere expanding uniformly due to gas heated to high temperatures near its surface, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> several giant convection cells propel gas from the star's surface into its atmosphere." [...] This is the same region in which Kervella's 2009 finding of a bright plume, possibly containing carbon and nitrogen and extending at least six photospheric radii in the southwest direction of the star, is believed to exist.|$|E
2500|$|These small immune {{signaling}} peptides (PRPs) were independently {{discovered in}} colostrum and other sources, such as blood plasma, in the United States, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Hence they appear under various {{names in the}} literature, including Colostrinin, CLN, transfer factor and PRP. [...] They function as signal transducing molecules that have the unique effect of modulating the immune system, turning it up when the body comes under attack from pathogens or other disease agents, and damping it when the danger is eliminated or neutralized. At first thought to actually transfer immunity from one immune system to another, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> PRPs simply stimulate cell-mediated immunity.|$|E
2500|$|However, Michael W. Holmes {{has pointed}} out that it is not certain [...] "that Papias knew the story in {{precisely}} this form, inasmuch as <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> at least two independent stories about Jesus and a sinful woman circulated among Christians in the first two centuries of the church, so that the traditional form found in many New Testament manuscripts may well represent a conflation of two independent shorter, earlier versions of the incident." [...] Kyle R. Hughes has argued that one of these earlier versions is in fact very similar in style, form, and content to the Lukan special material (the so-called [...] "L" [...] source), suggesting that the core of this tradition is in fact rooted in very early Christian (though not Johannine) memory.|$|E
50|$|On 25 September 1938, Daladier and Bonnet {{returned}} to London for {{another set of}} meetings with British leaders; during this summit, Bonnet said almost nothing. When Britain rejected Hitler's Bad Godesberg ultimatum on 26 September, Bonnet sought to prevent {{the news of the}} British rejection appearing in the French press, as <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> British were pushing the French towards war, and deprived Bonnet of using British pressure as an excuse.|$|R
60|$|The {{effect was}} evident. Men {{looked at one}} another with {{suspicion}} in their eyes, the coroner sent for Palliser and conferred with him and Stitt, while the heavy stillness the murmur of their voices emphasized was curiously significant. Hitherto nobody had seriously thought of connecting Appleby with Davidson’s death, but <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> there could be only one meaning {{to the fact that he}} had sought safety in flight. Then the coroner stood up.|$|R
50|$|Livermore {{ordered an}} {{independent}} review by Joseph Nilsen, who delivered {{a report on}} 27 June 1985 that said the same thing.

2500|$|Niven wrote four books. The first, Round the Rugged Rocks, (published {{simultaneously}} in the US {{under the title}} [...] "Once Over Lightly") was a novel that appeared in 1951 and was forgotten almost at once. In 1971, he published his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon, which was well received, selling over five million copies. He followed this with Bring On the Empty Horses in 1975, a collection of entertaining reminiscences from Hollywood's [...] "Golden Age" [...] in the 1930s and '40s. <b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Niven recounted many incidents from a first-person perspective that actually happened to other people, especially Cary Grant, which he borrowed and embroidered. In 1981 Niven published a second and much more successful novel, Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly, which was set {{during and after the}} Second World War, and which drew on his experiences during the war and in Hollywood. He was working on a third novel {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
2500|$|Type 1 (Juvenile onset). The {{incidence}} of juvenile Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is about 1:500 in the U.S. population, {{and is the}} result of autoimmune damage to the Islets of Langerhans cells in the pancreas. The level of adult onset T1D plus ambiguous T1D/T2D is unknown. It is unclear how large a role Triticeae has in T1D, which also shows strong linkage to DQ2.5 and DQ8. Childhood (male) Type 1 diabetes increases the risk for GSE and vice versa and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> GSE precedes T1D in many cases and an active search for coeliac disease in early juvenile diabetes patients revealed that GF diet resulted in some improvements. A high frequency of diabetes patients have anti-transglutaminase antibodies along with increased levels of gluten specific T-cells in T1D patients. From an evolutionary point of view it is difficult to explain the high association of T1D and DQ2.5 given negatively selective nature of the disease in NW European population given the number of studies suggesting that the [...] "Super B8" [...] haplotypes has been under positive selection, and appears to be the most characteristic HLA type in NW Europeans indicating an advanced natural history of the haplotype. A T. aesitivum storage globulin, Glb-1 (locus), was identified that is similar to the hypersensitizing peanut protein Ara h 1 and other known plant hypersensitizing proteins. Antibodies to this protein correlated with levels of lymphocyte infiltration into Islet regions of the pancreas. [...] Gastrointestinal viruses may play a role.|$|E

50|$|After the war {{the roles}} of Admiral Redman and his brother John R.

Darnley, to be sure, told his father that 'I never offended the Queen, my wife, in meddling with any woman in thought, let be in deed,' and, whether Darnley spoke truth or not, there was, among the Queen's Maries, no Mary Hamilton to meddle with, just as there was no Mary Carmichael.|$|R
