40|$|Design, {{planning}} and logistics for road construction are increasingly performed using 3 D models. These models can subsequently {{be used to}} guide machines directly on site. At present {{there is no direct}} integration of 3 D de-sign and production planning of the construction work, which limits use of the 3 D models for optimization and real-time follow-up of mass haulage and machinery logistics. This paper describes a conceptual model of an industrial process for machine <b>guided</b> <b>road</b> construction projects where 3 D design is integrated with production planning, enabling production visualization (4 D) and real-time follow-up. The aim is to create an integrated working process {{to such an extent that}} redesign and replanning of activities and re-sources can actively be optimized, based on observations and data collected during the production.

40|$|A goal of many image analysis, image {{understanding}} and computer vision problems is the delineation of linear features. This thesis addresses the specific problem of operator <b>guided</b> <b>road</b> delineation in aerial photographs. Our {{solution to this}} problem applies the classical pattern recognition paradigm of feature extraction followed by pattern classification. The feature extraction process merges features extracted at different levels of a multi-resolution image pyramid to obtain a dichotomization of image coordinates into classes of road pixels and not road pixels. The road center line is estimated from this road pixel image using a generalized Hamming distance based decision scheme. An artificial neural network (ANN) architecture is developed which implements the generalized Hamming distance classifier. It is shown that the ANN implementation offers significant throughput improvements over sequential implementations. Results of applying the road delineation algorithm to digitized aerial photographs demonstrate delineation accuracy suitable for computer-aided cartography applications...|$|E
40|$|NIST is {{applying}} their Real-time Control System (RCS) {{methodology for}} control of ground vehicles for both the U. S. Army Research Lab, {{as part of the}} DOD's Unmanned Ground Vehicles program, and for the Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle / Highway Systems (IVHS) program. The actuated vehicle, a military HMMWV, has motors for steering, brake, throttle, etc. and sensors for the dashboard gauges. For military operations, the vehicle has two modes of operation: a teleoperation mode - where an operator remotely controls the vehicle over an RF communications network; and a semi-autonomous mode called retro-traverse - where the control system uses an inertial navigation system to steer the vehicle along a prerecorded path. For the IVHS work, intelligent vision processing elements replace the human teleoperator to achieve autonomous, visually <b>guided</b> <b>road</b> following. 1.

40|$|Contemporary {{learning}} environments have fewer structured learning activities and more self directed learning tasks guided through consultation with academics. Such tasks are predominately project/problem based where {{the student is}} required to follow a freely <b>guided</b> <b>road</b> map to self discovery whilst simultaneously achieving desired learning outcomes for a particular course. However, many students struggle to adjust to a learning environment where they are being increasingly encouraged to undertake self directed learning (SDL). Thus, this paper proposes to evaluate the SDL readiness of final year engineering students. To achieve this objective, a questionnaire survey of 22 students (37 per cent of final year cohort) completing the civil engineering program at Griffith University was conducted. Moreover, {{the relationship between a}} respondent's grade point average (GPA) and their SDL readiness was determined. Through understanding students SDL readiness throughout their engineering programs, academics can better tailor PBL support mechanisms to achieve desired learning outcomes.

40|$|Modern {{learning}} approaches increasingly {{have fewer}} structured learning activities and more self directed learning tasks guided through consultation with academics. Such tasks are predominately project/problem based where {{the student is}} required to follow a freely <b>guided</b> <b>road</b> map to self discovery whilst simultaneously achieving desired learning outcomes for a particular course. However, many international students struggle to adjust to an Australian higher learning environment where they are being increasingly encouraged to undertake self directed learning (SDL). Thus, this paper proposes the concept that international students who have higher readiness for SDL gain greater learning outcomes from project based learning (PBL) approaches. To achieve this objective, a questionnaire survey of 26 students (65 per cent of class) completing an engineering management course was conducted. Linear regression analysis provided evidence that SDL readiness was a key enabler for achieving learning outcomes from PBL. In particular, having high self management skills was shown {{to be the most}} significant and reliable predictor for achieving learning outcomes from PBL. Through understanding students SDL readiness at the commencement of their engineering programs, academics can better tailor PBL support mechanisms to achieve desired learning outcomes.

40|$|Contemporary {{learning}} {{approaches have}} fewer structured learning activities and more self directed learning tasks guided through consultation with academics and tutors. Such tasks predominately follow a project and/or problem based learning (PBL) mantra where an individual student or {{a team of}} students is required to follow a freely <b>guided</b> <b>road</b> map to complete the tasks whilst simultaneously achieving desired learning outcomes for a particular course. However, many students struggle to adjust to such a learning environment where they are being increasingly encouraged to undertake self directed learning (SDL) activities. This paper utilises questionnaire survey approach to evaluate the SDL readiness factors and course learning outcomes for a large class of third year undergraduate civil engineering students at Griffith University, Australia. The {{results of the study}} showed that students with a higher grade point average (GPA) also typically had a higher SDL readiness; however learning outcomes achieved by the students from this PBL course were higher for those with a moderate GPA (i. e. 5 or credit average). This suggests that students performing moderately in their former fundamental engineering courses, had higher learning outcomes from this PBL course and higher achievers did not perceive to learn as much. A final overarching finding was that this course provided the necessary skills for students to confidently tackle PBL based courses in the future; undoubtedly the precursor for engineering graduate functions.

Simulation results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i. e., vehicle number and flux. At {{the end of this}} paper, we also discuss in what situation PFS will become invalid in multi-route systems.
