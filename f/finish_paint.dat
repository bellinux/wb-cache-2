5000|$|Mechanized car washes, {{especially}} those with brushes, were once avoided by some meticulous car owners {{because of the risk}} of damaging the <b>finish.</b> <b>Paint</b> finishes have improved as have car washing processes, and this perception of vehicle damage is much less prevalent today. However, this perception was the motive behind the rise of facilities utilizing [...] "brushless" [...] (cloth) and [...] "touch-free" [...] (high-pressure water) equipment, as well as modern [...] "foam" [...] washing wheels made of closed cell foam.|$|E
50|$|Acrylics (brushed or air-brushed), oil paints, brushed-on pastel dust, and etching {{away the}} {{original}} <b>finish</b> <b>paint</b> with an x-acto knife are all common {{materials and methods}} for altering {{the appearance of a}} model. Coloured pencils, watercolour (pencil and paint), and even ink are sometimes used as well. The preference for sculpted or hair manes and tails goes in and out of vogue and can vary by region as well. Mohair is generally used, though some artists use glue-coated embroidery thread to great effect creating something between a sculpted and haired appearance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{restoration}} {{includes a}} television {{of the same}} type originally installed in the console. A small reel-to-reel tape recorder hidden in the cockpit and which was intended to play a musical recording of the car's features was discovered along with the original tape during the restoration process and is in working order; the recording was reportedly done by Tex Ritter. Planet Plastics of Chino, California, the original company contracted to create the bubble top, was contracted to create a replacement. Evidence of the car's original [...] "candy blue" [...] color (similar in execution to [...] "candy apple red") was discovered within the interior and {{was used as a}} basis for matching the replacement <b>finish.</b> <b>Paint</b> work was overseen by Larry Watson, who painted the car in 1964. Watson was joined by his original assistant, Bill Carter who applied the new finish. A descendant of the individual responsible for the pin-striping applied the new pin-striping to the vehicle upon its completion. Interior restoration was by Joe Perez who was responsible for the original upholstery work as well. The original Chevrolet engine with its rare Stromberg 97 triple carburetor setup and Chevrolet Corvette finned aluminum valve covers has been rebuilt and reinstalled.|$|E
30|$|Two painted plaster fragments, FSC-A- 3 a and FSC-A- 3 b, were {{excavated}} at Persepolis {{and concluded}} by Herzfeld {{to be part}} of a floor. The <b>finish</b> <b>paint</b> layer is a deep red over a white layer on a pink plaster substrate. The plaster does not display voids indicative of a plant temper, but instead contains stone aggregate up to 0.75  cm in diameter. These stones would serve to control shrinkage, but also to impart compressive strength to the floor. The Persepolis plasters have lost little to no visible surface area from the historic photographs and are considerably more stable than the plasters from Pasargadae.|$|E

40|$|Galvanized steel {{specimens}} were {{coated with}} four different organic systems, containing either special acrylic resins or epoxy resins {{with or without}} wash primer. The anticorrosive performance of these duplex systems when exposed to an environment of 3. 5 percent w/w NaCl solution, was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, corrosion potential monitoring, potentiodynamic polarization and dielectric measurements. Interrelation of the obtained results, confined by visual observations after salt spray and weathering tests, shows that all four coating systems are more protective than simple galvanizing. The system, comprising a wash primer, a two-component epoxy resin primer and an epoxy resin <b>finish</b> <b>paint,</b> demonstrates the best anticorrosive behavior among the four systems examined...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of a biosensor for the amperometric measurement of galactose, {{in the presence of}} human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, with and without the presence of a hepatotoxic agent. The biosensor was fabricated by first drop-coating 1. 5 % cellulose acetate onto a 3 x 3 mm screen-printed carbon electrode. This was followed by depositing 2 U of galactose oxidase. Using gloss <b>finish</b> <b>paint</b> and a valox card to define the electrode area, the dimensions were reduced to 3 mm x 0. 5 mm. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells were utilised for in vitro toxicity testing, by evaluating the effect of paracetamol on galactose uptake. The amperometric responses to galactose indicated that the level of inhibition of uptake was directly proportional to the concentration of paracetamol after 24 hours of exposure to the hepatocellular carcinoma cells. These results demonstrate that the fabricated biosensor may be used for the real-time monitoring cell metabolism and toxicity testing...|$|E
40|$|In those {{industries}} in which materials are colored to close specifications, {{a means of}} evaluating the degree of metamerism of colored objects is of considerable importance. Based on Wyszecki 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis and its application to quantifying metamerism as described by Fairman, parameric decomposition is a technique to adjust one spectrum of a parameric match {{in order to achieve}} a perfect (metameric) match under a specific illumination and observer condition. This method can be viewed as batch correction using three 2 ̆ 2 colorants 2 ̆ 2 where the color-mixing model is linear in reflectance. The research in this thesis presented these methods using the basis functions from the CIE color-matching functions (CMFs) as well as alternative basis functions derived from dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) for a pre-defined DuPont spectral dataset and Munsell dataset. 1, 152 parameric pairs surrounding 24 color centers were synthesized using an automotive <b>finish</b> <b>paint</b> system and two-constant Kubelka-Munk turbid-media theory. Each parameric pair was corrected to a metameric pair using these various methods. The corrected spectra were compared with the formulated spectra using Kubelka-Munk theory to evaluate the parameric decomposition accuracy in terms of special and general metameric indices. The results showed that the estimated metameric indices from the CMFs-based process primaries presented relatively poor correlation to those from Kubelka-Munk theory. The process primaries from ICA for the Munsell IV dataset showed almost indentical performance in estimation of metameric indices to the process primaries from the PCA for Munsell dataset as well as those from ICA for the DuPont dataset. These three sets of process primaries showed slightly better performance in estimation of metameric indices than the process primaries from PCA for the DuPont dataset...|$|E
