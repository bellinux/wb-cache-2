Therefore, several Fine Beam RADARSAT- 1 SAR satellite images were acquired in winter / spring 2000 and 2001, and analyzed for ice types and ice-front locations. Video footage of the ice conditions on the Peace River was obtained from aerial ice observations that were conducted simultaneously with the image acquisitions. The analysis of the images was done 1) visually and 2) using an Unsupervised Fuzzy K-means Classification. By visually analyzing the images, several river ice features could be identified, including frazil pans, <b>frazil</b> floes, shore <b>ice</b> composed of <b>frazil</b> slush, melting <b>ice,</b> and brash. Juxtaposed and secondary consolidated ice could be distinguished relative from each other. Under most conditions encountered in this study, {{the location of the}} ice front coincided {{with the head of the}} complete ice cover, and was, therefore, discernible from the SAR images. Ambiguities arose from open water and freeze-over border ice. By comparison, the Unsupervised Classification broke the data into four classes, which represent river signatures ranging from open water to ice with a strong radar return. No physically existing ice types could be assigned to the three categories representing ice features. However, the spatial distribution of ice features closely matches the visible ice types on the river. User interpretation is required to derive ice types from the classification maps. This study suggests that the visual analysis of SAR imagery is very powerful for river ice type classifications, but that more effort needs to be made to further develop automated river ice classification techniques. 1...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION There is {{a strong}} {{seasonal}} and regional variability in the sea ice distribution in the Kara and Pechora Seas. This is an important sea ice production region because of very low air temperatures and repeated opening of polynya areas driven mainly by strong winds. Various ice types can be found during the whole ice season, from thin <b>ice</b> types like <b>frazil</b> and grease <b>ice</b> to first year ice, and multi year ice near the Severnaya Zemlya area. The following description of the Pechora and Kara Sea region is mainly based on [1, 2, 3]. The Pechora Sea {{is influenced by the}} relatively warm extension of the Gulf Stream, the North Cape Current, which carries water into the sea from southwest. This current also flows northwards off the eastern coast of Novaya Zemlya, and prevents ice formation in these areas. These warm water masses do not enter the Kara Sea. The Kara Sea is often totally ice covered from November to June, and is characterized by land fast ice along major parts of the co...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) data from TerraSAR-X were compared with RADARSAT- 2 data to evaluate their effectiveness for river ice monitoring on the Peace River. For several years RADARSAT- 2 data have been successfully used for river ice observation. However, {{it is important to}} take into account data from other satellites as they may provide solutions when {{it is not possible to}} obtain images from the preferred system (e. g., in the case of acquisition priority conflicts). In this study we compared three TerraSAR-X (X-band) and three RADARSAT- 2 (C-band) datasets acquired in December 2013 on a section of the Peace River, Canada. For selected classes (open water, skim ice, juxtaposed skim ice, agglomerated skim <b>ice,</b> <b>frazil</b> run and consolidated ice) we compared backscattering values in HH and VV polarisation and performed Wishart supervised classification. Covariance matrices that were previously filtered using a refined Lee filter were used as input data for classification. For all data sets the overall accuracy was higher than 80 %. Similar errors associated with classification output were observed for data from both satellite systems...|$|R
50|$|These methods either {{heat the}} {{structures}} in the water to prevent <b>frazil</b> <b>ice</b> adhesion or heat the water to prevent <b>frazil</b> <b>ice</b> from forming in the first place. When heating the structure, it must be heated to a temperature above freezing. Electrical resistance heaters {{have been found to}} work well, but these have potential safety problems. Installing hollow tubes in the structures through which steam or warm water is pumped also works, but this method has been seen to cause operational problems. Other active methods are also available. Sometimes warm water byproducts are released from nearby water facilities, and the warm water is wasted. Redirecting this water to potential <b>frazil</b> <b>ice</b> accumulation regions could raise the water temperature 0.1-0.2 °C, often enough to prevent supercooled water from developing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frazil</b> <b>ice</b> is a {{collection}} of loose, randomly oriented needle-shaped ice crystals in water. It resembles slush and has the appearance of being slightly oily when seen on the surface of water. It sporadically forms in open, turbulent, supercooled water, which means that it usually forms in rivers, lakes and oceans, on clear nights when the weather is colder, and air temperature reaches -6 C or lower. <b>Frazil</b> <b>ice</b> is the first stage in the formation of sea ice.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways to control <b>frazil</b> <b>ice</b> build up. They include suppression, {{mechanical}} control, thermal control, vibration, materials selection and damage mitigation.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{properties}} of <b>frazil</b> and grease <b>ice</b> {{depending on their}} microstructures are not easily measured, while they are important elements for predicting their behavior on the ocean surface. Thus, numerical models considering {{the effect of the}} microstructures are required to investigate the ice-water mixture. In this paper, we combined a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crystal growth model, and numerically predicted a process of flotation and accumulation of crystal nuclei near the surface of calm sea, and their growth after the accumulation. The results obtained showed that the crystal fabrics and c-axis distributions had good similarity with those of an actual sea ice, and the combined model was effective for dealing with ice-water mixture. Thus far, while we have paid little attention to the details of c-axis distributions within the surface layer of sea ice because of their tedious investigation, the results also indicated that anisotropic growth of crystal nuclei, as well as the flotation and accumulation, strongly affects the c-axis distributions within the horizontal cross-sections of the surface layer of sea ice grown under calm sea conditions. This work would be an important step for the development of numerical models to predict the complex phenomena of sea ice depending on the microstructures, such as behavior of the ice-water mixture on the sea surface...|$|R
50|$|In calm water, {{the first}} sea ice to {{form on the}} surface is a skim of {{separate}} crystals which initially are {{in the form of}} tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than 0.3 cm. Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable, and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile, and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an <b>ice</b> type called <b>frazil</b> or grease <b>ice.</b> In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent — that is the ice called nilas. Once nilas has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on {{to the bottom of the}} existing ice sheet, a process called congelation growth. This growth process yields first-year ice.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} water wave {{scattering}} by two sharp discontinuities {{in the surface}} boundary conditions involving infinitely deep water is examined here by reducing it to two coupled Carleman-type singular integral equations. The discontinuities arise due {{to the presence of}} two types of non-interacting materials floating on the surface, one type being {{in the form of an}} infinite strip of finite width sandwiched between another type. The non-interacting materials form an inertial surface which is a mass-loading model of floating ice and is regarded as a material of uniform surface density having no elastic property. The two integral equations are solved approximately by assuming the two discontinuities to be widely separated, and approximate analytical expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients are also obtained. This problem has applications in wave propagation through strips of <b>frazil</b> or pancake <b>ice</b> modelled as floating inertial surfaces. Numerical results for the reflection coefficient are depicted graphically against the wave number for different values of the surface densities of the two types of floating materials. The main feature of the graphs is the oscillatory nature of the reflection coefficient and occurrence of zero reflection for an increasing sequence of discrete values of the wave number. A direct analytical treatment to solve the integral equations numerically, when the separation length between the two discontinuities is arbitrary, is also indicated. For the case of more than two discontinuities the solution methodology of the corresponding scattering problem is described briefly...|$|R

50|$|In rough water, fresh sea ice {{is formed}} by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere. The {{uppermost}} layer of the ocean is supercooled to slightly below the freezing point, at which time tiny ice platelets (<b>frazil</b> <b>ice)</b> form. With time, this process leads to a mushy surface layer, known as grease ice. <b>Frazil</b> <b>ice</b> formation may also be started by snowfall, rather than supercooling. Waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates, of several meters in diameter, called pancake ice. These float on the ocean surface, and collide with one another, forming upturned edges. In time, the pancake ice plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover, known as consolidated pancake ice. Such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom.|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} {{provides}} {{a description of}} the ice jam phenomena along the river of Bistrita, which has the longest mountainous course in Romania (216 km). During the cold season of the year, in the upstream of the Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir over a length of 25 - 30 km, there are generated with a almost yearly frequency ice blocks accumulations known as ice jams. Analysis of the hidroclimatical and morphological conditions of the river bed has revealed that they are favorable to formation of ice jam provided there is present a certain combination of their temporal variations. Hidraulic geometry of the Bistrita river bed is favorable to flow of frazil slush, <b>frazil</b> pans and <b>ice</b> floes while the air temperature is - 7 oC as long as the level of Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir is below 500 m. Over this level, the river bed is blocked with ice jam during the submerse phase of the lake and this blockage advances upstream with velocities of several hudreds of meters per day. The most dramatic phenomena has been recorded during the winter of 2002 - 2003 when the thickness of the ice was of 6 meters and it caused floods that provoked damages and claimed human lives. Aparition in 2003 of the Topoliceni Reservoir, placed 6 km upstream of the Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir, has complicated the evolution of the phenomena, the lake itself acting as an accumulation pool for the ices in the upstream. </p...|$|R
40|$|Preserving {{hydrological}} variability is important when developing environmental flow regimes, {{and a number}} of tools have been developed to support this process. A commonly applied method is the index of hydrological alteration (IHA), which describes a set of indices {{that can be used to}} assess changes in flow regimes. In cold climate regions, river ice can have large effects on flow regimes through <b>frazil</b> and anchor <b>ice</b> formation, ice cover formation, and ice break-up, and the impact of this is usually not included in the commonly used indexes. However, to understand the effect of ice formation and the break-up on the flow regime, the ice effects on the hydrology should be considered when assessing winter alteration indexes. This paper looks at the effects of river ice on winter flow conditions using data from Norwegian rivers, and discusses these effects in relation to {{hydrological variability}}. This paper also shows how indexes can be used to classify ice-induced variability, how this should be used to avoid ice-induced effects in the current analysis, and how this can be combined with the current indices to improve the winter flow regime classification. The findings from this paper show that frazil- and anchor-induced raises of the water level have a large impact on the perceived flow in winter, producing higher flow and deeper water than what the open water conditions discharge could do. Corresponding to this, winter lows connected to ice-induced high flows at other locations are also common. Finally, issues related to the assessment of the temporal and spatial effects of ice formation are discussed...|$|R

From three cores with contrasted physico-chemical characteristics, we report significant isotopic fractionations linked to diatom activity with distinct silicon biogeochemical dynamics between different brine structures. The diatoms in snow ice and in brine pockets of <b>frazil</b> or congelation <b>ice</b> have the heavier silicon-isotopic composition (+ 0. 53 to + 0. 86 ‰), indicating that they grow in a closed system and use a significant fraction of the small dissolved silicon pool available. In the brine channels and skeletal layer, diatoms display a relatively lower silicon-isotopic composition (+ 0. 41 to + 0. 70 ‰), although it is still relatively positive compared to expected equilibrium fractionation. This suggests that the diatoms have grown in a semi-closed system where the dissolved silicon pool (i. e., brine) is partially replenished. The silicon-isotopic composition (+ 0. 63 ‰) of the sea-ice diatoms is much heavier than the one of biogenic silica in the seasonal ice zone mixed layer (+ 0. 09 ‰).

40|$|Riparian zones support some of {{the most}} dynamic and species-rich plant {{communities}} in cold regions. A common conception among plant ecologists is that flooding during the season when plants are dormant generally has little effect on the survival and production of riparian vegetation. We show that winter floods may also be of fundamental importance for the composition of riverine vegetation. We investigated the effects of ice formation on riparian and in-stream vegetation in northern Sweden using a combination of experiments and observations in 25 reaches, spanning a gradient from ice-free to ice-rich reaches. The ice-rich reaches were characterized by high production of <b>frazil</b> and anchor <b>ice.</b> In a couple of experiments, we exposed riparian vegetation to experimentally induced winter flooding, which reduced the dominant dwarf-shrub cover and led to colonization of a species-rich forb-dominated vegetation. In another experiment, natural winter floods caused by anchor-ice formation removed plant mimics both in the in-stream and in the riparian zone, further supporting the result that anchor ice maintains dynamic plant communities. With a warmer winter climate, ice-induced winter floods may first increase in frequency because of more frequent shifts between freezing and thawing during winter, but further warming and shortening of the winter might make them less common than today. If ice-induced winter floods become reduced in number because of a warming climate, an important disturbance agent for riparian and in-stream vegetation will be removed, leading to reduced species richness in streams and rivers in cold regions. Given that such regions are expected to have more plant species in the future because of immigration from the south, the distribution of species richness among habitats can be expected to show novel patterns...|$|R
40|$|As an inhomogeneous {{mixture of}} pure ice, brine, air and solid salts the {{physical}} properties of sea ice depend on its highly temperature-dependent microstructure. Understanding the microstructure {{and the way}} it responds to variations in temperature and salinity is crucial in developing an improved understanding of the interaction between sea ice and the environment. However, measurements monitoring the microstructure of sea ice are difficult to obtain without disturbing its natural state. The brine fraction of sea ice is orders of magnitude more conductive than the solid ice, thus direct current resistivity techniques should yield information on sea ice microstructure. Due to the preferential vertical alignment of brine inclusions, the bulk resistivity of first-year sea ice is anisotropic, complicating interpretation of surface resistivity soundings. However, it can be shown that in a bounded anisotropic medium the resistivity structure may be resolved through in situ cross-borehole measurements. Measurement between borehole pairs, each containing one current and one potential electrode, allows the determination of the horizontal component of the anisotropic bulk resistivity (PH). Using three to four electrodes positioned at approximately the same depth in separate boreholes, provides an under-estimation of the geometric mean resistivity (Pm), and numerical modelling is required to retrieve an estimate of the true Pm. Combining these resistivities allows calculation of the vertical component of the bulk resistivity (PV). This thesis looks at results from measurements made in first year sea ice in April – June 2008 off Barrow, Alaska and in November 2009 off Ross Island, Antarctica. At Barrow, relatively quiescent conditions typically lead to a predominance of columnar ice, while more turbulent conditions and underwater ice formation in McMurdo Sound tend to produce a larger component of <b>frazil</b> or platelet <b>ice.</b> Interpretation of the resistivity measurements, aided by temperature and salinity data, shows that this measurement technique can be used to observe evolution of the ice structure, and distinguish different ice types. Basic two phase structures provide a simple picture of the brine microstructure and how it changes with depth and time. These models indicate the need for vertical connectivity of the brine inclusions even in cool ice, and that PH seems to be mostly due to connections along grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Despite the Arctic sea ice cover's {{recognized}} {{sensitivity to}} environmental change, {{the role of}} sediment inclusions in lowering ice albedo and affecting ice ablation is poorly understood. Sea ice sediment inclusions were studied in the central Arctic Ocean during the Arctic 91 expedition and in the Laptev Sea (East Siberian Arctic Region Expedition 1992). Results from these investigations are here combined with previous studies performed in major areas of ice ablation and the southern central Arctic Ocean. This study documents the regional distribution and composition of particle-laden ice, investigates and evaluates processes by which sediment is incorporated into the ice cover, and identifies transport paths and probable depositional centers for the released sediment. In April 1992, sea ice in the Laptev Sea was relatively clean. The sediment occasionally observed was distributed diffusely over the entire ice column, forming turbid ice. Observations indicate that <b>frazil</b> and anchor <b>ice</b> formation occurring in a large coastal polynya provide a main mechanism for sediment entrainment. In the central Arctic Ocean sediments are concentrated in layers within or at the surface of ice floes due to melting and refreezing processes. The surface sediment accumulation in central Arctic multi-year sea ice exceeds by far the amounts observed in first-year ice from the Laptev Sea in April 1992. Sea ice sediments are generally fine grained, although coarse sediments and stones up to 5 cm in diameter are observed. Component analysis indicates that quartz and clay minerals are the main terrigenous sediment particles. The biogenous components, namely shells of pelecypods and benthic foraminiferal tests, point to a shallow, benthic, marine source area. Apparently, sediment inclusions were resuspended from shelf areas before and incorporated into the sea ice by suspension freezing. Clay mineralogy of ice-rafted sediments provides information on potential source areas. A smectite maximum in sea ice sediment samples repeatedly occurred between 81 °N and 83 °N along the Arctic 91 transect, indicating a rather stable and narrow smectite rich ice drift stream of the Transpolar Drift. The smectite concentrations are comparable {{to those found in}} both Laptev Sea shelf sediments and anchor ice sediments, pointing to this sea as a potential source area for sea ice sediments. In the central Arctic Ocean sea ice clay mineralogy is significantly different from deep-sea clay mineral distribution patterns. The contribution of sea ice sediments to the deep sea is apparently diluted by sedimentary material provided by other transport mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|Once a crack occurs {{within the}} ice cover {{and begins to}} expand {{to make up a}} lead, the open water inside the lead is exposed to the cold air {{temperatures}} and will freeze.

Following a stage of <b>frazil</b> <b>ice</b> formation, which sometimes results from seeding by snow crystals, the resulting thin ice skim is followed by the growth of congelation ice. In windier regions, as in the Southern Ocean, <b>frazil</b> <b>ice</b> accumulation may occur along the downwind side of leads.

40|$|In the {{seasonal}} climates of northern Europe and North America, winter {{is considered a}} particularly ecologically challenging season for aquatic organisms in natural streams. They experience reduced flow and freezing in winter, with associated hydro-physical changes. In ectothermic animals, like the cold-water fish Atlantic salmon and brown trout, biochemical reactions and behaviors depend on water temperature. Many northern rivers are also impacted by hydropower regulation, which may increase winter stream flow and temperatures, and reduce ice formation and surface ice cover. Knowledge about salmon and trout winter survival strategies and responses to these hydropower impacts {{is a prerequisite for}} adaptive management of regulated rivers in winter. The complex ice processes are driven by winter intensity and duration, hydrologic conditions and channel characteristics, and tend to become more complex and pervasive in smaller, high-gradient streams. Winter stream ice formation may be divided into the dynamic period ‘freeze-up’ in early winter with sub-surface ice, more stable ‘mid-winter’ with surface ice, and the ecologically challenging ‘ice breakup’ in late winter with potential mechanical ice runs and scouring. The duration of periods vary depending on climate and hydropower regulation, particularly the mid-winter period may change or become absent in regulated streams. An ice classification model may predict type of ice cover forming in a natural reach depending on stream morphology (e. g. gradient, size, and substrate), and winter intensity and duration, and identify ice processes. Hydropower regulation modify natural winter stream conditions, particularly in reaches downstream of power-plant outlets by increased water temperature and reduced surface ice formation, and in bypass reaches by decreased flow and enhanced freezing. The stable mid-winter periods may be replaced by repeated unstable transition periods. High head regulation may increase downstream water flow and water temperature, whereas low head systems may have small or no major impacts on downstream ice conditions. Quantitative knowledge about longitudinal water temperature changes is limited, especially in relation to alternative regulation regimes and intakes/outlets. Hydro-peaked systems may aggravate high-low flow effects, depending on down-ramping rate, ramping amplitude, frequency of flow fluctuations, prior flow conditions, and timing of pulse. A basic winter survival strategy in salmon and trout is energy storage. Their feeding and growth performance is limited at low temperatures, and additional related winter strategies are reduced metabolism, tolerance and starvation effected by quiescence. Energy storage may depend on local conditions, but otherwise there is little indication of adaptation to local thermal climates. Intraspecific phenotypic plasticity is important. The main behavioral strategy is risk-reducing sheltering and nocturnalism. As temperatures drop to 6 - 8 °C or lower, salmon and trout become less active, seek more shelter in the substratum or deep areas, and are active at night. During freezing and before surface ice cover, the heat loss and associated <b>frazil</b> and anchor <b>ice</b> formation is greatest at night, and visual predators are at a disadvantage. Trout and salmon appear to cope well with thermal ice phenomena, and do not appear to become trapped in ice. Surface ice may reduce fish metabolism, but other factors, e. g. availability of substrate shelter, may override this effect. Mechanical ice breakup may reduce survival. Higher flows in winter may increase rearing and/or resting habitat, which may benefit fish survival, but studies are few. Low flows increase ice formation, reduce and fragment available habitat, and may reduce egg and fish survival. However, influx of ground water may mitigate these impacts during shorter periods with stranding. Sudden drops in regulated water discharge have been demonstrated to result in fish stranding, in particular at low temperatures in the daytime when fish are less mobile and seek shelter. Local movements between daytime refuges and night-time slow-current activity areas are usually limited (less than 1 m), but with individual variation and single movements up to several kilometers. Larger fish may move more and aggregate in restricted suitable deep-slow refuge habitats such as pools and deep glides. Water temperature and/or flow may control more local spawning/smolt migrations, particularly in smaller streams. In regulated systems, flow during spawning season should not be higher than minimum maintained flow during winter to avoid dewatering and mortality of eggs. Egg development is linked to water temperature. Emerging alevins and young fry are sensitive and vulnerable, often incurring high moralities. Survival may depend on a delicate balance between suitable low flows and available drifting food during and after the ‘swim-up’ stage. Useful hydrophysical and ice-formation models have been developed to help in impact analysis and adaptive management, but more sophisticated models are often data intensive, and several ice phenomena are still difficult to model. Efforts to integrate biological and societal considerations via e. g. Multi- Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), have increased during recent years, but so far met with limited success. In conclusion, potential mitigating measures and research needs are tabulated...|$|R

Suppression {{is the idea}} of ‘insulating’ the surface water with an intact, stable ice cover. The ice cover will prevent heat loss and warm the supercooled water that might have already formed. Sufficient area needs to be covered in order for this method to work, but it is still unknown what is meant by [...] "sufficient".|$|E
