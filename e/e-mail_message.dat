25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the senderâ€™s <b>e-mail</b> <b>message</b> as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an <b>e-mail</b> <b>message</b> while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.|$|E
25|$|Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on {{a remote}} server), the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an {{application}} more responsive. Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an <b>e-mail</b> <b>message)</b> to the server. The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.|$|E

[...] It was originally {{supposed to be the}} second episode shown in the series, but the broadcast schedule was changed and [...] "Canvassing," [...] the original third episode, was shown second instead.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a system to summarize <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages.</b> The system exploits two aspects of e-mail, thread reply chains and commonly-found features, to generate summaries. The system uses existing software designed to summarize single text documents. Such software typically performs best on well-authored, formal documents. <b>E-mail</b> <b>messages,</b> however, are typically neither well-authored, nor formal. As a result, existing summarization software gives a poor summary of <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages.</b> To remedy this poor performance, our system pre-processes email messages using heuristics to remove e-mail signatures, header fields, and quoted text from parent messages. We also present a heuristics-based approach to identifying and reporting names, dates, and companies found in <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages.</b> Lastly, we discuss conclusions from a pilot user study of the summarization system, and conclude with areas for further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the Licensing Support Network (LSN) Assistant [...] {{a set of}} tools for categorizing <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages</b> and documents, and investigating and correcting existing archives of categorized <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages</b> and documents. The two main tools in the LSN Assistant are the LSN Archive Assistant (LSNAA) tool for recategorizing manually labeled <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages</b> and documents and the LSN Realtime Assistant (LSNRA) tool for categorizing new <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages</b> and documents. This report focuses on the LSNAA tool. There are two main components of the LSNAA tool. The first is the Sandia Categorization Framework, {{which is responsible for}} providing categorizations for documents in an archive and storing them in an appropriate Categorization Database. The second is the actual user interface, which primarily interacts with the Categorization Database, providing a way for finding and correcting categorizations errors in the database. A procedure for applying the LSNAA tool and an example use case of the LSNAA tool applied to a set of <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages</b> are provided. Performance results of the categorization model designed for this example use case are presented...|$|R

2500|$|In October 2006, {{two weeks}} after bass guitarist Guy Berryman welcomed his first daughter, which makes him the third Coldplay member to have a child, reports {{circulated}} that the band were taking a five-year hiatus. The new baby, {{and the fact that}} Coldplay had no touring or recording schedule at the time, had fans wondering if the band's new album would not be released until 2010. Dispelling such reports, Ambrosia Healy, spokesperson to Capitol Records, sent an <b>e-mail</b> <b>message</b> to MTV that there was no self-imposed hiatus.

40|$|For this thesis, I {{designed}} and implemented {{a system to}} summarize <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages.</b> The system exploits two aspects of e-mail, thread reply chains and commonly-found features, to generate summaries. The system uses existing software designed to summarize single text documents. Such software typically performs best on well-authored, formal documents. <b>E-mail</b> <b>messages,</b> however, are typically neither well-authored, nor formal. As a result, existing summarization software typically gives a poor summary of <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages.</b> To remedy this poor performance, the system's approach preprocesses <b>e-mail</b> <b>messages</b> to synthesize new input to this software, {{so that it will}} output more useful summaries of e-mail. This pre-processing involves a lightweight, heuristics-based approach to filtering e-mail to remove e-mail signatures, header fields, and quoted parent messages.
