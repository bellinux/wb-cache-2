The <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> to be released was [...] "Semper Fidelis" [...] by the U.S. Marine Band. At first, cylinders were released sparingly, but as their sales grew more profitable, distribution increased. These early recorded songs were a mix of vaudeville, barbershop quartets, marches, opera, novelty songs, and other popular tunes. Many popular standards, such as [...] "The Good Old Summertime", [...] "Shine On Harvest Moon", and [...] "Over There" [...] come from this time.

60|$|From which Experiments, I think, we may safely conclude, {{that the}} Elater of the Air is {{reciprocal}} to its extension, {{or at least}} very neer. So that to apply it to our present purpose (which was indeed the chief cause of inventing these wayes of tryal) we will suppose a Cylinder indefinitely extended upwards, [I say a Cylinder, not {{a piece of a}} Cone, because, as I may elsewhere shew in the Explication of Gravity, that triplicate proportion of the shels of a Sphere, to their respective diameters, I suppose to be removed in this case by the decrease of the power of Gravity] and the pressure of the Air at the bottom of this Cylinder to be strong enough to keep up a Cylinder of Mercury of thirty inches: Now because by the most accurate tryals of the most illustrious and incomparable Mr. Boyle, published in his deservedly famous Pneumatick Book, the weight of Quicksilver, to that of the Air here below, is found neer about as fourteen thousand to one: If we suppose the parts of the Cylinder of the Atmosphere to be every where of an equal density, we shall (as he there deduces) find it extended to the height of thirty five thousand feet, or seven miles: But because by these Experiments we have somewhat confirm'd the hypothesis of the reciprocal proportion of the Elaters to the Extensions we shall find, that by supposing this Cylinder of the Atmosphere divided into a thousand parts, each of which being equivalent to thirty five feet, or seven geometrical paces, that is, each of these divisions containing as much Air as is suppos'd in a Cylinder neer the earth of equal diameter, and thirty five foot high, we shall find the lowermost to press against the surface of the Earth with the whole weight of the above mentioned thousand parts; the pressure of the bottom of the second against the top of the first to be 1000 - 1 = 999. of the third against the second to be 1000 - 2 = 998. of the fourth against the third to be 1000 - 3 = 997. of the uppermost against the 999. or that next below it, to be 1000 - 999 = 1. so that the extension of the lowermost next the Earth, will be to the extension of the next below the uppermost, as 1. to 999. for as the pressure sustained by the 999. is to the pressure sustain'd by the first, so is the extension of the first to the extension of the 999. so that, from this hypothetical calculation, we shall find the Air to be indefinitely extended: For if we suppose the whole thickness of the Air to be divided, as I just now instanced, into a thousand parts, and each of those under differing Dimensions, or Altitudes, to contain an equall quantity of Air, we shall find, that the <b>first</b> <b>Cylinder,</b> whose Base is supposed to lean on the Earth, will be found to be extended 35-35/999 foot; the second equal Division, or Cylinder, whose basis is supposed to lean {{on the top of the}} first, shall have its top extended higher by 35-70/998 the third 35-105/997 the fourth 35-140/996 and so onward, each equal quantity of Air having its dimensions measured by 35. and some additional number exprest alwayes in the manner of a fraction, whose numerator is alway the number of the place multipli'd by 35. and whose denominator is alwayes the pressure of the Atmosphere sustain'd by that part, so that by this means we may easily calculate the height of 999. divisions of those 1000. divisions, I suppos'd; whereas the uppermost may extend it self more then as high again, nay, perhaps indefinitely, or beyond the Moon; for the Elaters and Expansions being in reciprocal proportions, since we cannot yet find the plus ultra, beyond which the Air will not expand it self, we cannot determine the height of the Air: for since, as we have shewn, the proportion will be alway as the pressure sustain'd by any part is to 35. so 1000. to the expansion of that part; the multiplication or product therefore of the pressure, and expansion, that is, of the two extream proportionals, being alwayes equal to the product of the means, or 35000. it follows, since that Rectangle or Product may be made up of the multiplication of infinite diversities of numbers, that the height of the Air is also indefinite; for since (as far as I have yet been able to try) the Air seems capable of an indefinite Expansion, the pressure may be decreased in infinitum, and consequently its expansion upwards indefinite also.|$|E

50|$|An oxygen {{concentrator}} has an air compressor, two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets, a pressure equalizing reservoir, and some valves and tubes. In the first half-cycle the <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> receives {{air from the}} compressor, which lasts about 3 seconds. During that time the pressure in the <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> rises from atmospheric to about 1.5 times normal atmospheric pressure (typically 20 psi/138 kPa gauge, or 2.36 atmospheres absolute) and the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen. As the <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> reaches near pure oxygen (there are small amounts of argon, CO2, water vapour, radon and other minor atmospheric components) in the first half-cycle, a valve opens and the oxygen enriched gas flows to the pressure equalizing reservoir, which connects to the patient's oxygen hose. At {{the end of the}} first half of the cycle, there is another valve position change so that the air from the compressor is directed to the 2nd cylinder. Pressure in the <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> drops as the enriched oxygen moves into the reservoir, allowing the nitrogen to be desorbed back into gas. Part way through the second half of the cycle there is another valve position change to vent the gas in the <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> back into the ambient atmosphere, keeping the concentration of oxygen in the pressure equalizing reservoir from falling below about 90%. The pressure in the hose delivering oxygen from the equalizing reservoir is kept steady by a pressure reducing valve.|$|E
5000|$|To {{simplify the}} engine and reduce costs, the V-twin {{ignition}} was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor. This {{is known as a}} dual fire ignition system, causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke, with the other spark plug firing on its cylinder's exhaust stroke, effectively [...] "wasting a spark". The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping.The 45° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such: The <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> fires, the second (rear) cylinder fires 315° later, then there is a 405° gap until the <b>first</b> <b>cylinder</b> fires again, giving the engine its unique sound.|$|E

Most of the surviving 1888 recordings would be formulated from a combination of ceresin wax, carnauba wax, stearic acid, and beeswax.
