5|$|Deeper {{insight into}} the nature of chess came with two younger players. American Paul Morphy, an {{extraordinary}} chess prodigy, won against all important competitors (except Howard Staunton, who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he <b>intuitively</b> knew how to prepare attacks.|$|E
5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, <b>intuitively</b> romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intuitively,</b> the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intuitively,</b> {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity result that applies to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E
5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as <b>intuitively</b> given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. <b>Intuitively,</b> the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. <b>Intuitively,</b> one {{can think of}} a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E
5|$|Supersymmetry {{severely}} {{restricts the}} possible number of dimensions of a brane. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. <b>Intuitively,</b> these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, Michael Duff, Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity {{with one of}} the dimensions curled up into a circle. In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.|$|E
5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows <b>intuitively</b> from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E
5|$|Sega also {{experienced}} success with arcade games. In 1992 and 1993, the company's new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased Sega AM2's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter (the first 3D fighting game), which {{played a crucial}} role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. In particular, Virtua Fighter garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with the game's strategy coming from the <b>intuitively</b> observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. Despite its crude visuals—with characters composed of fewer than 1,200 polygons—Virtua Fighters fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites. The Model 1 was an expensive system board, and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required more than its hardware could handle. Several alternatives helped to bring Sega's newest arcade games to the console, such as the Sega Virtua Processor chip used for Virtua Racing, and eventually the Sega 32X add-on.|$|E

25|$|A {{satisfactory}} resolution {{should also}} explain why there naively {{appears to be}} a paradox. Solutions that accept the paradoxical conclusion can do this by presenting a proposition that we <b>intuitively</b> know to be false but that is easily confused with (PC), while solutions that reject (EC) or (NC) should present a proposition that we <b>intuitively</b> know to be true but that is easily confused with (EC) or (NC).|$|E
25|$|Two-slit {{diffraction}} is {{a famous}} {{example of the}} strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not <b>intuitively</b> associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits {{cancel each other out}} in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. <b>Intuitively,</b> one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.|$|E
25|$|Wiki {{promotes}} meaningful topic {{associations between}} different pages by making page link creation <b>intuitively</b> easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not.|$|E

25|$|Using this Carnapian approach, Maher {{identifies}} {{a proposition}} which we <b>intuitively</b> (and correctly) {{know to be}} false, but which we easily confuse with the paradoxical conclusion. The proposition in question is the proposition that observing non-ravens tells us about the color of ravens. While this is <b>intuitively</b> false and is also false according to Carnap's theory of induction, observing non-ravens (according to that same theory) causes us to reduce our estimate {{of the total number}} of ravens, and thereby reduces the estimated number of possible counterexamples to the rule that all ravens are black.|$|E

25|$|One {{advantage}} of Bayesian networks {{is that it}} is <b>intuitively</b> easier for a human to understand (a sparse set of) direct dependencies and local distributions than complete joint distributions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intuitively,</b> minimisation seeks—beginning {{the search}} from 0 and {{proceeding}} upwards—the smallest argument {{that causes the}} function to return zero; {{if there is no}} such argument, the search never terminates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intuitively,</b> the theorem simply {{states that}} the sum of infinitesimal changes in a {{quantity}} over time (or over some other variable) adds up to the net change in the quantity.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of the cavity can be understood <b>intuitively</b> {{as one of the}} channel's mechanisms for overcoming the dielectric barrier, or repulsion by the low-dielectric membrane, by keeping the K+ ion in a watery, high-dielectric environment.|$|E
25|$|Applicative order: The rightmost, {{innermost}} redex {{is always}} reduced first. <b>Intuitively</b> {{this means a}} function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymmetry}} {{between the}} prograde and retrograde satellites {{can be explained}} very <b>intuitively</b> by the Coriolis acceleration in the frame rotating with the planet. For the prograde satellites the acceleration points outward and for the retrograde it points inward, stabilising the satellite.|$|E
25|$|In common language, {{for example}} in primary school, natural numbers may be called {{counting}} numbers both to <b>intuitively</b> exclude the negative integers and zero, and also to contrast the discreteness of counting to the continuity of measurement, established by the real numbers.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} (X smooth over C), these {{homomorphism}}s form a ring homomorphism from the Chow ring to the cohomology ring. <b>Intuitively,</b> {{this is because}} the products in both the Chow ring and the cohomology ring describe the intersection of cycles.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{equivalent}} ways of defining the tangent spaces of a manifold. While the definition via {{the velocity of}} curves is <b>intuitively</b> the simplest, {{it is also the}} most cumbersome to work with. More elegant and abstract approaches are described below.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{chemical}} and physical factors involved in ion suppression {{are not fully}} understood, it has been proposed that basicity, high concentration, mass and more <b>intuitively,</b> co-elution with the analyte of interest are factors which should not be ignored.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intuitively,</b> since a {{normalised}} {{wave function}} stays normalised while evolving {{according to the}} wave equation, {{there will be a}} relationship between the change in the probability density of the particle's position and the change in the amplitude at these positions.|$|E

25|$|In a formula, a {{variable}} may occur free or bound. <b>Intuitively,</b> {{a variable}} is free in a formula {{if it is}} not quantified: in , variable x is free while y is bound. The free and bound variables of a formula are defined inductively as follows.|$|E
