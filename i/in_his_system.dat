5|$|An autopsy of Hawkins {{showed that}} he had 200 nanograms per {{milliliter}} of Valium <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system,</b> which is {{the low end of}} its therapeutic-use range (100-1500ng/mL). No trace of any other drug was found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Back at FBI headquarters, Scully {{testifies to}} Skinner that she {{believes}} Mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty, noting that Pincus {{and several others}} mysteriously disappeared, {{that there was an}} intruder in Mulder's room, and that Backus did have some sort of chemical <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system.</b> Afterward she tells Mulder that she said it was Folie à deux, and describes it as 'a madness shared by two'. But she does not specify who the two were.|$|E
5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a coping mechanism, and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system</b> the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system</b> were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system,</b> combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system.</b> After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan {{captured}} {{two more}} ranking {{titles in the}} 1997/1998 season. By beating three-time defending champion Stephen Hendry 10–6 in the final, O'Sullivan won his second UK Championship title. O'Sullivan also triumphed at the Scottish Open by defeating John Higgins 9–5 in the final. For the third year in a row, O'Sullivan made {{the final of the}} Charity Challenge. He was defeated, like the year previous, in a final frame decider, 8–9 to John Higgins. For {{the first time in three}} years O'Sullvian did not reach the final at the Masters, losing to Steve Davis. After defeating Ken Doherty 9–3 in the final of the Irish Masters, a post-match drug test found traces of cannabis <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system.</b> O'Sullivan was stripped of the title, forfeited of the prize money and the title was awarded to Doherty by the WPBSA. O'Sullivan reached the World Championship semi-finals for the second time in his career, but lost 9–17 to eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey dropped Alan Ball and John Connelly {{and brought}} in Terry Paine and Martin Peters, whose {{advanced}} style of play as a midfielder matched the qualities Ramsey looked for <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system.</b> England beat Mexico 2–0. Ramsey replaced Terry Paine with Ian Callaghan for their final group match, against France. England won 2–0, securing qualification to the knockout rounds. Two difficult situations arose from the final group match, however. After making a vicious tackle and being cautioned, midfielder Nobby Stiles came under fire from senior FIFA officials, who called for Ramsey to drop him from the side. Ramsey strongly disagreed, and told the FA to inform FIFA that either Stiles would remain in his team or Ramsey himself would resign. Another bad tackle was committed during that match, resulting in Tottenham striker (and one of England's most prolific goal-scorers) Jimmy Greaves being injured and sidelined {{for the next few}} matches. Despite having more experienced strikers in his squad, Ramsey selected young Geoff Hurst as Greaves's replacement, once again seeing potential in the young West Ham forward. The France match also marked Ramsey's final game with a winger. After it, he dropped Ian Callaghan from his side and brought back Alan Ball to strengthen the midfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} panel {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. The panel had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the panel, although the panel said that the records were not enough. The panel obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the prescribed medication. The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs were <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>system</b> {{during the time of}} the shooting.|$|E
