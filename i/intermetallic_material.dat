This solution is made of a carbon/epoxy composite overwrapped on a metal liner first coated with <b>intermetallic</b> <b>material.</b> The composite helps to reinforce the structure, while the liner prevents it from any leakage.

40|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} (CMC) and intermetallic materials (e. g., {{single crystal}} nickel aluminide) are high performance materials that exhibit attractive mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. These materials are critically important in advancing certain performance aspects of gas turbine engines. From an aerospace engineer's perspective {{the new generation}} of ceramic composites and intermetallics offers a significant potential for raising the thrust/weight ratio and reducing NO(x) emissions of gas turbine engines. These aspects have increased interest in utilizing these materials in the hot sections of turbine engines. However, as these materials evolve and their performance characteristics improve a persistent need exists for state-of-the-art analytical methods that predict the response of components fabricated from CMC and <b>intermetallic</b> <b>material</b> systems. This need provided the motivation for the technology developed under this research effort. Continuous ceramic fiber composites exhibit an increase in work of fracture, which allows for "graceful" rather than catastrophic failure. When loaded in the fiber direction, these composites retain substantial strength capacity beyond the initiation of transverse matrix cracking despite the fact that neither of its constituents would exhibit such behavior if tested alone. As additional load is applied beyond first matrix cracking, the matrix tends to break in a series of cracks bridged by the ceramic fibers. Any additional load is born increasingly by the fibers until the ultimate strength of the composite is reached. Thus modeling efforts supported under this research effort have focused on predicting this sort of behavior. For single crystal intermetallics the issues that motivated the technology development involved questions relating to material behavior and component design. Thus the research effort supported by this grant had to determine the statistical nature and source of fracture in a high strength, NiAl single crystal turbine blade material; map a simplistic failure strength envelope of the material; develop a statistically based reliability computer algorithm, verify the reliability model and computer algorithm, and model stator vanes for rig tests. Thus establishing design protocols that enable the engineer to analyze and predict the mechanical behavior of ceramic composites and intermetallics would mitigate the prototype (trial and error) approach currently used by the engineering community. The primary objective of the research effort supported by this short term grant is the continued creation of enabling technologies for the macroanalysis of components fabricated from ceramic composites and <b>intermetallic</b> <b>material</b> systems. The creation of enabling technologies aids in shortening the product development cycle of components fabricated from the new high technology materials...|$|E

40|$|Georgia Techs Packaging Research Centers {{vision of}} System on Package (SOP) {{requires}} that the ball grid array (BGA) package be eliminated and the integrated circuit (IC) directly assembled on the printed wiring board (PWB). Flip-Chip on board (FCOB) emerges as a viable solution which meets the industry requirements of (i) increased I/O, (ii) increased functionality and (iii) improved performance at lower costs. Nevertheless flip-chip on board (FCOB) reliability {{continues to be an}} important concern in electronic packaging industry. Moreover transition to Pb-free solder for interconnects and continuously shrinking geometries result in new modeling challenges. In addition, the integrity of the intermetallics (IMCs) at the interfaces of the solder/PWB and solder/die is one of the determinant factors in the reliability and continuity of electrical signals in flip-chip interconnects. Pb-free solder studies for the flip-chip assembly studies are limited and simplified so far, not fully incorporating the effect of intermetallics in the reliability. New modeling challenges involve many details, from geometry to material properties. A brittle IMC will lead to a fracture at the interface. Also IMC thickness can cause the variation in stresses in the underlying layers, causing delamination. Moreover IMC morphology can also depend on the metal finishes on the PWB. In this work, a combined numerical and experimental program has been developed to address the challenges mentioned above. The flip-chip on board assembly is modeled in 3 -D for reliability studies, taking into consideration material non linearities and a 104 order of geometric variation to capture the die size in mm to sub-micron intermetallic thickness. The study intends to determine the stresses induced at the critical interfaces under thermo-mechanical loading incorporating the <b>intermetallic</b> <b>material</b> properties. Various failure modes of these assemblies were studied. Experiments were carried out for comparative reliability studies of Pb-free solder with eutectic Pb-based solder. Intermetallic formation and growth are characterized during thermal aging and its effect on reliability is determined.

In view of the environmental consequences, 2011 saw the release by the EU of Vision Flightpath 2050, which sets ambitious goals for pollution and noise reduction (including a 75 % reduction in CO 2, taking the year 2000 as benchmark). A potential CO 2 emission saving in the order of 15 - 20 % is achievable simply by stepping up the efficiency and optimizing the weight of aircraft jet en-gines. One promising option for achieving these targets is the substitution of the very heavy iron and nickel-based super alloys currently in use for high temperature applications by new, lighter materials. Alongside the general weight-saving achievable, this development will also enable an increase in the response times for movable components by up to 50 %. The current work focuses on titanium aluminide alloys based on gamma-TiAl and alpha 2 -Ti 3 Al, which combine the attributes „light, corrosion-protected and extremely tough“. The application potential of this material at moderate to high temperatures (500 °C- 800 °C) makes it a particularly attractive option for manufacturing rotating turbine blades and wheels. The main barrier to the general introduction of TiAl components is the nature of this material: very hard and brittle, and, in a melt, extremely reactive. Cost-effective manufacture of TiAl low pressure turbine blades on the industrial scale is achievable by the near-net shape casting approach. The manufacture of single near net shape prototypes using centrifugal casting has already been successfully demonstrated. However, transferring this approach to industrial standard has not hitherto been possible. Starting from the current technological platform already achieved, this work aims to develop a stable and reproducible manufacturing process chain, thus laying the foundation for future series casting of near-net shape TiAl low pressure turbine blades (up to approx. 300 mm in length) for jet engines. This will enable the transfer of the huge potential of this difficult-to-process <b>intermetallic</b> <b>material</b> to a broad field of application within the aerospace industry. This calls for close investigation of component, material and the various process steps as a complex, rather than in isolation. Alongside the fundamental definition of a casting concept and corresponding process parameters, and the subsequent technology transfer to production plant specifically developed for the production of TiAl components, an essential focus of the technology development within the scope of this paper is an all-round optimization of the casting process. Not only the melt flow up to the shell mould but also mould-filling of the cavities is covered in this research. It is demonstrated that modelling a complex, thin-walled blade geometry is only achievable by goal-oriented adaptation of the crucible tilt process and the gating and feeder technology. Verification of the suitability of both the ceramic material and furnace used in being able to meet the dimensional tolerances demanded then provides the basis for the production of a small series of 600 turbine blades, the setting up of which is based on bringing together knowledge previously obtained. Verification of a stable and reproducible process chain is executed by evaluating process stability and component quality...|$|E

The present work is focused on the preparation and characterization of open-framework <b>intermetallic</b> <b>materials</b> based on group 14 elements, in particular those crystallizing in clathrate and related structures such as the clathrate-II phases. Materials possessing the clathrate-II crystal structure have received increased attention in recent years, as a result of both the unique properties they exhibit as well as potential for use in technologically important applications such as thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and optoelectronics. However, in comparison with other clathrate structure types, characterization of clathrate-II materials has in general been far less extensive. Moreover, many conceivable compositions have yet to be realized. The purpose of this work is to expand the current knowledge of the structural, chemical, and physical properties of these materials, while simultaneously exploring new compositions and synthetic routes to clathrate-II phases. One of the unique and promising aspects of clathrate-II materials is the ability to vary the guest concentration, which is shown to have significant implications for the structural and physical properties of NaxSi 136 (03 ̆c x 3 ̆c 24) materials. It is demonstrated that new compositions can be explored by novel approaches to chemical design.

Although {{there are a lot of}} works about Ti-rich alloys, however, investigation from the Al-rich side is very limited. This work reviews the class of Al-rich TiAl alloys in terms of phases, microstructures, morphology, deformation mechanisms, mechanical behaviors along with a possible micromechanical modeling approach. Single crystal like Ti- 61.8 at.%Al alloy from the Al-rich family has been chosen as an example for modeling high temperature anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. A possible comparison with Ti-rich side is also presented.|$|R
