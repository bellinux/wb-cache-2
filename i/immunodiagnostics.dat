2500|$|<b>Immunodiagnostics</b> (ELISA, {{lateral flow}} immunoassay, rapid immunomigration techniques) to detect {{heartworm}} antigen in the host's blood are now regularly used. The weakness {{of these tests}} is they only detect the antigens released from the adult female worm's reproductive tract, so [...] produce negative results during the first five to eight months of infection. The specificity of these tests is close to 100%, and the sensitivity is more than 80%. A recent study demonstrated a sensitivity of only 64% for infections of only one female worm, but improved with increasing female worm burden (85%, 88%, and 89% for two, three, and four female worms, respectively).

We evaluated two <b>immunodiagnostic</b> techniques {{for the detection of}} Schistosoma japonicum infections: circulating antibody and circulating antigen assays.; A total of 1864 individuals (between 6 and 72  years old) residing in five administrative villages in Hubei province were screened by serum examination with an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). The positive individuals (titer ≥ 20 in IHA) were reconfirmed by stool examination with the Kato-Katz method (three slides from a single stool specimen). Samples of good serum quality and a volume above 0. 5  ml were selected for further testing with two <b>immunodiagnostic</b> antibody (DDIA and ELISA) and two antigen (ELISA) assays.; The average antibody positive rate in the five villages was 12. 7 %, while the average parasitological prevalence was 1. 50 %; 25 of the 28 egg-positive samples were also circulating antigen-positive.

40|$|AuthorSUMMARY Cysticercosis {{caused by}} {{infection}} with the larval stage of Taenia solium {{is an important}} cause of neurological disease worldwide and immunodiagnosis {{is important for the}} control and elimination of cysticercosis. In the present study, we established a simple and reliable preparation of <b>immunodiagnostic</b> low-molecular-weight antigens (LMWAgs) from T. solium cyst fluids by a cation-exchange chromatography (CEC). Banding patterns of LMWAgs on SDS-PAGE were different between isolates from Ecuador and China. All cysticercosis patient sera and some echinococcosis patient sera recognized both LMWAgs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but sera from healthy persons were not positive. There was no statistical difference in <b>immunodiagnostic</b> performance of LMWAgs prepared from different geographical isolates.

5000|$|The {{first steps}} towards the present Phadia AB {{were taken in}} the mid 1960s. Three {{scientists}} working at Uppsala University Hospital, Leif Wide, Rolf Axén and Jerker Porath, then presented their ideas to use Pharmacia's separation medium Sephadex as the solid phase in <b>immunodiagnostics</b> tests and proposed a collaboration with the company for the commercial development. Pharmacia's management {{decided to go for}} the project and established a special R&D group for diagnostics products. In 1970 Pharmacia's first product, Phadebas Amylase Test, a test for the enzyme alpha-amylase, was launched. At the same time an important medical discovery was made which would be of decisive importance to Phadia. In 1967 immunoglobulin E, or IgE, was discovered by two separate research teams, by Teruko and Kimishige Ishizaka in the US and by Gunnar Johansson and [...] at Uppsala University Hospital. Johansson and Bennich worked together with Wide to develop a method to measure the levels of the substance in blood samples. Eventually a clear connection was demonstrated between IgE antibodies and allergic symptoms. Johansson, Bennich and Wide then suggested that Pharmacia should use the findings to develop a commercial allergy test. This led to the ground-breaking product Phadebas RAST, which established the leading position that Phadia still maintains in the area of allergy testing.|$|E
