5|$|Coal was {{expected}} {{to be able to be}} delivered to the station by rail, as well as by ship to the Port of Blyth. The station's coal storage area would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply. All of the station's pulverised <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> (PFA) may have been sold to the construction industry, transported to which in dry dust tankers. Unsold PFA and furnace bottom ash would be taken to a landfill site by road.|$|E
5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised <b>Fuel</b> <b>Ash</b> was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
25|$|The four mines {{identified}} for work were Baron's Quay, Witton Bank, Neumann's and Penny's Lane. These mines were chosen because their subsidence was causing {{problems for the}} town centre. The stabilisation plan involved removing millions of litres of brine from the four mines {{and replacing it with}} a mixture of pulverised <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> (PFA), cement and salt. The project was completed in late 2007.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the Table  2 that the {{temperature}} data and Rmax varied considerably between different <b>fuels</b> <b>ashes.</b> While coal ash 1 exhibited maximum shrinkage rate at 910 °C, for coal ash 6 the maximum shrinkage rate occurred at 875 °C.|$|R
40|$|The {{range of}} fuels fed to waste {{incineration}} plants extends from well-sorted domestic refuse through mixed waste fractions to fuel mixtures that may additionally contain various types of hazardous waste and biomass. This diversity results in {{a great number of}} <b>fuel</b> and <b>ash</b> compositions. Among these are fuels with a high calorific value as well as with a low calorific value and simple <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes</b> just as highly problematic <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes.</b> The latter can lead to increased slagging in the combustion chamber and fouling in the open passes of {{waste incineration plants}} as well as accelerated corrosion. The plant operator is consequently faced with considerable challenges associated with unscheduled boiler downtime and production losses. The paper describes how fuel specific process know-how is applied in combination with fully automated, efficient on-load boiler cleaning systems to control the slagging issues. The paper describes a system which utilizes water as the cleaning medium. The system allows the targeted cleaning of waste incinerators during operation. This paper points out challenges faced by plant operators and suppliers of boiler cleaning technology caused by the heterogeneous fuel composition, and describes in well monitored case studies how these challenges can be successfully met...|$|R

500|$|To the {{southwest}} lies Green Hill, {{from which the}} disused Flixton Sewage Works may be viewed. [...] Formed from pulverised <b>fuel</b> <b>ash,</b> the soil provides ideal conditions for flora like gorse and is a habitat for moles. [...] The former sewage works is an important undisturbed wintering site for wildfowl, such as marsh harriers and linnets.

500|$|Pulverised <b>Fuel</b> <b>Ash</b> (PFA) and Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) were {{byproducts}} produced {{through the}} burning of coal in the station. Bottom ash was removed from ash hoppers {{at the bottom of}} the boilers by high pressure water jets. It then travelled to ash settling ponds via sluiceways. For much of the station's life, the station was served by a series of barges, which took the ash to dump [...] out into the North Sea. Two barges provided this service over the years; Sir Fon and MVA. The barges were loaded by silos situated at a special dock to the east of the stations. However, dumping in the sea stopped in 1992 when the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships prevented further dumping in the North Sea. From then on FBA was sold to the construction industry, while PFA was either dried for sale, or was disposed of at a licensed landfill on-site.|$|E
500|$|Pulverised <b>fuel</b> <b>ash</b> (PFA) and {{furnace bottom}} ash (FBA) are two {{byproducts}} {{from the burning}} of coal. Each year, the station produces about 1,000,000 tonnes of PFA and around 220,000 tonnes of FBA: all FBA and 85% of PFA is sold. Under the trade name Drax Ash Products, the ash is sold to the local building industry, where it {{is used in the}} manufacture of blocks, cement products, grouting and the laying of roads. The ash is also used {{in other parts of the}} country. [...] Between 2005 and 2007, PFA was used as an infill at four disused salt mines in Northwich in Cheshire. 1,100,000 tonnes was used in the project, which was to avoid a future risk of subsidence in the town. Ash was delivered by DB Schenker in ten trains a week, each carrying 1,100 tonnes. Following a trial in January 2010, PFA is also transported to Waterford in Ireland by boat. [...] One ship a month will transport 1,200 tonnes for the manufacture of construction materials. This will replace 480 lorry journeys annually and is deemed more environmentally friendly.|$|E

It is possible to produce a gypsum brick unit that can meet the engineering properties required by the Americans Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) standards by using these by-products. This can be accomplished at a cost less than the least expensive common fired clay brick that is used in construction operations. The gypsum brick can be manufactured using established methods that are currently in operation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Among other constituents, <b>fuel</b> oil <b>ash</b> {{contains}} {{vanadium pentoxide}}, a known respiratory irritant. Exposure to ambient vanadium pentoxide dust {{has been shown}} to produce irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. The usefulness of nasal lavage in detecting an inflammatory response to exposure to <b>fuel</b> oil <b>ash</b> among 37 boilermakers and utility workers was investigated. METHODS [...] A baseline lavage was performed {{on the morning of the}} first day back to work after an average of 114 days away from work (range 36 hours to 1737 days). A lavage was performed after exposure on the morning three days after the baseline lavage. Exposure to respirable particulate matter of diameter 0. 5), but in nonsmokers it was significantly greater than zero (+ 50 %, P < 0. 05). In both non-smokers and smokers, there was considerable variability in adjusted polymorphonuclear cell counts and a dose-response relation between these adjusted cell counts and either PM 10 or respirable vanadium dust exposure could not be found. CONCLUSION [...] A significant increase in polymorphonuclear cells in non-smokers but not smokers was found. This suggests that in non-smokers, exposure to <b>fuel</b> oil <b>ash</b> is associated with upper airway inflammation manifested as increased polymorphonuclear cell counts. The lack of an increase in polymorphonuclear cells in smokers may reflect either a diminished inflammatory response or may indicate that smoking masks the effect of exposure to <b>fuel</b> oil <b>ash...</b>|$|R

30|$|Review of {{proximate}} analyses {{indicates that}} the volatile matter (VM) content of the low-rank fuels is varying between 30 % and 38 % and ash content between 16 % and 40 %. The sulfur content of the fuels studied varies between 0.3 % and 7.0 %. Such wide variations in both the ash content and sulfur content necessitate the adoption of CFBC technology for such low-rank fuels. The results of chemical composition of ash and ash fusion temperature (AFT) of <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes</b> indicate that the firing of such fuels in CFBC with temperature range of 850 °C to 900 °C may not pose any problem. However, it is experienced that firing of the coal samples 1 and 6 resulted in some clogging/blockage during initial stages of commissioning of the CFBC boilers. The conventional indices based on chemical composition of ash and AFT do not provide any useful directions to address the sintering related problems.|$|R

40|$|The {{thermochemical}} use {{of solid}} biomass {{will be important}} for the energy production in the future. If possible, all types of biomass, e. g. wood and residues of cereal production should be used. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) {{seems to be a}} promising concept with efficiencies > 55 %, in which the product gas can be used for electrical power generation and heat production or for the production of synthesis gas. High amounts of alkali, sulphur, and chlorine compounds in the flue gas can be problematic. These pollutants can cause slagging and fouling in the boiler, catalyst deactivation or high temperature corrosion of iron materials and nickel-base alloys. In order to develop technical measures {{to reduce the amount of}} alkalis, sulphur and chlorine in the flue gas, an increased understanding of the release behaviour of these pollutants during thermochemical conversion of biomass is necessary. In the present work, the influence of fuel composition, temperature, and oxygen/fuel ratio on the release of trace elements during combustion and gasification of woody and herbaceous biomass was investigated. Therefore experiments were performed in a tube furnace and in a lab scale fluidized bed reactor. The experiments were supplemented by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and a thermochemical model of the Värnamo gasifier. The <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes</b> were investigated chemically, by XRD, STA, and Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry (KEMS). Molecular Beam Mass Spectrometry (MBMS) was used for the semi-quantitative analysis of the hot flue gas. This work provides important insights into the influence of <b>fuel</b> composition, <b>ash</b> phases, temperature, and oxygen/fuel ratio on the release of inorganic pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Ash {{deposition}} such as slagging and fouling on {{boiler tube}} surfaces is an inevitable, though undesirable consequence of burning solid fuels in boilers. The role of fuel characteristics, in affecting {{the form and}} severity of the problem, is significant. In recent years, biomass fuels have gained increasing popularity as an environmentally friendly source of energy in power plants all over the world. This study is based on characterising the fusion behaviour of four biomass fuels (pine wood, peanut shells, sunflower stalk and miscanthus) using ash fusion temperature (AFT) tests, simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) of <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes,</b> calculation of empirical indices and predicting ash melting behaviour {{with the help of}} thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The AFT results failed to show any clear trend between fusion temperature and high alkali content of biomass. STA proved useful in predicting the different changes occurring in the ash. Empirical indices predicted high slagging and fouling hazards for nearly all the biomass samples and this was supported by the possible existence of a melt phase at low temperatures as predicted by thermodynamic calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{elemental}} {{losses from}} ashes of common biomass fuels (rice straw, wheat straw, and wood) were determined {{as a function}} of temperature from 525 8 C to below 1525 8 C, within the respective melting intervals. The experimental procedure was chosen to approach equilibrium conditions in an oxidizing atmosphere for the specific ash and temperature conditions. All experiments were conducted in air and used the ashes produced initially at temperatures of 525 8 C as reactants. Losses during the initial ashing at 525 8 C were negligible, except for a K 2 O loss of 26 % for wood and a Cl loss of 20 % for wheat straw. Potassium losses are positively correlated with temperature for all <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes.</b> The K 2 O loss for wood ash commences at 900 – 1000 8 C. Carbonate is detected in the wood ashes to about 700 – 800 8 C and thus cannot explain the retention of K 2 O in the ashes to 1000 8 C. Other crystalline phases detected in the wood ashes (pericline and larnite) contain little or no potassium. Petrographic examinations of high temperature, wood ash products have failed to reveal potassium bearing carbonates, sulfates, or silicates. The release of potassium, thus, appears to be unrelated to the breakdown of potassium-bearing crystalline phases. The straw ashes show restricted potassium loss compared to wood ash. The potassium content declines for both straw ashes from about 750 8 C. Cristobalite appears in the straw ashes at about 700 – 750 8 C and is replaced by tridymite in the rice straw ash from about 1100 8 C. Sylvite (KCl) disappears completely above 1000 8 C. The Cl content starts to decline at about 700 8 C, approximately at the same temperature as potassium, suggesting that the breakdown of sylvite is responsible for the losses. The K–Cl relations demonstrate that about 50 % of K (atomic basis) released from breakdown of sylvite is retained in the ash. The presence of chlorine in the ash is, therefore, best attributed to the presence of sylvite. Potassium is easily accommodated in the silicate melt formed at temperatures perhaps as low as 700 – 800 8 C from dehydration, recrystallization, and partial melting of amorphous components. Loss of potassium persists for ashes without remaining sylvite and points to the importance of release of potassium from partial melt at temperatures within the melting interval for the <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} coal <b>fuel</b> <b>ashes</b> have been {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} leaching behaviour and reactivity against lime and gypsum in hydratory systems for the manufacture of building materials. Their behaviour was also {{compared to that of}} coal ashes. Metal release was measured in a dynamic leaching test with duration up to 16 days. The results have shown that coal-fuel oil ashes behave very similarly to coal ashes. The reactivity of coal-fuel oil ashes against lime and gypsum was measured in mixtures containing only lime and in mixtures containing both lime and gypsum. These systems were hydrated at 25 and 40 °C under 100 % R. H. The results have shown that the main hydration products are the same as those that are usually formed in similar coal ashes-based systems. That is, calcium silicate hydrate in coal-fuel oil/lime systems and calcium silicate hydrate plus calcium trisulfoaluminate hydrate in coal-fuel oil/lime/gypsum systems. From the quantitative point of view, hydration runs showed that both chemically combined water and reacted lime are significantly higher in the case under investigation.
