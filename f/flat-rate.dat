5|$|On February 1, 1995, the Keyser Avenue {{interchange}} near Scranton was {{slated to}} open {{at a cost}} of $22.4 million. Construction of this interchange also involved constructing a new mainline <b>flat-rate</b> toll barrier near the new interchange.|$|E
5|$|All {{three main}} {{terminals}} {{used by the}} Eurostar service – St Pancras International, Paris Gare du Nord, and Brussels Midi/Zuid – are served by domestic trains and by local urban transport networks such as the London Underground and the Paris Metro. Standard Eurostar tickets no longer include free onward connections to or from any other station in Belgium: this is now available for a <b>flat-rate</b> supplement, currently £5.50.|$|E
5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are charged <b>flat-rate</b> tolls {{based on what}} {{particular}} toll booths they pass through. Tolls are collected at selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|E

5|$|On November24, 2004, the {{day before}} Thanksgiving, 2,000 Teamsters Union {{employees}} went on strike, after contract negotiations failed. This was the first strike {{in the history of}} the roadway. As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the United States, to avoid traffic jams, tolls were waived for the rest of the day. Starting on November25, turnpike management personnel collected <b>flat-rate</b> passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November30. Normal toll collection resumed December1.|$|E
5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, {{and the risk}} of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that the colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a <b>flat-rate</b> basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} in 1993 to build a direct {{interchange}} between the turnpike and I-79 in Cranberry Township, Butler County. A contract was awarded to build this interchange in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed upon a design for the interchange. The project also included the movement {{the western end of}} the ticket system to a new toll plaza in Warrendale. The interchange project was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who wanted to prevent construction of the toll plaza as they thought it would cause noise, air and light pollution. Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow the toll plaza be built. Groundbreaking for the new interchange took place on February 22, 2002. The westbound Butler service plaza was closed because the Warrendale toll plaza was to be located at its site. On June 1, 2003, the plaza opened and the Gateway toll plaza became a <b>flat-rate</b> toll plaza, while all the exit toll plazas west of Warrendale closed. The direct interchange between the turnpike and I-79, connecting to US 19, opened on November 12, 2003. The project cost $44 million.|$|E

50|$|The 45XR's {{performance}} and specifications increases {{are due to}} the upgrading of the engines to the TFE731-20BR configuration, <b>flat-rated</b> to 3,500 pounds thrust, even at 104 degrees Fahrenheit, well above the 86-degree mark for that power from the original Model 45's TFE731-20 engines.|$|R
50|$|Remote call {{forwarding}} {{is also a}} means for a suburban business to obtain a city-centre local number (with its full large-city coverage area) for inbound calls; while cheaper than a foreign exchange line, this can reduce long-distance telephony costs in markets where local calls are <b>flat-rated</b> but trunk calls are expensive.|$|R
25|$|In {{the field}} of social security, a number of {{important}} reforms in welfare provision were introduced during Cosgrave's premiership. In 1974, sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and occupational injuries coverage were extended to all employees, while earnings-related components were added to the basic <b>flat-rate</b> sickness benefit, the basic <b>flat-rate</b> short-term occupational injury benefit, and the basic <b>flat-rate</b> unemployment benefit. That same year, pension insurance was extended to all employees, and a means-tested allowance for the wives of prisoners was introduced.|$|E
25|$|A {{balanced}} budget, almost non-existent public debt, <b>flat-rate</b> income tax, {{free trade}} regime, competitive commercial banking sector, innovative e-Services and even mobile-based services are all hallmarks of Estonia's market economy.|$|E
25|$|Almost all service {{providers}} offer ADSL2+ subscriptions at {{speeds up to}} 20Mbit/s downstream and up to 768kbit/s upstream. All {{service providers}} provide a <b>flat-rate</b> model with unlimited traffic. Amis Telekom, VIPNet, H1 Telekom, Iskon, Optima Telekom, and Hrvatski Telekom offer IPTV.|$|E
2500|$|Within most North American rate centres, local {{wireline}} {{calls are}} free, while calls {{to all but}} a few nearby rate centres are considered long distance and incur a per-minute toll. In a few large US cities, as well as most points outside North America, local calls are not <b>flat-rated</b> or [...] "free" [...] by default.|$|R
50|$|The CFE738 {{consists}} of a single stage fan, driven by a 3-stage low-pressure (LP) turbine, supercharging a 5-stage high-pressure (HP) axial/centrifugal compressor driven by a 2-stage HP turbine. The engine has an overall pressure ratio of 35:1, which is extremely high for an engine with a centrifugal compressor. Other cycle parameters are a bypass ratio 5.3 and airflow of 240 lb/s. The take-off thrust is 5,600 lbf, <b>flat-rated</b> to ISA+15C.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, local {{calls from}} {{landline}} telephones are <b>flat-rated</b> {{even in the}} largest cities (unlike the United States, which has metered service in {{a few of the}} largest markets). Local telephone numbers were lengthened to a standard seven digits in all of the largest markets in 1958 to accommodate US-style direct-dial equipment (Montréal and Toronto previously had 2L+4N six-digit local calling, smaller communities had four or five digits).|$|R
25|$|According to a 2003 {{study by}} the French Supreme Audit Agency (Cour des Comptes), the {{complexity}} of water tariffs makes them difficult to understand for users despite {{efforts to improve the}} presentation of water bills. The agency also states that <b>flat-rate</b> tariffs that are not linked to consumption levels still persist, although the 1992 water law aimed at linking water tariffs to consumption.|$|E
25|$|There is daily ground {{transportation}} between Auburn and the Atlanta airport. Tiger Taxi, Eagle Town Taxi, Spirit Town Taxi all provide both local taxi service and <b>flat-rate</b> transportation service to other cities. Auburn University provides the Tiger Transit bus system, which runs near {{the campus and}} to area apartment complexes part of the year. Lee-Russell Public Transit (LRPT) offers Dial-A-Ride services in Lee and Russell counties. Hail-a-ride apps available: Gata Hub.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{welfare state}} was created with the National Insurance Act 1946, {{in which people}} in work paid a flat rate of national insurance. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for <b>flat-rate</b> pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income. Legislation was also passed to provide free education at all levels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economic}} downturn of 2009 {{has resulted in}} changes at some brothels. Reduced prices and free promotions are now found. Some changes, the result of modern marketing tools, rebates, gimmicks. Brothels introducing all-inclusive <b>flat-rates,</b> free shuttle buses, discounts for seniors and taxi drivers. [...] "Day passes." [...] Some brothels reportedly including loyalty cards, group sex parties, rebates for golf players. Clients have reported reducing their number of weekly visits.|$|R
5000|$|The Skymaster {{rear engine}} was {{replaced}} with a <b>flat-rated</b> [...] Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 and front engine was removed and the cockpit was stretched forward. The aircraft is capable of taking off in less than 450 ft fully loaded. Basler had {{a deal with the}} government of Thailand to convert their O-2 Skymaster to SA-550 and to convert civilian Skymaster in Thailand as well. These plans appear to have never happened.|$|R
5000|$|Nowadays, civil {{engines are}} usually <b>flat-rated</b> on net thrust up to a 'kink-point' climate. So {{at a given}} flight condition, net thrust is held {{approximately}} constant over a very wide range of ambient temperature, by increasing (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature (RIT or SOT). However, beyond the kink-point, SOT is held constant and net thrust starts to fall for further increases in ambient temperature. Consequently, aircraft fuel load and/or payload must be decreased.|$|R
25|$|The {{contracts}} {{called for}} starting every month {{a new class}} of 100 students for three months of instruction. The schools would provide the instructors, classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, food services, and health and recreational facilities. Textbooks, classroom supplies, and an engineering slide rule (usually a K Log-Log Duplex Decitrig) were also supplied. (The slide rule in its holder strapped on the belt was a standard part of students’ uniform of the day.) The contracts required the schools to provide all of this under a <b>flat-rate</b> per student-month.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} farmers. This was originally intended to encourage farmers to choose to grow those crops attracting subsidies and maintain home-grown supplies. Subsidies were generally paid on the area of land growing a particular crop, {{rather than on the}} total amount of crop produced. Reforms implemented from 2005 are phasing out specific subsidies in favour of <b>flat-rate</b> payments based only on the area of land in cultivation, and for adopting environmentally beneficial farming methods. The change is intended to give farmers more freedom to choose for themselves those crops most in demand and reduce the economic incentive to overproduce.|$|E
25|$|Since reestablishing independence, Estonia has styled {{itself as}} the gateway between East and West and aggressively pursued {{economic}} reform and integration with the West. Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former COMECON area. A balanced budget, almost non-existent public debt, <b>flat-rate</b> income tax, free trade regime, fully convertible currency backed by currency board and a strong peg to the euro, competitive commercial banking sector, hospitable environment for foreign investment, innovative e-Services and even mobile-based services are all hallmarks of Estonia's free-market-based economy. Estonia also has made excellent progress in regard to structural adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{unlimited}} local {{calls are}} <b>flat-rated</b> and long-distance incurs high per-minute charges, the downtown number's wider local calling area represents a commercial advantage. Markham (directly north of Toronto) is long-distance to Mississauga (directly west of Toronto) [...] A Markham {{business with a}} forwarded 416 number could receive calls from Toronto's entire local calling area without incurring long-distance tolls (as both legs, Mississauga → Toronto and Toronto → Markham, are each a local call).|$|R
40|$|The authors {{develop a}} model {{in which it is}} {{predicted}} that more resources will be devoted to safety in a workers' compensation system with experience-rated. premiums than in one with <b>flat-rated</b> premiums. They test this model by observing the effect on fatality rates of the move from flat rating to experience rating in the forestry and construction industries of Ontario, Canada. The evidence provides strong confirmation of the theory. Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} rate center determines the inbound local calling {{area for a}} number, an {{important}} consideration in markets where local calls are <b>flat-rated</b> but toll calls are expensive. A number in area code 416 is in the Toronto rate center, so local to everything between Oakville and Ajax; the suburban rate centers are less valuable as one suburb to another {{on the other side}} of the same city (Markham to Malton, for example) is often a toll call.|$|R
25|$|Lynch's {{first term}} as Taoiseach also {{witnessed}} various reforms {{in areas such}} as welfare and education. In 1967, a redundancy payments scheme was introduced, and in 1970, various improvements in welfare provision for women were introduced. Maternity insurance was extended to all female employees, a social insurance benefit for deserted wives was introduced, a means-tested allowance for unmarried mothers was established, and an earnings-related component was added to the basic <b>flat-rate</b> maternity benefit. In 1967, free secondary education was introduced, together with free transport to school “for those living more than three miles from the nearest school.” In 1972, entitlement to free travel on public transport was introduced for all persons of pensionable age, while people eligible for free hospital care became entitled to prescription drug reimbursement over a certain amount each month.|$|E
25|$|A law of 9 June 1975 {{increased}} the number of eligible occupational diseases and extended the duration of benefits. A law of 3 June 1975 introduced various benefit improvements for pensioners. The multiplying coefficient was raised to 2% and applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 10 years of work, and automatic annual adjustment of minimum pensions to increase of the minimum contractual wage in the industrial sector (with a smaller adjustment made for pensions higher than the minima). A law of 27 December 1975 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for certain diseases and of all <b>flat-rate</b> allowances. A law of 14 July 1967 extended family allowances to self-employed farmers, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers. On 29 April 1976, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to civil servants.|$|E
25|$|Buses now {{provide the}} {{majority}} of local public transport. The main bus operators are First Southampton, Bluestar, Xelabus and Wheelers. The other large service provider is the Unilink bus service (running from {{early in the morning}} to midnight), which was commissioned by the University of Southampton to provide transport from the university to the town. Previously run by Enterprise, it is now run by Bluestar. Free buses were provided by City-link', but the subsidy provided by Southampton City Council was pulled in 2014 and the service now charges passengers £1 <b>flat-rate</b> single fare, with Red Funnel ticket holders continuing to travel free. The service was rebranded as QuayConnect in May 2016, with a red and white livery on the bus instead of blue. It runs from the Red Funnel ferry terminals at Town Quay to Central station via Westquay and is operated by Bluestar. There is also a door-to-door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride, for residents who cannot access public transport. This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, the Series 300 was introduced, {{beginning}} with serial number 231. Both aircraft performance and payload were improved by fitting more powerful PT6A-27 engines. This was a [...] engine that was <b>flat-rated</b> to [...] {{for use in}} the Series 300 Twin Otter. The Series 300 proved to be the most successful variant by far, with 614 Series 300 aircraft and their subvariants (Series 310 for United Kingdom operators, Series 320 for Australian operators, etc.) sold before production in Toronto by de Havilland Canada ended in 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The Kaveri engine {{has been}} {{specifically}} designed for the demanding Indian operating environment, which ranges from hot desert to the highest mountain range in the world. Its design is a variable-cycle, <b>flat-rated</b> engine and has 13 percent higher thrust than the General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 engines equipping India's Tejas prototypes. The GTRE's design envisions achieving a fan pressure ratio of 4:1 and an overall pressure ratio of 27:1, which it believes will permit the Tejas to [...] "supercruise" [...] (cruise supersonically {{without the use of}} the afterburner).|$|R
5000|$|The general {{arrangement}} of the Kaveri {{is very similar to}} other contemporary combat engines, such as the Eurojet EJ200, General Electric F414, and Snecma M88. At present, the peak turbine inlet temperature is designed to be a little lower than its peers, but this is to enable the engine to be <b>flat-rated</b> to very high ambient temperatures. Consequently, the bypass ratio that can be supported, even with a modest fan pressure ratio, is only about 0.16:1, which means the engine is a [...] "'leaky' turbojet" [...] like the F404.|$|R
