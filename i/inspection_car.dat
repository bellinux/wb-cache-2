25|$|The {{construction}} of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company's Ripley route began in May 1913, and it was opened in several sections, all outside the city. The section between Church Street Basford, and Cinderhill was constructed by the Corporation and, after inspection by Major Pringle on 1 January 1914, through services to Ripley started. This section of the line included the only reserved track in Nottingham, ballasted sleeper track about ¼ mile long cutting off the corner between Nuthall Road and Stockhill Lane. The only Corporation cars to run over this track, so far as can be ascertained, were two test cars and the <b>inspection</b> <b>car</b> and, later, about 1919, one of the Westinghouse bogie cars borrowed by the Tramway Company {{in order to try}} out a car of this type on their line. It is thought that this car was no. 77: the car ran all the way to Ripley, probably the only Nottingham car to do so.|$|E
