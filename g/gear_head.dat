40|$|Abstract:- In {{the last}} decade new {{technologies}} for manufacturing of precison mechanical components have been developed. Nowadays, the reduction of size and weight is very often {{one of the most}} important requirements in product design. Many applications in robotics, automation, medicine systems etc require powerful precison actuator. The powerful precision actuator has Speeds up to high speed and high output torque efficiencies. To accomplish a powerful precision actuator, these powerful motor have to be combined with gearhead of the same outer diameter. So, we have developed BLDC motor and planetary type gearheads as powerful precison actuator. The BLDC motor has advantages that compact structure, high efficiency, high reliability. The planetary type <b>gear</b> <b>heads</b> have advantages that same-axle structure, high torque transmission, low noise in comparison with spur <b>gear</b> <b>heads.</b> In this study included BLDC motor and planetary type <b>gear</b> <b>heads</b> design, manufacture for small robot...|$|R

50|$|A geared head {{drill press}} is {{a drill press}} in which power {{transmission}} from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head. No friction elements (e.g., belts) of any kind are used, which assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements. <b>Gear</b> <b>head</b> drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.|$|E

50|$|Other head types {{include the}} gimbal head, fluid head, <b>gear</b> <b>head,</b> alt-azimuth, and {{equatorial}} heads. Fluid heads and gear heads move very smoothly, avoiding the jerkiness {{caused by the}} stick-slip effect found in other types of tripod heads. Gimbal heads are single-axis heads used {{in order to allow}} a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well as in any other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a gimbal head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.|$|E

50|$|A {{machine head}} (also {{referred}} to as a tuning machine, tuner, or <b>gear</b> <b>head)</b> is a geared apparatus for tuning stringed musical instruments by adjusting string tension. Machine heads are used on mandolins, guitars, double basses etc., and are usually located on the instrument's headstock. Non-geared tuning devices that are used on violins, violas, cellos, lutes, older Flamenco guitars, ukuleles etc., are known as friction pegs. Friction pegs hold the string in tune by way of friction caused by their tapered shape and by the string pull created by the tight string. Some other commonly used slang names for guitar tuners are pegs, gears, machines, cranks, knobs, tensioners and tighteners.|$|E

50|$|Geared head drill presses are {{commonly}} found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger geared head drill presses are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or {{in the event of}} excessive travel. Some gear-head drill presses have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger <b>gear</b> <b>head</b> drill presses. A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Talents {{are what}} gamers call [...] "crunchy bits": {{advantages}} with cool names (like <b>Gear</b> <b>Head</b> or Hold Together, Baby) that add flavor to a character and either grant bonuses, benefit allies, remove penalties during play, or penalize adversaries. They cost experience points to buy, {{and must be}} unlocked in the order they appear on a diagram called a [...] "Specialization Tree" [...] (similar {{to those found in}} video games such as Star Wars: The Old Republic). The further down the diagram, the more expensive (and powerful) the Talents become. This means that sometimes a player has to buy Talents that they do not want or require {{in order to get to}} desired talents further down the same branch. However, it avoids having the character cherry-pick the more powerful talents and leaving the rest. The player can only buy a talent on the tree once (but can buy it again if it appears elsewhere on the diagram); when the tree is all filled out, the character cannot buy any more talents from that specialization tree.|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of turning require power, in which the power {{obtained}} from electrical energy. The electrical energy is then converted into mechanical energy via an electric motor. How much power the electric motor is determined by several factors, among others: cutting speed, depth of cut, motion eating, cutting time and cutting tool material. In modern lathe used system {{is to make the}} <b>gear</b> <b>head</b> gear as the transmission power is driven by an electric motor. So that there is a relationship between the electric motor power on a lathe with head gear system to the cutting depth on a lathing process.

40|$|Scuffing is a {{prominent}} surface failure mode of loaded, lubricated contacts of gears and rolling element bearings experiencing excessive relative sliding and high speeds. This temperature-induced failure occurs suddenly when the contact temperatures reach a critical level {{due to the}} frictional heat generated at the contact interface. Material properties and geometry of contacting surfaces, operating conditions (normal load, relative sliding and speed), surface texture (roughness amplitude and direction) {{as well as physical}} and chemical properties of the lubricant all influence the scuffing behavior of such components. In this study, a physics-based methodology is proposed for predicting thermal conditions of lubricated contacts under combined sliding and rolling, and for relating these thermal conditions to the likelihood of scuffing. The methodology combines (i) a mixed thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) model to predict temperatures of the contacting surfaces and in the lubricant film in between, (ii) a convective heat transfer model to predict the time-varying temperature distributions of the contacting bodies, and (iii) a scuffing criterion to predict the onset of scuffing. The proposed general methodology is applied to a spur gear problem by considering variations of contact parameters along the tooth surfaces and incorporating a gear load distribution to predict contact loads.
