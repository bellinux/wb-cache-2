5|$|Programs {{were entered}} in binary form by {{stepping}} through <b>each</b> <b>word</b> of memory in turn, {{and using a}} set of 32switches known as the input device to set the value of each bit of <b>each</b> <b>word</b> to either 0 or 1. The SSEM had no paper-tape reader or punch.|$|E
5|$|The machine's {{instruction}} set was increased from the 7 of the SSEM to 26 initially, including multiplication done in hardware. This increased to 30instructions in the Final Specification version. Ten bits of <b>each</b> <b>word</b> were allocated {{to hold the}} instruction code. The standard instruction time was 1.8 milliseconds, but multiplication was much slower, {{depending on the size}} of the operand.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of <b>each</b> <b>word.</b> However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E

5000|$|Use a constant-weight code. In other <b>words,</b> <b>each</b> {{transmitted}} code <b>word</b> is corrected {{such that}} every code word that contains some {{positive or negative}} levels also contains enough of the opposite levels, such that the average level over <b>each</b> code <b>word</b> is zero. For example, Manchester code and Interleaved 2 of 5.|$|R
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of <b>each</b> <b>word</b> rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of <b>each</b> <b>word</b> they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E

50|$|The DEC SIXBIT format packs three {{characters}} in <b>each</b> 18-bit <b>word,</b> <b>each</b> 6-bit character obtained by stripping the high bits from the 7-bit ASCII code, which folds lowercase to uppercase letters.|$|R
50|$|Linguists {{working with}} Australian {{languages}} today purposely use unambiguous phonemic orthographies based on detailed phonological {{analysis of the}} language in question. In orthographies of this kind <b>each</b> spoken <b>word</b> can only be written one way, and <b>each</b> written <b>word</b> can only be read one way.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method to {{optimize}} translation candidate lists derived from window-based approach {{for the task}} of bilingual lexicon extraction. The optimizing process consists of two cross-comparisons between 1 th translation candidate of <b>each</b> target <b>word,</b> and between set of all the 1 th candidates and that of <b>each</b> <b>word’s</b> 2 th to Nth ones. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method leads to a significant improvement on accuracy over window-based approach in bilingual lexicon extraction from both English-Chinese and Chinese-English comparable corpora. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{special feature}} of Swiss Standard German, is a {{somewhat}} [...] "singing" [...] cadence. That means that <b>each</b> <b>word's</b> stressed syllable isn't only marked through the higher voice volume, but also through a distinguishable {{modification of the}} voice's sound. In general, the pitch of the stressed syllable sinks.|$|R
