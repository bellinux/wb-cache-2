5|$|During the 1872 campaign, Wilson's {{reputation}} for honesty {{was marred by}} a September New York Sun article which indicated {{that he was involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crédit</b> Mobilier scandal. Wilson was one of several Representatives and Senators (mostly Republicans), including Colfax, who were offered (and possibly took) bribes of cash and discounted shares in the Union Pacific Railroad's Crédit Mobilier subsidiary from Congressman Oakes Ames during the late 1860s in exchange for votes favorable to the Union Pacific during the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his career, Wilson {{was known}} for championing causes that were at times unpopular, {{including}} {{the abolition of slavery}} and workers' rights for both blacks and whites. Massachusetts politician George F. Hoar, who served in the United States House of Representatives while Wilson was a Senator, and later served in the Senate himself, believed Wilson to be the most skilled political organizer in the country. However, Wilson's reputation for personal integrity and principled politics was somewhat damaged late in his Senate career by his involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crédit</b> Mobilier scandal.|$|E
5|$|At the 1872 Democratic National Convention, Stevenson {{received}} {{the votes of}} Delaware's six delegates for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination, although Benjamin Gratz Brown was ultimately nominated. In February 1873, Vice-President Schuyler Colfax named Stevenson as one of {{five members of the}} Morrill Commission to investigate New Hampshire Senator James W. Patterson's involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crédit</b> Mobilier of America scandal. Stevenson and fellow Senator John P. Stockton of New Jersey both asked to be removed from the commission, but the Senate refused to grant their request. On February 27, 1873, the commission recommended Patterson's expulsion from the Senate, but the chamber adjourned on March 4 without acting on the recommendation. Patterson's term ended {{with the end of the}} session, and he was not re-elected, rendering moot further consideration of the matter.|$|E
5|$|Working as the Deputy Surveyor, Jones {{began to}} build good {{relations}} with the Mississauga Ojibwa Indians and Mohawk Indians of the area. He became fluent in the languages of these groups and earned the trust of many members of the tribes, including influential members like Joseph Brant, of whom he became a good friend. In 1797 the head chief of the Mississaugas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> River area Wabakinine, as well as his wife, were murdered {{by a member of the}} Queen's Rangers. Wabakinine had been a very beloved chief and seen as a firm ally of the British. His murder shocked the members of his band and other local Ojibwa bands. Charles McEwan, the killer was charged and tried, but the Indian witnesses did not attend the trial and he was subsequently acquitted for lack of evidence. Nimquasim, a local Indian chief, met with Augustus Jones on February 15, 1797 and confessed to Jones that he and the local Indian bands were inclined to wage open war against the British over the event. Jones relayed this information to British administrator Peter Russell. The town of York had about 675 white settlers and 135 soldiers, a number that Russell believed might not be sufficient to address an Indian rebellion. If a winter rebellion transpired York would be cut off from large garrisons at the Bay of Quinte and the Niagara Peninsula. Russell and John Graves Simcoe both anticipated rebellion for the next year or so, but it never came. Joseph Brant, a Mohawk chief who had travelled to England cautioned the tribes against rebellion as he knew the military strength of the British was likely to render any war a losing one. Russell, however, set out to undermine alliances and friendships between the Indian bands of southern Ontario, fearing such an uprising.|$|E

25|$|The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) and Financial Sector Reform Programme (FSRP) {{were formed}} in 1990, upon {{contracts}} with the World Bank. These programs sought to remove government distortions and lessen the financial repression. Policies made use of the McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis, which stated that removing distortions augments efficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> market and increases competition. The policies therefore involved banks providing loans on a commercial basis, enhancing bank efficiency and limiting government control to monetary policy only. FSRP forced banks to have a minimum capital adequacy, to systematically classify loans and to implement modern computerised systems, including those that handle accounting. It forced the central bank to free up interest rates, revise financial laws and increase supervision <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> market. The government also developed the capital market, which was also performing poorly.|$|E

As a result, mature two-sided network industries are usually dominated by a handful of large platforms, as is the case <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> card industry. In extreme situations, such as PC operating systems, a single company emerges as the winner, taking almost all of the market.|$|E

25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007, which resulted from insufficient consumer financial {{protection in the}} US, conflicts of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> rating agency industry, and defective transparency requirements in derivatives markets, triggered a massive rise in corporate insolvencies. Contemporary debate, particularly in the banking sector, has shifted to prevention of insolvencies, by scrutinising excessive pay, conflicts of interest among financial services institutions, capital adequacy, and the causes of excessive risk taking. The Banking Act 2009 created a special insolvency regime for banks, called the special resolution regime, envisaging that banks will {{be taken over by}} the government in extreme circumstances.|$|E

The Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibit {{discrimination on the}} basis of race, sex, or other personal characteristics. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires that financial institutions publicly disclose mortgage lending and application data. In contrast with those acts, the CRA seeks to ensure the provision of credit to all parts of a community, regardless of the relative wealth or poverty of a neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} {{individuals}} see debits and credits {{in the above}} manner, is that the bank statement presented by the bank to the customer is the bank's view of the account. The bank views money in a chequing account as money the bank owes to the customer, i.e. a liability, and in the rules of accounting, an increase to a liability account is a credit. Likewise, when a bank lends money to a customer and places the money into the customer's chequing account, the bank has increased its obligation to pay that money, which is a liability, and this increase is a credit and appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> column of a bank statement.|$|E
