5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve <b>gates</b> (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls. These massive <b>gates</b> are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These <b>gates</b> are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these outer <b>gates</b> were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} gate types {{require a}} specific manner of crossing. Double cone <b>gates</b> must be crossed in level flight, single cone <b>gates</b> must be crossed in a 90° angle, and slalom {{flying through the}} chicane <b>gates</b> (knife or level flying not mandatory).|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} south through rural Virginia in October 1780, Kościuszko {{proceeded to}} North Carolina {{to report to}} his former commander General <b>Gates.</b> However, following Gates's disastrous defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, the Continental Congress had selected Washington's choice, Major General Nathanael Greene, to replace the disgraced <b>Gates</b> as commander of the Southern Department. When Greene formally assumed command on December 3, 1780, he retained Kościuszko as his chief engineer. By then, he had been praised by both <b>Gates</b> and Greene.|$|E

5|$|At {{the south}} end of Park Lane, on the west side, <b>gates</b> in honour of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (widow of George VI) were erected in 1993. The <b>gates</b> were {{designed}} by Giuseppe Lund and David Wynne and bear motifs in an interpretation from her coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|During 2006, {{the state}} {{government}} supplied $150,000 for new <b>gates</b> and ticket boxes at the stadium entry. The <b>gates</b> were later named after recently deceased Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon.

The two-storey Cameron-Tyson stand was in 2005, replaced by an extension of the Gunns Stand.|$|E
5|$|Dutthagamani's army {{attacked}} {{all four}} <b>gates</b> {{of the city}} simultaneously. He led the main assault on the southern gate with Nandimithra, Suranimala and the elephant Kandula, while {{the attacks on the}} northern and western <b>gates</b> were led by Bharana, Khanjadeva, Phussadeva and Labhiyavasabha. The eastern gate was attacked by Mahasona, Gothaimbara, Theraputthabhaya and Velusumana. The defenders of the eastern <b>gates</b> were routed by Velusumana after a cavalry attack, and Elara's forces withdrew into the city.|$|E
50|$|A NOT <b>gate</b> is made {{by joining}} the inputs of a NAND <b>gate</b> together. Since a NAND <b>gate</b> is {{equivalent}} to an AND <b>gate</b> followed by a NOT <b>gate,</b> joining the inputs of a NAND <b>gate</b> leaves only the NOT <b>gate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{community}} is accessed by Scientists' Cliffs Road and divided into five sub-sections, called [...] "Gates," [...] named <b>Gate</b> A, <b>Gate</b> B, <b>Gate</b> C, <b>Gate</b> D, and <b>Gate</b> E, respectively.

For example, <b>Gate</b> A features streets named Aster, Aspen, Azalea, etc., <b>Gate</b> B features streets named Birch, Beech and Bluebell, and so forth.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gating</b> occurs {{through two}} mechanisms: protopore or fast <b>gating</b> and common or slow <b>gating.</b> Common <b>gating</b> {{involves}} both protein subunits closing their pores {{at the same}} time (cooperation), while protopore <b>gating</b> involves independent opening and closing of each pore. As the names imply, fast <b>gating</b> occur at a much faster rate than slow <b>gating.</b> Precise molecular mechanisms for <b>gating</b> are still being studied.|$|R
5|$|Fares are {{enforced}} by the station agent, who monitors activity at the fare <b>gates</b> adjacent {{to the window and}} at other fare <b>gates</b> through closed circuit television and faregate status screens located in the agent's booth. All stations are staffed with at least one agent at all times.|$|E
5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out from the gate to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The <b>gates</b> themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some <b>gates</b> had portcullises. Postern <b>gates</b> were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gates</b> are {{sometimes}} installed at cave entrances to limit human entry into caves with sensitive or endangered bat species. The <b>gates</b> are designed not {{to limit the}} airflow, and thus to maintain the cave's micro-ecosystem.|$|E

50|$|The First East <b>Gate</b> was {{a sturdy}} <b>gate</b> that formed a square {{together}} with the outer <b>gate.</b> It also had a gabled, tile-roof along with a smaller <b>gate</b> {{on the right side}} that connects with the tower <b>gate.</b> This <b>gate</b> was similar to the First <b>Gate</b> that was destroyed during World War II.|$|R
5|$|<b>Gates</b> has {{credited}} {{the generosity}} and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller {{as a major}} influence. <b>Gates</b> and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby {{they are interested in}} tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda <b>Gates</b> were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gates</b> {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} {{entrepreneurs}} of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. Later in his career, <b>Gates</b> pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda <b>Gates</b> Foundation, which was established in 2000.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gates</b> was a National Merit Scholar when he {{graduated}} from Lakeside School in 1973.

5|$|In 1999, {{his wealth}} briefly surpassed $101billion. Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, <b>Gates</b> usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, <b>Gates</b> commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, <b>Gates</b> was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to <b>Gates).</b> Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, <b>Gates</b> was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E
