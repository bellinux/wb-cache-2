40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{basically}} concerned with improving {{the environment in}} which office workers go about their business. In the first chapter - The office environment - the extent of the problem and the necessity for improving the environment is discussed. <b>Deep-plan</b> buildings and associated interior layouts like the "bull-pen" and open planning are defined. Chapter 2 - Daylighting - deals with issues relating to the incorporation of daylighting into buildings. Here, the advantages of daylighting- both in quantitative measurements as well as qualitative aspects - are put forward; and the implications on interior planning discussed.. Chapter 3 - The courtyard array - brings together the ideas of the preceding chapters and proposes a broad, low building with multiple atria as {{a solution to the problem}} of daylighting the <b>deep-plan</b> office. Earlier studies dealing with illumination, thermal comfort, view content, acoustics and economic evaluation are discussed in relation to the proposed array. A discussion on the importance of physical scale models in the evaluation of a building's lighting performance is at the beginning of Chapter 4 : Daylighting models. This chapter continues with a description of the models made; and ends with tables of illumination measurements and daylight factor calculations from the physical models. These measurements show the validity of the day lit array concept for day lighting a <b>deep-plan</b> building. In Chapter 5 - Economic evaluation - the thermal performances of a non-daylit and a daylit building are compared, using the computer program Solar 5. The operating costs of the two alternatives show the extent of potential savings from the use of day lighting. The concluding chapter of this thesis puts in perspective issues relating to the day lighting of <b>deep-plan</b> offices. It discusses the economic trade-offs inherent in the design of a different type of building form. The final question - whether the non-daylit module or the day lit module will be built - can only be decided by the management of the office. The purpose of my thesis is to give them an idea of what daylighting can mean to their company: in creating a better work environment and lowering operating costs. by Chittaranjan David Leonard Swamidasan.

This paper summarizes four kinds of passive ventilation cooling types. Their techniques and adaptability are discussed. The disadvantage of natural ventilation cooling is pointed out. It proposed that indirect controllable ventilation cooling may be used in large depth, enclosed public buildings...|$|R
40|$|Daylight is a {{valuable}} resource for both energy and human health. However, this resource is often underutilized in buildings due {{to the difficulty of}} controlling the changing qualities of daylight. <b>Deep-plan</b> building spaces pose an especially challenging problem because traditional sidelighting strategies are only effective for workplanes adjacent to the facade. Infrequently adjusted shading systems can also limit the availability of daylight. A number of advanced daylighting systems have been developed that attempt to address these challenges with varying priorities and success. This thesis proposes a new technology named the Soralux Daylighting System. The system is passive, requires no shading adjustments, even under direct sunlight, and works well with <b>deep-plan</b> spaces on the order of 8 to 15 m deep. The Soralux system presents itself as a double-glazing window unit, allowing it to be easily integrated into curtain wall facades typical of <b>deep-plan</b> offices in large cities. Computer simulations using the ray tracing programs Radiance and TracePro were conducted to estimate the annual performance of the system. Variables such as facade orientation, sky obstruction, and climate were evaluated for their effect on system performance. The system was found to increase light levels by a factor of 2 to 10 compared to an unshaded window at depths between 8 and 15 m from the facade. Two physical mockups of the Soralux system were fabricated for testing. The first mockup tested was a small proof-of-concept prototype, while the second was a full-scale mockup which was installed in a Tokyo office building. The physical mockups were used to evaluate visual comfort and appearance. A monitoring campaign was also conducted for the Tokyo mockup and the measured data were compared with a Radiance model of the building space to validate the accuracy of the simulation results. The average error between simulated and measured illuminance values was 16 %. Based on these results, recommendations are provided identifying which scenarios are well-suited for the system. The Soralux Daylighting System is scheduled to be permanently installed into a Tokyo office building in 2012. by Kevin W. Thuot. Thesis (S. M.)

The present paper gives a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of anidolic integrated ceiling. This device was designed with regard of luminous climate of the city of Biskra (Algeria), installed in the north façade and their luminous performance is assessed experimentally by using scale model, for a 12 m deep room.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} testing of {{appropriate}} design standards to optimize energy performance {{in the pursuit of}} building retrofits. The impact of whole-building "best" and "normal" practice standards are predicted and evaluated using as a case study a forty-year-old heavy coredependent <b>deep-plan</b> twenty-three storey office building in Brisbane. Predictive modelling used Design Builder simulation software. A Forward Simulation Model (FSM) and Data-Driven Simulation Models (DDSM) contributed to the evaluation of "normal" and "best" practice standards. With higher thermal resistance in the built fabric the PassivHaus Model (PHM) – a “best” practice standard – demonstrated a maximum energy saving of 9. 5 %. Findings suggest that retrofitting for energy saving in internal-load dominated office buildings requires strategies to control internal loads. The holebuilding energy standards with efficient operational profiles promoted 46 % of energy savings, showing systematic appraisal and prediction to derive case-specific design solutions in satisfying the regulatory measures for future commercial buildings in Australia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the lighting {{performance of a}} passive horizontal solar light pipe designed for deep floor plan buildings with open-plan configuration. The light pipe system was designed to deliver natural light {{at the back of}} <b>deep-plan</b> buildings (5 - 10 m from window wall) using an optimized geometry and high reflective materials. The current light pipe system was developed for latitude 30. 6 ?N in a predominantly sunny and clear sky location. A 360 ? rotating experimental room was built to test the light pipe performance at different orientations. The experimental room represents a section of a deep open plan office space of 3. 6 m high, 6. 1 m wide, 9. 1 m long, with an area of 56 m 2. Preliminary results of photometric measurements in a South-facing orientation have shown that on clear and partly cloudy days (global horizontal illuminance GH, ranging 20, 000 - 120, 000 lux), the light pipe can provide at 8 m from the perimeter, between 300 to 2, 500 lux for about nine hours (9 : 00 am- 6 : 00 pm). The highest illuminance values (above 1, 000 lux) are achieved consistently between 10 : 30 am and 4 : 30 pm under clear sky conditions. Natural light is evenly distributed over the workplane; the sidelight window illuminates {{the front of the room}} and the light pipe system the back...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{identify}} the thermal functions of internal courtyards in traditional Chinese shophouses (CSHs) located in the hot-humid climate of Malaysia with the aim of providing useful passive cooling strategies for modern urban houses. The CSHs are <b>deep-plan</b> brick row houses that are located in relatively dense urban areas. First, this paper empirically analyses the effects of courtyard forms on their indoor thermal environments based on the results of field experiments conducted in 16 CSHs in the city of Malacca in 2011 and 2014. Second, this paper investigates the detailed thermal environments of the selected two traditional CSHs with different courtyard types to discuss the thermal functions of courtyards. It was determined that air temperatures in internal courtyards can be explained using the sky view factor, the height of the courtyard and the difference in the heights of the building and walls that form the courtyard. The courtyard forms that characterized their thermal environments were classified into five types and the different types of courtyards performed different functions with respect to improving the indoor thermal comfort in the CSHs. It was suggested that closed, cross ventilated courtyards be embedded to achieve indoor thermal comfort and avoid excessive humidity in hot-humid climates. Meanwhile, it was also recommended that a staggered form courtyard with V-shaped roofs should be designed as a nocturnal cooling source...|$|R
40|$|Tubular Daylighting Devices {{are used}} to bring {{daylight}} into <b>deep-plan</b> spaces, and meet sustainability goals. However, they are expensive, and justification for their use lies in hypothesised benefits they can provide {{in areas such as}} well-being and productivity. Yet, there is very little research into the effects of Tubular Daylighting Devices. The broader daylighting literature suggests that benefits to satisfaction, mood, and performance are possible — though research into the benefits of daylight is still not conclusive. Therefore, a before and after study was carried out in a windowless computer room in the university to compare how the students responded under TDDs versus typical electric lighting. Their cognitive performance, change in mood, average sleepiness, and perceptions of the room and lighting were measured. TDDs significantly increased ratings of room attractiveness and brightness, and had no more perceived glare than the electric lighting. Ratings of lighting quality were on a par with both typical electric lighting and good modern lighting. They were also just as effective on overcast days as sunny. No effects were found on performance or sleepiness, and mood results were inconclusive. Overall, it is suggested that TDDs can be considered to be on a par with good modern lighting, and superior to typical existing lighting. Note, however, that it is possible that effects in rooms with windows could differ from those found here. Further research should use longer exposures and larger sample sizes if they wish to find performance effects...|$|R

It is available at: [URL] tackle climate change it is essential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. To this end, it is important to reduce the energy demands of nondomestic buildings. Naturally ventilated buildings can have low energy demands but the strategy is difficult to implement in deep plan, urban locations. The Frederick Lanchester Library at Coventry University, UK, incorporates natural ventilation, daylighting and passive cooling strategies. By using lightwells and perimeter stacks to supply and exhaust air, it can be ventilated by natural means despite its deep plan form and sealed fac¸ade. This paper describes the building and presents the energy consumption and the internal temperatures and CO 2 levels recorded in 2004 / 2005. The building’s performance is compared to the original design criteria and good practice guidelines. Recommendations for the design of such buildings are made and the likely performance in other UK cities is assessed. It is concluded that the building uses under half the energy of a standard air-conditioned building and yet, in summer, can keep the interior comfortable and up to 5 8 C below ambient. The design would perform equally well in the typical weather conditions experienced at 13 other UK cities, but not in London. It is concluded that <b>deep-plan,</b> naturally ventilated buildings with sealed facades, if well designed, could maintain thermal comfort in all but a very few UK locations, whilst consuming much less energy than even good practice standards...|$|R
40|$|The Military Health System (MHS) is a {{worldwide}} network of healthcare facilities and personnel. The healthcare facility inventory is aging and requires extensive facility management, renovations and replacement construction {{to maintain the}} environment of a high quality of care. Recent developments in sustainability and evidence-based design (EBD) have created additional requirements for the design and construction of facilities. These areas of design emphasis, sustainability and EBD, are developing best practices according to the respective theory. Existing facilities in the MHS have been directed to undergo restoration and modernization by Department of Defense (DoD) civilian leadership. Governmental directives have mandated that these restorations and new construction complies with current building codes and that EBD design features be included in healthcare facility planning. The hospital building type has changed over history due to innovations in building technology, such as HVAC and steel frame construction, as well as healthcare initiatives, such as treatment of tuberculosis and the mentally ill. The design concepts of environmental sustainability and EBD are currently altering the hospital typology. Building professionals have found significant differences in facilities that are categorized as evidence-based and those noted as sustainable. The future of successful healthcare designs relies on a balance of these concepts. The hospital building type {{has one of the}} highest energy intensities out of all commercial building types. Hospitals have become more energy intense due to the evolution of the <b>deep-plan</b> hospital. The design of the building envelope is the most lasting feature affecting the energy use of a hospital, due to its service-life typically equaling the life of the facility. The building envelope design consists of the shape of the building, material selection, as well as its orientation. This research demonstrates the relationship between incorporating positive building occupant features, such as increased day lighting and views of nature, and efficient energy design choices. The use of energy simulation software and early design collaboration between multiple professional disciplines is recognized as critical to optimal design solutions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} an advanced optical light pipe daylighting system {{as a means to}} deliver natural light at the back of <b>deep-plan</b> office buildings (15 ft to 30 ft), using optimized geometry and high reflective materials. The light pipe configurations follow a previous study at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Beltr??n et al., 1997). The current system is designed for College Station, TX (lat: 30 ?? 36 ??N), with predominantly mostly sunny sky conditions. This work consists of the monitoring of two scale models simulating a portion of a multi-story office building with open-plan configuration, with interior dimensions 30 ft x 20 ft x 10 ft, built at 1 : 4 of its real scale, one of the models being the reference case and the other the test case where the light pipe system is placed. The main objectives of this thesis are (a) to examine this daylighting system comparative to the reference case, taking measurements for longer periods than the study at LBNL, as well as to collect detailed data of its performance under different weather conditions and with different materials; (b) to evaluate the visual comfort and possible glare problems of the light pipe system through photographic evaluation and the conduction of a survey that provides people??s opinions and suggestions about the daylighting system. The light pipe system demonstrated a higher performance than the reference case in terms of appropriate levels of light and people??s preferences. The illuminance at the workplane level showed to be adequate with any of the two different diffusing materials used to spread the light into the room. The light pipe without a diffuser was the other condition observed to further understand the bounces of the sunbeam inside the reflective chamber and its consequences on the lighting output. Recommended standards for office spaces with VDT screens together with the analysis of the daylight system, led to preliminary suggestions on how to integrate the light pipe system in an open-plan office configuration. Further study is indicated to reach the complete potential of this advanced optical light pipe that ties illuminance quality with energy savings through the integration of daylight and electric light systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the low-density car-based suburbs that surround Australian and US cities {{are well known}} and widely debated. These include facilities located to the disadvantage of non-car users, wasteful use of land, cost of infrastructure, time and energy expended on driving, low incidence of social contact and lack of exercise. Nevertheless, the older Australian suburb also has compensating advantages for both the residents and the wider community. This includes {{a higher degree of}} biodiversity, the presence of trees also provides shade, modifying the microclimate and giving aesthetic pleasure. The planted areas around the dwelling also aid the process of storm drainage by retaining water and reducing run-off. The private amenity space around the dwelling can accommodate not just a garden for the pleasure of the occupants but also barbeque facilities and an in-ground swimming pool. These not only benefit the residents directly but also facilitate social interaction with friends and neighbours. In some parts of Australia, notably Queensland, use is made of verandas to provide outdoor living sheltered from the sun. Although very large, all encompassing roofs may be employed, {{a significant part of the}} space under them is open to the air and to the surroundings. The more recent suburbs, however, display a disturbing trend, signified by the problematic design and layout of dwellings. The dwelling now extends near to the boundary of the plot and, in consequence, near to adjoining dwellings. There is very little private amenity space to the rear of the dwelling, in extreme cases none at all. Houses are predominantly singlestorey, with only a proportion rising to 1 ½ or two storeys. There is little in the way of balconies and verandas. The design is square or <b>deep-plan</b> and incorporates an integral double garage greatly reducing the scope for natural lighting and ventilation, windows are often small and tinted. Normally only one room provides an outlook to the front and surveillance of the street. While the {{disadvantages of}} suburban living still apply, the advantages referred to above have disappeared. This paper provides a quantitative analysis of this change to the morphology of the Australian suburb. Comparisons are made with selected examples in the USA and UK. The effects and possible causes of the change are discussed and remedies suggested...|$|R
