The Midway Carousel and Calypso were relocated in October {{to other areas of}} the park to make room for Raptor. Footers also began to be poured that month. The lift hill was topped off in December with track construction continuing through January 1994. The first trains were tested about two months later in March. Final preparations were made in March with the entrance plaza being built and [...] of midway replaced. Media day was held on May 6 before the ride opened to the public the next day for the first time. The ride was originally painted with dark green supports, bright green track and unpainted rails. It was repainted for the 2002 season and the rails were painted dark green, matching the supports.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the Gold Rush log <b>flume</b> <b>water</b> {{ride was}} added, {{and two years}} later Geauga Lake added the Skyscraper, which took {{passengers}} up 21 stories for views of the park. Admission to the park was free until 1972. Until then, rides on various attractions were purchased on a pay-as-you-go basis. Beginning in 1973, the park converted to an admission charge with a pay-one-price for all the rides and attractions. The Geauga Dog became the park's mascot and would remain so until 1999. In 1976, the park added the Wildcat compact steel roller coaster, and a year later the park added the Double Loop, a looping steel coaster. [...] For a time, the park ran a short-lived series of TV commercials featuring Geauga Dog and a singing, dancing adolescent boy performing a song about the park. The boy's off-key singing and awful dancing were deliberate, a means of getting viewers to notice the ad. It succeeded.|$|E

Through Las Canoas (The <b>Flumes),</b> <b>water</b> was funneled from Rattlesnake Canyon into Mission Creek. The native Chumash people helped dig the channel and build the flumes. In 1808, to build a more permanent structure, dams were built by Mexican artisans on Mission Creek and in Rattlesnake Canyon. Only remnants of the dam still exist, and the reservoir has been filled with sediment from the creek.|$|R

In January 2005 a new feature was unveiled - 'The Amazonian Falls', a double chamber speed slide. Other features include two whirlpool spas, eighteen 'Water Bubble Beds', two artificial geysers, four water cannons, three massage channels, four water gargoyles and a mushroom drench shower.|$|E

5000|$|As the 1990s dawned, {{customers}} of Adventureland wanted more water rides. Gentile and Amoruso opened Splish Splash (sold {{in the late}} 90's to a corporate amusement company), a 6 million dollar water park. Then, in 1991, the Galaxy was replaced by Hurricane- a roller coaster. New rides were regular through the 1990s. In 1992, Super Raider, a climbing/fun house was opened. Then, the next year, the antique car ride was updated, the Scorpion ride was switched with Surf Dance, Tubs of Fun and Flying Clown replaced older kiddie rides. Then, in 1995, the balloon Wheel replaced the Big Wheel. In 1996, the Dragon Wagon replaced the Sooper Jet, a kiddie roller coaster. Then, in 1999, a double decker merry go round replaced the old merry go round. In 2000, a child roller coaster called the Lady Bug was built. In 2001, the mini golf course was replaced with Adventure Falls, a log <b>flume</b> <b>water</b> ride. Top Scan {{was introduced to the}} park in 2003, and the next year, Viking Voyage replaced the last original ride, the Kiddie Boats. Then, in 2004 a Spinning alligator water ride called Crocodile Run replaced the bumper boats. In 2006, a kiddie log flume called Little Dipper was added where the Top Scan used to be and the Frisbee was added where Surf Dance was. In 2007, they also added a [...] "Glass House" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Mirror House") to where some of their games were and also bought all of the outside games and updated them. Two years later, the ride Flying Puppies replaced Tubs of Fun. In 2010, a new Haunted House, imported from Europe, was added to the park in place of the former Haunted House.|$|E

50|$|While the smelter sat idle, mining {{activity}} continued {{on the south}} side of the river in the Hope-Katy mine complex, at the Hope Mill, which crushed and separated ore, and at the Basin Reduction Works. <b>Flumes</b> carried <b>water</b> from upstream on Cataract Creek and Basin Creek to a storage reservoir in town and supplied water to the mills as well as the town's fire hydrants. A separate <b>flume</b> carried <b>water</b> to the mills from upstream on the Boulder River. At the Basin Reduction Works, Corliss steam engines, driven by the coal-fired boilers, provided power to run the mine hoists and the mill machinery, and an electric generator powered by a water wheel made electricity for factory lights and the arc lights at Basin's street intersections. Surplus tailings were discharged into the river and into a dam built for the purpose downstream of Basin.|$|R
40|$|Three male {{swimmers}} underwent 10 -min resting and 20 -min swimming (breaststroke) exposures in {{a swimming}} <b>flume.</b> <b>Water</b> temperatures in separate exposures were 18, 26, and 33 C. At each water temperature the subjects rested and swam at water velocities of 0. 50, 0. 75, and 0. 95 m/sec, which {{were designed to}} produce around 40, 70, and 100 % of maximal aerobic power. Measurements were made of esophageal temperature, four skin temperatures, water temperature, heat flow from five local skin surfaces (Hatfield-Turner disks), and oxygen uptake. Calculations were made of mean area-weighted skin temperature and heat flow, metabolic rate, and heat storage. Internal body temperature changes after 20 min of swimming were related to water temperature, swimming intensity, and body composition...|$|E
40|$|Three {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments were run, varying the <b>flume</b> <b>water</b> discharge and the downstream water depth, to investigate local scouring downstream of a trapezoidal drop {{followed by a}} rigid apron. Three different kinds of jets, developing downstream of the drop, were observed: a submerged jet, a surface wave jet, and an oscillating jet. The oscillating jet {{is defined as a}} jet which changes intermittently between a surface wave jet and a submerged jet. A different development of the scouring process due to the different kinds of jet was observed: a submerged jet produced a local scouring with a downstream dune, while a surface wave jet produced a local scouring with both an upstream and a downstream dune; the scouring process due to the oscillating jet {{was the result of the}} interaction of the scouring processes due to a submerged jet and a surface wave jet. A stability analysis of the surface wave jet was performed, with both a flat and a scoured bed, by means of the modified De Saint - Venant equations, that is, with correction terms accounting for the curvature of the streamlines. The stability of the surface wave jet is affected by the presence of the scoured bed, which weakens its stability properties...|$|E
40|$|Microsensors, {{including}} a recently developed NO 3 − biosensor, {{were applied to}} measure O 2 and NO 3 − profiles in marine sediments from the upwelling area off central Chile and to investigate the influence of Thioploca spp. on the sedimentary nitrogen metabolism. The studies were performed in undisturbed sediment cores incubated in a small laboratory flume to simulate the environmental conditions of low O 2, high NO 3 −, and bottom water current. On addition of NO 3 − and NO 2 −, Thioploca spp. exhibited positive chemotaxis and stretched out of the sediment into the <b>flume</b> <b>water.</b> In a core densely populated with Thioploca, the penetration depth of NO 3 − was only 0. 5 mm and a sharp maximum of NO 3 − uptake was observed 0. 5 mm above the sediment surface. In sediments with only few Thioploca spp., NO 3 − was detectable down {{to a depth of}} 2 mm and the maximum consumption rates were observed within the sediment. No chemotaxis toward nitrous oxide (N 2 O) was observed, which is consistent with the observation that Thioploca does not denitrify but reduces intracellular NO 3 − to NH 4 +. Measurements of the intracellular NO 3 − and S 0 pools in Thioploca filaments from various depths in the sediment gave insights into possible differences in the migration behavior between the different species. Living filaments containing significant amounts of intracellular NO 3 − were found to a depth of at least 13 cm, providing final proof for the vertical shuttling of Thioploca spp. and nitrate transport into the sediment...|$|E
