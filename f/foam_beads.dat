High-density EPS is even more moisture-resistant, and is manufactured for use on exterior foundation walls and burial against footings, if the soil is relatively dry. EPS typically uses pentane as a blowing agent, avoiding the high global warming potential of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs, as well as the ozone depletion potential of CFC and HCFCs.|$|E

With regard to waste management, CO 2 balance and the conservation of petrochemical resources, increasing efforts are being made to replace standard plastics with bio-based polymers. Nowadays biopolymers can be built for example of cellulose, lactic acid, starch, lignin or bio mass.

40|$|While {{hollow glass}} {{microspheres}} {{are commonly used}} in syntactic foam, their abrasive and brittle properties usually result in poor processability and have adverse effects on the foam performance. Therefore, a number of {{attempts have been made}} in the industry to replace hollow glass microspheres with polymeric foamed microspheres. Among many choices, expandable thermoplastic (ETP) microspheres filled syntactic foam has shown its high potential to become a novel class of engineering materials, especially for lightweight structural applications. However, conventional processing techniques for syntactic foam usually experience difficulties such as high processing viscosity, low loading of foam fillers, and ineffective microsphere expansion. To address these emerging issues, a microwave expansion process to produce thermoset-matrix syntactic foam containing thermoplastic <b>foam</b> <b>beads</b> was developed in this thesis work. In this process, unexpanded ETP microspheres were directly foamed in uncured thermoset matrix via microwave heating. Expandable polystyrene (EPS) microspheres and epoxy resin were chosen as a model material system. The resin viscosity and specific microwave energy are found to be the two primary control parameters determining the process window. Mechanical characterization showed that the syntactic foam can outweigh neat polymer in lightweight structural applications and was effectively toughened by foamed EPS. Furthermore, the microwave expansion process was found to be capable of molding syntactic foam parts of relatively sophisticated geometry with smooth surfaces. In order to broaden its impact, the microwave expansion process was extended to produce composite EPS foam. This process converts an expandable suspension into a composite foam with a honeycomb-like barrier structure. The suspension viscosity was found to highly influence the foam morphology. Results from mechanical tests showed that the existence of the barrier structure can considerably improve the mechanical performance of the composite foam. Fire-retardation tests demonstrated that the barrier structure can effectively stop the fire path into the foam, suppress toxic smoke generation, and maintain foam structure integrity. A general formulation was developed to model the EPS expansion to optimize the microwave expansion process. A semi-analytical solution was first obtained based on the case of a single bubble expansion in an infinite matrix. The dimensionless bubble radius and pressure are defined and found to be as exponential functions of dimensionless expansion time. The semi-analytical solution can qualitatively predict the radial expansion of EPS microsphere observed in a real-time experiment. To have an accurate prediction, a numerical solution was obtained to the model that couples the nucleation and expansion of multiple bubbles in a finite matrix. The results show that the numerical solution can quantitatively predict the radial expansion of EPS. A parameter sensitivity study was performed to examine the effect of each parameter over the expansion process. Ph. D...|$|E

A new thermoplastic elastomer <b>bead</b> <b>foam,</b> which is described as expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (ETPU), now exists. Notably, it has an excellent soft touch quality and is ductile. It has also generated widespread interest in both the academic and industrial communities. In this study, three types of ETPU foams with various sample sizes were steam-chest molded. We concentrated on the preparation of the molded ETPU (METPU), which was followed by a mechanical test. Our morphological observations showed that the ETPU bead foams' interfaces had effectively bonded. A high tensile strength of 1. 80 MPa and an elongation at break of 360. 1 % were reached in the METPU sample with a density of 0. 35 g/cm(3). A 200 -fold cyclic compression measurement verified that the compressed METPU sample could recover more than 95 % both in stress and modulus, after 6 days of relaxation. This suggested the presence of excellent interbead bonding in the ETPU <b>bead</b> <b>foams.</b> Based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, we proposed that a formation mechanism for interbead bonding during the ETPU steam-molding process existed.

The biodegradation of hexane by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was thus optimized in a two phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB).

When a conventional packed-bed biofilter was used, the average RE and EC achieved were 74 % and 12 +/- 7 g m(reactor) (- 3) h(- 1) respectively.

Aeration was provided by recirculating a portion of the reactor liquid phase through an aeration tank, where the dissolved oxygen concentration was kept at 6 mg/l. At a feeding rate of 0. 77 g acetonitrile l– 1 reactor day– 1, 99 % of the acetonitrile was removed; and 86 % of the nitrogen present in acetonitrile was released as NH 3, confirming that acetonitrile volatilization was not significant. Increasing the acetonitrile loading resulted in lower removal efficiencies, but a maximum removal capacity of 1. 0 g acetonitrile l– 1 reactor day– 1 was achieved at a feeding rate of 1. 6 g acetonitrile l– 1 reactor day– 1. The removal capacity of the system was well correlated with the oxygenation capacity, showing that acetonitrile removal was likely to be limited by oxygen supply. Microbial characterization of the biofilm resulted in the isolation of a Comamonas sp. able to mineralize acetonitrile as sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source. This organism was closely related to C. testosteroni (91. 2 %) and might represent a new species in the Comamonas genus.

40|$|Two {{types of}} cement-based {{functional}} composites, thermal insulation and acoustical insulation materials, {{have been developed}} and characterized in this thesis. For thermal insulation material, paraffin and <b>foam</b> plastic <b>beads</b> had been incorporated into a short fiber reinforced cementitious composite. The extrusion technique is utilized to manufacture the composite panels. A series of heat transfer tests under both steady and transient condition is performed by using a controlled-environment multi-test facility. A combined conduction-convection system is arranged in the tests to evaluate the effect of paraffin and foam incorporation. The test results have proved that the foam can reduce the overall thermal conductivity of the composites and the paraffin can enhance the thermal capacity of the materials during transient period. These lead to a good heat insulation property. For acoustical insulation material, lead spheres coated with silicone rubber are used as coarse aggregates. The lead ball is a heavy mass and the silicone rubber behaves as a soft spring. The coated lead spheres are embedded into a short fiber reinforced cement-based matrix. When a sound wave passes through the composite panel, localized excitation occurring in the coated lead balls will be induced. And thus the sound transmission through the panel can be greatly reduced. Therefore, the composite panel improves acoustical insulation by the localized resonant excitation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{well defined}} ZSM- 5 films were {{prepared}} on monoliths, ceramic <b>foams,</b> alumina <b>beads,</b> glass beads and crushed quartz glass by further refinement of a method originally {{developed at the}} division of Chemical Technology, Luleå University of Technology. The supports were seeded with silicalite- 1 seeds and hydrothermally treated, either at 75 °C or at 150 °C in a single or several steps. By adding sodium to the solution the aluminum concentration increased in the zeolite, which is beneficial for catalytic activity. Consequently, films with different Si/Al ratios could be prepared. The film thickness could be controlled from 110 nm to 9000 nm. Short hydrothermal treatments and use of multi-step synthesis was utilized to prevent excessive bulk crystallization and ultrasound treatment was beneficial in order to remove sedimented crystals {{on top of the}} zeolite films. The choice of support material and its influence on the performance of thin ZSM- 5 film catalysts was examined by testing the reactivity of the zeolite- coated materials in two reactions; para-xylene isomerization and triisopropylbenzene cracking. ZSM- 5 films with a thickness of 150, 350, 800 and 2300 nm, respectively, were prepared on alumina beads and quartz glass. Based upon the zeolite content, the films on quartz glass were much more active for para-xylene isomerization and for cracking of triisopropylbenzene, which is attributed to poisoning of the films on alumina due to impurities in the support. Model parameters were fitted to experimental results. The simulations indicated that thicker films contained a higher fraction of defects, which may be caused by open grain boundaries and cracks. These defects explain higher xylene diffusivities and higher triisopropylbenzene cracking activity for thicker films. As expected, thicker films possessed higher diffusion resistance than thin films despite the higher fraction of defects. The present work has given substantial and valuable fundamental understanding of the performance of thin molecular sieve film catalysts. These findings will be beneficial for development of materials that may be used in novel industrial applications. Godkänd; 2003; 20070216 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|A method {{originally}} {{developed at the}} division of Chemical Technology, Luleå University of Technology was tailored for the preparation of well-defined ZSM- 5 films and zoned MFI films on supports suitable for catalysis and adsorption applications. Films were grown on monoliths, ceramic <b>foams,</b> alumina <b>beads,</b> soda glass beads and quartz glass. The supports were seeded with silicalite- 1 crystals and hydrothermally treated in a single or several steps. The materials were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, N 2 and NO 2 sorption, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ICP-AES, p-xylene isomerization and cracking of 1, 3, 5 -tri-isopropylbenzene. The thickness of the continuous films could be controlled from 110 nm to 9 µm. Zoned MFI films were prepared from precursor ZSM- 5 films by overgrowth with silicalite- 1. A multi-step synthesis protocol was used to prevent excessive bulk crystallization. Ultrasound treatment was beneficial for removal of loosely attached crystals {{on top of the}} zeolite films. Defects such as cracks and open grain boundaries were observed by SEM and in concert, mesopores were observed by N 2 sorption. Model parameters were fitted to experimental data from catalytic test reactions and these parameters indicated that thicker films contained more defects, probably in the form of open grain boundaries and cracks (mesopores) as observed by SEM and N 2 sorption. Films supported on quartz were more catalytically active than films on alumina and soda glass. This was attributed to partial poisoning of the acid sites in the films on the latter two substrates, probably due to solid-state ion exchange of impurities such as alkali metals from the alumina and soda glass support to the film. As expected, thicker films possessed higher diffusion resistance than thin films. Surprisingly, a higher external activity was observed after zoning. This was attributed to formation of mesopores, migration of aluminum from the precursor ZSM- 5 film to the external surface, and increased surface roughness upon zoning. ZSM- 5 films supported on monoliths were successfully tested for NO 2 sorption. As expected, the adsorption capacity per g zeolite was independent of film thickness. Formation of NO was observed as a result of NO 2 adsorption on strong sites. Thicker films resulted in higher diffusion resistance as expected. The present work has resulted in substantial and valuable new fundamental understanding of the performance of thin molecular sieve film catalysts and adsorbents. These findings may facilitate development of novel materials for industrial applications. Godkänd; 2005; 20061004 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|Polymer foam {{materials}} play a {{large role}} in the modern world. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) <b>bead</b> <b>foam</b> is a lightweight, low density, and good thermal and acoustic insulating material whose properties make it attractive for a number of applications, especially as building insulation. However, EPS also experiences post- molding shrinkage; it shrinks dimensionally from its molded size after processing. This means parts must be stored in warehouses until they are considered stable by the industry standard, DIN EN 1603. This often takes 11 - 18 weeks and is thus very timely and expensive. This study aims to decrease the post-molding shrinkage time of EPS foam by understanding the mechanisms of shrinkage behavior. Samples were split into two groups based on their amount of initial volatile matter content and storage conditions, then compared to a control group. Based on thermogravimetric analysis and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, the volatile matter content and composition was found to not be the sole contributor to EPS foam dimensional stability. Residual stress testing was done with the hole drilling method and Raman spectroscopy. As this type of testing has not been done with polymer foams before, the aim was to see if either method could reliably produce residual stress values. Both methods measured residual stress values with unknown accuracy. All samples stored at a higher temperature (60 °C) reached dimensional stability {{by the end of this}} study. Thus, air diffusion into EPS foam, encouraged by the high temperature storage, was found to play a significant role in post-molding shrinkage...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to changes}} in modem warfare threats, as well as {{advances}} in body armor, soldier survivability in combat has increased, but blast-induced Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has become a prevalent injury in the battlefield. Often {{referred to as the}} "signature wound" of the current U. S. conflicts, blast-induced TBI is not a very well understood injury. In an effort to gain more insight on blast mechanisms and TBI, and to increase protection against this injury, our study investigates the development and exploration of a new Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) liner for the modem day soldier. The key component of the liner explored in this work is the addition of channels within foam that contain fluid or fluid-like materials. To support this goal, this thesis explores the response of these filler materials in a 2 D sandwich structure at a range of pressures believed to be in the range of the occurrence of mild TBI, the most common TBI diagnosis among soldiers. Filler materials explored in this work are glass beads and glycerin. Experiments were performed at Purdue University and the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, using two different shock tube setups to produce incident blast waves. Peak transmitted pressure was used to assess filler materials' blast mitigation abilities, and any nonlinear behavior was explored over the range of incident pressures tested. Results indicate a nonlinear effect in the mitigation of blasts by solid <b>foam</b> and glass <b>beads.</b> These materials respond linearly to applied pressures at 15, 30, and 45 psi, but digress from linear behavior at 60 psi applied pressure. It was also determined that there is a significant advantage to using sandwiches with glass beads compared to solid foam at 60 psi applied pressure, but at 15 psi, 30 psi, and 45 psi, there is no significant difference among all three materials explored. by Allison L.

40|$|A {{hydrogen}} (H 2) {{energy economy}} {{has the potential}} to lower fossil carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, which {{have been shown to be}} the major cause of climate change. Biomass gasification as a source of H 2 and synthesis gas has many environmental advantages and is the most favourable process in terms of commercialisation in the near future. In this study, steam methane reforming (SMR), water-gas shift (WGS) and dry methane reforming (DMR) were selected as model reactions for downstream processing of biomass gasification. The selective generation of hydrogen gas (H 2) from the pyrolysis-gasification of renewable biomass feedstocks, using in-situ carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture is a promising process that has been investigated extensively in the pursuit of practical and sustainable processes for hydrogen production. The high CO 2 uptake capacity of bulk calcium oxide (CaO) as a CO 2 sorbent is well known in literature, as are its limitations in terms of decay in activity, due to sintering effects, over multiple carbonation and regeneration cycles. A number of research groups have reported that dispersion of nanoparticulate calcium oxide on/through support materials can enhance the reactivity, thermal stability and longevity of the sorbent. The first key objective of this project was to synthesise mesoporous and hierarchically porous alumina and aluminate materials to use as supports for calcium oxide sorbent, as well as, nickel catalysts. The nanocasting technique using a soft-templating method and evaporationinduced self-assembly was employed to synthesise these materials. Pluronic P 123 was used as structure-directing agent for the mesopores and polyurethane <b>foam</b> or polystyrene <b>beads</b> were used as co-templates for the hierarchically porous alumina, calcium aluminate, cerium aluminate and nickel aluminate in which both two-dimensional and three-dimensional porous structures were obtained. ii CaO/porous calcium aluminate sorbents were synthesised and tested for their CO 2 uptake capacity and thermal stability by means of thermogravimetric analysis. They remained stable and active in CO 2 sorption for at least thirty carbonation and regeneration cycles, using a typical steam methane reforming (SMR) reaction temperature of 700 °C as the carbonation temperature (also tested at 560 °C) and a relatively high regeneration temperature of 850 °C. The sorbent materials synthesised in this study displayed a high CO 2 uptake and a resistance to sintering effects. Initial SMR and WGS experiments showed that mesoporous nickel aluminate (meso- NixAlyOz) catalyst generated a high hydrogen yield comparable to that of a commercial nonporous Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The physical mixture of the CaO/mesoporous calcium aluminate sorbents and the meso-NixAlyOz led to improved hydrogen yields during CO 2 -sorption enhanced SMR and WGS, via the removal of the CO 2 from the product gas stream. Hydrogen can also be produced from the reaction between methane, a biomass gasification product, and CO 2; this process is known as dry methane reforming (DMR). DMR is even more endothermic than SMR, but if it is used in conjunction with sustainable processes, such as biomass gasification of renewable carbonaceous feedstocks, this energy cost could be justified. Both SMR and DMR afford a synthesis gas but for DMR a lower H 2 /CO ratio is obtained, which is more suitable for use in e. g. gas-to-liquids (GTL) technologies such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Nickel-based catalysts are known to have a high DMR activity but are prone to coking. Aluminate support materials have been shown to improve coking-resistance in catalysts, therefore, mesoporous and macro-mesoporous nickel aluminates were synthesised, as well as, nickel and nickel-cobalt bimetallic catalysts on porous alumina and aluminate supports. Nickel/non-porous Al 2 O 3 catalysts were synthesised, for comparison. All of these materials were tested for catalytic activity towards DMR of a model product gas from pyrolysis- gasification of biomass. The performances of these materials were screened along with a commercial nickel/alumina (Ni/Al 2 O 3) catalyst at 700, 800 and 900 °C. Most of the catalysts tested displayed a high degree of catalytic activity and showed very little weight loss in post- DMR temperature-programmed oxidations (TPO), which suggests that coking of these catalysts was negligible. Hierarchically porous nickel aluminate (hier-NixAlyOz) showed a high H 2 and CO yield compared with other materials and also a high degree of stability during long-term DMR catalytic experiments (20 and 665 hours) with the aforementioned model product gas at 800 °C. The catalysts that displayed a high degree of catalytic activity and stability during these screening experiments were performance-tested for dry methane reforming, at 800 °C, of a real product gas from pyrolysis-gasification of beechwood chips. The hier-NixAlyOz catalyst proved to have the highest catalytic activity and stability in DMR experiments compared to other materials tested, including a commercial Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The use of porous alumina and aluminate materials as supports for CaO sorbent and nickel catalyst proved to be beneficial in terms of thermal and hydrothermal stability, as well as maintaining catalytic activity and CO 2 -uptake capacity through resistance to coking and sintering.
