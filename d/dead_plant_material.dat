5|$|The fungus is saprobic, and so derives {{nutrients}} from breaking down <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material,</b> such as leaves, bark, needles, and twigs, that {{has fallen to}} the ground. Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on leaf litter in beech and beech-hemlock forests {{during the summer and}} autumn, although it has been recorded growing on lawns. It is also often found under eastern North American oaks. The distribution includes the US states Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Vermont. It has also been collected in Quebec, Canada.|$|E

25|$|Carbon {{present in}} the trees is {{essential}} for ecosystem development and {{plays a key role}} in the regional climate in Brazil and also globally. Fallen leaves resulting from deforestation leave behind a mass of <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> known as slash, which on decomposition provides a food source for invertebrates which has the indirect effect of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels through respiration and microbial activity. Simultaneously the organic carbon within the soil structure becomes depleted and the presence of carbon plays a vital role in the functioning of life in any ecosystem.|$|E

50|$|To {{treat the}} {{infected}} plant, {{the first step}} is to remove infected and dying leaves, buds and flowers immediately along with any other <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>materials</b> around the hellebore. The next step is to reduce the humidity around the plant by improving the ventilation and ensuring the plants are not overcrowded.|$|R
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{decrease in}} the member of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, {{increase the amount of}} detritus (<b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material)</b> that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{southern}} California witnessed powerful chaparral wildfires. Hundreds {{of homes}} {{and hundreds of thousands}} of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads, a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case. Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.|$|E
500|$|Like ants {{and some}} bees and wasps from the {{separate}} order Hymenoptera, termites divide labour among castes consisting of sterile {{male and female}} [...] "workers" [...] and [...] "soldiers". All colonies have fertile males called [...] "kings" [...] and one or more fertile females called [...] "queens". Termites mostly feed on <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> and cellulose, generally {{in the form of}} wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung. Termites are major detritivores, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions, and their recycling of wood and plant matter is of considerable ecological importance.|$|E
50|$|Scavenging {{is both a}} {{carnivorous}} and a herbivorous {{feeding behavior}} in which the scavenger feeds on <b>dead</b> animal and <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> present in its habitat. The eating of carrion from the same species {{is referred to as}} cannibalism. Scavengers {{play an important role in}} the ecosystem by consuming the <b>dead</b> animal and <b>plant</b> <b>material.</b> Decomposers and detritivores complete this process, by consuming the remains left by scavengers.|$|R
50|$|Adults {{are seen}} around various {{habitats}} including ponds and wetlands.

Calbovista is a common mountain puffball. Its distribution covers the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of the western United States. On {{the eastern side of}} the Cascade Range, the puffball is often found growing under ponderosa pine. It has been collected from California, Colorado, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming, and Oregon. Its range extends north to British Columbia and Alaska. The puffball is often found by morel hunters in the spring, as it grows in similar habitats.|$|E
500|$|Overall Y. geinitzi can be {{distinguished}} from the related Baltic amber species Y. constricta in several ways. [...] Y. geinitzi individuals are overall more gracile in form with a less constricted mesonotum and the mesosoma has a less convex appearance. [...] Y. geinitzi specimens have maxillary palps which are six-jointed, labial palps which are four jointed, and the clypeal border is sinuately indented in the middle. [...] The pupae which Wheeler referred to the species are noted to not have any cocoon unlike the modern larvae of some ant subfamilies which will spin a cocoon to pupate in. [...] The eyes of Y. geinitzi are placed more {{to the front and}} sides of the head capsule than seen in Iridomyrmex species. Due to the shape of Y. geinitzi, the species may have been a herpetobiont (an inhabitant of the soils surface), but scientists suggest that these ants inhabited trees, dwelling inside epiphytes and <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> (such as branches).|$|E

The crew consists of 10 people, including five Terrans (people from Earth). One of the crew members, named Osden, is an [...] "empath"; {{he has the ability to}} feel the emotions of any sentient creatures around him, including humans. His abilities are depicted as being the result of his being treated for autism. The team is led by Tomiko Haito, a woman of East-Asian descent, whose official title is [...] "coordinator." [...] Tensions among the team members run high from the very beginning; in addition to several neurotic personalities, Osden's abrasive personality causes the others to dislike him intensely. The team arrives at the planet, named World 4470. They find it completely covered in vegetation, and seemingly devoid of intelligent life. Osden, whose role is to sense the presence of sentient beings, senses nothing. After some exploration, the scientists find that there is nothing resembling animal life on the planet; all of its life-forms are either photosynthetic, or feed off of <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Decomposition {{products}} of <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>materials</b> form intimate associations with minerals, {{making it difficult}} to isolate and characterize soil organic constituents. 18th century soil chemists successfully used alkaline extraction to isolate a portion of the organic constituents in soil.

However, these humic substances have not been observed in soil. Although 'humification' theory is unsupported by evidence, [...] "the underlying theory persists in the contemporary literature, including current textbooks."

2500|$|A fire regime {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} fire and how it interacts with a particular ecosystem. Its [...] "severity" [...] is a term that ecologists use {{to refer to the}} impact that a fire has on an ecosystem. Ecologists can define this in many ways, but one way is through an estimate of plant mortality. Fire can burn at three levels. Ground fires will burn through soil that is rich in organic matter. Surface fires will burn through <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> that is lying on the ground. Crown fires will burn in the tops of shrubs and trees. Ecosystems generally experience a mix of all three.|$|E

2500|$|The American bison (Bison bison) once {{roamed the}} Great Plains grasslands in vast herds. [...] Their total {{population}} numbers were {{once in the}} tens of millions and spanned most of North America. [...] The bison was, in colloquial terms, the lawnmower of the grasslands, but their dwindling numbers have severely reduced their ecological impact. The bison’s large influence as a grazer, a major converter of plant to animal biomass, and a key link in nutrient recycling have been lost. [...] Their grazing habits were pivotal in allowing for the establishment of much of the biodiversity observed today in the region, including the prairie dog. Along with fire, bison were responsible for the removal of excess plant material that accumulated in the grassland. With the accumulation of <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>material,</b> seed germination is greatly hindered and biodiversity is held stagnant. The purging of excess biomass helped to promote and maintain biodiversity among plant species on the plains. [...] While the American bison once played a keystone role in both the establishment and maintenance of the Great Plain’s current biodiversity, the severely reduced population that still remains has little ecological effect on the Great Plains ecoregion.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we report, for {{the first}} time, the {{presence}} of glandular trichomes on leaf surfaces and petioles of A. ulvaceus. However, we found {{that none of the}} in vitro-cultured plants have trichomes. Likewise, leaf surfaces of in vitro-raised plants grown ex vitro remained glabrous. A marked difference observed was there were no detritivores (organisms feeding on <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>materials)</b> inhabiting the water in the ex vitro study, thus in vitro-raised plants were not damaged. The detritivores could have inflicted damage to live cells while feeding on <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> parts. It is, therefore, reasonable to speculate that the leaf trichome formation in A. ulvaceus is a response following damage caused by herbivory. In this regard, A. ulvaceus, that was previously glabrous, produces new leaves with trichomes that start developing in the third week of growth which may be favourable, as it increases resistance against herbivores (Dalin et al. 2008). This is similar to the resistance mechanism of several plant species whereby new leaves with increased trichome number or density are produced (Traw and Bergelson 2003; Björkman et al. 2008). Our finding provides the first evidence that such a response occurred in A. ulvaceus and further field studies addressing functional and adaptive significance of induced trichome development should be evaluated in the context of effects on tritrophic interactions and plant fitness under varying abiotic conditions.|$|R

50|$|To {{maintain}} this biodiversity, the flatwoods and scrub ecosystems require fire to help {{clean up the}} <b>dead</b> and dried-up <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> that after some time can completely cover the ground.

40|$|Infections due to Cryptococcus are {{a leading}} cause of fungal infections {{worldwide}} and are acquired as a result of environmental exposure to desiccated yeast or spores. The ability of Cryptococcus to grow, mate, and produce infectious propagules in association with plants is important for the maintenance of the genetic diversity and virulence factors important for infection of animals and humans. In the Western United States and Canada, Cryptococcus has been associated with conifers and tree species other than Eucalyptus; however, to date Cryptococcus has only been studied on live Arabidopsis thaliana, Eucalyptus sp., and Terminalia catappa (almond) seedlings. Previous research has demonstrated the ability of Cryptococcus to colonize live plants, leaves, and vasculature. We investigated the ability of Cryptococcus to grow on live seedlings of the angiosperms, A. thaliana, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Colophospermum mopane, and the gymnosperms, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir), and Tsuga heterophylla (Western hemlock). We observed a broad-range ability of Cryptococcus to colonize both traditional infection models as well as newly tested conifer species. Furthermore, C. neoformans, C. deneoformans, C. gattii (VGI), C. deuterogattii (VGII) and C. bacillisporus (VGIII) were able to colonize live plant leaves and needles but also undergo filamentation and mating on agar seeded with <b>plant</b> <b>materials</b> or in saprobic association with <b>dead</b> <b>plant</b> <b>materials.</b> The ability of Cryptococcus to grow and undergo filamentation and reproduction in saprobic association with both angiosperms and gymnosperms highlights an important role of plant debris in the sexual cycle and exposure to infectious propagules.

40|$|A well-controlled growth {{environment}} with {{plants that are}} not unduly stressed is essential for Arabidopsis molecular biology research. Even {{if they do not}} kill the plants outright, insect pests and microbial pathogens can cause subtle changes in gene expression or plant metabolism that affect experimental results. Therefore, regular scouting for infestations, frequent cleaning of plant growth areas, proper disposal of <b>dead</b> or diseased <b>plant</b> <b>material,</b> and controlled access to the greenhouses or growth chambers will help to make experiments more reproducible. Powdery mildew, a fungal pathogen, and arthropod pests, including aphids, thrips, fungus gnats, and spider mites, are the most common greenhouse problems. Biological control methods such as parasitoid wasps and Bacillus thuringiensis crystal toxin can be used to contain some insect infestations. However, if an infesta-tion gets out of hand despite reasonable precautions, insecticide or fungicide spraying by a licensed applicator may be necessary.
