Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their <b>front,</b> <b>rear</b> and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} udder and teat {{measurements}} on milk yield in Brown Swiss Cows were studied. The {{differences among the}} means for <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teat length, <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teat diameter, <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> udder height, distance between front teats and mammary type scores in different lactation numbers were statistically significant (P < 0. 001). <b>Front</b> and <b>rear</b> teat length, and <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> udder height after milking were higher than before milking. <b>Front</b> and <b>rear</b> teat diameter, distance between front teats, distance between rear teats and distance between <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teats after milking were lower than before milking. Furthermore, 305 -day milk yield and milk yield per milking were significantly positively correlated with distance between <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teats and mammary type scores before milking (P < 0. 001). The mean values before milking for <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teat length, <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teat diameter, <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teat udder height, distance between front teats, distance between rear teats, distance between <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> teats and mammary type scores at general lactation were 59. 45 and 49. 72 mm, 22. 14 and 21. 53 mm, 47. 96 and 47. 59 cm, 12. 29 cm, 7. 76 cm, 9. 58 cm and 23. 65, respectively. In conclusion, teat and udder measurements and mammary type scores significantly affected milk yield.

500|$|A low-wing, twin-engined, twin-tailed monoplane, the DIS was {{of mixed}} construction. The front section was built from duralumin, the middle section was a wooden {{monocoque}} and the rear section was steel tubes {{covered with a}} duralumin skin. The twin tails were wooden and had an electrically operated variable-incidence horizontal stabilizer. The elevators had duralumin frames, but were covered by fabric. The two-spar wing was made in three pieces. The center section was metal, but the outer panels were wooden with fabric-covered ailerons and veneer-covered Schrenk flaps. The wing had leading edge slats along two-thirds of its length. The main undercarriage retracted rearwards into {{the rear of the}} engine nacelles and the tailwheel retracted into the rear fuselage. The Mikulin AM-37 inline engines were slung underneath the wings with the engine oil coolers mounted in the outer wing panels. The air intakes for the engine superchargers were located in the wing leading edge. The pilot was provided with a glass panel {{on the underside of the}} nose to improve his downward visibility, and he was protected by armor up to [...] thick at the <b>front,</b> <b>rear,</b> sides and underside of his seat. The fuel capacity was [...] in two protected tanks behind the pilot, and another four in the wings.|$|E

The turret was designed to be removable so that it could be detached and transported inside the C-54 and reattached once on the battlefield. The loading took six men about twenty-five minutes, the unloading ten minutes. On top of this the aircraft required a proper airfield on which to land. However, the T9 was of the correct shape, weight and size to be carried inside a Hamilcar glider, suggesting that these dimensions had been chosen deliberately so that the tank could be transported inside a glider if required.|$|E

2500|$|In conclusion, Kurt Agricola {{was one of}} {{the very}} few commanders who tried to change the {{occupation}} policies that were the norm in Nazi–occupied territories and opted to minimize resistance by treating the population humanely instead of terrorizing it. According to historian Christian Hartmann, [...] "it is difficult to say" [...] if Agricola's stance stemmed from ethical values or from political necessity. Agricola's former chief of staff supported the former view, describing Agricola as a [...] "very humane, highly educated and extraordinarily capable man". Agricola's actions ultimately found recognition by his superiors, reflected by his decoration with the German Cross in Gold on 15 December 1943, a highly unusual award for rear area commanders, as the German Cross in Gold was typically awarded to commanders at the <b>front</b> (<b>rear</b> area personnel could receive, by contrast, the German Cross in Silver).|$|E

The Van (and its subsequent siblings) has MacPherson struts in front and semi-elliptic leaf springs in rear.

2500|$|The command {{structure}} followed the three-tier organizational structure.

2500|$|Introduced {{exclusively}} to Japan in July 1990, the Camry V30 carried forward the four-door sedan and a differently styled hardtop sedan. Like before, either shape could {{be had in}} a Vista branded variety with revised styling. Both bodies would also {{form the basis of}} enlarged wide-body XV10 versions from September 1991, aimed primarily at international markets. The V30 remained smaller than the XV10 to offer buyers a vehicle within the [...] "five-number" [...] registration category concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement for Japanese vehicle size regulations. The rules required a body width under , length under , and engines at or below 2000cc. Sedans in the wide-body format would sell overseas as the Camry XV10—identical to the smaller V30 in most respects except for the front- and rear-end styling grafted to an otherwise unchanged body and interior. Hardtop sedans would engender the luxury Lexus ES 300 (XV10), which again would couple the existing side profile with rehashed <b>front,</b> <b>rear,</b> and interior designs.

2500|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} the DMC-12 is its gull-wing doors. The common problem of {{supporting}} the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and a hydraulic pump in the Bricklin SV-1, although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DMC-12 features heavy doors supported by cryogenically preset torsion bars and gas-charged struts. These torsion bars were developed by Grumman Aerospace (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, PA) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors. A popular misconception of the DMC-12's gull-wing doors is that they require far more side clearance to open relative to ordinary side-hinge doors, such as when parked in a parking lot. In fact, the opposite is true: the DMC-12 requires far less clearance than side-hinge doors, and this can be physically demonstrated. This misconception of side clearance may stem from a misunderstood location of the hinge point of the doors by persons unfamiliar with DMC-12s. These doors, when opening, only require [...] clearance outside {{the line of the}} car, making opening and closing the doors in crowded spaces relatively easy. Much like the doors fitted to the Lamborghini Countach, the DMC-12 doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels. Additionally, the doors featured red and amber [...] "safety" [...] lights around the perimeter. These lights illuminated when the door was open and could be seen from the <b>front,</b> <b>rear</b> or side of the vehicle at night or low light situations.|$|E
