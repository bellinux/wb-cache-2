McNutt wrote that, [...] "Andy getting hit by a girl plays into the most weak, infantile parts of his character, and making Pam his accomplice was a complete non-starter." [...] Kratzer wrote, [...] "Don't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> the idea of Andy getting punched in the face by a female fifth grader isn't necessarily unbelievable or unfunny, it's just that it had so little relevance or realism {{that it was difficult}} to follow for more than five minutes and it constituted an entire plot line." ...|$|E

When asked about what his agent said, Favre responded [...] "I am (in shape), but I am no way considering playing...The stress level was much, much more (when I played)....The demands are, don't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> I want to win, but it's not a job." [...] A few weeks later, in late October, the St. Louis Rams called Favre after their starting quarterback Sam Bradford was lost for the season, but Favre declined their offer to bring him out of retirement.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett {{said that}} Michael {{falling in love}} with the chair model was [...] "a hysterical turn and {{highlights}} just how deluded Michael – and Dwight – can be". Fickett was critical of the [...] "parking" [...] storyline, saying that it was [...] "a bit over the top and runs a bit thin", but he did think that the scene at the end with Kevin was [...] "a sweet and genuine moment". Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly stated that, in relation to the previous episode [...] "Dinner Party", [...] "Last night's show took another approach. Don't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>wrong.</b> It was a blinder—but a totally different animal, so to speak." [...] D'Arminio went on to praise the dual plots of the episode.|$|E

500|$|THEM Anime Review's Carlos Ross said, [...] "The voice-acting is remarkable, the {{directing}} is solid, {{and music}} is quite competent. But the real kicker {{here is the}} animation quality, which actually equals (and sometimes exceeds) that of excellent television series like Vandread and Full Metal Panic...there is a remarkable amount of storyline; the plot is well-written and executed, and never {{gets a chance to}} be too drawn out. And Shinkai gives equal time to the slick action sequences and the well-handled, genuinely touching romance". IGN's [...] A.E. Sparrow said, [...] "While [...] was visually one of the best pieces of eye-candy I have seen in a year or so, it's ultimately a voice track over a sequence of pretty pictures. Don't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> it was absolutely beautiful, but it left me wanting more". Mania's Chris Beveridge commended ADV Films for obtaining [...] the original computer files that were used to create it. He said, [...] "the transfer here is simply gorgeous. Colors are amazingly lush and deep, saturated without bleeding. Cross coloration is non-existent and only a few very minor areas of aliasing occur. The only real 'flaw' that I could see with this transfer is during some of the panning sequences up and down, there’s a slight stutter that’s simply inherent in the materials". DVDs Worth Watching's Johanna Draper Carlson said, [...] "the character designs are familiar and uninspired, and the cross-cutting choppy".|$|E

[...] "I wish it wasn't done separately," [...] North said. [...] "Don't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> the mo-cap actors {{do a great}} job, but {{there will always be}} somewhat of a disconnect when it's done this way.

In her recap, she favored the Belle-centric storyline by giving it a B+: [...] "The upside, though, is a strong episode for Belle; Gaston is downright dishy (although still evil); and a Belle plot means more Rumple time, always welcome." [...] However, the other plotline garnered a C-: [...] "The main plot fared even better compared to the dumb B-plot, with Emma, Hook and Snow Scooby-ing up the place, with an enchanted elevator, a dream sequence, and what {{looks to be a}} wild goose chase that results in the discovery of Red/Ruby.

Jeff Ray, the Midwestern coach who hired Rouse, commented: [...] "I'm {{right in the middle of}} it, don't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>wrong.</b> But sometimes the things you see are pretty disgusting.

2500|$|In the {{spin-off}}, Bianca {{had fallen}} upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky {{embroiled in a}} drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fiancée Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> I had the time of my life when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now – the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish." [...] In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show [...] "rubbish".|$|E
