5|$|The Cracidae {{are large}} birds, similar in <b>general</b> <b>appearance</b> to turkeys. The guans and {{curassows}} live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas {{are found in}} more open scrubby habitats.

5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is the <b>general</b> <b>appearance</b> of {{an animal}} resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see.

40|$|Some New rice {{varieties}} (VUB) found adaptive {{grown in}} Lampung. However, the successful {{of the development}} of VUB is not only determined by its highness productivity, but a consumer preference is also an important indicator. The study of consumer preferences towards new rice varieties has been done in Tanjung Rejo village, Katon Sub District, Pesawaran District in January to July 2014. Varieties tested were varieties commonly grown by farmers, i. e. Situbagendit, Cibogo and Ciherang, whereas for the VUB were Inpari 9, Inpari 10, Inpari 14 and Inpari 15. Organoleptic test was conducted to determine consumer preferences for rice and cooked rice. For rice, the preferences tested were whiteness, aroma, shape and <b>general</b> <b>appearances.</b> Preferences of cooked rice were aroma, whiteness, flavor, texture and <b>general</b> <b>appearances.</b> Organoleptic tests on rice and cooked rice using a score from 1 to 5 : 1 = extremelly dislike, 2 = dislike, 3 = rather like, 4 = like, and 5 = extremely like. The number of panelists used as many as 20 people. Based on the results of organoleptic test on rice, panelists preferred the rice varieties of Cibogo and Inpari 10, compared to Situbagendit and Ciherang. Score of whiteness for Inpari 10 was 4. 24, aroma 3. 67, shape and <b>general</b> <b>appearances</b> was 4. 24 and 4. 05 respectivelly, while the scores of Cibogo 4. 29 for whiteness, aroma 3. 81, shape 4. 52 and <b>general</b> <b>appearances</b> 4. 38. The results of organoleptic test on cooked rice, indicating that the panelists preferred the Inpari 9, Cibogo and Inpari 14 compared to Ciherang and Situbagendit. Scores aroma given by panelist for cooked rice Inpari 9 was 4. 46, whiteness 4. 50, flavor 4. 29, texture 4. 29, and <b>general</b> <b>appearances</b> was 4, 29. This shows that people's preferences have shifted from rice that commonly grown such as Ciherang to the new varieties Inpari 9 and Inpari 10. </p...|$|R
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a <b>general</b> <b>appearance</b> that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the <b>general</b> <b>appearance</b> within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the <b>general</b> <b>appearance</b> of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in <b>general</b> <b>appearance.</b> The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|The {{color and}} <b>general</b> <b>appearance</b> of A.bisporigera {{are similar to}} those of A.verna and A.virosa. A.bisporigera is at times smaller and more slender than either A.verna or A.virosa, but it varies {{considerably}} in size; therefore size is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic. A.virosa fruits in autumn—later than A.bisporigera. A.elliptosperma is less common but widely distributed in the southeastern United States, while A.ocreata is found on the West Coast and in the Southwest. Other similar toxic North American species include Amanita magnivelaris, which has a cream-colored, rather thick, felted-submembranous, skirt-like ring, and A.virosiformis, which has elongated spores that are 3.9–4.7 by 11.7–13.4μm. Neither A.elliptosperma nor A.magnivelaris typically turn yellow with the application of KOH; the KOH reaction of A.virosiformis has not been reported.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{damage was}} {{widespread}} but generally mild. Although damage to mangroves was minor, the cyclone defoliated swaths of many coastal and island forests. For the most part, cays and reefs were unharmed, with no visible {{change in the}} <b>general</b> <b>appearance</b> or shape of reefs and little underwater change as well. It was noted, however, that water clarity surrounding certain reefs was poor. River plumes of the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Hull, Johnstone, and Mulgrave/Russell rivers were noticeably changed, with some paths diverted. The Herbert River plume expanded to encompass areas near the Greater Palm group of islands, the Mulgrave/Russell around the Frankland Islands. In addition, {{the loss of a}} raft system utilized for farming of giant clams was noted near Fitzroy Island. Tourist operations experienced little damage from Winifred, with only minimal damage on Dunk Island, Bedarra Island, and Mission Beach. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and $130million (1986AUD) in damage, and was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as the worst cyclone to strike Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971.|$|E

5|$|In <b>general</b> <b>appearance,</b> {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion that}} lemurs are unintelligent has been perpetuated by {{the view that}} the neocortex ratio (as a measure of brain size) {{indicates}} intelligence. In fact, primatologist Alison Jolly noted early in her academic career that some lemur species, such as the ring-tailed lemur, have evolved a social complexity similar to that of cercopithecine monkeys, but not the corresponding intelligence. After years of observations of wild ring-tailed lemur populations at the Berenty Reserve in Madagascar and as well as baboons in Africa, she more recently concluded that this highly social lemur species does not demonstrate the equivalent social complexity of cercopithecine monkeys, despite <b>general</b> <b>appearances.</b>|$|R
