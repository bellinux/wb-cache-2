40|$|<b>Escalations</b> {{refer to}} the actions taken when {{workflow}} activities, which constitute business processes, miss their deadlines. Typically, <b>escalations</b> increase the cost of business processes due to the execution of additional activities, the compensation of finished activities, or the intervention of highly-paid workers. In this paper, we present on-going research addressing workflow <b>escalations</b> and the cost associated with them. Our goal is twofold: (a) minimize the number of <b>escalations</b> during process execution and (b) reduce the cost associated with <b>escalations</b> when they cannot be avoided. To {{reduce the number of}} executions that result in <b>escalations,</b> we propose {{to keep track of the}} slack time accumulated during process executions and use it to adjust the deadlines (i. e., delay <b>escalations)</b> of the remaining activities. To reduce the cost of inevitable <b>escalations,</b> we describe an approach for predicting whether a process is going to escalate at some future point and, then, deciding wheth [...] ...|$|R

Fifteen weeks later Wilde was in prison.|$|E
5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an <b>escalation</b> into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E

In 1971, it became the School of Industrial Engineering with the academic title of Industrial Engineering, with specialties in Mechanical, Electrical and Industrial Chemistry, and with a studies duration of three years.

5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. <b>Escalation</b> typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. <b>Escalation</b> is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

By the time the cease-fire order was received, the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Korçë, making the city's Albanian garrison's surrender imminent.|$|E
5|$|The Korean War was an <b>escalation</b> of a {{civil war}} between two rival Korean regimes, each of which was {{supported}} by external powers, with each of the regimes trying to topple the other through political and guerrilla tactics. The conflict was expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War.

Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E
5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011.

5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the <b>escalation</b> of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E
