5000|$|There are {{two ways}} to record I-V curves in the manner {{described}} above. In constant-spacing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (CS-STS), the tip stops scanning at the desired location to obtain an I-V curve. The tip-sample spacing is adjusted to reach the desired <b>initial</b> <b>current,</b> which may be different from the <b>initial</b> <b>current</b> setpoint, at a specified tip-sample bias. A sample-and-hold amplifier freezes the z piezo feedback signal, which holds the tip-sample spacing constant by preventing the feedback system from changing the bias applied to the z piezo. The tip-sample bias is swept through the specified values, and the tunneling current is recorded. Either numerical differentiation of I(V) or lock-in detection as described above for modulation techniques can be used to find [...] If lock-in detection is used, then an A.C. modulation voltage is applied to the D.C. tip-sample bias during the bias sweep and the A.C. component of the current in-phase with the modulation voltage is recorded.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the machine}} {{does not have}} enough {{residual}} magnetism to build up to full voltage, usually a provision is made to inject current into the rotor from another source. This may be a battery, a house unit providing direct current, or rectified current from a source of alternating current power. Since this <b>initial</b> <b>current</b> is required for a very short time, it is called [...] "field flashing". Even small portable generator sets may occasionally need field flashing to restart.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "classic" [...] {{mechanism}} of vasomotion generation {{is thought to}} be the voltage-dependent coupled model. In this model, high gap junction coupling is present between the vascular smooth muscle cells, the endothelial cells and the endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cells. An <b>initial</b> depolarizing <b>current</b> leads to the opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels, ultimately resulting in synchronization of individual calcium levels. When patch clamp recordings are conducted, depolarization occurs in the endothlial layer {{at the same time as}} the underlying vascular smooth muscle. The cause of the <b>initial</b> depolarizing <b>current,</b> however, remains to be determined. Mathematical modeling has pointed to the existence of 2-4 independent non-linear oscillating systems interacting to produce vasomotion. It is possible that in order for vasomotion to be generated, these systems must pass a depolarizing threshold.|$|R

50|$|An NTC thermistor's {{resistance}} is high at low temperatures. When the circuit is closed, the thermistor's resistance limits the <b>initial</b> <b>current.</b> After some time current flow heats the thermistor, and its resistance changes {{to a lower}} value, allowing current to flow uninterrupted. It is inherently impossible for 100% of supply voltage {{to appear on the}} protected circuit, as the thermistor must continue to dissipate power (producing heat) in order to maintain a low resistance. The resulting voltage drop from the operating resistance, and the power consumption of the thermistor must be taken into account.|$|E

The genome of a child demonstrating epileptic encephalopathy was sequenced and revealed a de novo missense mutation, p.Asn1768Asp. The missense mutations in Nav1.6 increased channel function by increasing {{the duration of the}} persistent sodium current and prevented complete inactivation following hyperpolarization. 20% of the <b>initial</b> <b>current</b> persisted 100 ms after hyperpolarization resulting in hyperexcitability of the neuron and increasing the likelihood of premature or unintentional firing. In addition to epileptic encephalopathy, the patient presented with developmental delay, autistic features, intellectual disability and ataxia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice of}} {{reference}} electrode (liquid gate) or back-gate voltage determines the carrier concentration {{within the field}} effect transistor, and therefore its region of operation, therefore {{the response of the}} device can be optimised by tuning the gate voltage. If the transistor is operated in the subthreshold region then an exponential increase in current is expected for a unit change in surface potential. The response is often reported as the change in current on analyte binding divided by the <b>initial</b> <b>current</b> (...) , and this value is always maximal in the subthreshold region of operation due to this exponential amplification. For most devices, optimum signal-to-noise, defined as change in current divided by the baseline noise, (...) is also obtained when operating in the subthreshold region, however as the noise sources vary between devices, this is device dependent.|$|E
40|$|A {{barotropic}} model over an equatorial beta-plane {{is used to}} investigate the response when a uniform zonal current crosses an isolated hypothetical mountain centered at the equator. The bounded derivative initialization method is applied to suppress gravity-inertia motions. A quasi-stationary trough is generated {{at the top of}} the orography. Its intensity is greater in the easterly case than in the westerly case of the <b>initial</b> zonal <b>current.</b> A diagnostic equation is derived to interpret this difference in the solution. The quasi-stationary orographic divergence field which is positive on the windward slope and negative on the leeward slope (for both easterly and westerly cases of the <b>initial</b> zonal <b>current)</b> is responsible for maintaining the trough. The difference in the intensity of the trough is due to the contribution of the beta-u effect, which changes sign with the direction of the initial zonal flow...|$|R

5000|$|If the {{obstacle}} cannot be overcome, provided propagation {{is in the}} turbulent phase, the gravity current will first surge vertically up (or down depending on the density contrast) along {{the obstacle}}, {{a process known as}} [...] "sloshing". Sloshing induces a lot of mixing between the ambient and the current and this forms an accumulation of lighter fluid against the obstacle. As more and more fluid accumulates against the obstacle, this starts to propagate in the opposite direction to the <b>initial</b> <b>current,</b> effectively resulting in a second gravity current flowing on top of the original gravity current. This reflection process is a common feature of doorway flows (see below), where a gravity current flows into a finite-size space. In this case the flow repeatedly collides with the end walls of the space, causing a series of currents travelling back and forth between opposite walls. This process has been described in details by Lane-Serff.|$|E
5000|$|Many Wilson Electric {{vehicles}} were classified by their payload, which {{was measured in}} hundredweights, and this usage has been retained in the article. A hundredweight is one twentieth of a long ton or 51kg, and is abbreviated to [...] "cwt". In 1934 Partridge Wilson produced their first electric van, suitable for a payload of 5-6 cwt, and branded the Wilson Electric. It was fitted with a 29-cell, 129 Amp-hour battery manufactured by Exide Ironclad, and had a range of 35 to 40 mi, with {{a top speed of}} 16 to 17 mph. Speed control was arranged by switching of the motor fields and the battery cells, so that a starting resistance to limit the <b>initial</b> <b>current</b> through the motor was not needed. Early customers included the West Ham Electricity Department, who bought two standard chassis in 1934, which were fitted with streamlined bodies by Tomlinson (Marylebone) Ltd. They had a capacity of 5-7 cwt, and were powered by a 24-cell battery made by D P Kathanode driving a Metropolitan-Vickers motor. This arrangement gave a top speed of about 20 mph and a range of 50 mi.|$|E
5000|$|The DC motor was the {{mainstay}} of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and {{is connected to the}} field windings through [...] "brushes" [...] which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the commutator. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as [...] "series-wound". A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. Because of this, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to Ohm's law. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, resistors were used to limit the <b>initial</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
