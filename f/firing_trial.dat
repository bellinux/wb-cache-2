The chief project engineer of the rocket's assembly at the space projects division of Hawker Siddeley Dynamics was Dr Geoffrey Pardoe, also the project manager of Blue Streak from 1956 to 1960 (when under de Havilland). In August 1965, the Blue Streak was tested (static <b>firing</b> <b>trial)</b> with (complete full-weight) dummy upper stages at RAF Spadeadam (the site was owned by Rolls Royce), with first successful firing on 23 September 1965 lasting 135 seconds. Five days later the site was visited by the Minister of Aviation, Roy Jenkins.|$|E

[...] "'Our previous {{work in this area}} showed real potential for an enhanced gun system on the Navy's ships,' says Samir Patel, CORDA's business development director. 'This contract will allow more concentrated research and a live, land-based <b>firing</b> <b>trial</b> in 2009 will inform further developments on the programme'. The next step for the programme, subject to a successful trial and MOD requirements, will be a full scale technology demonstrator programme, leading to possible full manufacture and fit to the Future Surface Combatant and possible retrofit to the existing Type 23 Duke-class frigates and/or the Type 45 Daring-class destroyer." ...|$|E

50|$|Several {{unexpected}} events {{occurred during}} the course of this voyage, two of them near the outset. On April 25, 2007, the schooner ventured near a US Navy missile <b>firing</b> <b>trial</b> that was being conducted off the New Jersey coast. After United States Coast Guard personnel alerted the schooner, the crew diverted their course with no further mishap. A second, more serious mishap occurred on May 6, 2007 when the schooner ran into a container ship that left the schooner's bowsprit heavily damaged, though the hull and the remainder of the boat was unscathed. Stowe was able to make a replacement, albeit shortened, bowsprit from less-damaged portions. Following these incidents, the vessel spent much of the second half of 2007 in the Southern Atlantic, passing the tip of Africa in mid December, 2007.|$|E

The first <b>firing</b> <b>trials</b> of the DART ammunition bought by Colombia in 2012, were successfully conducted in the Caribbean Sea on August 29 from the 76/62 Strales inner-layer defence system fitted to its modernised FS 1500 Padilla-class frigates.|$|R
