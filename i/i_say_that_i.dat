Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E

[...] He said he tries to dispel [...] "false impressions" [...] created by opponents who want to make him out to be [...] "an intolerant bigot", but says [...] "I don't want to whine about it because it's what I chose to do" [...] to help improve Virginia. He says, [...] "I really mean it when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> intend to serve everybody. And I really mean it when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not have a hateful bone in my body for anybody," [...] though he admitted [...] "it may not always come across that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September, Opposition and Commonwealth Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook {{addressed}} {{parliament in}} support of conscription: [...] "There are some that {{do not believe in}} the compulsion of men, who say that Australia has done enough ... I hope there are few men in the parliament who believe that ... We are proud of what the Empire has done, and our contribution must be adequate, and in every way worthy of that effort ... To [...] now would be a national sin, a national calamity. As opposition leader, Cook had opposed almost no government measures throughout 1916, and Hughes and his faction were becoming increasingly distant from the bulk of the ALP and aligning much more with the conservative opposition. When the second reading of the Military Service Referendum bill was moved, it carried 46 to 10 in the House and 19 to 9 in the Senate. In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority. Hughes stared down his enemies within the party and committed himself fully to the campaign: [...] "For myself, <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going into this referendum campaign as if it were the only thing for which I lived." ...|$|E

And I said then, and <b>I</b> <b>say</b> now, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hope Mr. Neville {{may come to}} good, but I don’t believe he will.’ Here the cap vibrated again considerably.|$|R
6000|$|... "Does that matter?" [...] Jeanne {{answered}} calmly. [...] "Is it {{not sufficient}} if <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will not marry the Count de Brensault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I exaggerate nothing, my dear aunt, when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{write in}} great distress. Let me beg you to prepare {{yourself}} for very sad news.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Pardon me,' I answered, in German. 'What <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mean. The never-to-be-forgotten {{music of}} the Fatherland's-speech has on my infant ear from the first-beginning {{impressed}} itself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And don't {{you believe}} that I'm {{telling you the truth}} when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't, for all the world can give or take, change {{anything}} that's been?" ...|$|E
