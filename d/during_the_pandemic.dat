5|$|Max Beesley as Tom Price. Tom Price {{was serving}} a long prison {{sentence}} at Wandsworth prison when the virus struck. He escapes after killing the sole remaining guard {{and makes his}} way home, {{only to discover that}} his mother had also died <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Price's remorselessness and violent streak provide an element of friction within the group, though he is often proven right about the darker side of human nature. Largely through his relationship with Anya, Tom becomes quite loyal to the group. At the close of the second series (and the programme), Tom has secreted himself aboard a consortium aeroplane bound for parts unknown.|$|E

25|$|The plague struck various {{countries}} in the Middle East <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic,</b> leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease also entered the region from southern Russia. By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea. During 1348, the disease traveled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348–49, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread {{to the people of}} Asia Minor.|$|E

Finland's National Institute of Health and Welfare recommended that Pandemrix vaccinations be suspended pending further investigation into 15 reported cases of children developing narcolepsy. [...] In Finland in mid-November 2010, 37 cases of children's narcolepsy had been reported by doctors. This {{can be compared to}} the normal average of 3 cases of children's narcolepsy per year.

[...] In 2013, the link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy was confirmed by a registry study by the Swedish Medical Products Agency, with a three-fold increase in risk for people under the age of 20.|$|E
2500|$|To {{deal with}} the Spanish flu, In October 1918 Riggs ordered doctors to meet {{arriving}} steamships upon arrival to inspect for signs of the virus and that transport firms refuse passage to the territory by anyone who was ill. [...] The precautions were unsuccessful with the first case reaching Juneau on October 14 and widespread outbreaks being present a month later. [...] In response to the flu's arrival, Riggs established a cordon sanitaire on all trails to the interior, but unfortunately the couriers carrying announcements of the quarantine may have also spread the disease. [...] The native population proved especially vulnerable, with up to an eight percent mortality rate <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> [...] This left hundreds of orphans and entire villages who's populations were unable to perform basic activities such as prepare meals or chop firewood. [...] In response, Riggs exceeded authorized funding levels in his spending on medical supplies, maintaining the quarantine, and providing relief efforts. [...] The territory's financial situation was further complicated when {{a request for a}} US$200,000 special allocation was cut in half by the U.S. Senate and rejected completely by the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E

This paper develops an agent-based simulation model of a pandemic within a generic US metropolitan area, along with the effects associated with mitigation strategies involving home confinement and school closure. Also, a comparison of the two strategies and their variants is presented. ...|$|R
