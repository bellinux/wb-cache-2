In this thesis, two improvements to the process of core loss characterization of <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> are made. First, the characterization is made based on the anhysteretic rather than hysteretic (actual) flux density. This makes design predictions of losses more accurate, as such predictions are based on the anhysteretic fields. Second, the effects of test sample flux density nonuniformity on the characterization process are accounted for. ...|$|R

Corrosion of {{embedded steel}} reinforcing members {{is the primary}} cause of the deterioration of these structures. Many. er 1. he corrosion products are [...] ferrimagnetic and exhibit ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). This thesis describes the design, implementation and testing of two impulse radar systems that exploit FMR to detect and locate <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> and differenti- ate them from other targets: a free-space system and a transmission line analogue. A novel data processing software solution that interprets data acquired with the hardware systems is also explained. The software allows unequivocal detection and location of <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> and, in principle, the extraction of intrinsic materials parame- ters from radar signals. The efficacy of the technique and the software and hardware solutions are demonstrated using several synthetic samples. The free space system proves the concept of non-destructive detection and location of <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> while the transmission line analogue provides a powerful tool for ultra-wideband FMR metrology. Finally improvements to both systems are suggested along with additional potential applications. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The present work analyzes several phenomenological models of the magnetic dispersion and points out the common “denominator ” of the oscillations of the mesoscopic domains corresponding to the magnetization walls and to the elastic media grains, respectively.

50|$|<b>Ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> {{have high}} {{resistivity}} and have anisotropic properties. The anisotropy is actually induced by an external applied field. When this applied field aligns with the magnetic dipoles it causes a net {{magnetic dipole moment}} and causes the magnetic dipoles to precess at a frequency controlled by the applied field, called Larmor or precession frequency. As a particular example, a microwave signal circularly polarized {{in the same direction}} as this precession strongly interacts with the magnetic dipole moments; when it is polarized in the opposite direction the interaction is very low. When the interaction is strong, the microwave signal can pass through the material. This directional property is used in the construction of microwave devices like isolators, circulators and gyrators. <b>Ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> are also used to produce optical isolators and circulators. Ferrimagnetic minerals in various rock types are used to study ancient geomagnetic properties of Earth and other planets. That field of study is known as paleomagnetism.|$|R
5000|$|A {{single domain}} {{magnetic}} material (ex: magnetic nanoparticles) {{that has no}} hysteresis loop {{is said to be}} superparamagnetic. The ordering of magnetic moments in ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> decreases with increasing temperature. Ferromagnetic and <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> become disordered and lose their magnetization beyond the Curie temperature [...] and antiferromagnetic materials lose their magnetization beyond the Néel temperature [...] Magnetite is ferrimagnetic at room temperature and has a Curie temperature of 850 K. Maghemite is ferrimagnetic at room temperature, unstable at high temperatures, and loses its susceptibility with time. (Its Curie temperature is hard to determine). Both magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles are superparamagnetic at room temperature.This superparamagnetic behavior of iron oxide nanoparticles can be attributed to their size. When the size gets small enough (<10 nm), thermal fluctuations can change the direction of magnetization of the entire crystal. A material with many such crystals behaves like a paramagnet, except that the moments of entire crystals are fluctuating instead of individual atoms.|$|R
50|$|An {{electromagnet}} {{is a type}} of magnet {{in which}} the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of insulated wire wound into a coil. A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole {{in the center of the}} coil. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>material</b> such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.|$|E
5000|$|Much {{stronger}} {{magnetic fields}} {{can be produced}} if a [...] "magnetic core" [...] of a soft ferromagnetic (or <b>ferrimagnetic)</b> <b>material,</b> such as iron, is placed inside the coil. [...] A core can increase the magnetic field to thousands of times {{the strength of the}} field of the coil alone, due to the high magnetic permeability μ of the material. This is called a ferromagnetic-core or iron-core electromagnet. However, not all electromagnets use cores, and the very strongest electromagnets, such as superconducting and the very high current electromagnets, cannot use them due to saturation.|$|E
50|$|In the {{paramagnetic}} state, {{the individual}} atomic magnetic moments are randomly oriented, and the substance has a zero net magnetic moment {{if there is}} no magnetic field. These materials have a relative magnetic permeability greater than one and are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment drops to zero when the applied field is removed. But in a ferromagnetic material, all the atomic moments are aligned even without an external field. A <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>material</b> is similar to a ferromagnet but has two different types of atoms with opposing magnetic moments. The material has a magnetic moment because the opposing moments have different strengths. If they have the same magnitude, the crystal is antiferromagnetic and possesses no net magnetic moment.|$|E
