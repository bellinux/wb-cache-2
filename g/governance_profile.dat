Using a sample of 106 IPOs between 1999 and 2009, the results indicate that companies experience negative stock price reactions to the completion of an IPO in their industry on days leading up to and including the event date. The multivariate results show that in relation to corporate governance factors, both board size and CEO share ownership exhibit negative relationships with rival firm abnormal returns. Moreover, IPOs which disclose either investment, or both debt reduction and investment as the intended use of proceeds result in a greater negative price impact upon rival firms...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present how the {{paradoxical}} nature of the governance landscape in Denmark and strategic models and/or concepts of a normative character may be combined to develop the idea of a strategic governance model and typologies of this. This idea is central to a current PhD project. The methodology of this is also briefly presented in order to provide a complete picture of how research on the topic of strategic governance in a public sector setting is approached. With the project still in its early phase, this paper will only offer early indications of the analysis as oppose to findings or conclusions and instead focus on presenting the concept of strategic governance. Following a brief introduction, the paper will set out by discussing the concept of governance and <b>governance</b> <b>profile.</b> Second, the paper provides a brief discussion of strategic perspectives and schools, which will lead to how the concept of strategic governance may be conceived. Hereafter the paper elaborate on the methodology of the PhD research conducted before offering some early indications and closing remarks.

40|$|Globalization {{processes}} have rendered non-state actors {{an integral}} part of global governance. The body of literature that has examined non-state actor involvement in global governance has focused mainly on whether and how non-state actors can influence states. Less {{attention has been paid to}} the comparative advantages of non-state actors to answer questions about agency across categories of non-state actors, and more precisely what governance activities non-state actors are perceived to fulfil. Using unique survey material from two climate change conferences, we propose that different categories of non-state actors have distinct <b>governance</b> <b>profiles.</b> We further suggest that the different <b>governance</b> <b>profiles</b> are derived from particular power sources and that agency is a function of these profiles. The study thereby contributes to a strand in the literature focusing on the authority of non-state actors in climate governance and broadens the methodological toolkit for studying the “governors” of global governance.

40|$|From {{the agency}} perspective, {{literature}} studying links between investor protection and <b>governance</b> <b>profiles</b> argues that family is more disposed than other shareholders to divert private benefits {{in countries with}} a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the stewardship perspective, the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm. We do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family counterparts. Some evidence is found as regards the entrenchment effect: family CEOs seem to weaken firm performance. Stewardship attitude – not familiness – does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and increase risk-taking...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the market impact of {{initial public offerings}} (hereafter IPOs) on industry competitors as observed by their abnormal return behaviour around the event date. Prior literature commonly refers to this phenomenon as information transfer which is said to occur when a corporate event has wider implications for the competitors of the announcing firm. This thesis focuses on the pricing effects which Australian IPOs have on rival firms, with the primary research questions being {{whether or not a}} price reaction is evident, and if so, to what extent can this be explained. While previous studies address this issue by examining rival firm and industry factors, I extend on the literature by testing the effects of characteristics relating to the IPO firm itself. Specifically, the effects of the IPO firm’s corporate <b>governance</b> <b>profile</b> and the intended use of offer proceeds are examined to assess whether and to what extent they hold relevance in the process of information transfer. Using a sample of 106 IPOs between 1999 and 2009, initial results indicate that rival firms react negatively to the completion of an IPO on days leading up to and including the event date. Multivariate analysis shows that in relation to corporate governance factors, both board size and CEO share ownership exhibit negative relationships with rival firm abnormal returns. Moreover, IPOs which disclose either investment, or both debt reduction and investment as the intended use of proceeds result in a greater negative price impact upon rival firms. Finally, the results demonstrate that while IPO disclosure regarding investment has a greater negative impact upon rival firms, there is no ‘intensity’ dimension to this relationship i. e. it does not hold when a continuous variable is used which measures the dollar amount of intended investment...|$|E
40|$|Over {{recent decades}} {{there have been}} moves away from {{traditional}} forms of government towards broader practices of "governance". These moves are as relevant to the handling of natural hazards {{as they are to}} other societal concerns. Key characteristics of such changes include the emergence of multi-level governance processes, shifts away from the exercise of centralised authority towards the involvement and collaboration of a multiplicity of actors, the creation of new forms of authority and control, and changing distributions of responsibilities between the state and other actors. However, {{the extent to which these}} shifts have taken place across the varied national contexts in Europe and can be observed specifically in relation to the governance of natural hazards is not at all clear. Such developments may also be evaluated in different ways; where some might see progressive reforms, others might see damaging undermining of established arrangements. In this paper, we propose a risk <b>governance</b> <b>profiling</b> framework that can be used to draw out the key characteristics of the ways in which natural hazards are governed in a particular governance setting. The framework can be flexibly applied in relation to a specific hazard and national, regional or local context, and enables qualitative profiling across a spectrum of eight key governance characteristics. Past trends and likely future changes can also be represented. We discuss the formulation of this framework as well as giving examples of profiles for different hazards in different parts of Europe. We suggest ways in which comparisons can be made between <b>governance</b> <b>profiles,</b> providing a stimulus and focus for debate and discussion around the trends of change in governance practice that have been, and are continuing, to take place...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} clear divergences arise across the EU in how {{executive}} remuneration is structured. Sharp differences also {{occur in the}} adoption of best practices in pay-setting and in the disclosure of executive pay. These divergences are broadly in line, as agency theory predicts, with block-holding and dispersed ownership <b>governance</b> <b>profiles.</b> While the EU has recently adopted two important 2004 Recommendations on executive pay, the paper argues that EU-led reforms should be undertaken with care. Harmonization should be limited and only address disclosure. Disclosure {{is central to the}} adoption of effective incentive contracts in that it can manage the particular agency costs of executive pay, across dispersed and blockholding systems, without intervening in governance choices and structures. Any other interventions in the pay process carry the risk of distorting competition and interfering with the dynamics of different ownership structures and economic contexts...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{addresses the}} issue of enhancement of cultural landscapes, with reference to economic and business planning tools, measurement and control systems and their possible application to the territory. The cultural landscape is presented not as a cultural asset to be protected and preserved but as a complex and culturally homogeneous system, with social and economic implications in the local area. Complexity and systemicity towards the cultural landscapes require the usage of a multi‐dimensional and interdisciplinary approach to management, in order to coordinate the research and analysis directly concerning the landscape. As part of this work, therefore, the concepts of protection, conservation and enhancement are fundamental {{in the definition of}} tools and models for managing the landscape. Besides the management and <b>governance</b> <b>profiles,</b> the function of the management and of business principles are fundamental to coordinate all the different areas of work which, through a managerial approach, become mutually related to pursuit shared cultural values...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} {{the large number of}} listed family firms that operate in and {{contribute}} to the Italian economy, this paper tries to provide evidence and indications on their role in comparison with their non-family counterparts. The analysis adopts two perspectives. From the agency perspective, some recent literature on the links between investor protection and <b>governance</b> <b>profiles</b> argues that family members are more willing than other shareholders to divert private benefits in countries, like Italy, with a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the stewardship perspective, the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm: we do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family ones. Some evidence is found in relation to the entrenchment effect: in family firms with members as CEOs, the performance seems to be significantly lower. The stewardship attitude, and not familiness per se, does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and facilitate risk-taking, while extreme levels (i. e., on the one hand, widely held ownership in non-family firms, or ownership fragmentation among descendants in family firms; on the other hand, close ownership/boards or family members as CEOs) worsen performance...|$|R
40|$|Frame {{analysis}} {{was developed by}} Erving Goffman as a sociological concept, used for understanding how individual actors relate themselves to the world, creating coherent frames out of individual social experiences. We apply frame analysis in the emergent field of sociology of governance, using the example of low profile public issue of drug addiction in a specific local social and political context of a municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina, {{in order to understand}} the roles of governance actors and their social interactions in the attribution of meaning. We focus on mental organization of governance experiences related to drug addiction and the strategic involvement of different governance actors which use given frames. We discuss the importance of frame coherence and ways in which it can be achieved for the low profile issues.

5000|$|Anticipatory <b>governance,</b> or anticipatory <b>profiling,</b> is the {{practice}} {{used by the}} state to collect information and data about its citizens in order to assess events or behaviours in a predictable manner based on the knowledge gathered. Anticipatory governance is also a method of decision making that uses predictive measures to anticipate possible outcomes to then make decisions based on the data provided. Anticipatory governance is a system of governing that is made up of processes and institutions that rely on foresight and predictions to decrease risk and develop efficient methods to address events in their early conception or prevent them altogether.|$|R
40|$|The {{social and}} {{economic}} effects of high <b>profile</b> <b>governance</b> scandals such as the National Safety Council, HIH and Centro have triggered much debate, reform and research into predicting and preventing future failures. While this has meant director financial literacy is now recognised as a core capability required of each individual director, {{there has been little}} guidance on what this capability involves other than the very general statement of being able to 'read and understand financial statements'. This thesis presents the results of a Delphi study aimed at identifying the core concepts a director needs to master to be financially literate. Thirty-five experts drawn from accounting, education and practice agreed that to be financially literate a director must have a conceptual understanding of 24 basic accounting concepts and be able to independently apply this understanding to a strategic evaluation of the finances of the organisation they serve...|$|R
40|$|Around the world, public – private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) {{have been}} widely promoted as a model to expand the provision of critical urban transportation infrastructure. This paper examines {{the extent to which}} PPPs have actually been used to deliver urban transportation infrastructure, and whether this model of project delivery has redressed historically uneven patterns of global infrastructure investment. Through an analysis of over 950 transportation PPPs worldwide over the past quarter century, it is shown that only one third were projects built in urban areas. Of these urban projects, PPPs have been concentrated in the largest and wealthiest cities in a small number of countries, largely supported road projects rather than public transit, and been an unstable source of funding during periods of economic volatility. These uneven patterns of project development are explained by three interrelated factors: overlapping jurisdictions in urban <b>governance,</b> project risk <b>profiles,</b> and market interest. The paper concludes by reflecting on the theoretical and policy implications of these findings. ...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>profiles</b> of interorganizational <b>governance</b> of IT were {{obtained}} from interviews conducted with leaders involved in setting the governance mechanism needed to support successful IT collaboration with their business partners. Three attributes, based on literature from network governance streams, were used to uncover those profiles. They are the IT governance structure, the processes {{put in place to}} make decisions, and the roles of participants involved in setting the interorganizational <b>governance</b> mechanisms. Observed <b>profiles</b> share a continuum where the Contractual profile is at one end, and the Consensual profile is at the other end. Some performance variations among the two profiles exist, yet both profiles contribute to successful interorganizational relationships. These profiles were uncovered from seven case studies conducted in Canadian organizations. Through fifteen interviews with senior interorganizational IT governance committee members and IT executives, the critical IT governance mechanisms they employed were identified. Two cases are reported in this article, each one illustrating respectively the Contractual and the Consensual profiles...|$|R
50|$|The use of data {{in modern}} society brings about {{new ways of}} {{understanding}} and measuring the world, but also brings with it certain concerns or issues. Data scholars attempt to bring {{some of these issues}} to light in their quest to be critical of data. Rob Kitchin identifies both technical and organizational issues of data, as well as some normative and ethical questions. Technical and organization issues concerning data range from the scope of datasets, access to the data, the quality of the data, the integration of the data, the application of analytics and ecological fallacies, as well as the skills and organizational capabilities of the research team. Some of the normative and ethical concerns addressed by Kitchin include surveillance through one's data (dataveillance), the privacy of one's data, the ownership of one's data, the security of one's data, anticipatory or corporate <b>governance,</b> and finally <b>profiling</b> individuals by their data. All of these concerns {{must be taken into account}} by scholars of data in their objective to be critical.|$|R
30|$|The {{conception}} of port governance models evolves both {{in time and}} space because of the confluence of several elements: i) devolution, ii) corporate <b>governance,</b> iii) operational <b>profile,</b> iv) functional autonomy, v) functional pro-activeness, vi) investment responsibility and (vii) financial autonomy (see Verhoeven and Vanoutrive 2012). This evolution has intensified since the 1990 s, in line with the devolution programs developed all around the world. Those reforms sought to increase the transparency, optimize the resources and find new financial sources (Brooks 2004) 1. Additional and relevant changes for the port governance evolution are: i) the new paradigm of ports (nodes instead of places); ii) the need for ports to be competitive, flexible and efficient, iii) the internationalization of cargo handling firms, iv) the confluence of different port governance models into the same geographical area and v) a larger spatial scope of ports and a reduction of ties with the cities where they are located (Vanoutrive 2012). It could be concluded that port governance models are influenced {{by the size of the}} corresponding port authority (Verhoeven 2011), and evolve because of the socio-economic framework and the performance of ports (Brooks and Pallis 2008).|$|R
40|$|It is {{no small}} feat to develop a replicable, {{dependable}} information literacy rubric that is appropriate to an institution’s unique student population. But once the rubric is created, how does it become edited, adopted, and utilized by campus stakeholders to actually improve information literacy learning? And, {{what happens when you}} multiply this by a consortial context, wherein one information literacy rubric is presented to five undergraduate colleges and two graduate schools, each with unique <b>governance</b> models, assessment <b>profiles,</b> and relationships with the library they share? The visual nature of a poster will provide a perfect means to map out the different paths the rubric and its librarian advocates have taken at each of the Claremont College campuses. The schools represent a range of governance models from top down to consensus based to grass roots, and are at very different stages of outcomes-based assessment, a few already utilizing numerous evaluation methods while others are brand new to systematic assessment. Our insight into information literacy assessment and advocacy across different institutional structures will speak to librarians from primary to higher education contexts. While all institutions are unique, any librarian should be able to identify with one or more paths toward information literacy assessment integration, and transform this knowledge into successful campus information literacy assessment collaborations...|$|R
