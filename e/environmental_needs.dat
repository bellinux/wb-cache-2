According to the United Nations Development Programme, the latter is found more often to {{be the cause of}} countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and <b>environmental</b> <b>needs,</b> but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.|$|E

It served the <b>environmental</b> <b>needs</b> of the U.S. Army by facilitating the identification and clean-up of contaminants on training lands, due primarily to partially detonated explosives or unexploded ordnance (UXO). Other researchers addressed mobility issues with vehicles over snow and muddy terrain. CRREL researchers participated in defining tactical runway requirements for the C-17 military transport aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting <b>environmental</b> <b>needs</b> for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E

In 1992, the first UN Earth Summit resulted in the Rio Declaration, Principle 3 of which reads: [...] "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and <b>environmental</b> <b>needs</b> of present and future generations." [...] Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20).|$|E

Yet {{there has been}} very little empirical analysis of LEIs, and we know surprisingly little about their origins. In this article, the authors use a rational choice framework to examine the incentives and disincentives communities face in deciding whether to establish LEIs. In particular, the authors study the decision of communities to adopt local wet-lands bylaws under the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act. Using event history analysis, the authors find strong evidence that <b>environmental</b> <b>need,</b> economic attributes, and economic constraints have strong effects on the impulse of communities to adopt LEIs...|$|R
