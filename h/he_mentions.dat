5|$|The {{scene where}} Bela is seen walking towards his house after Ed drops him off, <b>he</b> <b>mentions</b> how Hollywood has changed its horror films {{and how they}} aren't {{what they used to}} be back in the 1930s. <b>He</b> <b>mentions</b> movies about giant bugs (Them!), giant spiders, (Tarantula) and giant {{grasshoppers}} (Beginning of the End), however these movies came out after when the scene was supposed to be set and after the release of Glen or Glenda.|$|E
5|$|Among {{many other}} things, he gave {{accurate}} {{descriptions of the}} four-chambered stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the dogfish. His accounts of about 35 animals are sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; <b>he</b> <b>mentions</b> the internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E
50|$|In {{the good}} side of things, <b>he</b> <b>mentioned</b> the car was a great way of making {{complicated}} vehicle construction much simpler, like having no transmission and just a throttle. Another thing <b>he</b> <b>mentioned</b> was that the propeller helped with decrease in tire wear, and the entire build helped with the mechanical layout. At the opposing spectrum, <b>he</b> <b>mentioned</b> that at any speed you're in, it always feels dangerous, and that hitting pedestrians up front and center with the propeller will kill them. <b>He</b> also <b>mentioned</b> that the experience feels much worse in an urban city.|$|R

5|$|Asser's Life omits {{any mention}} of {{internal}} strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when <b>he</b> <b>mentions</b> that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he {{makes it clear that}} Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|British mycologist Donald Dring, in his 1980 {{monograph}} on {{the family}} Clathraceae, wrote that C.ruber was not regarded highly in southern European folklore. <b>He</b> <b>mentions</b> a case of poisoning following its ingestion, reported by Barla in 1858, and notes that Ciro Pollini reported finding it growing on a human skull in a tomb in a deserted church. According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom a cause of cancer; they will usually bury specimens they find. In other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.|$|E

In this serial we see his daughter, Paula Quatermass, who works as an assistant at the Rocket Group, {{but there is no}} sign of a wife or other children.

5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} {{how to tell}} a good from a counterfeit preparation. <b>He</b> <b>mentions</b> the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience.

It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear, when you read the date in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.|$|E

5|$|There was mass {{unemployment}} among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary {{evidence shows that}} those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably. In addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies. <b>He</b> <b>mentions</b> grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.|$|E

5|$|Andy and Angela play Mad Libs, a phrasal {{template}} word {{game where}} one player prompts another {{for a list}} of words to substitute for blanks in a story, usually with funny results. Ryan chides Jim for being a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, a professional American football team. While Daryl is telling Michael how gang members deal with problems, <b>he</b> <b>mentions</b> that {{he was a member of}} the Newsies (the name of a 1992 musical drama) and The Warriors (the gang in the 1979 cult action film of the same name). Near the end of the episode, Michael does a succession of comedian impressions. These include badly performed spoofs of Rodney Dangerfield, Henny Youngman, Jeff Foxworthy, Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat, and Jerry Seinfeld.|$|E
5|$|Eric Church {{wrote the}} song with Jeff Hyde and Ryan Tyndell. The {{basis for the}} song came from a memory of a girl and {{involved}} another artist's song. Church chose to base the song around an idol of his, Bruce Springsteen, whose career he admires. During {{the course of the}} song, Church makes several allusions to Springsteen; <b>he</b> <b>mentions</b> the Springsteen songs Born to Run, Born in the USA, Glory Days, and I'm on Fire. While being named after Springsteen and making several references to him, the song however {{tells the story of a}} teenage romance.|$|E
5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (<b>he</b> <b>mentions</b> the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. <b>He</b> <b>mentions</b> other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{state that}} Deusdedit {{died of the}} plague that was {{prevalent}} in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after <b>he</b> <b>mentions</b> {{the outbreak of the}} plague, the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably bubonic plague. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. <b>He</b> <b>mentions</b> that the {{philosophers}} spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are generally more vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E
