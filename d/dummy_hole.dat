50|$|In {{order for}} the lock to operate, the key must be fully inserted, {{allowing}} the dual sidebars to enter the pins, provided the pins were raised to the correct height, thereby freeing the cylinder core for rotation. The cylinder does not use the traditional top- and bottom-pin combination, relying instead only on {{the holes in the}} side of the pins and pressure applied by the 12 springs above. Many pins have a <b>dummy</b> <b>hole</b> which will trap the sidebar pin if any turning pressure is applied to the lock with the pin in the incorrect position, preventing the lock from opening. Due to the lack of top pins, lock bumping is theoretically impossible; because bumping requires a moment in time when the two pins separate, and when this occurs and turning pressure is applied, the cylinder will rotate, thereby causing the lock to open. This bumping technique uses the principles of Newton's cradle.|$|E

It is {{found that the}} development of fracture network depends very sensitively on the geometrical settings (e. g. positions of empty <b>dummy</b> <b>holes</b> prepared for controlling crack propagation directions) in the blocks, and cracks extending from blast holes may tend to arrest on the (pre-) existing planes of weakness (e. g. interfaces between concrete material and reinforcing steel bars). This characteristic can be used to actualize more efficient and precise disintegration of a given structure, for instance, removal of reinforced concrete (RC) lining segments from the surroundings in an underground space. Optimal positions of blast and empty <b>dummy</b> <b>holes</b> for predictable and controlled dynamic destruction may be determined for each specific structure by the established simulation technique, which is effective for both conventional and modern dynamic disintegration methodologies, namely, fragmentation by blasting using explosives as well as by EDI...|$|R
40|$|Goal of {{this work}} is the {{characterization}} of flaws in cylindrical geometry exploiting Pulse Phase Thermography (PPT), a Non-Destructive Testing method belonging to the Infrared Thermography category. The experiments are conducted on a hollow semicylindrical Plexiglas pipe section, with an outer and an inner diameter, respectively, of 150 mm and 130 mm. Defects are simulated by 5 cylindrical <b>dummy</b> <b>holes,</b> whose diameter range between 2 and 8 mm. Two operations are necessary to reconstruct the actual conditions of the analyzed specimen: morphological operations are carried on to reconstruct its actual surface, due to the distortion of the acquired image; furthermore, an evaluation how the directional emissivity affects the measurements is conducted. A FEM model has also been implemented to extend the analysis on other type of defects...|$|R
500|$|Seven days of {{pre-production}} {{began on}} August 15, 1997. On the first day, Fleder met with Yoshimura and Fontana {{to discuss the}} script and the director's vision for the episode. Fleder suggested modifying the prologue, and storyboarded the introduction which {{was included in the}} episode. The new prologue involved commuters coming down to the train station while a street band performed, leading up to the subway accident before the opening credits rolled. The song featured in this prologue, [...] "Killing Time", was written by Lisa Matthews, the lead singer of the Baltimore-area band Love Riot. Matthews also had a brief cameo on [...] "Subway" [...] as one of the witnesses to Lange's fall. On August 16, the show creators scouted out the Johns Hopkins Hospital Metro Subway Station, where the episode was to be filmed. At the request of the authority, the subway was renamed the fictional Inner Harbor station during filming. Fleder himself had only one hour to scout the location with his technical crew. Art director Vincent Peranio created a dummy wall to place in the empty space between two subway cars, making it appear that the two trains were one big car. Inside the dummy wall was a space in which the actor could stand and appear cut. Stunt coordinator G.A. Aguilar also choreographed the accident that day, and Peranio simulated the accident itself by tying a <b>dummy</b> into the <b>hole</b> in the <b>dummy</b> wall. Peranio originally wanted a stuntman to fall against the moving train, spin and fall into the padded <b>hole</b> in the <b>dummy</b> wall, but the transit authority refused to allow it.|$|R
