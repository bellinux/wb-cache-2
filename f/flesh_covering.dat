50|$|Although {{clearly not}} the normal procedure, a bare T-888 endoskeleton {{was able to}} grow itself a new <b>flesh</b> <b>covering</b> using 2007 {{technology}} (with {{the assistance of a}} geneticist and its own knowledge of future formula) by submerging itself in a blood-like bath. This improvised process resulted in a deformed covering that had the appearance of a burn victim and lacked its own biological eyes, requiring it to steal those of the geneticist and subsequently undergo cosmetic surgery to produce a more normal appearance.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that Terminators' <b>flesh</b> <b>coverings</b> are somehow grown identically, {{producing}} many multiple copies of exactly the same physical appearance, indicating the use of specific physical templates for different variations of a model or series The most well known is that worn by multiple T-800/850 Model 101 units portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger; a scene in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles displays a memory of a T-888 model, referred to as [...] "Vick", facing a room (presumably in the factory where he was created) of several dozen units sharing an identical template to himself, naked and moving in unison to his direction. However, not all T-800's are made with an identical appearance, such as Cameron and the Terminator from the future bunker scene in the original movie.|$|R

The most well known is that worn by multiple Model 101/T-800/850 units portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as a T-888 model known as [...] "Vick Chamberlain" [...] having a memory of facing a room (presumably in the factory where it was created) of several dozen units sharing an identical template to itself, naked and moving in unison. [...] Some terminators' outer coverings are custom-designed to copy the appearances of humans whom they are intended to kill and replace. Three such examples in The Sarah Connor Chronicles include Carl Greenway in [...] "Automatic for the People", James Ellison in [...] "Brothers of Nablus" [...] and Cameron's pattern, Allison Young, in [...] "Allison from Palmdale".|$|R
50|$|It {{is unknown}} what manner of circulatory system, if any, is employed, nor what {{biological}} processes {{take place to}} sustain the <b>flesh</b> <b>covering</b> since T-800's do not eat food. At least some terminator models can consume sustenance. Cameron eats a corn chip in the Sarah Connor Chronicles pilot, and later {{a piece of a}} pancake. The liquid metal T-1001 is also shown to have this capability. The T-888s presumably consume food, given Vick Chamberlain's ability to maintain a human cover for years while married to a human woman. The organic covering was developed for the 800 series, and was its unique feature when first introduced. In the first film, Kyle Reese states that the 600 series were covered in rubber skin, which proved unconvincing and made them easy to spot.|$|E
5000|$|Terminator flesh heals by itself, {{and at a}} {{much faster}} rate than normal human tissue {{and has never been}} shown to bruise or discolor from trauma, even after several days. However, a Terminator's <b>flesh</b> <b>covering</b> can die if it sustains {{adequately}} massive damage without maintenance, at which point it takes on a waxy, corpse-like pallor and begins to decompose. In Terminator Genisys its shown that a T-800's covering ages; the Guardian is shown as having aged over eleven years and then a further thirty-three. By contrast, a T-888's undamaged flesh can remain un-aging for decades; Myron Stark immured itself for 89 years, emerging from its wall unchanged. In Genisys is it also shown that after the T-3000 threw a T-800 (credited as 'The Guardian'; nicknamed 'Pops') into a T-1000 type liquid, [...] "The Guardian" [...] attained characteristics and abilities of a T-1000.|$|E

This improvised process results in a deformed covering that has the appearance of a burn victim and lacks its own biological eyes, requiring it to steal some and subsequently undergo cosmetic surgery to produce a more normal appearance (While escaping detection from law enforcement as it was able to undergo this procedure without the use of pain medication). Whether or not this replacement flesh possessed the T-888's original flesh's un-aging properties, it appeared healthy despite the T-888's deactivation for many days. The theft of the eyes suggests that Terminator flesh is capable of accepting some degree of organ grafts from ordinary humans, that it can circumvent transplant rejection, and is capable of sustaining the life of the grafted tissue via its own unknown biological process.|$|E
5000|$|St. Giles {{was sold}} to James Jackson of Alabama in 1835 and {{exported}} to the United States in September of that year. In 1836 Jackson leased St. Giles to Colonel George Elliott of Tennessee who offered the stallions services at a fee of $60. He did not stand for the 1837 season because he was [...] "out of condition." [...] While at Elliott's farm for the season of 1837 - 1838, the normally docile St. Giles developed the habit of biting himself and tearing his own <b>flesh</b> after <b>covering</b> mares. To counteract this problem, sharp prongs were lashed to his sides to prevent him turning his head {{too far to the}} side. St. Giles made little impact as a sire and died before 1840.|$|R
40|$|Carcass {{records on}} 4749 bulls (from 153 sires) {{slaughtered}} {{at an average}} age of 20 months were collected from slaughter houses in the Netherlands. Bulls had a variable proportion of genes from Dutch Black and White (DBW), Dutch Red and White (DRW) and Pimontese (PIM). Additive genetic and crossbreeding parameters were estimated for fleshiness score (<b>FLESH),</b> fat <b>covering</b> score (FAT) and carcass weight (CWT) using three fixed models (additive breed, Dickerson and Kinghorn model) and the corresponding three mixed models with random sire effects. These models involved additive breed, heterosis (or dominance), and recombination loss (or epistatic loss) effects (i. e., crossbreeding parameters) as regression covariates. In addition, an additive sire group model was used as a mixed model. FLESH and FAT were defined numerical values ranging from 1 (poorly muscled; very much fat) to 15 (very muscled; very little fat). When comparing models, estimates of crossbreeding parameters over breeds and breed combinations showed similar patterns, although absolute values between the same parameters differed up to a standard error between fixed and mixed models and between Dickerson and Kinghorn models. Mixed models showed larger standard errors relative to fixed models. Relative to DBW, PIM showed significantly positive favorable breed effects for FLESH (ranging from 5. 8 to 6. 3 for different models) and CWT (62. 6 to 111. 8 kg), and unfavorable for FAT (− 1. 7 to − 2. 6). DRW showed favorable, but smaller than PIM, additive genetic effects for all three traits (2. 2 to 2. 3 for FLESH, 0. 1 to 0. 3 for FAT and 18. 1 to 24. 2 kg for CWT). Significant heterosis was only found for FAT (0. 4 to 0. 7) and for CWT (12 to 14 kg) in the cross DBW x DRW. Significant recombination and epistatic effects were obtained for CWT in the Dickerson and the Kinghorn models. Models not including non-additive effects over-estimated genetic variances and heritabilities for FLESH and FAT...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the quality of frozen broiler carcass sold in traditional markets of North Halmahera. Samples were taken from three traditional markets that selling frozen broilers and five sellers for each market were chosen. Three carcasses were taken from each trader replications. Macroscopic observation was done by seven panelists to asses 14 carcasses from each seller. Parameters observed were macroscopic characteristis of carcasses i. e. conformation, fleshing, fat cover, wholeness, discoloration, defeathering, color, and aroma of carcass. Physical characteristis determined were pH, cooking loss, water-holding capacity, and tenderness. Chemical composition included water, fat, and protein contents, and microbial quality consisted of total microbial, Coliform and Escherichia coli bacteria. Macroscopic characteristic data were assessed using descriptive analysis based on National Standard, whereas physical quality, chemical and microbial quality {{data were analyzed using}} analysis of variance completely randomized design. The differences between means, were tested using Duncan’s new Multiple Range Test. The results showed that the average macroscopic properties of conformation, <b>fleshing,</b> fat <b>covering,</b> wholeness, discoloration, defeathering and the colour of frozen broiler carcasses with score I, were 40. 41, 38. 16, 50. 41, 49. 80, 49. 59, and 50. 82 % respectively. Quality factor of the aroma/odor of a carcass with score II was 63. 47 %. The data of physical quality of broiler meat were as follow: pH 6. 16, cooking loss 21. 72 %, water-holding capacity 23. 01 %, and tenderness 2. 81 kg/cm 2. The chemical composition of broiler meat were moisture 71. 93 %, lipid 2. 50 % and protein 20. 11 %. Data of microbial quality of broiler carcass were total plate count 7. 1 x 105 cfu/g, and E. coli 0. 8 x 101 cfu/g, there was not any significant differences between the seller, however there was significant differences among the seller on the number of coliform (P< 0. 05). The conclusions of the experiment were that broiler carcasses sold in the traditional market in North Halmahera in respect of their physical characteristics and their chemical composition have not altered, whereas the microbial quality such as total plate count and E. coli number was still below threshold. Furthermore, coliform population was also below the maximum number allowed. (Key words: Traditional market, Broilers frozen, Physical characteristics, Chemical composition, Microbial quality...|$|R
5000|$|The March 1983 {{issue of}} Games Workshop's White Dwarf {{magazine}} (#39) presented the demigod Ggorulluzg, whom bullywugs revere as [...] "the chief amongst {{a number of}} monsters." [...] The article describes Ggorulluzg as chaotic evil in alignment, native to the Negative Material plane, and worshipped by bullywugs and degenerate humans. This [...] "dreadful lurker in shadow" [...] is described as resembling [...] "a breeding of octopus and giant frog; its body is much as the latter, but its head is bulbous and misshapen, with a soft beak, two great staring eyes, and six trailing tentacles." [...] If engaged in combat, Ggorulluzg will [...] "fix its loathsome gaze on a single individual", causing the victim to become paralysed with fear. The demigod attacks with claws and tentacles (sophisticated bullywugs claim the god bears an array of great iron axes), and non-edged weapons often bounce harmlessly off the soft <b>flesh</b> <b>covering</b> its skull. The article states that Ggorulluzg may be limited in acting personally on the Prime Material Plane {{by the power of}} a more powerful deity, so it sends giant slugs or leeches to intervene on its behalf.|$|E
5000|$|The flesh-covering {{that is used}} on the {{majority}} of Terminator models has similar qualities to real human muscle and skin, {{as well as the}} ability to sweat, simulate breathing, and produce realistic body odor. Although Terminator flesh does contain blood, it only displays minimal bleeding when damaged and has never been shown to experience any kind of profuse bleeding even from massive lacerations, dozens of gunshot wounds, or even complete removal. In the absence of a circulatory system, the flesh uses a system of [...] "nanobots" [...] which maintain the skin. It is unknown what biological processes take place to sustain the <b>flesh</b> <b>covering,</b> since Terminators do not require the consumption of food. Under 2007-era analysis, this blood is shown to be similar to human blood, using a synthetic oxygen carrier rather than human red blood cells, as Terminator endoskeletons contain no bone marrow. There is debate as to whether the T-800 is truly a cyborg, despite its claims it is so in the second film and its flesh/systems's organic characteristics, but it is shown it can function even when its organic systems are completely gone/dissolved, thus some argue that the T-800 is really a robot underneath an organic disguise, and that a machine with an organic covering does not truly constitute a cyborg.|$|E

40|$|By searching deserts {{around the}} world, Israeli {{scientists}} have found six fruit and nut trees that show promise as orchard crops for arid regions. The project began in 1984 and initially yielded 27 potential trees, but these have been narrowed down to Yehib (Cordeauxia edulis), Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana), Pitahaya Agria (Stenocereus gummosus), Mongongo nuts (Ricinodendron rautaneii), White Sapote (Casimiroa edulis) and Marula (Sclerocarya birrea). Marula grows in northern South Africa and Botswana where the wild fruits are {{an important source of}} vitamin C. The flesh of the fruit is juicy and aromatic and it is eaten fresh or processed. Inside is a very tasty, small nut. White Sapote comes from Central America where it is already grown in home gardens. The fruits have a creamy white, sweet flesh which has a green-yellow skin. Mongongo nuts grow on sandy soils between latitudes 15 and 21 degrees in southern Africa, including the Kalahari Desert. The fruit has a thin, green, edible <b>flesh</b> <b>covering</b> a hard walled stone. Inside the stone is a very pleasant kernel which is particularily rich in fats and protein. Scientists from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev have been growing the fruit trees on several sites m Israel where tolerance to a range of soils, temperatures and salinity are being assessed. Germination has been difficult to achieve as most of these plants have been adapted to hostile desert conditions. Generally, the trees have seeds with low germination rates, which staggers germination over several years and so increases their chances of germinating in favourable conditions. Transplanting has been another problem as the trees develop long tap roots very quickly. However, Professor Yosef Mizrahi and his team feel that with more time and research these fruit trees may provide arid land farmers with lucrative and sustainable fruit crops.
