5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which {{was taken from the}} film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E

The deliberate omission of each letter means that Fulgentius cannot use any word containing that letter for the entirety of that section. However, he varies this avoidance of words with his second technique of swapping omitted letters for other arbitrarily selected letters. These techniques obscure his language, making {{it very difficult for}} the reader to understand his meaning.

25|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Cvetkovich's book is “organized as ‘an archive of feelings,'” and is “an {{exploration}} of cultural texts as repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the texts themselves {{but in the}} practices that surround their production and reception.” According to Cvetkovich, archives of trauma resemble the archives {{of gay and lesbian}} cultures. Not only are ephemera, ephemerality, and memory fundamental to both of these archives, but both also challenge the very concept of the archive. Cvetkovich's sources – her archive – include oral interviews, performances, fiction, poetry, memoirs, photographs, and films. Theoretically, she engages with feminist, critical race, Marxist, and queer theory.|$|E
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|E

Here, butanoic acid was selectively conjugated to the secondary hydroxyl group of β-cyclodextrin through ester bond using sodium hydride as the deprotonation reagent.

In addition, his commitment to launching his Dark Horse record label had left Harrison rushing to finish the album while rehearsing for the concerts; as a result, he contracted laryngitis and sang hoarse on much of the recordings and throughout the tour.

500|$|The black {{wildebeest}} {{can maintain}} its body temperature within a small range {{in spite of}} large fluctuations in external temperatures. It shows well-developed orientation behaviour towards solar radiation which helps it thrive in hot, and often shadeless, habitats. The erythrocyte count is high at birth and increases till {{the age of two}} to three months, while in contrast, the leucocyte count is low at birth and falls throughout the animal's life. The neutrophil count is high at all ages. The haematocrit and haemoglobin content decreases till twenty to thirty days after birth. There is a peak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> all these haemological parameters at the age of two to three months, after which the readings gradually decline, reaching their lowest values in the oldest individuals.

500|$|Asturias blurs the {{separation}} {{between dream and reality}} throughout , {{making it one of the}} novel's most prominent themes. Latin American writer and critic Ariel Dorfman notes that the mixing of dream and reality is partly a result of Asturias's frequent use of figurative language. This stylistic choice is reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the story itself, which suggests that an important effect of dictatorial power is the blurring of dreams and reality. Dorfman also notes that the President is sustained by fear, which further blurs the distinction between reality and dream. This fear grants him the voluntary or involuntary support of others, enabling the President to exercise his mandates. Dorfman asserts that the President's use of fear elevates his mandates to legends. These legends are then able to [...] "impose itself upon reality because men live it fully in a way to make sense of their humanity". One example of this theme, elucidated by Eckart, is a series of scenes leading to the arrest of the lawyer Carvajal. When the President decides to blame Carvajal for the murder of Colonel Sonriente, it is clear that Carvajal is confounded by the charges. Moreover, despite being a lawyer, Carvajal is unable to defend himself during the sham trial with [...] "the members of the tribunal so drunk that they cannot hear him". As Eckart asserts, [...] "to be captured and tortured without ever knowing why is another horrible feature of a dictatorship. For the victim, reality unexpectedly becomes unreality, no longer comprehensible by a logical mind." [...] Therefore, the use of fear by a dictatorship blurs the line between reality and dream for the people being ruled.|$|E
