Windle's first event was the 4×100m freestyle relay, where he combined with Dickson, Peter Doak, and John Ryan to win Australia's heat {{in a time of}} 3min 40.6s, which lagged behind the United States' winning <b>heat</b> <b>time</b> by 1.8s. Windle anchored the team as Australia came from second at the halfway point to win their heat. The Australians were the second fastest qualifier for the finals. However, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6s in the final, but Australia could only improve their time to 3min 39.1s, leaving them third behind the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second place for the first two legs, until Germany moved into the silver medal position at the last change by 0.1s. A distance swimmer, Windle could not keep up with his German anchorman counterpart, and Australia fell 1.9s behind the silver medalists {{by the end of the}} race.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} {{parameter}} {{to be considered}} is the output frequency of the power source. As the heat is predominantly generated in {{the surface of the}} component it is important to select a frequency which offers the deepest practical penetration depth into the material without running the risk of current cancellation. It will be appreciated that as only the skin is being heated time will be required for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the component and that if too much power is applied too quickly it is possible to melt the surface of the component whilst leaving the core cool. Utilising thermal conductivity data for the material and the customers specified homogeneity (physics) requirements regarding the cross sectional ∆T it is possible to calculate or create a model to establish the <b>heat</b> <b>time</b> required. In many cases the time to achieve an acceptable ∆T will exceed what can be achieved by heating the components one at a time. A range of handling solutions including conveyors, in line feeders, pusher systems and walking beam feeders are utilised to facilitate the heating of multiple components whilst delivering single components to the operator at the required time cycle.|$|E

The experiment {{was carried out in}} a 5 × 4 × 3 factorial experiment using completely randomized design with three replications. Experimental factors were three levels of potassium humate (control, one and two parts per 1000 potassium humate), four wheat varieties (Shirodi, Darya, Morvarid and Chamran) and five <b>heating</b> <b>times</b> (zero, 48, 72, 96 and 144 hours).

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to predict the <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> and power consumption associated with the self-heating process of lithium-ion batteries at low temperatures. A temperature-rise model considering the dynamic changes in battery temperature and state of charge is thus proposed. When this model is combined with the ampere-hour integral method, the quantitative relationship among the discharge rate, <b>heating</b> <b>time,</b> and power consumption, during the constant-current discharge process in an internally self-heating battery, is realized. Results show that the temperature-rise model can accurately reflect actual changes in battery temperature. The {{results indicate that the}} discharge rate and the <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> present an exponential decreasing trend that is similar to the discharge rate and the power consumption. When a 2 C discharge rate is selected, the battery temperature can rise from − 10 °C to 5 °C in 280 s. In this scenario, power consumption of the heating process does not exceed 15 % of the rated capacity. As the discharge rate gradually reduced, the <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> and power consumption of the heating process increase slowly. When the discharge rate is 1 C, the <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> is more than 1080 s and the power consumption approaches 30 % of the rated capacity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rapid heat {{transfer}} methods {{can be used}} to speed up the baking process and create new product properties. This study investigates the effect of air jet impingement and infrared radiation (alone or in combina-tion) on crust formation of par-baked baguettes during post-baking. The parameters investigated are crust color, crust thickness, total water loss, and <b>heating</b> <b>time.</b> The results show that infrared radiation and jet impingement, as compared with heating in a conventional household oven, increased the rate of color development of the crust and shortened the <b>heating</b> <b>time.</b> The fastest color development was obtained by combining infrared and im-pingement heating. The water loss rate was increased due to the high {{heat transfer}} rate, but the total water loss was reduced because of the shorter <b>heating</b> <b>time.</b> Crust thickness was most dependent on <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> and crust temperature.

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} microwave <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> on the self-healing properties of fibre-reinforced asphalt mixtures. To this purpose, self-healing properties of dense asphalt mixtures with four different percentages of steel wool fibres were evaluated as the three-point bending strength before and after healing via microwave heating at four different <b>heating</b> <b>times.</b> Furthermore, the thermal behaviour of asphalt mixtures during microwave heating was also evaluated. With the aim of quantifying the efficiency of the repair process, ten damage-healing cycles were done in the test samples. In addition, self-healing results were compared with the fibre spatial distribution inside asphalt samples evaluated by CT-scans. Crack-size change on asphalt samples during healing cycles was also evaluated through optical microscopy. It was found that the <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> is the most influential variable on the healing level reached by the asphalt mixtures tested by microwave radiation.
