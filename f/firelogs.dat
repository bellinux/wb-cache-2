50|$|There are now {{a number}} of wood and wax <b>firelogs</b> made using {{renewable}} materials. These are made using plant or animal based renewable waxes such as palm oil. These logs can {{be considered to be}} carbon neutral <b>firelogs</b> during combustion as the carbon released on combustion is the same carbon absorbed when the plants are growing.Sulphur emissions are virtually eliminated with renewable <b>firelogs</b> as they do not contain paraffin waxes.|$|E
50|$|A firelog is a {{manufactured}} log {{constructed to}} be used as wood fuel. <b>Firelogs</b> are designed to be inexpensive, while being easier to ignite, and burn longer, and more efficiently than firewood. <b>Firelogs</b> are traditionally manufactured using two methods. The first uses only compressed sawdust and the second uses sawdust and paraffin, which is mixed and extruded into a log shape. The extruded <b>firelogs</b> are individually wrapped in paper packaging which can be ignited to start burning the firelog as the paraffin is readily combustible.|$|E

50|$|The {{materials}} {{used for a}} traditional <b>firelog</b> are variable, the sawdust used is often commercial wood waste from manufacturers, or waste agricultural biomass (nut shells, fruit pits, etc.); additionally bio-wax {{may be used in}} lieu of paraffin (petroleum-based wax).|$|R
50|$|The project also {{includes}} testing and monitoring methods of harvesting thickened (encroached) bush and design a scheme that {{is appropriate for}} farmland habitat and is beneficial to the landowners. CCF is developing an international market for bush-based products, Bushblok, that assures the long-term sustainability of appropriate levels of harvest. Within Namibia, CCF markets a <b>firelog</b> product as an affordable alternative to wood harvesting. Based {{on the results of}} the pilot project already conducted, habitat restoration efforts can be scaled up to restore cheetah habitat on an ecologically appropriate scale. This would also provide a long-term income-generating, self-sustaining conservation development project for the CCF.|$|R
50|$|Wood {{from the}} tree is {{commonly}} used to make fence posts, house beams, and <b>firelogs.</b> Also, the Guarijío prepare herbal tea, malo en el cuerpo (pain in the body), from W. mexicana, chamomile, and cilantro.|$|E
50|$|The low {{moisture}} content of about 10% {{leads to an}} energy content of around 5.0 kWh per kg {{depending on the type}} of wood. Green <b>firelogs</b> have a water content of around 50% with 2.5 kWh/kg energy content.|$|E

40|$|Oregon woodstove National Emissions Inventory (NEI) {{estimates}} {{have been}} elevated compared to neighboring states {{and most other}} areas of the country. This paper outlines the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s approach for estimating the 2002 annual residential wood combustion emissions by county; the method detailed here is a refinement of the DEQ NEI submittal, and reflects the most recent changes in EPA emission factor and heating device apportionment data. Two separate statewide surveys, completed in 1993 and 2000, were used to determine wood heating activity. A large component of the methodology consisted of estimating the mass of cord wood burned per housing unit for different areas in Oregon. An additional challenge was in calculating the distribution and number of wood burning device types by housing unit. Wood burning devices for the inventory include conventional, catalytic, pellet, and non-catalytic woodstoves, as well as fireplaces. Emission factors used are from a variety of sources, including AP- 42, EIIP, OMNI Environmental Services, and the 2002 NEI documentation. Estimated results show that statewide 2002 residential wood combustion emissions were approximately 44, 256 tons PM 2. 5; 216, 121 tons VOC; 295, 224 tons CO; and 4, 513 tons of NOX. The inventory does not encompass emissions from manufactured <b>firelog</b> combustion, or from wood-fired hyrdronic heaters, cook stoves, or masonry heaters...|$|R
50|$|Other {{new types}} of <b>firelogs</b> include one made from waste wax-cardboard such as that used in the packing of {{perishable}} foods for shipment, {{which is used to}} create a compressed cardboard firelog, and another made from renewable Greek cotton plants, offering a high energy content.|$|E
5000|$|The team added Tyler Dippel (#38 East West Marine/TyCar) and Hunter Baize (#13 Bicycle Playing Cards/Pine Mountain <b>Firelogs),</b> who {{competed for}} Rookie of the Year {{alongside}} Burton. Haley (#5 Braun Auto Group) returned in 2016 and ended {{the year as}} the 2016 series champion after winning 2 races, 2 poles with 13 Top 5's and finishing in the top ten in all 14 races, the only driver {{to do so in}} series history. [...] Dippel (1 win) finished 3rd in points, Baize finished 4th in points and Burton (1 pole) finished 7th in points.|$|E
50|$|A new cleaner firelog has {{now been}} {{developed}} using waste fibre from the oil palm fruit bunches of South East Asia. Unlike sawdust logs these burn with zero sulfur emissions. Also unlike sawdust logs, no trees need to be felled to produce these <b>firelogs.</b> While it is beneficial that the oil palm derived logs use waste fibre, the overall impact of palm oil plantations is problematic because vast areas of virgin tropical rain forest in Borneo and Sumatra are being clear cut {{to open up land}} for palm plantations. This activity directly threatens habitats of endangered species such as the orangutan.|$|E
5000|$|The late 8th {{century is}} the time of the {{spreading}} of the Homeric poems, the [...] "Iliad" [...] and the [...] "Odyssey". Funerary customs at Salamis and elsewhere were greatly influenced by these poems. The deceased were given skewers and <b>firelogs</b> in order to roast their meat, a practice found in contemporary Argos and Crete, recalling the similar gear of Achilles when he entertained other Greek heroes in his tent. Honey and oil, described by Homer as offerings to the dead are also found at Salamis, and the flames of fire that consumed the deceased were quenched with wine as it happened to Patroclus' body after it was given to the flames. The hero's ashes were gathered carefully wrapped into a linen cloth and put into a golden urn.|$|E
40|$|Air {{emissions}} {{from the use}} of wax-sawdust <b>firelogs</b> and cordwood in fireplaces were measured. The study was designed to operate the fireplaces during testing in a manner that simulated real-world use and to use the most common/typical appliance type, cordwood, and set-up. Standard air quality source testing and analysis methods were used. Results showed that emissions of key air pollutants associated with residential wood combustion were reduced in the range from 69 % to 90 % through the use of wax-sawdust <b>firelogs</b> in fireplaces. Particulate and carbon monoxide emission reductions documented in this study were consistent with previous studies. Emissions of the hazardous air pollutants of formaldehyde, benzene and polycyclic organic matter (POM), measured for the first time for <b>firelogs</b> in this study, were also significantly lower than for cordwood and their emission reductions were comparable in magnitude as seen for particles and carbon monoxide. The majority of the particulate {{emissions from}} both cordwood and <b>firelogs</b> were PM 2. 5, however, the fraction of the total particles that were PM 2. 5 were slightly less for <b>firelogs</b> than for cordwood, AIR EMISSIONS FROM RESIDENTIAL WOOD COMBUSTION Residential wood combustion (RWC) has been identified as a significant source of air pollutant...|$|E
40|$|Residential wood {{combustion}} (RWC) {{particulate emission}} inventories {{were prepared for}} the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) and the Coachella Valley portion of the Salton Sea Air Basin (SSAB) of California. Both the number of wood-burning appliances that were used and the number that were owned were estimated by category for the 2002 base year. American Housing Survey current housing reports for the Anaheim – Santa Ana, Riverside – San Bernardino – Ontario, and Los Angeles – Long Beach metropolitan areas were a key source of data. Other surveys conducted {{in the state of}} California, nationwide surveys, data from firewood vendors, and hearth industry records supplied supplemental data. The wood-burning categories were: (1) conventional pre-EPA certification cordwood heaters, (2) EPA certified catalytic cordwood heaters, (3) EPA certified non-catalytic cordwood heaters, (4) pellet heaters, and (5) cordwood fireplaces without inserts. The term “heater ” includes both freestanding units and fireplace inserts. The relative contribution of manufactured wax/fiber <b>firelogs</b> and cordwood used in fireplaces was also assessed. The average amount of fuel (cordwood, pellets, or wax/fiber <b>firelogs)</b> burned in each category of appliance was estimated from previous surveys conducted in California.

40|$|Abstract: Information 1, 7 found {{regarding}} {{these products}} was fairly old {{with very few}} independent studies to measuring the emissions. Environment Canada and the EPA (Region 5) collaborated in this study to analyze the contents of 5 types of wax <b>firelogs</b> and measure their emission characteristics. OMNI Labs was contracted to conduct the study, {{under the direction of}} James Houck. Most of the logs were manufactured by the two major producers of these products, The results of the study indicate that the wax used for these products had a high oil content. The results from the study indicate significant variations of metal content between the logs. This may be attributed to the wax and source of the wood fiber. The emission data indicated that the levels of particulate and chemicals such as PAHs are less than burning with cordwood but provided some interesting comparisons. This paper will describe the burning characteristics and emissions created from these logs and provide an update of the contents which can be expected when using these products. Introduction: This study was done to find out the current emissions from burning these wax fire logs and their composition. The information on these products was fairly old and som...|$|E

Asbestos was once referred to as the “miracle mineral ” for its ability to withstand heat. It was heavily used as a fireproofing and insulating material in ships, buildings and consumer products, including wallboard, roofing, flooring, cement, insulation, drinking water pipes, automobiles, clothing, paper, hair dryers, garden products, home appliances, artificial <b>firelogs</b> and children’s toys.
