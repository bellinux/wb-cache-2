[...] The following week Wright proposed the idea to Martin Luther King Jr., who subsequently organized the Poor People's March on Washington.

500|$|Prior to {{securing}} a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in {{artists such as}} Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: [...] "From a word, I can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis." [...] She considered her music {{as a form of}} poetry, citing the album track [...] "Hazy Shades" [...] {{as an example of a}} poem turned into a song.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book.

[...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot of big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants". However, it occurs in [...] and the sixth season episode, [...] "Giant Squidward".|$|E

More than once, that morning, did our hero regret he had not entered into terms with the Vineyard men, that the effort might have been made in company. There was something so portentous in a lone vessel's venturing within the ice, in so remote a region, that, to say the truth, Roswell hesitated. But pride of profession, ambition, love of Mary, dread of the deacon, native resolution, and the hardihood produced by experience in dangers often encountered and escaped, nerved him to the undertaking. It must be attempted, or the voyage would be lost; and our young mariner now set about his task with a stern determination to achieve it.|$|E
