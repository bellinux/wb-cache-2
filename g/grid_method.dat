The mathematical model for {{a description of a}} thermal field is based on the conventional Stefan approximation for the evaluation of phase change and the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation for convective flows of a melt. Two basic approaches for the solution of these problems with a free boundary (phase change interface) are considered.

40|$|In this thesis, the Defrise-Clack (DC) {{algorithm}} [4], {{an exact}} cone-beam reconstruction algorithm, was implemented in CUDA {{for the most}} common geometry used in x-ray C-arm CT systems (flat panel detector geometry). The implementation utilizes the forward <b>gridding</b> <b>method</b> with Kaiser-Bessel kernel to calculate the 2 D Radon transform efficiently. Furthermore, a complete image quality evaluation (resolution, noise and artifacts) was carried out on reconstructions from 29 different cone-beam data sets and with 196 different sets of reconstruction parameters (Ns,N&# 956;,W). The results were compared to the predominantly used cone-beam reconstruction algorithm, Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) [9]. To improve reconstruction speed, an alternative implementation of the Defrise-Clack algorithm with inverse <b>gridding</b> <b>method</b> was suggested. The inverse <b>gridding</b> <b>method</b> was originally designed to replace the 2 D inverse Radon transform [24], however, we showed that this method, with a small modication and without additional processing, can also replace the 2 D backprojection operation. The Defrise-Clack algorithm was then implemented in CUDA with the inverse <b>gridding</b> <b>method</b> and the same image quality evaluations were carried out. The inverse gridding implementation utilizes the same Kaiser-Bessel kernel with the same width parameter W as the forward gridding implementation. Results have shown that this method does not degrade image quality if {{the size of the}} Kaiser-Bessel kernel is large enough (W > 2). Results indicate that the Defrise-Clack algorithm provides reconstructions with signicant improvements over the short-scan FDK algorithm with respect to cone-beam artifacts. In addition, it was shown that both algorithms have the sameresolution-noise characteristics. </p...|$|R

40|$|This Project {{focuses on}} {{unstructured}} <b>grid</b> <b>methods.</b> Structured <b>grid</b> generators are {{most commonly used}} within the CFD field, where strict alignment of elements and very large aspect ratios can be required by the analysis code or necessary to capture physical phenomenon. Unstructured <b>grid</b> <b>methods</b> utilize an arbitrary collection of elements to fill the domain. Because the arrangement of elements have no discernible pattern, the mesh is called unstructured. These types of grids typically utilize triangles in 2 D and tetrahedra in 3 D. Given a good CAD model, a good mesher can automatically place triangles on the surfaces and tetrahedra in the volume with very little input from the user. The automatic meshing algorithm typically involves meshing the boundary and then either adding elements touching the boundary (advancing front) or adding points in the interior and reconnecting the elements (Delaunay). Tetrahedral unstructured <b>grid</b> <b>methods</b> will be discussed to give an idea as {{to figure out the}} effort done in the Project. Tri/Tetrahedral Meshing Triangle and tetrahedral meshing are by far the most common forms of unstructured mesh generation.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we propose a new path {{planning}} method for a robot manipulator in a cluttered static environment, based on lazy grid sampling. Grid cells are built while searching for the path to the goal configuration. The proposed planner acts in two modes. A depth mode while the robot is far from obstacles makes it evolve toward its goal. Then a width search mode becomes active when the robot gets close to an obstacle, and it ensures the shortest path to go around an obstacle. This method reduces the gap between pre-computed <b>grid</b> <b>methods</b> and lazy <b>grid</b> <b>methods.</b> No heuristic function is needed to guide the search process. An example dealing with a robot in a cluttered environment is presented to show the efficiency of the method...|$|R
