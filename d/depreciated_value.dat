2500|$|The British {{researchers}} Richard Harris & Stephen Drinkwater also {{highlighted the}} problem that the PIM {{does not account for}} premature scrapping. The reason is that a constant depreciation rate (based on average asset lives) is applied for the stock; a discrepancy therefore arises between <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> and scrap value (often statisticians also fail to track what happens to fixed assets that are got rid of, and therefore the assets can be counted twice in the same year). The mathematical problem is that, given a constant depreciation rate, the effect of overstated stock values in the data will increase cumulatively across a series of years, unless a special adjustment is made. Thus, Harris & Drinkwater's 2000 study of fixed capital in British manufacturing 1970–1993 (23 years) found that, if the effect of capital scrapping which occurs due to plant closures is ignored from the 1969 benchmark onward, then this will lead to a 1993 capital stock estimate for plant and machinery which is 44% larger than it is when an appropriate adjustment is made for premature asset disposals. Another depreciation measurement problem is the accelerating replacement of fixed assets, particularly of computer systems, affecting estimated asset lives and therefore average depreciation rates. These two factors alone could, according to a 1997 OECD paper, make a difference of 10% to the estimate of the annual capital stock for some UK industries. Dutch and French statisticians suggested that if capital scrapping is ignored, capital stock results obtained with the PIM could be up to 20% larger than they probably are. New Zealand statisticians acknowledge explicitly that [...] "PIMs may typically overstate the gross capital stock because of a failure to account for changing cyclical or accelerating rates of retirements". Although he is not a Marxist, Thomas Piketty usefully discusses many problems with the PIM. Unlike orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist academics, Piketty and Zucman did not use the PIM method to get a measure of the capital stock, but instead used book values and corporate equity at market value.|$|E
2500|$|Independent {{developer}} Vortex Media Arts {{was placed}} in charge of programming, art, animation, sound, script, and voice artists for the series. Meanwhile, as publisher, Creative Wonders {{was in charge of}} producing, testing, package design, documentation, online assistance, print activities, and consulting. Vortex Media Arts was formed by a 1993 merger of game design and programming technology company Strategic Visions (aka Creative Vision, founded in 1991), and art and animation company Lil' Gangster Entertainment, {{in order to create a}} stronger value proposition to publishers. Prior to the creation of Vortex Media Arts, Lil' Gangster Entertainment partner Jay Francis supervised the animated series of Madeline while working for DIC Entertainment as the shows' producer. Michael Pole was familiar with Lil' Gangster Entertainment through their work for Electronic Arts, as well as Virgin Interactive and Disney Interactive, but felt that while the company could take care of the animation work of Madeline, it was unable to produce an entire title in-house. After the merger however, Creative Wonders was able to obtain the Madeline licensing deal from DIC alongside the new company Vortex. Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, the premiere project of the Madeline video game series, was created on a budget of $500,000 and required 60,000 units to be sold to break even. It cost Vortex $300,000 to produce later Madeline video games, and they were paid through an [...] "advances against royalties" [...] deal, receiving an [...] "advance of $3 on a disc that sells for $20 wholesale"; at least 100,000 copies of a video game had to be sold before Vortex received a royalty. The company saved money during development through an advance called [...] "publisher's assistance", which meant [...] "equipment is essentially borrowed from the publisher"; and the publisher then had the right to [...] "repurchase the equipment at a <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> after the project is completed." [...] Many Vortex artists had previously worked on the DIC television series, so had familiarity with the characters and design, and therefore had a lower learning curve. The video game series used an established engine that had already been created by Strategic Visions/Creative Vision, which minimised the technology learning curve. With the money that was saved from the relatively low rights acquisition fee, plus these [...] "business and design caveats", Creative Wonders was able to publish video games with high quality on-screen elements for a cost well below the standard of the industry. [...] Nevertheless, without outside financing, [...] "overhead, salaries, and marketing" [...] costs made royalty reimbursement from the games slim.|$|E
60|$|The Secretary of the Treasury (Mr. Hamilton), {{it will be}} remembered, {{had been}} {{directed}} by Congress to prepare such a plan during its recess. In the one thus prepared, he asserted, what none were disposed to question, the propriety of paying the foreign debt according to its terms. He asserted, also, the equal validity of the original claims of the American creditors of the government; whether those creditors were the original holders of its certificates or subsequent purchasers of them at a <b>depreciated</b> <b>value.</b> The idea of any distinction between them, which some were inclined to advance, he repudiated as alike unjust, impolitic, and impracticable. He urged, moreover, the assumption, by the general government, of the separate debts of the States, contracted for the common cause, and that a like provision should be made for their payment as for the payment of those of the Union. They were all contracted {{in the struggle for}} national independence, not for the independence of any particular part. No more money would be required for their discharge as federal, than as State debts. He recommended, therefore, that the entire mass of debt be funded; the Union made responsible for it, and taxes imposed for its liquidation.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{regulatory}} {{changes on}} both sides of the border presented a grim panorama. On the American side, a new international radio agreement would diminish the coverage area of Mexican clear-channel stations by allowing American stations to set up shop on those frequencies; meanwhile, Mexico proposed changes to its broadcast law that would allow for operators to own their stations for 10 years, at which time the government would have the right to purchase a station for the <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> of its assets.|$|E
50|$|Very high {{interest}} rates, {{which can be}} extremely damaging to {{an economy that is}} healthy, wreaked further havoc on economies in an already fragile state, while the central banks were hemorrhaging foreign reserves, of which they had finite amounts. When {{it became clear that the}} tide of capital fleeing these countries was not to be stopped, the authorities ceased defending their fixed exchange rates and allowed their currencies to float. The resulting <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> of those currencies meant that foreign currency-denominated liabilities grew substantially in domestic currency terms, causing more bankruptcies and further deepening the crisis.|$|E
50|$|Swaziland enjoys {{well-developed}} {{road links}} with South Africa. Swazi Rail operates its railroads that run {{east to west}} and north to south. The older east-west link, called the Goba line, {{makes it possible to}} export bulk goods from Swaziland through the Port of Maputo in Mozambique. Until recently, most of Swaziland's imports were shipped through this port. Conflict in Mozambique in the 1980s diverted many Swazi exports to ports in South Africa. A north-south rail link, completed in 1986, provides a connection between the Eastern Transvaal (now Mpumalanga) rail network and the South African ports of Richards Bay and Durban. From the mid-1980s foreign investment in the manufacturing sector boosted economic growth rates significantly. Since mid-1985, the <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> of the currency has increased the competitiveness of Swazi exports and moderated the growth of imports, generating trade surpluses. During the 1990s, the country often ran small trade deficits.|$|E

5000|$|The cost {{approach}} was once called the summation approach. The {{theory is that}} the value of a property can be estimated by summing the land value and the <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> of any improvements. The value of the improvements is often referred to by the abbreviation RCNLD (for [...] "reproduction/replacement cost new less depreciation"). Reproduction refers to reproducing an exact replica; replacement cost refers to the cost of building a house or other improvement which has the same utility, but using modern design, workmanship and materials. In practice, appraisers almost always use replacement cost and then deduct a factor for any functional dis-utility associated with the age of the subject property. An exception to the general rule of using the replacement cost is for some insurance value appraisals. In those cases, reproduction of the exact asset after a destructive event like a fire is the goal.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{for example}} workers who take coffee beans, use a roaster to roast them, {{and then use}} a brewer to brew and {{dispense}} a fresh cup of coffee. In performing this labor, these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee. The worker also transfers the value of constant capital—the value of the beans; some specific <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> of the roaster and the brewer; {{and the value of}} the cup—to the value of the final cup of coffee. Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labor previously possessed to the finished cup of coffee So the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labor—this constant capital—and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the lease, the lessee is {{required}} to return the vehicle to the lessor, however most lease contracts have as the penalty for failing to return the vehicle a payment of the amount of the residual value to the lessor. In effect, this means the lessee can purchase the vehicle from the lessor at the residual value at {{the end of the}} lease. The residual value is a <b>depreciated</b> <b>value</b> of the vehicle defined by the contract, although because it is determined at the start of the lease, it may not be the actual market value of the vehicle. There will often be a term in the lease contract that requires the lessee to make good any shortfall between the residual and the market value of the vehicle. Since the residual includes GST and is not paid by the employer (resulting in a tax saving), it is beneficial to the employee have a lower residual value and to pay higher rentals during the lease. For this reason, residuals are usually set at or near the minimum allowed by the Australian Taxation Office. [...] In general this means that the market value of the vehicle exceeds the residual, resulting in additional benefit to the employee which is not subject to FBT.|$|E
50|$|The Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) {{was a major}} {{component}} of the ERTA and was amended in 1986 to become the Modified Accelerated cost Recovery System. The system changed the way that depreciation deductions are allowed for tax purposes. Instead of basing the depreciation deduction on an estimate of the expected useful life of assets, the assets were placed into categories: 3, 5, 10, or 15 years of life. For example, the agriculture industry saw a re-evaluation of their farming assets. Items such as automobiles and swine were given 3 year depreciation values, and things like buildings and land had a 15-year depreciation value. The idea was {{that there would be a}} rise in tax cuts due to the optimistic consideration of <b>depreciating</b> <b>values.</b> This would in turn put more cash into the pockets of business owners to promote investment and economic growth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plaintiff}} has {{to prove}} the elements of section 22, particularly that the use would likely <b>depreciate</b> the <b>value</b> of the goodwill of the claimant's mark.

50|$|S. 22 thus steps where {{confusion}} {{fails to}} tread.
