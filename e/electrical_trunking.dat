50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed to}} be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with a square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of 9 to 13.4 m and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.Nonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, <b>electrical</b> <b>trunking</b> and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.|$|E
40|$|Erectores spinae {{exhibit a}} period of <b>electrical</b> silence during <b>trunk</b> flexion from the erect {{position}} and return extension. This study defined {{the positions of the}} fingertips relative to the floor at the end-points of the period of myoelectric silence. These points are termed ‘critical 1 and were investigated in 15 male and 15 female young adults (x = 21 years). The two critical points were similar in terms of the fingertip- floor distance (, Y = 030 m) and significantly different from the maximally flexed position (x = 0. 04 m). There {{were no significant differences between}} the experi­mental groups in the flexed positions. Anthropometric differences had little effect on the measures. The fingertip-floor distance provided a good estimate of trunk and hip flexion but was a poor indicator of the degree of flexion of the thoracolumbar vertebral column...|$|R
40|$|We present {{methods to}} treat Low Back Pain (LBP) with {{electrical}} stimulation. The conventional method of treating LBP with electrical stimulation {{is based on}} mechanisms of reduction of pain. The method that we suggest uses <b>electrical</b> stimulation of <b>trunk</b> muscles at motor suprathreshold level synchronized with exercising of the trunk muscles. The hypothesis was {{that the combination of}} voluntary activity augmented with electrical stimulation would lead to higher levels of recovery of postural control and thereby, reduction of LBP. The electrical stimulation in this treatment was delivered with the lumbar belt with eight pairs of electrodes named Stimbelt. The outcome measures included: a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Oswestry LBP disability questionnaire, the SF- 12 health survey, and Manual Muscle Test (MMT). We specifically address the selection of the most appropriate statistical tests for the analysis of results. The analysis {{of the results of the}} clinical study indicates significant benefits of the addition of the Stimbelt to the conventional therapy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine how surface <b>electrical</b> stimulation of <b>trunk</b> musculature influences the kinematic, kinetic, and metabolic characteristics, as well as shoulder muscle activity, during wheelchair propulsion. METHODS: Eleven participants with spinal cord injury propelled their own wheelchairs on a dynamometer at a speed of 1. 3 m/s for three 5 -minute trials. During a propulsion trial, 1 of 3 stimulation levels (HIGH, LOW, and OFF) was randomly applied to the participant's abdominal and back muscle groups with a surface functional electrical stimulation device. Propulsion kinetics, trunk kinematics, metabolic responses, and surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of 6 shoulder muscles were collected synchronously. Kinetic, kinematic, and EMG variables were recorded during 3 time intervals (30 seconds each) within a 5 -minute trial. Metabolic variables were recorded through the entire 5 -minute trial. RESULTS: Participants with HIGH stimulation increased their gross mechanical efficiency (P=. 05) during wheelchair propulsion. No differences were found in shoulder EMG activity, energy expenditure, and trunk motion between stimulation levels. CONCLUSION: Functional electrical stimulation on the trunk musculature has potential advantages in helping manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury improve propulsion efficiency without placing additional demands on shoulder musculature...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{sclerosis}} is an {{autoimmune disease}} influenced by environmental factors. OBJECTIVES: The feasibility of a multimodal intervention {{and its effect}} on perceived fatigue in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were assessed. DESIGN/SETTING: This was a single-arm, open-label intervention study in an outpatient setting. INTERVENTIONS: A multimodal intervention including a modified paleolithic diet with supplements, stretching, strengthening exercises with <b>electrical</b> stimulation of <b>trunk</b> and lower limb muscles, meditation, and massage was used. OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to each component of the intervention was calculated using daily logs. Side-effects were assessed from a monthly questionnaire and blood analyses. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Data were collected at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. RESULTS: Ten (10) of 13 subjects who were enrolled in a 2 -week run-in phase were eligible to continue in the 12 -month main study. Of those 10 subjects, 8 completed the study and 6 subjects fully adhered to the study intervention for 12 months. Over a 12 -month period, average adherence to diet exceeded 90 % of days, and to exercise/muscle stimulation exceeded 75 % of days. Nutritional supplements intake varied among and within subjects. Group daily average duration of meditation was 13. 3 minutes and of massage was 7. 2 minutes. No adverse side-effects were reported. Group average FSS scores decreased from 5. 7 at baseline to 3. 32 (p= 0. 0008) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this small, uncontrolled pilot study, there was a significant improvement in fatigue in those who completed the study. Given the small sample size and completer rate, further evaluation of this multimodal therapy is warranted...|$|R
40|$|During {{wheelchair}} propulsion, {{in order}} to apply power to the pushrim effectively, shoulder and trunk stabilization is needed to control arm movements and the consequent transfer of power from the limbs through to the pushrim. Available trunk control {{may be one of}} the most important force-generating mechanisms during wheelchair propulsion, particularly when an individual is fatigued or propelling through a demanding situation. Consequentially it is a worthwhile pursuit to further understand and study the process of trunk muscle recruitment during propulsion and the effects of reduced trunk control on propulsion biomechanics. In the first of three studies contained in this dissertation is, trunk muscle recruitment patterns using surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes during wheelchair propulsion under different speed conditions. The results of this first study provided insight into the functional role of specific trunk muscles during propulsion. In the second study, a biomechanical analysis was utilized to examine the effect of functional electrical stimulation (FES) on trunk musculature during five minutes of wheelchair propulsion. The findings revealed that a trunk FES device could help an individual to generate more propulsion power and increase gross mechanical efficiency during wheelchair propulsion. Consequentially, a user with a trunk FES device may be able to more easily negotiate demanding propulsion tasks, ultimately improving quality of life. The third study investigated the influence of surface <b>electrical</b> stimulation of <b>trunk</b> musculature on shoulder muscle recruitment patterns during wheelchair propulsion. The results showed that trunk FES may help individuals to generate wheelchair propulsion power without placing additional demands on shoulder musculature. With trunk stimulation, the functional role of the shoulders may shift from stabilizers to a prime movers contributing more directly to propulsion. In the future, improvements can be made with advanced programming. A FES device could be better synchronized with the propulsion cycle to avoid continuous stimulation causing muscle fatigue. It would be ideal to provide stimulation during pre-push and early push phase of the propulsion cycle when trunk stability has been shown to be most critical. Individuals could potentially benefit from using FES more during challenging tasks of short duration, such as pushing up a ramp...|$|R
