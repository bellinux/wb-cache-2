40|$|As {{prices of}} single family homes rapidly {{increase}} in Toronto, many families {{are faced with}} a challenging dilemma: move beyond the city’s peripheries to where house prices are lower, or remain within the city and attempt to find suitable housing in multi-unit buildings. Recently, more families have been choosing the latter, yet discovering that the city offers very few affordable housing options suitable for families with children. This thesis is an exploration into why this is the case and a proposition for a possible solution. The exploration is broken down into two components: the political and economic framework of housing affordability and an urban and architectural analysis of design compatibility of housing for families with children. The findings suggest that a more comprehensive economic model is required, with consideration given to community land trusts and co-operative housing. Furthermore, a design approach which considers the amenities and diversity required by family life is seen to create a more inclusive built environment. The research culminates in a design synthesis - a proposal of a co-operative building on an existing parking lot in Bloor West Village. The proposed design of the Home for Urban Families is <b>exemplary</b> in <b>nature,</b> in that it displays a possible solution within the established framework of the thesis...|$|R

There are three main contradictions that {{make it difficult for}} teachers and students to engage in meaningful activities from which understandings result. The central issues in this book are framed in terms of three dichotomies that lead to tensions arising from the dialectic of opposing aspects of teaching and learning. First, there is a tension between learning as an individual process (cultural production) and as a cultural process (cultural reproduction). Second, there is a tension between science and technology (applied science). Finally, there exists a tension between children's interaction with nature and their language for describing and explaining <b>nature.</b> <b>Exemplary</b> case studies are featured that show the tremendous capabilities of elementary students to talk about technology and, in the process, to learn to talk science. These case studies are couched in an ongoing professional dialogue among the authors and the requirements to make such exemplary science happen in other classrooms...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{functioning}} transportation infrastructure are receiving {{more and more}} environmental and social concern nowadays. Nevertheless, preliminary corridor plans are usually developed {{on the basis of}} technical and economic criteria exclusively. By the time of environmental impact assessment (EIA), which succeeds, relocation is practically impossible and only preventative measures can be applied. This paper proposes a GIS-based method of delimiting motorway corridor and integrating social, environmental and economic factors into the early stages of planning. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are used to assess all possible alternatives. GIS-held weighted shortest path algorithm enables to locate the corridor. The evaluation criteria are <b>exemplary.</b> They include <b>nature</b> conservation, buildings, forests and agricultural resources, and soils. Resulting evaluation surface is divided into a grid of cells, which are assigned suitability scores derived from all evaluation criteria. Subsequently, a set of adjacent cells connecting two pre-specified points is traced by the least-cost path algorithm. The best alternative has a lowest total value of suitability scores. As a result, the proposed motorway corridor is routed from origin to destination. It is afterwards compared with an alternative derived by traditional planning procedures. Concluding remarks are that the location criteria need to be adjusted to meet construction requirements as well as analysis process to be automated. Nevertheless, the geographic information system and the embedded shortest path algorithm proved to be well suited for preliminary corridor location analysis.

60|$|Mavering {{could not}} worship enough this nobility of soul in her, and he celebrated it to Boardman with the passionate need of imparting his rapture which a lover feel. Boardman acquiesced in silence, {{with a glance}} of {{reserved}} sarcasm, or contented himself with laconic satire of his friend's general condition, and avoided any comment that might specifically apply to the points Dan made. Alice allowed him to have this confidant, and did not demand of him a report of all he said to Boardman. A main fact of their love, she said, must be their utter faith in each other. She had her own confidante, and the disparity of years between her and Miss Cotton counted for nothing in the friendship which their exchange of trust and sympathy cemented. Miss Cotton, in the freshness of her sympathy and the ideality of her inexperience, was in fact younger than Alice, at whose feet, in the things of soul and character, she loved to sit. She never said to her what she believed: that a girl of her <b>exemplary</b> principles, a <b>nature</b> conscious of such noble ideals, so superior to other girls, who in her place would be given up to the happiness of the moment, and indifferent {{to the sense of}} duty to herself and to others, was sacrificed to a person of Mavering's gay, bright nature and trivial conception of life. She did not deny his sweetness; that was perhaps the one saving thing about him; and she confessed that he simply adored Alice; that counted for everything, and it was everything in his favour that he could appreciate such a girl. She hoped, she prayed, that Alice might never realise how little depth he had; that she might go through life and never suspect it. If she did so, then they might be happy together to the end, or at least Alice might never know she was unhappy.|$|R

This is of particular importance when the model assumptions cannot be easily verified {{by the nature of the}} production system considered.|$|E

This subject was raised to answer the question whether the new social behavior can affect the classical principles of organization of space? In particular, can one affect the management of settlement units in the facilities of social services? Currently, in fact a man meets some of his needs in an unreal way (e. g., via electronic techniques), without any limits of distance, space (e. g., by means of transport), because of the development of social and economic life. - Propose planning solutions for mountain villages located in the Karkonosze, presenting opportunities for development or a stable existence.

This led to a selection of specific examples of the phenomenon of the social centers disappearance, shut down of service infrastructure, and on the contrary strengthen their local position. It was assumed that the combination of the contemporary image with their historical forms of settlement can help to find the synthesis of virtual and the real world. As a result of the analyze, it was found: - Elimination of the complementary network of services contributes to minimizing the village in the settlement system. New social customs may even intensify this state; - Gradual modernization of services leads to prosperity of settlement, using new media opportunities; - Reasonable use of potential space of information technology space can contribute to improved well- being and changes in the mountain village...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The article {{attempts}} {{to study the}} origin {{and development of the}} Mylaralinga tradition prevalent in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Goa. It tries to point out how this tradition has silently subdued the other religious traditions and stayed devoid of caste, community and class overtones. It highlights how this tradition accepts the reality of social philosophy, while stressing on folk music forms as the basis of elite music. By looking at certain ways of worship of Mylaralinga, it indicates a possibility of considering Mylaralinga’s epic on different grounds. It explains also how the poetry leaves an indelible impression on the audience about the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of man’s dynamic force and spiritual heroism.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the role of}} the case study as a form, with special reference to classical reception studies. It {{considers the}} history and theory of exemplification within rhetoric and within literary criticism (and other forms of writing), with due attention to the special place that classicism makes for the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of the antiquity of Greece and Rome—and thus the special place of such exemplification in the reception of antiquity by modern writers and thinkers. It concludes first that the exemplification of the case-study constructs specific models of temporality that construct the self as a historically located subject: thus we should be particularly aware of the politics of the case study, the dynamic of responsibility and response in taking the past {{as a model for the}} present. Second, it concludes that to construct a case study is to commit to a model of social epistemology—about what knowing the past is, how tradition and repetition are to be constructed. Thus, thirdly, a reader’s desire is always a constitutive but disruptive factor in the construction of the case study...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{negotiated}} end of {{the civil}} war in El Salvador was built around a double process of demilitarisation and democratisation. It {{put an end to the}} armed conflict while giving the guerrillas the chance to become a political party and participate in the elections. The <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of this process, from the military and institutional points of view, has however hampered the demobilisation of former combatants, soldiers, and guerrillas. Individual rehabilitation programmes, plagued by delays and poor implementation, have not allowed the former combatants to find a place in post-war society. These difficulties have been exacerbated by the memories of the years of conflict maintained by political actors of a very strong ideological opposition, marginalising the image of those in the ranks who actually fought. The mobilisation of former soldiers and guerrillas are therefore either controlled by political parties or repressed by the state. In post war El Salvador, which suffers from very high levels of violence linked to delinquency, it is particularly difficult for the role and actions of former combatants to be valued positively. It is equally difficult for them to develop a collective identity linked to their participation in the armed conflict...|$|E

Even the German government is convinced of the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of Dutch ethnic minority policies, as evidenced by last year's Zuwanderungskommission (Immigration Commission) report. But to what extent is Dutch policy really exemplary? On the surface, the situation in the Netherlands seems indeed to be better when compared to Germany and other European countries.

It is also impossible to doubt that, when interpolating in his Persiles (III. 6) {{the first part of the}} tale of the Polish Ortel Banedre, Cervantes is once more alluding to the humanist, namely to one of his Hecatommithi, which develops parallel narrative sequences (the sixth of the sixth Deca). After examining the triangular game created by 1) main narrator 2) secondary narrator 3) listener of the narration in the two texts, we can discover the deep reasons which generate visible effects on the superficial structure of meta-diegetic tale. Cinthio’s closed triangle which leads the listener towards the main narrator (who, this way, guarantees the reliability of the secondary narrator) determines and certifies the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of the tale of frogiveness in the version of the Italian writer. Cervante’s open triangle, on the contrary, which does not put in touch the listener with the main narrator (and, in this way, leaves the responsability of the related facts on the shoulders of the secondary narrator only) gives credit to and generates the deep changes that characterize version of the same tale...|$|E
40|$|Responses to Hurricane Sandy {{consistently}} cluster {{into two}} types {{according to how}} the issues have been defined and understood. On one hand, the crisis {{was seen as an}} extreme weather event that created physical and economic damage, and temporarily moved New York City away from its status quo. On the other hand, Hurricane Sandy exacerbated crises which existed before the storm, including poverty, lack of affordable housing, precarious or low employment, and unequal access to resources generally. A Tale of Two Sandys describes these two understandings of disaster and discuss their implications for response, recovery, and justice in New York City. The white paper is based on 74 interviews with policymakers, environmental groups, volunteer first responders, and residents affected by the storm; ethnographic observation; analysis of public reports from government, community-based organizations, and other groups; qualitative analysis of canvassing forms and data; and a review of the academic literature on disaster response. As a framing document, A Tale of Two Sandys selects certain case studies for their <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature,</b> including how different groups identified vulnerable populations, timelines for aid and recovery, a case study of housing and rebuilding, and finally, urban climate change politics. The primary purpose of A Take of Two Sandys is to propose a sophisticated, accurate, and useful way of understanding the inequalities entwined with Sandy’s aftermath and to enable ways to address them...|$|E
40|$|Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) {{programs}} {{function in}} {{countries around the}} world and usually transfer cash to the mothers of the beneficiary children in order to facilitate women's '~development' and '~empowerment. ' In most cases, the World Bank and the governments of the respective countries jointly operate these CCT programs. Since 1992, in Bangladesh, CCT programs operate via two broad education-based programs: the Female Secondary School Assistance Project (FSSAP) and the Primary Education Development Program (PEDP). Mainstream development thinkers and World Bank experts claim the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of these programs in achieving their objectives including: delaying the marriage age for girls, increasing school enrollment, enabling employability, and enhancing empowerment within the household. However, critical development thinkers have found sufficient evidence that, instead of developing and empowering women, CCT programs are using women as '~conduits of policy' or as '~workhorses' in the name of gender-based development. Based on fieldwork done in northern Bangladesh in 2014, guided by feminist qualitative methodology, and through the analysis of testmonios of 13 mothers of the beneficiary children and girls, the present study found no corresponding empirical evidence to suggest any improvement in the wellbeing of women. On the contrary, women recounted concerns with the low quality of their children's education, and experiences when the stipend money adversely affected them. This study concludes that CCT programs are at best ineffective in meeting the stated goals, and at worst, aggravating structural violence against women in Bangladesh. [...] Leaf ii.

40|$|The present {{literary}} {{production in}} France indicates {{the return of}} the subject, which has been proclaimed dead since the New Novel. With the proliferation of autobiographical texts in the nineteen-eighties, a generalized movement towards an aesthetic genre valuing this particularity was noticed. This proliferation renders the scope of this literary form immense. It covers a range from strictly historical texts, including autobiographies, memoirs and intimate journals to semi-referential texts, qualified as autobiographical fictions, "autofictions" or again "factual fictions". Midway between the autobiography and the novel, autofiction, this little studied literary practice, inaugurates a new writing form which we believe constitutes one of the boldest modern incarnations of the writing of the self. This thesis considers the possibility of a correlation existing in the problematics of autofiction and those of Jewishness in writing. Already off-centered, the Jewish writer, {{can be seen as the}} emblematic figure of the writer himself. Drawing on a corpus of four writers (Serge Doubrovsky, Marcel Benabou, Regine Robin and Patrick Modiano), we examine the structure, as well as its functionning rules, woven through texts sharing Jewish authorship. These writers pose, each from his own specific perspective, the problem of Jewishness in writing. This correlation brings to light the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of these texts with regards to the more generalized and thus far unprecedented strategy that is autofiction. The intersection of these historically marked problems, autofiction and Jewishness in writing, leads us inevitably to further reflection upon the tragedy of modernity, the Shoah and its omnipresent shadow in the works of our corpus...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand and Canadian {{courts are}} willing to reduce the {{liability}} of a fiduciary for breach of fiduciary duty {{to take account of}} the claimant’s contributory fault, whereas English and Australian courts are not. The picture is less clear as regards breaches of trust not involving a breach of fiduciary duty, such as merely careless breaches of trust. English courts have assumed that there is no scope in any case of breach of trust for reducing trustee liability to take account of the beneficiary’s contributory fault, but this paper demonstrates that there is no binding authority to that effect. In the absence of authority the matter falls to be determined as a matter of principle. There are a number of obstacles of principle in the way of apportionment of liability between trustee and beneficiary on the ground of contributory fault. One significant obstacle is the basic difference between the compensatory aim of tortious liability and the traditional aim of trustee liability to reinstate the trust fund by means of the action for account. Another is the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> of trustee liability, which favours the enforcement of trust obligations even where this might over compensate individual beneficiaries. Significant though these obstacles are, it is demonstrated that they can be overcome {{in the case of a}} careless breach by the trustee of a bare trust. In such a case there is no significant difference between the conceptual basis for, and remedies for, negligently caused harm in tort actions and actions for breach of trust. The trustee’s fault-based liability in such a case should therefore be capable of reduction to take account of the beneficiary’s own fault...|$|E
40|$|We offer {{comments}} on the eight works contained in the Special Issue, all of which use advanced methods for analysing interdependencies using variants of the Social Relations Model (SRM) or the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). After critically discussing the SRM and APIM as used in these works, we describe {{similarities and differences between}} these two approaches. We also discuss the substantive contributions of this collection and then offer our suggestions for future development of the two models. Developmental research is inherently a study of interpersonal interactions, yet researchers have too long been hampered by traditional analytic techniques that make assumptions about independence of cases. Fortunately, techniques that accurately model the interdependencies of group and dyadic contexts have been developed, including the Social Relations Model (SRM) and the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). The collection of eight articles in this Special Issue offer a rich representation of the manner in which interde-pendencies can be conceptualised and analysed in develop-mental research. In the following, we review and comment upon the analytic application of the SRM and APIM in the articles of this Special Issue. We then compare and contrast these two techniques. We will also comment on the substantive contribution of these articles, including how the conceptual focus on interdepen-dencies have allowed these researchers to answer questions that could not be considered using traditional individual-oriented approaches. Finally, we will offer our suggestions for future substantive and analytic work. As we begin our commentary, we note that there is no necessarily ‘‘right’ ’ way to analyse interdependent data; and the papers of this Special Issue present a range of analytic options, each with different advantages and foci. Although we address strengths and potential weaknesses, our aim is to highlight the <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> and substantial advances represented by these works...|$|E

Why would a double negative as the Christian Hero have eyes that come out of their orbits, bloated bellies, bent spines or disproportionate ears? Why would Hersent, the avaricious and usurious merchant woman of Aiol have such a swollen abdomen? Can we identify a corporal typology of vices? On the other hand, is a protuberance a sign of exclusion only, or could it also be the sign of some sort of predestination? Following this line of thought, how should we interpret the fact that Guillaume d’Orange, according to a textual tradition with contradicting versions, is called either “Guillaume au court nez” or “Guillaume au courbe nez”? And why would Berte have grand pieds? The examples proliferate in a direct proportion to those excessive signs, endowed with a strange autonomy that allows them to cling themselves simultaneously to the surface of the body and of the text and which, in doing so, draw a sort of second language (or a subliminal one) which defies interpretation as it clearly demonstrates that the body, far from being a simple receptacle of pre-codified signs is equally a semiological territory, a dynamic and complex space which can, in turn, produce unexpected signs and above all senses that place it in the crossroads of history, myth and the poetic imaginary...|$|E
40|$|The A. returns here to {{the celebrated}} problem {{of the status of}} {{mathematical}} objects, which for Plato, as seen by Aristotle, are said to be intermediary between sensible things and the Ideas. The A. seeks to show how the object of dianoia (comparison of the Line in Resp. VI) is neither an intermediary of this kind nor even a specifically mathematical Idea. With the support of the standpoint of Cherniss, the A. seeks, firstly, to show that any interpretation which identifies the object of dianoia with mathematical intermediaries adheres unquestioningly to the testimony of Aristotle, and presumes implicitly a Platonic esoteric doctrine. Then he takes up the four textual indications, which the partisans of this interpretation believe they find in the Dialogues, and discusses the relevance of these indications. Finally, he shows that the object of dianoia is an Idea in general and how mathematical Ideas only have a practical function and an <b>exemplary</b> <b>nature</b> in Plato. (Transl. by J. Dudley). L'A. revient ici sur le fameux problème des êtres mathématiques qui seraient, chez Platon et d'après Aristote, intermédiaires entre les choses sensibles et les Idées, pour tenter de montrer en quoi l'objet de la dianoia (texte de la Ligne, Rép. VI) n'est ni un tel intermédiaire ni même une Idée spécifiquement mathématique. En s'appuyant sur la position de Cherniss, l'A. tente d'abord de montrer que toute interprétation qui pose l'identité de l'objet de la dianoia et des intermédiaires mathématiques adhère sans examen au témoignage d'Aristote, et présume de façon implicite une doctrine platonicienne ésotérique. Puis il relève les quatre indices textuels que les partisans de cette interprétation pensent retrouver dans les Dialogues, indices dont il discute ensuite la pertinence. Enfin, il montre que l'objet de la dianoia est une Idée en général, et en quoi les Idées mathématiques n'ont qu'une fonction pratique et une nature exemplaire chez Platon. Fischer Franck.
