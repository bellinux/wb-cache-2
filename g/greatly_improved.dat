Through both private efforts and public initiatives like the Somali Diaspora Corps, they have participated in the renovation of schools, hospitals, banks and other infrastructure, and have played a leading role in the capital's recovery. They have also helped to propel the local real estate market.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s {{job losses}} due to {{industrial}} restructuring caused New York City, including Manhattan, {{to suffer from}} economic problems and rising crime rates.

The Hospitallers built new bastioned fortifications, such as the fortifications of Birgu and Valletta, and {{upgraded}} the medieval defences. By {{the end of the}} 18th century, Malta had extensive fortifications around the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett, as well as a coastal defence system consisting of towers, batteries, redoubts and entrenchments.|$|E

5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very decent ratings. However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the ratings had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings <b>greatly</b> <b>improved</b> and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E
5|$|Fusō {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1924. During {{the first phase}} of her first modernization, a catapult was fitted on the roof of Turret No. 3 and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. Fusōs ability to operate her aircraft was <b>greatly</b> <b>improved</b> during the second phase of her second modernization in 1940–41 when the aircraft handling equipment was moved to the stern and a new catapult was installed. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns from 1942 on.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{crafted a}} simple battle {{plan for the}} {{expected}} engagement. His ships would steam in column with his destroyers at {{the front and rear}} of his cruiser column, searching across a 300 degree arc with SG surface radar in an effort to gain positional advantage on the approaching enemy force. The destroyers were to illuminate any targets with searchlights and discharge torpedoes while the cruisers were to open fire at any available targets without awaiting orders. The cruiser's float aircraft, launched in advance, were to find and illuminate the Japanese warships with flares. Although Helena and Boise carried the new, <b>greatly</b> <b>improved</b> SG radar, Scott chose San Francisco as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly finding {{themselves}} in hot demand, the Daddies immediately started touring again. Spending {{the majority of}} 1998 and 1999 on the road, the band were playing close to 300 shows a year, carrying out both headlining and supporting tours of the United States while traveling internationally {{as one of the}} headliners on the 1998 Warped Tour beside Rancid, NOFX and Bad Religion. By this time, the group's touring conditions had <b>greatly</b> <b>improved,</b> thus enticing Dan Schmid – who had originally left the band due to health concerns – to return as the Daddies' bassist at Perry's request.|$|E
5|$|The 1,380-kW (1,850-hp) Shvetsov ASh-82 {{radial engine}} was {{proposed}} {{as a replacement}} to alleviate the shortage of engines and this modification went into production in late 1942. The exhaust arrangements of the ASh-82 were not compatible with the gun turrets {{in the rear of}} the engine nacelles and the guns were removed, reducing the aircraft's defensive capability. At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted in favor of a manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but reliability was <b>greatly</b> <b>improved.</b> Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.|$|E

5|$|The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) was {{a privately}} financed light fighter, {{designed}} and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop's F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that <b>greatly</b> <b>improved</b> overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} <b>greatly</b> <b>improved</b> {{handling}} characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were responsive to the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} whether {{to proceed with}} Zeus eventually fell to President John F. Kennedy, who became fascinated by the indecision surrounding the ABM system. In 1963, the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, convinced Kennedy to cancel Zeus. McNamara directed its funding towards studies of new ABM concepts being considered by ARPA, selecting the Nike-X concept which addressed Zeus' various problems by using an extremely high-speed missile, Sprint, along with <b>greatly</b> <b>improved</b> radars and computer systems. The Zeus test site built at Kwajalein was briefly used as an anti-satellite weapon.|$|E
