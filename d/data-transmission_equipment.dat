One vault can hold up to four nuclear weapons and in the lowered position provides ballistic protection through its hardened lid and reinforced sidewalls. The WS3 system allowed storage directly underneath the aircraft intended to carry the bombs. The location inside the aircraft shelter increased the weapon survivability in case {{of any kind of}} attack and prevent monitoring of preparations to use the weapons. The electronic systems include various classified sensors, electronic <b>data-transmission</b> and security <b>equipment</b> such as video, motion detectors, closed circuit TV coupled with thermal imaging devices. These facilities enabled remote controlled weapon safety and made the large security forces obsolete.|$|R
