The {{rheological}} properties of sealing slurries {{are very important}} at the stage of designing and realization of works related to the sealing and reinforcement of the ground rock mass {{with the use of}} drilling technologies. For providing high efficiency of the works related to the sealing of casing pipes in deep wells and the rock mass with borehole injection methods, the rheological parameters of sealing slurries should be selected depending on [1, 2]: — reservoir conditions of ground and rocks to be sealed, — geometry of borehole and circulation system, — interactions between the stream of injected slurry and the resulting flow resistance, especially in the sealed medium. The results of laboratory experiments focusing on the influence of time on the rheological parameters of fresh sealing slurries based on API Class G HSR - Black Label <b>drilling</b> <b>cement</b> (Dyckerhoff) for various water to cement ratios are presented in the paper.

30|$|In {{the field}} of oil <b>drilling,</b> <b>cement</b> slurry is usually used to {{reinforce}} the well wall to provide a stable and safe wellbore (Kelessidis et al. 2009; Kosynkin et al. 2012). To {{meet the requirements of}} cementing job, additives such as fluid loss agent (FLA) are used to improve performance of the cement slurry (Dugonjić-Bilić et al. 2011). FLA can control the loss of water from the cement slurry to porous formations and thus prevent the cement slurry from dehydrating. During the past few decades, various FLA including inorganic granular materials, modified natural polymers and synthetic polymers have been developed (Amani et al. 2012). Among them, synthetic polymers were widely studied due to satisfactory performance under complicated formation environment.|$|E

The selection of an appropriate recipe for sealing slurry is a challenge for the cementing services and research units. Both fresh and set slurry should meet a number of technological requirements. Various chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the ground and rock mass media to a different degree influence the technological parameters of the injected fluid. The sealing slurries have to meet certain criteria if the high efficiency of works is to be provided. The first of them is the criterion of physicochemical congruence with the environment. The second condition stems from the criterion of pumping the slurry. It is realized by selecting an appropriate rheological model and rheological parameters of the sealing slurry. The third requirement is connected with the need of providing suitable strength and durability of hardened sealing slurries {{as a result of the}} physicochemical processes. The fourth condition should account for the economy and ecology factors. The selection of recipes for sealing slurries should not be accidental or an output of unfniished laboratory tests. The correct sealing and reinforcing of the rock mass are prerequisites of further engineering works performed in the wellbore.

40|$|AbstractAlong {{with the}} {{development}} of low permeability reservoirs, underbalanced drilling technology is applied more and more widely.

40|$|In the {{construction}} {{of oil and gas}} well, improper displacement work (primary cementing job) may cause poor zonal isolation, cement channeling, remedial squeeze cementing, and thus lead to a severe problem. The leakage of the wellbore fluids and contamination of sensitive zones resulting from poor primary cementing job such as the Gulf of Mexico's oil spill in April 2010 has been the biggest disaster accidents for mankind history since then. The experimental flow system was developed for systematic study of both single-fluid flow and two-fluid displacement in eccentric annuli. This flow is relevant to the <b>drilling</b> operation and <b>cementing</b> operation in oil well completions, where drilling fluids are displaced from the annulus between the casing and the well bore by a series of spacer/wash fluids and cement slurries. The design of the system is based on the helical flow geometry, which is a combination of annular axial flow and tangential rotating flow in an annulus. The annular flow apparatus can be operated at various degrees of eccentricity and different angles of inclination to simulate the type of flows in oilfield <b>drilling</b> and <b>cementing</b> operations. A special feature of the flow system is that the inner pipe can be rotated during displacement, allowing the effect of casing rotation on the performance of the annular displacement process to be studied. Single fluid flow with various models of rheological fluids and displacement tests with various models of rheological fluids, especially viscoplastic fluids representing <b>drilling</b> and <b>cementing</b> fluids was conducted at different eccentricities, pipe inclinations, and over a range of flow rates and cylinder rotational speeds. Regarding the entire results of the displacement experiments, to our knowledge, the images of the moving fluid-fluid interface in annular displacement flow, especially with a rotating cylinder, generated in this work may be considered to be the world leading, since such visual information is not available in the open literature. In addition to flow visualization, the velocity of moving fluidvi-fluid interface in annular displacement flow was studied by measuring the conductivity of tested fluids. The result reveals the dynamics of displacement flow in annuli. A method was developed for simultaneously determining the displacement efficiency by measuring the conductivity of the mixed fluid phase exiting the annulus. The results obtained are of sufficient accuracy to be useful for assessing the effects of key variables such as pipe standoff, pump rate, pipe rotation and fluid rheology, on the effectiveness of annular displacement process. The relationship between the pressure gradient and the displacement efficiency has been established for the displacement process. The basic general mixing rule of a binary system occupied in term of pressure gradient may be illustrated. The pressure gradient of the mixture at any specific time of the displacement process may be illustrated by the equation comprising of the pressure gradient of each pure component in the mixture (in mass, mole, or volume fraction) derived from the results of the single-fluid flow experiments. Finally, the graph plots of the model prediction for the friction pressure gradient of the displacement process were shown, illustrating that the results from model equation collapses properly on the experimental result. To summarize, the results obtained in this work is useful for assessing the effects of fundamental variables such as eccentricity, pipe inclination, flow rate, pipe rotation and fluid rheology, that impact on the effectiveness of the annular displacement process. In particular, the flow visualization data, the velocity of moving fluid-fluid interface, the displacement efficiency, and friction pressure modelling results obtained from this project can be used to compare with, and validate, Halliburton’s 3 -D simulation CFD, implemented.
