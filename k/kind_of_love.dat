25|$|Pausanias, {{the legal}} expert of the group, {{introduces}} {{a distinction between}} a nobler and a baser <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>love,</b> which anticipates Socrates' discourse. The base lover is in search of sexual gratification, and his objects are women and boys. He is inspired by Aphrodite Pandemos (Aphrodite common to the whole city). The noble lover directs his affection towards young men, establishing lifelong relationships, productive of the benefits described by Phaedrus. This love is related to Aphrodite Urania (Heavenly Aphrodite), {{and is based on}} honoring one's partner’s intelligence and wisdom.|$|E
25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>love.</b> He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
