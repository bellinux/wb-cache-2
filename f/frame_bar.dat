Thus, when two boxes are stacked atop one another, there is exactly one beespace vertically between the frames. However, both top and bottom beespace designs may now be found in use.The roof shown in the MAFF leaflet is a telescoping cover, with internal dimensions of 18¾" [...] (476mm), meaning a relatively loose fit over the topmost box. The total height of the roof is (depending on timber thickness) around 6¼" [...] (160mm), though a 4" [...] roof is now also common.

40|$|Accurate {{identification}} of frames into concrete reinforced walls {{in a nuclear}} power plant was required because of maintenance labours. Several cuts in the concrete, including the frame, were planned. The cutting lines were designed to avoid as much as possible the <b>frame</b> <b>bars.</b> To perfom this work the ground penetrating radar has been used. The use of ground prenetrating radar techniques allow to determine the vertical and horizontal position of the <b>frame</b> <b>bars.</b> GPR detects also other reflectors in to the walls. The ele ctric propertie s contrast betw een the concrete and th e steel o f the frame gives reflections clearly detected in the records. This near surface study requires to use high resolution antennas with a very high center frecuency. The measurement precision required In the work was obtained using a special marker to carry the antenna, specially design for this job.

The 1854 India General Service Medal was awarded to soldiers over a 41-year period. Twenty-three clasps were created for this award, becoming one of the more extreme uses of this system. The British Naval General Service Medal, was authorised in 1847 with some 231 clasps (of which about 10 were never issued) for actions ranging from relatively minor skirmishes to certain campaigns and all full-fledged battles between 1793 and 1840.|$|R
