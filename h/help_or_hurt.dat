You'll hear and see these key scenes unfolding in front of you, but you'll be in the house, the car, the church, or the hospital as a close associate, rather than a bystander. You'll feel like an insider who's part of a great powerful narrative, and the feeling is eerily remarkable."

[...] He concluded, [...] "people looking for a perfect game will be disappointed [...] there are elements that totally stand out from any similar games in this genre, from the extortion system to the business take-over model. Despite obvious areas in need of improvement, I had a blast playing The Godfather." [...] GameSpy's Will Tuttle scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 3.5 out of 5.
