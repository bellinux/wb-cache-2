2500|$|The psephologist John Curtice wrote {{just before}} Corbyn's second {{leadership}} win: [...] "There is evidently {{a section of}} the British public, to be found particularly among younger voters, for whom the Labour leader does have an appeal; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not look like a section that is big enough, on its own at least, to enable Labour to win a general election". Meanwhile, a poll for The Independent by BMG Research, suggested that working class voters were more likely to consider Corbyn [...] "incompetent" [...] than those from the middle class, and a higher proportion thought he was [...] "out of touch" [...] also. Martin Kettle of The Guardian [...] wrote that [...] "many Labour MPs, even some who face defeat, want an early election" [...] to prove decisively that Corbyn's Labour is unelectable as a government. [...] "If there is hope for Labour it lies with the voters. Only they can change the party".|$|E

5000|$|He Frank {{proceeded}} {{to fall apart}} before our very eyes. His style that everyone loved was melancholy, very tuneful things. He started doing things that were completely impenetrable. They were basically about psychological angst, played at full volume with lots of thrashing. I don't remember a single word of them, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not work. There was one review that said he belonged on a psychologist's couch. Then shortly after that, he hightailed it back to Woodstock again, because he wasn't getting any work.|$|R

Djawadi continued, saying, [...] "The great power of music is that something subconsciously happens {{when you listen to}} a piece of music, even if you don't pay full attention to it. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> something to us that nothing else can do, other than music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Christian Broadcasting Networks Chris Carpenter wrote, [...] "the album {{features}} several radio friendly songs {{including the}} debut single Losing but something {{gets lost in}} translation. Thematically, The Struggle explores the challenges of life and how Gods grace consistently delivers us {{from the depths of}} despair. Frontman Mike Donehy, an emerging voice in contemporary Christian music, has crafted a set of lyrics that are powerful and strong but sometimes feel disconnected from the musical arrangement. Perhaps the addition of two new band members into the creative mix finds them in a transitional period of sorts that is reflected on this record. … The lyrics are strong, the music is well crafted, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not come together in the end." ...|$|E

The station was then owned by National Telefilm Associates, a New York-based television distribution company which he organized in 1954; he subsequently became the president and chairman of the board for the company. National Telefilm Associates, which won praise for being innovative, distributed the series, for which Landau was primarily responsible. In a 1959 interview, he said: [...] "With this I'm bucking the trend.
