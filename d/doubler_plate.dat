50|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} of the metal fatigue is contained in pictures that were taken during a routine inspection of the plane years before the crash.

The Boeing technicians fixing the aircraft used two separate splice plates, one with two rows of rivets and one with only one row when the procedure called for one continuous splice plate (essentially a patch or <b>doubler</b> <b>plate)</b> with three rows of rivets to reinforce the damaged bulkhead. The incorrect repair reduced the part's resistance to metal fatigue to about 70% compared to the correctly executed repair. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the one splice plate which was specified for the job was cut into two pieces parallel to the stress crack {{it was intended to}} reinforce, [...] "to make it fit". This negated the effectiveness of one of the rows of rivets. During the investigation, Boeing calculated that this incorrect installation would fail after approximately 10,000 pressurization cycles; the aircraft accomplished 12,318 successful flights from the time that the faulty repair was made to when the crash happened.|$|E

A direct design process by a structural designer was added to this developed optimized system to increase the design efficiency and provide a way of directly inserting a designer's decisions into the design system process.

This study compares the clinical results in single locked plating versus dual plating (DP) using two incision approaches. Our hypothesis was that DP leads to less collapse and change in alignment at final followup compared with single plating.

40|$|In this paper, {{the data}} {{reduction}} equations for common delamination toughness tests are rederived {{for use with}} specimens which have bonded doublers. The common toughness tests considered here are the double cantilever beam (DCB) for mode I toughness; the end notch flexure (3 ENF) and 4 point ENF (4 ENF) for mode II toughness; and the mixed mode bending (MMB) test for testing under combined mode I and mode II loading. Because {{the addition of the}} doublers changes the bending stiffness of the specimens, these data reduction equations may need to be corrected. Doublers were added to the delamination test specimens to solve a premature failure problem. Delamination toughness is normally tested using a beam with an imbedded insert so that one end of the specimen is split into two arms. If the specimen is too thin, or if the toughness of the material is too high, an arm of the specimen may fail in bending before the delamination grows. When this occurs, the toughness of the material cannot be determined. To delay the bending failure so that delamination growth occurs, doubler plates were bonded to both top and bottom surfaces of the specimen. A doubler parameter, beta, which describes how much the use of doubler plates changed the ratio of full thickness to delaminated bending stiffnesses, was defined. When changes to the data reduction equations were required, the changes were minor when written in terms of the beta parameter. The <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> technique was demonstrated by measuring the mixed-mode fracture toughness of a carbon-carbon composite using test specimens which would otherwise have failed before delamination growth occurred.

40|$|In general, fatigue is a {{very common}} type of failure in tubular joints. The fatigue life for tubular joints is {{expressed}} {{in terms of the number}} of stress cycles they can sustain. Therefore, an accurate method of converting structural loads to local joint stresses is useful for fatigue life prediction. This is usually done by first converting the global structural loads to loads on individual structural members and then translating the loads on the members joining at each joint to local stresses around the joint. The former can be achieved in a relatively simple fashion using beam-element models. The second step is more conveniently performed by using parametric equations for stress concentration factors that convert nominal beam stresses to hot spot stresses around the joint. Many sets of stress parameter equations have been derived for tubular joint during the last two decades. Except for the present study, all these equations can be used to predict hot spot stress concentration factor for simple tubular joints without considering the effect of extra stiffness. This is partly because developing different parametric equations for every possible reinforcement geometry is impractical. In fact, in certain instances of field repair, the reinforcement may not even be visible and its exact nature unknown due to loss of past records. The present study has introduced a joint dynamic parameter that will represent the stiffening effect of the reinforcement without essentially having to know the exact nature of the reinforcement. This study has developed a new and novel method to calculate Stress Concentration Factors using parametric functions of not only the basic geometric functions but also parameter representing extra stiffening provided by various means such as <b>doubler</b> <b>plate,</b> gussets, etc. The application of this concept is demonstrated and proven through detailed finite-element analysis of a wide range of joint and reinforcement geometries. Shell element models are used to calculate the Hot Spot Stresses around the joint as the basis to derive the parametric equations. The non-dimensional dynamic joint parameter introduced in this study can be calculated in most instances by using standard techniques of experimental modal analysis without needing to know the nature and details of the reinforcement. This is especially useful in those cases where the exact nature of reinforcement is not known, for example, hidden in the interior or deteriorated through age or fabrication error...|$|E

Two of them were treated with <b>double</b> <b>plates</b> and four with antegrade intramedullary nail. According to the Neer’s classification, all proximal fractures were two-part surgical neck fractures. All humeral shaft fractures were located at the middle of one third.

All surgical neck fractures except one united uneventfully in the average time span of 8. 7 weeks. Four humeral shaft fractures healed in near anatomic alignment. The remaining two patients had the nonunion with no radiological signs of fracture healing. The average University of California, Los Angeles End-Results (UCLA) score was 23. 1.

40|$|Supermartensitic {{stainless}} steel pipelines {{are used in}} {{the oil and gas industry}} mainly to transport oil and gas products from wells to offshore installations or even to shore. Most of these pipes are installed by the reeling process, involving up to 3 % plastic strain of the pipe wall during installation. Supermartensitic {{stainless steel}}s are a relatively new group of alloys that contain 11 - 13 % chromium, 2 - 6. 5 % nickel and 0 - 2. 5 % molybdenum. They contain less than 0. 015 % carbon. In comparison, more common martensitic stainless steels contain 0. 1 - 0. 2 % carbon. The decreased carbon content increases the weldability of the steel by reducing the hardness in the heat affected zone and reducing carbide precipitation. This work has investigated the most typical failure mode of supermartensitic stainless steel pipelines in the oil and gas industry. Published results of failure investigations have revealed that this failure mode is hydrogen induced cracking in the weld coarse grained heat affected zone. The hydrogen source is either weld consumables or hydrogen developed on the steel surface because of the negative potential induced by the cathodic protection system. In the latter instance, the cracks have typically appeared in the toe of the fillet weld that attaches the sacrificial anode connection <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> (anode pad) to the pipe wall. The objective of the present work was to investigate the influence of the microstructure on the hydrogen cracking susceptibility of two typical pipeline supermartensitic stainless steels. The work has concentrated on the coarse-grained heat affected zone because this is the typical crack initiation point. The hydrogen cracking susceptibility was tested by tensile testing notched steel samples under varying conditions. Three different sets of tensile tests have been carried out. All specimens were subjected to weld heat affected zone simulation using a Smitweld simulator. All samples were first heated to a temperature close to the melting temperature in order to create a microstructure that is typical of the coarse-grained heat affected zone. Some samples were also subjected to a second heat cycle representing an adjacent second weld pass. The peak temperature of this second heat cycle was varied. The tensile test samples were machined after simulation with a 1 mm deep notch in the simulated zone. Two different materials were used throughout the testing, designated steel A and B. Both were rich grade supermartensitic stainless steels typical of the pipeline steels used in the North Sea. The distinct difference between them is that steel A is alloyed with titanium in order to avoid selective corrosion along previous austenite grain boundaries, while steel B is not alloyed with titanium. The first set of samples were tested without any influence of hydrogen and monitored during testing in order to investigate any tendency of local cracking during straining. After the tensile tests these samples were subjected to light microscopy and hardness testing in order to characterise the microstructure of each sample. The second peak temperature was found to have an impact on hardness. A second heat cycle to 500 - 550 oC resulted in an increase in hardness; while a second heat cycle to 625 - 650 oC decreased the hardness. The second set of samples were charged with hydrogen in 3. 5 %NaCl electrolyte prior to tensile testing in order to investigate the tendency for hydrogen embrittlement from hydrogen present in the material prior to straining. This is similar to the case in which hydrogen is introduced through the welding process, and the pipe is installed by reeling at a later stage. The tensile testing was performed at a slow rate (10 - 6 s- 1) in order to allow for the necessary hydrogen diffusion to the crack tip to achieve stepwise hydrogen cracking. A significant reduction in ductility compared to samples without hydrogen was observed. The third set of samples were tested under constant load immersed in 3. 5 % NaCl and subjected to a negative potential corresponding to that induced by the cathodic protection system. The load was increased by a small amount every second day in order to establish the threshold stress for hydrogen cracking during service in seawater with hydrogen being introduced on the steel surface by the cathodic protection system. A significant influence of the second heat cycle was observed. This effect was attributed to both a variation in yield strength and the influence of precipitates on hydrogen solubility and diffusion. Supermartensitic stainless steels contain a certain amount of retained austenite, and this is regarded as beneficial because it increases toughness and ductility. The retained austenite is produced intentionally in pipe products by heat treatment at a temperature where the alloy is partially transformed to austenite, normally 600 - 700 oC. The tendency to form retained austenite in the two materials was investigated by heat treatment of samples at different temperatures and time. Phase transformation temperatures were measured by dilatometer tests and X-Ray diffraction. The highest amount of retained austenite was achieved after a double tempering heat cycle, and the formation of retained austenite required longer heat treatment times in steel A than in steel B. Retained austenite may play a role in the hydrogen embrittlement process because austenite has a much higher hydrogen solubility than martensite has. The effect of the retained austenite on hydrogen cracking was investigated by tensile testing of standard round bar specimens that had been heat treated in order to achieve different levels of retained austenite. A significant effect of the retained austenite was observed. Samples with high amounts of retained austenite experienced a much higher reduction in ductility after hydrogen charging than samples with low amounts of retained austenite. In order to explain this effect, the hydrogen solubility of samples containing different levels of austenite and precipitates was measured. This was achieved by charging the samples to saturation in an electrolyte and performing hydrogen analysis. Carbide precipitation was also found to influence hydrogen solubility, and carbides precipitated at different temperatures were identified by transmission electron microscopy.

These connections must be designed as a highly ductile element in order to dissipate extensive energy thus undergo inelastic deformations. <b>Doubler</b> <b>plates</b> and continuity plates have been recommended by several design codes and standards in order to strengthen the column web and prevent the inelastic deformation of the panel zone due to high shear stress concentrations. However, <b>doubler</b> <b>plates</b> and continuity plates are very expensive due to the large amount of detailing and welding requirements. Furthermore, the extensive welding may affect the properties of the steel in which it may cause shrinkage, lower potential notch toughness and cracking. In any of these cases, there is high potential of losing the desirable inelastic performance required for these SMF. This report investigates the design of the special steel moment frame connections thus eliminating the use of <b>doubler</b> and continuity <b>plates</b> in these connections. Tables are provided that show all steel W-Shape beam sizes with all the adequate steel W-Shape column sizes used in special steel moment frames without the use of <b>doubler</b> and continuity <b>plates</b> in frame connections...|$|R
40|$|Background: Complex {{proximal}} humerus fractures with metaphyseal comminution remain challenging regarding {{reduction and}} stability. In most fracture patterns the hard bone of the bicipital groove remains intact. In this case series, we describe a novel technique of hybrid <b>double</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis of complex proximal humerus fractures with metaphyseal comminution. Methods: In randomly chosen shoulder specimens and synthetic bones, pilot studies {{for evaluation of}} the feasibility of the technique were performed. Between 4 / 2010 and 1 / 2012 10 patients underwent hybrid <b>double</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis. Seven patients (4 male, 3 female, mean age was 50 years (range 27 – 73)) were available for retrospective analysis. Based on plain radiographs (anterior-posterior and axial view), the fractures were classified according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification (OTA) and by descriptive means (head-split variant (HS), diaphyseal extension or comminution (DE)). Results: Follow-up radiographs demonstrated complete fracture healing in six patients and one incomplete avascular necrosis. None of the patients sustained loss of reduction. Three patients where reoperated. The medium, not adapted, Constant score was 80 Points (58 – 94). Patients subjective satisfaction was graded mean 3 (range: 0 – 6) in the visual analog scoring system (VAS). Conclusion: The technique of hybrid <b>double</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis using the bicipital groove as anatomic landmark may re-establish shoulder function after complex proximal humerus fractures in two dimensions. Firstly the anatomy is restored due to a proper reduction based on intraoperative landmarks. Secondly additional support by the second plate may provide a higher stability in complex fractures with metaphyseal comminution...|$|R
