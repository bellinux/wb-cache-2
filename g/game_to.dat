5|$|In Presley's {{second year}} as coach, Stanford {{was led by}} Ben Erb and Jim Arrell. The season was almost {{identical}} to the previous year: the team won its first seven games by shutout, and then lost Big <b>Game</b> <b>to</b> undefeated California. Stanford led in that game 6–0, but did not score again as California won 25–6. This Big Game is recognized as the first intercollegiate <b>game</b> <b>to</b> feature card stunts.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} the next {{entry in the}} Wipeout series, developer Psygnosis retained many of the developers of the original <b>game</b> <b>to</b> preserve the distinctive racing experience of earlier games. At the same time, Psygnosis sought to make the game more accessible to new players of the fast-paced racer, and kept early courses easier for these players; the difficulty was adjusted for later courses so that experts still experienced a challenge. Wipeout 3 was the first Wipeout <b>game</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of PlayStation controllers with analogue sticks, used to offer smoother control of the player's craft.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} <b>game</b> <b>to</b> {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature {{version of the}} vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer <b>game</b> <b>to</b> have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic <b>game</b> <b>to</b> use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E

5|$|Once Sega {{left the}} {{hardware}} market, other companies {{began to take}} {{up some of the}} franchises, including Crazy Taxi. Acclaim brought the <b>game</b> <b>to</b> the PlayStation 2 on May 21, 2001 and GameCube on November 18, 2001, while Activision and Strangelite ported the <b>game</b> <b>to</b> the PC in 2002; only the PlayStation 2 port was more successful than the Dreamcast version, and the rest didn't do as well. The Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi was also playable through emulation via Gametap on PC systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first <b>game</b> <b>to</b> be {{developed}} by the newly re-branded Rare, whereas the first <b>game</b> <b>to</b> be released under the company was Solar Jetman, earlier in 1990.

5|$|Ultima Underworlds game {{engine was}} written by a small team. Chris Green {{provided}} the game's texture mapping algorithm, which was applied to walls, floors and ceilings. The engine allowed for transparencies, walls at 45 degree angles, multiple tile heights and inclined surfaces, and other aspects. Ultima Underworld was the first video <b>game</b> <b>to</b> implement many of these effects. The game {{was also the first}} indoor, real-time, 3D first-person <b>game</b> <b>to</b> allow the player to look up and down, and to jump.|$|E
