40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedVarious {{methods have been}} introduced for <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> of ships.

In this study a gas turbine - electric drive combination is used as the means of propulsion; the usual method for <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> is the electric power dissipation method using resistors.

2500|$|The {{cars were}} ordered from General Electric and Avco. Aside from the boxier look and smaller side windows, the main changes {{between the new}} IVs and earlier Silverliners {{included}} a <b>dynamic</b> <b>brake</b> system, for which the resistance grids were fitted in the car's signature roof hump, and, for the Penn Central cars, a trainline automatic door system which removed the need for train crew to manually open doors at high level platforms. [...] The Silverliner IVs were also {{the first to be}} delivered in a married pair configuration, although a minority of cars were outfitted as single units. The delivery of the Silverliner IVs allowed SEPTA to replace most of its remaining PRR MP54s and Reading's pre-war MU fleet save for the 38 rebuilt [...] "Blueliner" [...] cars. [...] While being fitted with an updated propulsion system from General Electric, the Silverliner IVs were nevertheless still delivered with Ignitron tube rectifiers, which were later replaced with silicon controlled rectifiers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> {{is the use}} of the {{electric}} traction motors of a railroad vehicle as generators when slowing the locomotive.

5000|$|Upon {{retrieving}} the locomotives' [...] "black boxes" [...] (event recorders) and {{the recorded}} data therein, {{it was discovered}} that the third head end locomotive's <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> were not functioning at all, although the sound of the cooling fans misled crews into believing <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> was functional. It was also determined after the wreck that the engineer operating the helper locomotives knew of the faulty <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> on one of his units, but did not communicate that information to the head end crew. The combination of weight miscalculation, poor communication and faulty brake equipment resulted in a total train weight that was too great to adequately control on the down grade. Once <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> had been defeated by the helper engineer's emergency brake application the enormous weight of the heavily loaded cars caused rapid acceleration that could not be resisted solely by mechanical braking.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} that a wagon driven by a {{squirrel-cage}} induction motor is controlled {{to stop at the}} given position on a rail. The wagon is driven on the rail and arrives at the brake-start point. From this point, the motor should be braked corresponding to the load of the wagon. Therefore, the distance from brake-start point to the stop position must be constant. The brake of the 3 phase squirrel-cage induction motor is various method; <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> regenerative braking, plugging and single-phase braking etc. DC exciting method, so called <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> was used for this experiment. The peculiarity of this experiment is that the load was detected during the braking and braking current was decided. The method of this detection is as follows. At the first step, <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> of which braking current is small was given on the motor from the brake-start point. In response to the ratio of speed down, the pulses were gained by phototransister which respond to light through the hole of disk installed on motor. The distance of pulse was converted into position stepping in the second <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> of which braking current is large. This way was termed the second-step <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking.</b> By such a way, as the value of load increased, the braking quantity increased. Hence the difference of the given position and the stop position was small value in spite of the load variation...|$|R
