[...] As a result, a state may not “deem” that an employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> is an insurance plan in an effort to sidestep preemption if the <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> would not otherwise meet the requirements as an insurance company or contract. [...] The “deemer” clause therefore restricts the use of the “savings” clause to conventionally insured employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R

Defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> can also contribute to intergeneration inequality, as retired members continue to receive benefits, whether or not those benefits were adequately pre-funded. The reverse is true for defined contribution plans where the contribution certainty comes at the cost of complete benefit uncertainty.|$|R
50|$|ERISA is {{a federal}} law that sets minimum {{standards}} for employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> including pension <b>plans</b> and health <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> in private industry within the United States. ERISA neither requires an employer to establish a pension plan, with few exceptions, nor dictates what benefits must be offered; instead, it requires that employers who establish plans meet certain minimum standards. The law is designed {{for the protection of}} plan participants, and to ensure a uniform statutory body of law regulating applicable <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> throughout every jurisdiction in the country.|$|R
50|$|Although a {{cash balance}} plan is {{technically}} a defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> {{designed to allow}} workers to evaluate the economic worth their pension benefit {{in the manner of}} a defined contribution plan (i.e., as an account balance), the target <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> is a defined contribution plan designed to express its projected impact in terms of lifetime income as a percent of final salary at retirement (i.e., as an annuity amount). For example, a target <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> may mimic a typical defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> offering 1.5% of salary per year of service times the final 3-year average salary. Actuarial assumptions like 5% interest, 3% salary increases and the UP84 Life Table for mortality are used to calculate a level contribution rate that would create the needed lump sum at retirement age. The problem with such plans is that the flat rate could be low for young entrants and high for old entrants. While this may appear unfair, the skewing of benefits to the old worker is a feature of most traditional defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> and any attempt to match it would reveal this backloading feature.|$|R

50|$|A {{cash balance}} {{plan is a}} defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> made to appear {{as if it were}} a defined {{contribution}} plan. They have notional balances in hypothetical accounts where, typically, each year the plan administrator will contribute an amount equal to a certain percentage of each participant's salary; a second contribution, called interest credit, is made as well. These are not actual contributions and further discussion is beyond the scope of this entry suffice it to say that there is currently much controversy.In general, they are usually treated as defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> for tax, accounting and regulatory purposes. As with defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> investment risk in hybrid designs is largely borne by the plan sponsor. As with defined contribution designs, <b>plan</b> <b>benefits</b> are expressed in the terms of a notional account balance, and are usually paid as cash balances upon termination of employment. These features make them more portable than traditional defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> and perhaps more attractive to a more highly mobile workforce.|$|R

50|$|A Long Term Care <b>Benefit</b> <b>Plan</b> is {{also known}} as an Assurance <b>Benefit</b> <b>Plan.</b> A <b>Benefit</b> <b>Plan</b> is {{separate}} from a long term care insurance policy because it allows policy holders to use any form of life insurance policies to pay for long term care. The plan converts a death benefit into a living benefit. Life insurance policies can be converted into a Long Term Care <b>Benefit</b> <b>Plan</b> for 30 to 60 percent of the policy amount to be used for long term care. The sale of a life insurance policy can keep people off Medicaid. By exchanging a life insurance policy for a Long Term Care <b>Benefit</b> <b>Plan,</b> the <b>benefits</b> go toward long term care including assisted living, home health care, and nursing homes. The conversion takes away the responsibility of premium payments from the family and there is no wait period before benefits begin. The policy transfer is subject to regulatory standards in each state. Benefits are deposited into a FDIC-insured benefit account that follows federal and state banking regulations and is held by a nationally chartered bank and trust company. The benefit payments are then made directly to the health care facility on a monthly basis.|$|R
