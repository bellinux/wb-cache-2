40|$|Neutron star-black hole {{binaries}} {{are among}} the strongest sources of gravitational waves detectable by current observatories. They can also power bright electromagnetic signals (gamma-ray bursts, kilonovae), and may be {{a significant source of}} production of r-process nuclei. A misalignment of the black hole spin with respect to the orbital angular momentum leads to precession of that spin and of the orbital plane, and has a significant effect on the properties of the post-merger remnant and of the material ejected by the merger. We present a first set of simulations of precessing neutron star-black hole mergers using a <b>hot,</b> <b>composition</b> dependent, nuclear-theory based equation of state (DD 2). We show that the mass of the remnant and of the dynamical ejecta are broadly consistent with the result of simulations using simpler equations of state, while differences arise when considering the dynamics of the merger and the velocity of the ejecta. We show that the latter can easily be understood from assumptions about the composition of low-density, cold material in the different equations of state, and propose an updated estimate for the ejecta velocity which takes those effects into account. We also present an updated mesh-refinement algorithm which allows us to improve the numerical resolution used to evolve neutron star-black hole mergers. Comment: 23 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

Physicians in our study diagnosed a woman to have lower reproductive tract infection if she complained of malodorous vaginal discharge with or without perineal itching; and to have pelvic inflammatory disease or upper reproductive tract infection {{if she had any}} two of the following complaints: malodorous vaginal discharge, menstrual irregularities, lower abdominal pain or dyspareunia. Women consulted a variety of healthcare providers in their pursuit for treatment, mainly allopathic doctors and hakims. The different treatments prescribed to women ranged from oral and intravaginal medications to various home remedies including refraining from specific foods. Causes of reproductive tract infections reported were "melting bones", consuming foods with perceived <b>hot</b> <b>composition,</b> poor personal hygiene and procedures like dilatation and curettage, delivery and induced abortions. None reported sexually transmitted diseases as the perceived cause of their problem. Interference with religious activities, sexual relationships or socializing was reported as consequences of reproductive tract infections, in addition to lower abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, backache and kamzori (weakness). Pakistani women seek care for reproductive tract infections and visit a variety of providers, though causes and treatments offered are usually not related to sexually transmitted diseases. We therefore suggest training of healthcare providers for appropriate counseling and that treatment management protocols be advocated.

Pronounced pitch angle and spectral differences between ion species, and temporal variations within each species, are indicative of many of the complex source, energization, transport, and loss mechanisms at play in the magnetosphere.

The acceleration is required both to overcome the gravitational confinement of O(+) and to violate charge exchange equilibrium so that the neutral hydrogen atmosphere appears 'optically' thin to escaping O(+). Constraints are placed on the acceleration processes, and it is shown that O(+) escape is facilitated by observed ionospheric responses to magnetic activity...|$|R

The energetic He(2 +) to H(+) density ratio in the magnetosheath is consistent with that predicted from first-order Fermi acceleration of solar wind ions in the turbulent regions upstream and downstream from the earth's quasi-parallel bow shock.

We examine H(+) and He(+) distribution functions from approx. equals 1 to 160 eV using the <b>Hot</b> Plasma <b>Composition</b> Experiment instrument on AMPTE/CCE to investigate the thermal ion response to the waves. A total of 48 intervals were chosen {{on the basis of}} electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave activity: 24 with prevalent EMIC waves and 24 with no EMIC waves observed on the orbit. There is a close correlation between EMIC waves and perpendicular heated ion distributions. For protons the perpendicular temperature increase is modest, about 5 eV, and is always observed at 90 deg pitch angles. This is consistent with a nonresonant interaction near the equator. By contrast, He(+) temperatures during EMIC wave events averaged 35 eV and sometimes exceeded 100 eV, indicating stronger interaction with the waves. Furthermore, heated He(+) ions have X-type distributions with maximum fluxes occurring at pitch angles intermediate between field-aligned and perpendicular directions. The X-type He(+) distributions are consistent with a gyroresonant interaction off the equator. The concentration of He(+) relative to H(+) is found to correlate with EMIC wave activity, but it is suggested that the preferential heating of He(+) accounts for the apparent increase in relative He(+) concentration by increasing the proportion of He(+) detected by the ion instrument...|$|R

Hydrogen sulfide removal from simulated hot gas was evaluated {{as a function of}} both zinc oxide-based sorbent physical and chemical characteristics and various process parameters. In addition, the sorbent capture efficiency and regenerability of the ceramic filtration device were evaluated, and regeneration of sulfided sorbents via injection into an oxidizing gas was studied. For both sorbent sulfidation and spent sorbent regeneration, gas-solid reaction occurred both in the duct and within layers of partially reacted sorbent captured by the ceramic filter. Very high sulfur removal efficiencies were obtained only in highly reducing <b>hot</b> gas <b>compositions</b> at or above about 700 C, using stoichiometric ratio (defined as ZnO/H{sub 2 }S ratio) values of about 1. 5, and sorbent particles of about 20 {micro}m or less in diameter.

Negligible zinc loss from the hot zone of the reactor was detected, apparently due to rapid formation of zinc sulfide product layers on zinc oxide particles.
