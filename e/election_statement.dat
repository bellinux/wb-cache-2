50|$|Hindenburg {{initially}} demurred. While he was {{not opposed}} {{to the concept of}} leading Germany (something he had already effectively done during the latter years of the war), he was still a staunch monarchist and as such found the idea of becoming Germany's head of state repulsive. However, under strong pressure from Tirpitz applied over several meetings, and later from Jarres himself, who withdrew from the election saying only Hindenburg could win the presidency for the right, Hindenburg agreed to run provided he could secure some sort of blessing from the exiled German Emperor. After receiving a clear endorsement {{in the form of a}} letter Wilhelm II wrote from the Netherlands urging him to run, Hindenburg finally agreed that he would seek the presidency. On 9 April 1925, Hindenburg issued a brief press statement from his home in Hanover saying he was a candidate for president. Hindenburg ran during the second round of the elections as a non-party independent, though he was generally regarded as the conservative candidate. He won the election in the second round of voting held on 26 April 1925, largely because of his status as Germany's greatest war hero. He was aided by the support of the Bavarian People's Party (BVP), which switched from supporting Marx, and by the refusal of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) to withdraw their candidate Ernst Thälmann. (If either party had supported Marx, Marx would have won.) Significantly, Hindenburg's only <b>election</b> <b>statement</b> was his Easter Appeal of 11 April 1925 calling for a Volksgemeinschaft under his leadership.|$|E

40|$|From 1 July 2005, small {{business}} taxpayers using the Simplified Tax System {{and with a}} turnover of $ 50, 000 or less are allowed a tax offset of 25 per cent on their tax payable. If turnover exceeds $ 50, 000, the tax offset phases out at 1 per cent until the turnover reaches $ 75, 000. This tax concession {{was part of the}} government¿s <b>election</b> <b>statement</b> made on 26 September 2004 in which the government stated that it wanted to assist and encourage {{small business}} entrepreneurs, particularly those set up from home.

40|$|People want to {{know how}} Labor will make their lives better, writes David Burchell JUST about {{everyone}} who heard the PM’s election announcement on Sunday must have wondered about the opening sentences, in which he baldly stated that ‘this election will be about trust’, and went on to detail the spheres in which the Coalition were better guardians of the public trust than their opponents. After weeks of unwelcome controversy about the PM’s role in the ‘children overboard’ affair, and the bad smell which lingers from that affair in terms of the PM’s personal credibility, it seemed {{on the face of it}} an odd and audacious gambit. Indeed, if you listen to sections of the media, this election will be decided by questions of honesty and credibility. How could a PM who dissembled on ‘children overboard’ be entrusted by the electorate with the highest office in the land? Surely trust has to be a winner for Labor? Yet, not for the first time (remember 1975 ?), the press gallery may be a little behind the game. As this week’s Newspoll suggested vividly, the electorate is less interested in the government’s dissembling in 2001 than in the parties’ policies for 2005 - 07, less preoccupied by the length of the PM’s nose than the size of the health budget. In pushing Labor further down the path of a negative campaign based on repetitious claims of lies and deceit, the press gallery (for all its mistrust of him) may actually be the PM’s best friend. The gallery’s confusion isn’t hard to understand. In the good old days politics was a kind of war. There were attacks, counter-attacks and holding operations. You defended ‘your’ people and attacked the other side’s. All that’s changed. Political campaigning now looks less like hand to hand combat, and more like political jujitsu, where the prime aim is to turn your opponent’s strength against them, the better to bring them tumbling to the electoral mat. From late 2001 till late 2003 the judo match was going more or less entirely the government’s way. It had manoeuvred Labor into a morass of high-principle, first over refugees and then over the war in Iraq. All the while Labor’s policy messages on health and education were being lost. The PM could just sit there, an enigmatic smile playing around his lips, looking like a venerable black-belter. With the ascent of Mark Latham to Labor’s leadership, the rules of the game suddenly altered. For a good nine months, government attacks on Mr Latham resembled nothing so much as a first world war artillery barrage. They launched every missile they could find at him, including the kitchen sink, and the marital bed besides. Mostly it was sound and fury, signifying electoral nothing. Meanwhile Mr Latham, that supposed wild bull, sat serenely on the Opposition benches, with an aura of inscrutable peace and tranquility that would put the Dalai Lama to shame. Paradoxically, it’s the ‘children overboard’ embarrassment that seems to have caused the government to dump the khaki, and don the judo-pants once more. Now the PM presents himself as a veritable St Sebastian, suffering silently while the opposition launches wave after wave of arrows in dastardly personal attacks. Meanwhile, Mr Howard has been striving to turn the debate around, the better to gain judo-leverage against Mr Latham’s ample frame. Trust me about some leaky old boat from three years ago - his <b>election</b> <b>statement</b> implicitly asks - or trust Labor on managing the national economy? Which matters more? Twelve months ago it was almost unthinkable that the government could lose this election, or Labor win it. The economy was buoyant, the electorate mostly complacent, the auguries all favourable. Mr Latham has done an extraordinary job in turning Labor’s fortunes around. Now Labor almost deserves to be called the front-runner for 9 October. And yet, as any judo-teacher knows, this is potentially the most dangerous moment of all. Should Labor, its heart high and the wind in its nostrils, really choose to fight this election campaign on truth and honesty in public life, it could find itself smelling the sweaty vinyl of the mat. All Labor’s electoral advantages for twelve months now have come from its positive campaigning - on the problems of suburbia, or families, and of young people. On these issues it’s looked dynamic, and the government has appeared tired and defensive. Truth, honesty and trust all have a noble ring. But in the end they’re a matter of negative campaigning and sniping, artillery-barrages and trench-politics. Perhaps Mr Latham needs to turn a little Buddhist once again. You know the drill. Relax, clear your mind of anything superfluous, and focus only on the higher truths. What people {{want to know}} about in election campaigns is what you can do to better their lives.

5000|$|After {{losing the}} 2010 general {{election}} by 103 votes, Liberal Democrat candidate Elwyn Watkins submitted a petition {{for a hearing}} by an election court, claiming that campaign literature issued by his Labour opponent Phil Woolas breached the Representation of the People Act 1983 by making false statements about his personal character.

40|$|Near {{the end of}} life, {{hospice care}} reduces symptom-related {{distress}} and hospitalizations while improving caregiving outcomes. However, it takes time {{for a person to}} gain a sufficient understanding of hospice and decide to enroll. This decision is influenced by knowledge of hospice and its services, emotion and fear, cultural and religious beliefs, and an individual’s acceptance of diagnosis. Hospice admission interactions, a key influence in shaping decisions regarding hospice care, happen particularly late in the illness trajectory and are often complex, unpredictable, and highly variable. One goal of these interactions is ensuring patients and families have accurate and clear information about hospice care to facilitate informed decisions. So inconsistent are practices across hospices in consenting patients that a 2016 report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) entitled “Hospices should improve their <b>election</b> <b>statements</b> and certifications of terminal illness” called for complete and accurate <b>election</b> <b>statements</b> to ensure that hospice patients and their caregivers can make informed decisions and understand {{the costs and benefits of}} choosing hospice care. Whether complete and accurate information at initial admission visits improves interactions and outcomes is unknown. Our recent qualitative work investigating interactions between patients, caregivers, and hospice nurses has uncovered diverse and often diverging stakeholder-specific expectations and perceptions which if not addressed can create discordance and inhibit decision-making. This paper focuses on better understanding the communication dynamics and practices involved in hospice admission interactions in order to design more effective interactions and support the mandate from the OIG to provide hospice patients and their caregivers with accurate and complete information. This clarity is particularly important when discussing the non-curative nature of hospice care, and the choice patients make to forego aggressive treatment measures when they enroll in hospice. In a literal sense, to enroll in hospice means to bring in support for end-of-life care. It means to identify the need for expertise around symptom management at end-of-life, and agree to having a care team come and manage someone’s physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual needs. As with all care, hospice can be stopped if it is no longer considered appropriate. To uncover the communication tensions undergirding a hospice admission interaction, we use Street’s ecological theory of patient-centered communication to analyze a case exemplar of a hospice admission interaction. This analysis reveals diverse points of struggle within hospice decision-making processes around hospice care and the need for communication techniques that promote trust and acceptance of end-of-life care. Lessons learned from talking about hospice care can inform other quality initiatives around communication and informed decision-making in the context of advance care planning, palliative care, and end-of-life care...|$|R

Irish public opinion researches have been showing long-term and extremely positive attitudes to the European integration. The pro-European consensus is also known among the local political parties.
