60|$|When a man {{has found}} and won his mate then the best traditions demand a lyrical interlude. It should be {{possible}} to tell, in that ecstatic manner which melts words into moonshine, makes prose almost uncomfortably rhythmic, and brings all the freshness of every spring that ever was across the page, of the joyous exaltation of the happy lover. This at any rate was what White had always done in his novels hitherto, and what he would certainly have done at this point had he had the telling of Benham's story uncontrolledly in his hands. But, indeed, indeed, in real life, in very truth, the heart has not this simplicity. Only the heroes of romance, and a few strong simple clean-shaven Americans have that much <b>emotional</b> <b>integrity.</b> (And even the Americans do at times seem to an observant eye to be putting in work at the job and keeping up their gladness.) Benham was excited that night, but not in the proper bright-eyed, red-cheeked way; he did not dance down the village street of Harting to his harbour at the Ship, and the expression in his eyes as he {{sat on the edge of}} his bed was not the deep elemental wonder one could have wished there, but amazement. Do not suppose that he did not love Amanda, that a rich majority of his being was not triumphantly glad to have won her, that the image of the two armour-clad lovers was not still striding and flourishing through the lit wilderness of his imagination. For three weeks things had pointed him to this. They would do everything together now, he and his mate, they would scale mountains together and ride side by side towards ruined cities across the deserts of the World. He could have wished no better thing. But at the same time, even as he felt and admitted this and rejoiced at it, the sky of his mind was black with consternation....|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a {{significant}} increase of the incidence of left-handedness and sinistrality among schoolchildren. Theydemonstrate a large number of left-sided motor and sensory preferences which are considered as external markers offunctional hemispheric asymmetry of the brain. The purposes of this study are to investigate gender peculiarities and specificityof age-related dynamics of laterality pattern’s formation in junior schoolchildren and to find out educational peculiarities anddifficulties of left-handed children. The findings show that left-handers differ greatly in their mental development by havingsome peculiarities of intelligence, world’s perception and prevailing thinking strategies, ways of memorization, specificity ofemotional-affective expression. The main problems of left-handed children in school performance are academic failure, lack ofperseverance, anxiety neurosis, and extreme emotional lability. Integrated development of the left hemisphere and the righthemisphere thinking of left-handed schoolchildren is a favorable condition for harmonious personal and intellectualdevelopment and effective mastering of various modules of the school curriculum. The technological solution of the problem ofteaching the children with left-sided laterality is to include in educational programs some special exercises to developimagination, <b>emotional</b> sensitivity, <b>integrity</b> of perception, global view to the problems, creativeness, and original approachesto tasks’ solving. So a complex program for the intensive development of the right hemisphere of children who demonstrateleft-sided laterality to overcome the possible failure at primary school is proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{compilation}} of the information obtained in meetings and from documentation received by the five independent experts {{who were part of}} the Mission of Observation (MOC) visiting Mexico in November 2014 to observe the situation of human rights defenders in the country. The first part introduces the legal framework in which human rights defenders operate. It highlights governmental policies to promote and protect human rights that contrast with the backdrop of vulnerability and risk faced by human rights defenders. The second part of the report is divided into three chapters that address the issues that impact and hinder the defense of human rights: First, the criminalization of defenders that is fueled by a lack of appropriate acknowledgement of their work in Mexican society (Chapter 1); Protection mechanisms and how appropriate and effective they are for the protection of human rights defenders, with special emphasis on the Protection Mechanism for Human Rights Defenders and Journalists created in 2012 (Chapter 2); and the factors that contribute to impunity and prevent defenders from carrying out their work (Chapter 3). It {{should be noted that the}} experts received many complaints about an overall failure to effectively investigate and prosecute the perpetrators who put the work of human rights defenders and their <b>emotional</b> and physical <b>integrity</b> at risk.

40|$|Organizations use pre-employment {{tests to}} {{identify}} individuals characterized {{as having a}} propensity (likelihood) to commit theft {{with the intent to}} limit at-risk hires, thereby reducing the risk of fraud. Pre-employment tests were originally designed to identify a broad range of deviant behaviors such as previous violations of laws, and violations of social norms and organizational policies (O 2 ̆ 7 Bannon et al., 1989), not as predictive indicators of deviant behavior and theft. In addition, the test most commonly used to identify high fraud risk applicants, the integrity test, has limited support as a valid predictor of theft (MacLane 2 ̆ 6 Walmsley, 2010; Ones et al., 2003; Sackett et al., 1989; Van Iddekinge et al., 2012) within the literature. This study empirically examined the efficacy of pre-employment tests to elicit a predictive profile of white-collar crime by testing the relationship between deviant behaviors, personality traits, and integrity. The data for this study was obtained through questionnaires and pre-employment tests administered within the Federal prison system. The total sample consisted of twenty (N= 20) convicted white-collar inmates. Results of this sample were compared to the general population statistics as provided by the pre-employment test providers. In line with the literature, positive relationships were found between low integrity and deviant behaviors.

40|$|Background and Aim: Despite {{growing body}} of {{literature}} regarding marital adjustment of infertile women, to our knowledge, there is no study to address the role of religious and spiritual beliefs in adjusting marital relationships in infertile women. Considering the significance of marital cohesiveness and commitment in the long and stressful journey of infertile women, {{this study was designed}} to explore how marital relationships are experienced by infertile women who affiliated to different religious faiths. Methods: A group of 30 infertile women affiliated to different denominations of Christianity (Protestantism, Catholicism, Orthodoxies) and Islam (Shiite and Sunni) were interviewed. The design was a grounded theory study including semi structured in-depth interviews. Data were collected in one Iranian and two UK fertility clinics through theoretical sampling and analyzed using Strauss and Corbin’s mode of grounded theory.  Results: Religious infertile women using a religious/spiritual meaning-making framework tried adjust their marital relationships through going the following phases: being optimistic and positive, having supportive relationships, being grateful and appreciated for their marital life, offering spiritual sympathy and adopting religious role models. These strategies aided infertile women to be more understanding, sympathetic and gentle towards maintaining the family cohesion. Conclusion: I argue that awareness of health professionals of the potential ways in which religion and spirituality assist infertile women to deal with their marital issues could be important. This knowledge will help them to support <b>emotional</b> wholeness and <b>integrity</b> of infertile women, offering religious and spiritual coping strategies which can help adjusting their marital relationships. ...|$|R

While numerous leadership assessment tools exist at present, few are specifically tailored to the unique health care environment. The study team designed a 24 -item survey (Healthcare Evaluation & Assessment of Leadership [HEAL]) to measure leadership competency based on the core competencies and core principles of the Duke Healthcare Leadership Model. A novel digital platform was created for use on handheld devices to facilitate its distribution and completion. This pilot phase involved 126 health care professionals self-assessing their leadership abilities. The study aimed to determine both the content validity of the survey and the feasibility of its implementation and use. The digital platform for survey implementation was easy to complete, and there were no technical problems with survey use or data collection. With regard to reliability, initial survey results revealed that each core leadership tenet met or exceeded the reliability cutoff of 0. 7. In self-assessment of leadership, women scored themselves higher than men in questions related to patient centeredness (P= 0. 016). When stratified by age, younger providers rated themselves lower with regard to <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>integrity.</b> There were no differences in self-assessment when stratified by medical specialty. While only a pilot study, initial data suggest that HEAL is a reliable and easy-to-administer survey for health care leadership assessment. Differences in responses by sex and age with respect to patient centeredness, <b>integrity,</b> and <b>emotional</b> intelligence raise questions about how providers view themselves amid complex medical teams. As the survey is refined and further administered, HEAL will be used not only as a self-assessment tool but also in “ 360 ” evaluation formats.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades the {{conditions}} for parents have changed more radically than ever before in our history. The importance of a quality child-parent relationship has been discovered and the »subject-subject relationship« emphasized. Systems Theory is widely recognized as the most comprehensive theory with regard to analyzing and healing family conflicts as well as individual pain. A common set of values and moral consensus does not exist any more and parents have lost a lot of their external support. Pedagogy has tried to compensate for this, but since the nature of professional pedagogy is fundamentally different from private childrearing, it has been unsuccessful. When you place a method between a parent and a child, you establish a subject-object-relationship with the child as the object. This kind of relationship is far from optimal. The process violates the <b>emotional</b> and existential <b>integrity</b> of children. The more you violate the integrity of a human being, the more this human being will conform to the demands and expectations, which means that these methods are bound to "work". The crucial ethical, professional and political question is not what works, but how and why it works. We do not need another politically motivated alteration of parenting, but we do need a continued development, based on the experiences of today’s parents and their dialogue with different groups of professionals. Today nobody has the complete answer to the most important question of them all: "How do we as adults exercise our leadership over children and youth in ways that do not violate their personal integrity?" This question is also asked, and not yet answered, within industry, politics and education, so please be patient and do not take your frustration out on our children in the form of overly simplified methods. Stop thinking primitively in opposites and help us formulate genuine alternatives to everything that does not serve individuals and/or families and communities...|$|R

5000|$|Commenting on this, Lutz Peter Koepnick {{writes in}} 2002, How can Wagner at once help {{emphasize}} a progressivist vision of human individualism and a fascist preview of absolute domination? How can the master's music simultaneously signify {{a desire for}} lost <b>emotional</b> <b>integrity</b> and for authoritative grandeur?Chaplin's dual use of Lohengrin points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like Adorno, Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of fascism out {{of the spirit of}} the total work of art, and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle, Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms...Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions. Although Chaplin exposes the puzzling modernity of Nazi politics, Chaplin is unwilling to write off either Wagner or industrial culture. suggests Hollywood needs Wagner as never before in order to at once condemn the use of fantasy in fascism and warrant the utopian possibilities in industrial culture.|$|E
