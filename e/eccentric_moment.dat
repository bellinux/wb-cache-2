30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{sustained}} load tests of eccentrically loaded reinforced concrete columns {{were performed to}} investigate deformations due to sustained <b>eccentric</b> <b>moment.</b> The test parameters were the magnitude of sustained loads {{and the presence of}} eccentricity. The lateral displacement (curvature) and axial shortening due to the sustained <b>eccentric</b> <b>moment</b> were measured through the tests, and the results were compared with the predictions. In addition, simplified methods for estimating the time-dependent deformations of eccentrically loaded columns were proposed, based on the creep and shrinkage models of ACI 209 R- 92 and the age-adjusted effective modulus method.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{focuses on}} the {{quantification}} of genetic and environmental factors in arm strength after high-resistance strength training. METHODS: Male monozygotic (MZ, N = 25) and dizygotic (DZ, N = 16) twins (22. 4 +/- 3. 7 yr) participated in a 10 -wk resistance training program for the elbow flexors. The evidence for genotype*training interaction, or association of interindividual differences in training effects with the genotype, was tested by a two-way ANOVA in the MZ twins and using a bivariate model-fitting approach on pre- and post-training phenotypes in MZ and DZ twins. One repetition maximum (1 RM), isometric strength, and concentric and <b>eccentric</b> <b>moments</b> in 110 degree arm flexion at velocities of 30 degrees x s(- 1), 60 degrees x s(- 1), and 12 degrees x s(- 1) were evaluated as well as arm muscle cross-sectional area (MCSA). RESULTS: Results indicated significant positive training effects for all measures except for maximal <b>eccentric</b> <b>moments.</b> Evidence for genotype*training interaction was found for 1 RM and isometric strength, with MZ intra-pair correlations of 0. 46 and 0. 30, respectively. Bivariate model-fitting indicated that about 20 % {{of the variation in}} post-training 1 RM, isometric strength, and concentric moment at 120 degrees x s(- 1) was explained by training-specific genetic factors that were independent from genetic factors that explained variation in the pretraining phenotype (30 - 77 %). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic correlations between measures of pre- and post-training strength were indicative for high pleiotropic gene action and minor activation of training-specific genes during training. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Steel angles {{are widely}} used in roof trusses as web and chord members and in lattice towers. Very often angle members are {{connected}} eccentrically. As a result, not only an angle member is under an axial force, {{but it is also}} subject to a pair of end <b>eccentric</b> <b>moments.</b> Moreover, the connection at each end provides some fixity so neither pinned nor the fixed end represents the reality. Many national design codes allow for the effects due to eccentricities by modifying the slenderness ratio and reducing the compressive strength of the member. However, in practice, {{it is difficult to determine}} accurately the effective length. The concept behind this method is inconsistent with strength design of members of other cross-sectional types such as I or box sections of which the buckling strength is controlled by the Perry constant or the initial imperfection parameters. This paper proposes a method for design of angle frames and trusses by the second-order analysis. The equivalent initial imperfection-to-length ratios for equal and unequal angles to compensate the negligence of initial curvatures, load eccentricities and residual stresses are determined in this paper. From the obtained results, the values of imperfection-to-length ratios are suggested for design and analysis of angle steel trusses allowing for member buckling strength based on the Perry-Robertson formula.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytical model for predicting {{the behavior of}} elastomeric seismic isolation bearings subject to combined <b>eccentric</b> bending <b>moments</b> and shear deformation. The mechanical model consists {{of a series of}} axial springs at the top, mid-height and bottom of the isolator. The model can account for end rotations of the isolator, and the overall isolator rotational stiffness can include the influence of the variation of vertical load on the isolator and the imposed shear deformation. To identify the mechanical characteristics of isolators, static bending tests under various combinations of vertical load and shear deformation were performed. The results of analyses using the new model show very good agreement with experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore a}} {{classification}} method which {{can provide the}} clinical guidance for internal fixation of tibial fracture. MethodsThe different fractures were fixed according to their mechanical classification. Totally, 71 cases of tibial plateau fracture, tibial proximal fracture, tibial distal fracture and Pilon fracture were analyzed to test this selective principle. ResultsAll 71 patients were followed up for 6 - 32 months. The displacement was seldomly observed in cases treated acccording to the classification principle, while some cases against the principle had postoperative displacement. The difference was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). It was proved that there was remarkable correlation between tibial fracture classification, internal fixator and fixation methods. ConclusionTypes IIIa 3, IIIb 1 and IIIb 2 fractures without <b>eccentric</b> <b>moment</b> should be fixed with double plates or angle-stable materials combined with locking structure, otherwise displacement may occur...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the dynamic {{response}} of block foundations of different equivalent radius to mass (Ro/m) ratios under coupled vibrations is investigated for various homogeneous and layered systems. The frequency-dependent stiffness and damping of foundation resting on homogeneous soils and rocks are determined using the half-space theory. The dynamic response characteristics of foundation {{resting on the}} layered system considering rock–rock combination are evaluated using finite element program with transmitting boundaries. Frequencies versus amplitude responses of block foundation are obtained for both translational and rotational motion. A new methodology is proposed for determination of dynamic response of block foundations resting on soil–rock and weathered rock–rock system {{in the form of}} equations and graphs. The variations of dimensionless natural frequency and dimensionless resonant amplitude with shear wave velocity ratio are investigated for different thicknesses of top soil/weathered rock layer. The dynamic behaviors of block foundations are also analyzed for different rock–rock systems by considering sandstone, shale and limestone underlain by basalt. The variations of stiffness, damping and amplitudes of block foundations with frequency are shown in this study for various rock–rock combinations. In the analysis, two resonant peaks are observed at two different frequencies for both translational and rotational motion. It is observed that the dimensionless resonant amplitudes decrease and natural frequencies increase with increase in shear wave velocity ratio. Finally, the parametric study is performed for block foundations with dimensions of 4  m ×  3  m ×  2  m and 8  m ×  5  m ×  2  m by using generalized graphs. The variations of natural frequency and peak displacement amplitude are also studied for different top layer thicknesses and <b>eccentric</b> <b>moments...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} persistent Anglocentrism that punctuates twentieth-century British and Anglophone literatures. In {{the wake of}} British imperial decline, writers from Britain 2 ̆ 7 s former colonies often inscribe in their works an Anglocentric worldview that looks strikingly {{out of sync with}} the political realities of a post-imperial world. Looking at Henry James, James Joyce, Doris Lessing, and V. S. Naipaul, all of whom grew up outside of England and wrote from a peripheral position in the empire, I attend to the cultural and material existence of the British empire that outlives its geopolitical lifespan. These writers are all reluctant to let go of an obsolete colonial order, a hierarchical core-periphery world system sustained by British imperialism. However, they are not nostalgic about Britain 2 ̆ 7 s imperial past, but are deeply troubled by the empire 2 ̆ 7 s history of violence and injustice. Pervading their works is a self-conscious untimeliness. As their home countries take leave of the British empire, they refuse to celebrate with their fellow countrymen, and turn their backs on a new world of post-imperial hybridity and cultural mixing. While critics have downplayed or dismissed their anachronistic Anglocentrism, this dissertation homes in on the most unprogressive, <b>eccentric</b> <b>moments</b> in their works in order to address the vexing affective legacy of an obsolete empire. Placing these writers in a realist lineage, I suggest that their works articulate the British empire as a single historical totality as well as a complex network of feelings and identifications. Rather than follow the modernist ethos to fly by the nets of tradition and make it new, these writers hold fast to a world that they have outlived by painstakingly describing it into existence, in an attempt to secure in their own writing a home that was never their home. ...|$|R
40|$|Gait {{patterns}} for the non-amputated leg of eight elderly men with trans-tibia 1 amputations were assessed using kinematic and kinetic measures. Kinematically, the subject’s walking speed was faster than expected {{but less than}} normative non-amputee data. The stride length was also less than non-amputee norms. Net joint moment and power analyses showed various discrepancies between the amputee subjects and non-amputees. The amputees required a concentric ankle dorsiflexor moment just after heel-strike to help move the lower leg into mid-stance position. The concentric plantarflexor moment at push-off was much larger than comparative data. A large <b>eccentric</b> flexor <b>moment</b> was also found at the hip during late mid-stance. Most of these discrepancies {{could be explained by}} the lack of an ankle moment generator on the amputated side of the body...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} slice-wise {{factor of safety}} is {{introduced}} to investigate the state of both the whole slope and each slice. The assumption that the interslice force ratio is the same between any two slices is made and the <b>eccentric</b> <b>moment</b> of slice weight is also taken into account. Then four variables equations are formulated based on the equilibrium of forces and moment and the assumption of interslice forces, and then the slice-wise factor of safety along the slip surface can be obtained. The active and passive sections of the slope can be determined based {{on the distribution of}} factor of safety. The factor of safety of the whole slope is also defined as the ratio of the sum of antisliding force to the sum of sliding force on the slip surface. Two examples with different slip surface shapes are analysed to demonstrate the usage of the proposed method. The slice-wise factor of safety enables us to determine the sliding mechanism and pattern of a slope. The reliability is verified by comparing the overall factor of safety with that calculated by conventional methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{pendulum}} driven {{spherical robot}} exhibit unique dynamic behavior which designed for reconnaissance and unstructured hostile environment exploration. Unfortunately spherical type robot maneuvering is nonlinear {{to get the}} desired part, internal propulsion mechanism and motion control need to be reconciled. This is a mechanical challenge to get in balancing and weight distribution. The robot has three DOFs and single inputs, of which the nature is a nonlinear and under actuated system with non-holonomic dynamic constraints. The enhanced construction of two sections on pendulums joint offers novel motion principle of spherical robot, which is moving simultaneously actuated by <b>eccentric</b> <b>moment</b> and inertial moment generated by this pendulum. Meanwhile the mobility is enhanced when the robot behaves dynamically. The dynamic model of linear motion is formulated {{on the basis of}} Lagrange equation, and a smooth trajectory planning method is proposed for linear motion. A feedback controller is build to ensure the accurate trajectory planning. Turning in place motion is an indispensable element of omni directional locomotion which can enhance the mobility of spherical robots. The dynamic model is derived using the theory of moment of momentum, and a stick-slip principle is analyzed. The two motion control methods are validated by both simulations and prototype experiments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis on a numerical tidal stream turbine model where {{a multitude of}} input parameters' effect on the load output were determined. The statistical procedure used, known as the Morris method, provided insight into the interactions between the parameters as well as showing their comparative influence on the turbine loading. The investigation covered parameters from the operational, geometric design and inflow variable domains where the rotor radius, current shear, blade root pitch, surface velocity and wave height were identified as most influential. The blade pitch {{was regarded as a}} surprisingly prominent influence on the loads. The turbine's operating depth and the blade geometry were also found to be of limited influence in the ranges investigated. In terms of load transmission into the internal components of a turbine's drive train, the rotor out-of-plane bending <b>moment,</b> or <b>eccentric</b> bending <b>moment,</b> was found to be a considerable contribution to the off-axis loads on the shaft. Therefore, special attention was paid to the input parameters' relationship to the eccentric load component by performing a detailed study on the load variations caused by the identified primary input parameters. It is concluded that performing a sensitivity analysis on a tidal stream turbine in a specific operating climate can yield insight to the expected load range and that the eccentric loading transmitted to the shaft is significant for most input cases...|$|R
40|$|Joints are {{critical}} parts of timber structures, transmitting static and dynamic forces between structural members. The ultimate behavior of e. g. a building depends strongly on the structural configuration {{and the capacity}} of its joints. The complete collapse of a building or other less extensive accidents that may occur usually start as a local failure inside or {{in the vicinity of}} a joint. Such serious failures have recently occurred in the Nordic countries. Especially the collapses of two large glued-laminated timber (glulam) structures clearly indicate the need of an improved joint design. The trend toward larger and more complex structures even further increases the importance of a safer design of the joints. One aim of this partly experimentally and partly numerically based work has been to investigate if the short term capacity of steel-timber dowel joints loaded parallel to the grain is affected by an initial drying exposure. The experimental results showed that the load-bearing capacity of the joints is indeed reduced by such moisture changes. Moisture induced stresses was mentioned to be the explanation. The key point is that the climates chosen in the present work (20 °C / 65 % RH and 20 °C / 20 % RH) are equivalent to service class 1 according to EC 5 (Eurocode 5 2004). Thus, EC 5 predicts no decrease in load-bearing capacity, in relation to the standard climate used during testing. A decrease in load-bearing capacity in the range of 5 - 20 %, which was found in the present work, is of course not negligible and, therefore, there could be a need to introduce the effect of drying in design codes. Because similar results were also observed for a double-tapered glulam beam, further work should consider timber structures in general. Two numerical methods in order to predict the capacity of multiple steel-timber dowel joints loaded parallel to the grain were tested in the thesis. For the first method, where fracture mechanics (LEFM) concepts were implemented, a good correlation with the experimental results was seen. Also for the second method, where the capacity for a single dowel-type joint as given in EC 5 was used as a failure criterion, a good correlation to traditional EC 5 calculations of multiple dowel-type joints was seen. One advantage of using numerical methods in design is that the capacity of the joint can be calculated also for cases when the dowels are placed in more complex patterns. From both a structural and an architectural point of view this can be very important. In addition, such numerical methods are effective tools for the structural engineer when considering complicated loading situations in joints, i. e. <b>eccentric</b> loading giving <b>moments</b> in the joint...|$|R
