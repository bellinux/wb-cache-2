40|$|The {{external}} costs of road transport {{have been on}} the top of the transport policy agenda for almost a decade. While the discussion has been centred around the environmental costs, it emerges that the external accident cost is often the main component. Here the theory of accident externality charges is developed and the price-relevant accident cost for Sweden is estimated. Furthermore, a system to internalise the external cost through an adjustment of the current Swedish insurance system is proposed. It is found that an additional accident <b>externality</b> <b>charge</b> in urban areas is necessary to supplement a reformed traffic insurance. © The London School of Economics and the University of Bath 2001...|$|E

40|$|The North American and South African {{logistics}} cost calculation-time {{series are}} the two longest-running statistical series available worldwide. These calculations indicate that transportation’s contribution to logistics costs is rising, as the key cost driver (oil price) is increasing exponentially. This is exacerbated by volatile oil prices and the inclusion of <b>externality</b> <b>charges</b> to reduce the logistics environmental footprint. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} consider a new paradigm where material logistics requirements are reduced through localisation and consumption reduction. This, in turn, implies the consideration of new indicators for the future measurement of logistics costs. Because this article asks questions about the suitability of GDP as the primary (and often only) measurement of economic output, new measurements are required.

40|$|South Africa's {{national}} railway {{management is}} considering the further closing {{of a number}} of branch lines due to profitability pressures from stakeholders. This paper cautions against a myopic approach to such closures. Traditionally these decisions are driven by short-term profit motives realised through resulting core line densification. The research presented in this paper demonstrates the importance of 1) taking cognisance of potential branch lines flows; 2) considering freight transport externalities and road usage costs; and 3) understanding long-term demand, in informing closure decisions. The research results reveal considerable volume opportunities for branch lines which, if captured, will significantly reduce both the direct transport costs for this traffic as well as <b>externality</b> <b>charges</b> for the economy. This will therefore not only render rural economies more competitive but also enable the provision of more sustainable freight transport to these communities. The research approach will be of value to researchers in both developed and developing economies to inform the continuous debate regarding rail rationalisation and rail revival. </span...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of fixed-to-mobile (F 2 M) termination charges {{has become increasingly}} important in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand under the Calling Party Pays principle. In {{the absence of any}} regulation, mobile operators have an incentive to set F 2 M termination charges “too high”. We show that the setting of the optimal F 2 M termination charges depends on the significance of network externalities, the intensity of competition in the mobile sector, and the distribution of customer preferences. We also discuss the merits of possible remedies which are not very intrusive.

40|$|Although many special {{economic}} zones (hereinafter SEZs) currently {{identified themselves}} as a “platform (often as physical constrictions for zone enterprises),” the academic support is inadequate. This paper offers {{an introduction to the}} burgeoning literature on two-sided (or multi-sided) markets and illustrates a feasible analysis on how to adopt this model in designing a well-operated system focusing on the land rentals within a apecial economic zone (SEZ), and provides some theoretical support in this research area. In many industries, platforms match relevant parties, e. g. customers to retailers, advertisers to readers, and facilitate interactions between them. Based on this, the paper tries to design a structure for analysing SEZs, which is considered as an efficient method for economic growth. Key characteristics of these markets, regarding network <b>externalities,</b> fee <b>charging</b> strategies and the relation between platform users are discussed first. Afterwards, the possibility of introducing this model into SEZs land use fee charging policies is examined. Finally, the paper provides some key economic insights on SEZs development under the suggested platform model...|$|R
40|$|I examine an {{environment}} where advertisers can 'seed' word-of-mouth advertising by providing initial information about a product to specific users of a social network. Discussion over a social network generates spillover effects for firms when consumers can use the social network {{to inform each other}} about products. When a firm can exploit a social network's structure, it can increase its sales. However, when the network formation process is costly, firms free-ride on such costs at the expense of agents on the network. If agents can form coalitions, I show that they can recoup the value of this <b>externality</b> by <b>charging</b> a toll. When users actively modify the information, generating word-of-mouth advertising about a product provides a 'social value'. This social value stems from the discussions that agents have about the product, without any intervention. Since this process occurs regardless of the firm's actions, the firm cannot capture such valuation. The opinion leaders, or highly regarded agents on the network, {{play a key role in}} the formation of this social value...|$|R
40|$|No {{doubt that}} a {{customer}} (or a job) who joins a queue imposes de- lays on others. He should be charged for that. The question then is by how much. In particular, one {{looks for a}} price mechanism with which total waiting costs is shared while customers pay {{in accordance with their}} own length of service. Two such price mechanisms are presented here. The first, based on the notion of <b>externalities,</b> is by <b>charging</b> customers for the total waiting time accumulated while they are being served. The second is based on applying the Aumann-Shapley cost-sharing price mechanism. These two mechanisms will be exem- plify in the M/G/ 1 queueing model with various entrance disciplies like first-come first-served and processor sharing...|$|R
40|$|The Productivity Commission Staff Working Paper ‘Irrigation externalities: {{pricing and}} charges. by Gavan Dwyer, Robert Douglas, Deb Peterson, Jo Chong and Kate Maddern was {{released}} on 14 March 2006. The paper discusses the nature and causes of environmental change related to rural water use, and provides a taxonomy of the many diverse types. It also examines the issues surrounding possible charges on water use for water related externalities. There have been few attempts by water utilities to incorporate externalities into full cost pricing of irrigation water. The aim of this Staff Working Paper was to: examine {{the extent to which}} charges imposed by irrigation water utilities could address externalities from irrigation water supply and use; and to develop a framework to identify and characterise changes in environmental conditions from the supply and use of irrigation water that may lead to environmental externalities. The authors found that many factors influence the extent to which charging for water would change water use. These include the volume of water available to irrigators, the extent to which trade can occur, the size of the charge or tax, the price responsiveness for irrigation water and the existing mechanisms to address externalities. A tax on water use may increase economic efficiency where external costs are related only to the level of water use. However, such a tax is an unsuitable instrument if the Government’s policy objective is to reduce environmental damage to a predetermined level or to raise a target level of revenue to address the externalities. The views expressed in this paper are those of the staff involved and do not necessarily reflect those of the Productivity Commission. irrigation <b>externalities,</b> water <b>charges,</b> water trading...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of several pricing rules intended to promote entry into a network industry dominated by an incumbent carrier. Drawing {{on the work of}} Cournot and Hotelling, we develop a model of competition between two interconnected networks. In a symmetric equilibrium, the price of cross-network calls exceeds the price of internal calls. This "calling circle discount" tends to "tip" the industry to a monopoly equilibrium as would a network <b>externality.</b> By equalizing <b>charges</b> for terminating calls, reciprocity eliminates differences between internal and cross-network prices and makes monopoly less likely. Imputation counteracts an incentive by the dominant network to "price squeeze" a rival by eliminating differences in the wholesale price of termination and the implicit price for internal use. By increasing profits of rival networks and increasing their subscribers' surplus, imputation supports additional entry. Finally, an unbundling rule reduces termination fees charged by a dominant network that was engaging in pure bundling. Again, entry will be facilitated as rival networks offer potential subscribers a more attractive rate schedule. two-way networks, interconnection, reciprocity, imputation, unbundling...|$|R
