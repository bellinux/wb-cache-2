5|$|In the 18th century Jeremias Friedrich Gülich made {{substantial}} {{contributions to}} refining the <b>dyeing</b> <b>process,</b> making particular progress on setting standards on dyeing sheep wool {{and many other}} textiles. His contributions to refining the dying process and his theories on colour brought much praise by the well known poet and artist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> {{involves}} {{the preparation of}} the yarn {{in order to make it}} susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a mordant. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.|$|E

500|$|Several European-American merchants {{influenced}} Navajo weaving {{during the}} next decades. The first to advertise Navajo textiles in a catalog was C. N. Cotton in 1894. Cotton encouraged professional production and marketing among his peers and the weavers whose work they handled. Another trader named John. B. Moore, who settled in the Chuska Mountains in 1897 attempted {{to improve the quality}} of textiles he traded. He attempted to regulate the cleaning and <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> of artisans who did business with him, and shipped wool intended for higher grade weaving outside the region for factory cleaning. He limited the range of dyes in textiles he traded and refused to deal fabric that had included certain commercially produced yarns. [...] Moore's catalogs identified individual textile pieces rather than illustrating representative styles. He appears to have been instrumental in introducing new motifs to Navajo weaving. Carpets from the Caucasus region were popular among Anglo-Americans at that time. Both the Navajo and the Caucasus weavers worked under similar conditions and in similar styles, so it was relatively simple for them to incorporate Caucasus patterns such as an octagonal motif known as a gul.|$|E
50|$|A special {{characteristic}} of the Sungudi saree is that the knots created {{along the lines of}} the fabric cloth with red pigment prevent colours from intruding into the knotted part of the fabric when it is subject to the <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> in the vat. After the <b>dyeing</b> <b>process,</b> the knots are untied by removing the thread and the knotted parts. In the traditional <b>dyeing</b> <b>process,</b> vegetable dyes are used to obtain different colours. However, in the modern <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> artificial chemical dyes (aniline) like alizarine red, napthol and indigo are used to obtain the red, blue and other colour effects.|$|E
