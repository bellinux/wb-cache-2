40|$|Breaking Through the <b>First</b> <b>Cost</b> Barriers of Sustainable Planning, Design, and Construction John W. Mogge Jr. 377 Pages Directed by Dr. Rita Oberle The {{research}} integrates {{elements of}} the bodies of knowledge for sustainability, planning, design, and construction to create an understanding of green project <b>first</b> <b>cost</b> drivers. It extends conceptual models for sustainable infrastructure and the built environment process by creating a framework based linkage to analyze <b>first</b> <b>cost</b> impacts of sustainable project planning, design, and construction decisions. The framework functions as an analytical bridge between the built environment process and sustainability and is the principal contribution of this research. Through a preliminary analysis of fourteen projects, the work draws out relevant planning, materials and methods, and estimating and scheduling best practices and guiding principles. The work then proposes a <b>first</b> <b>cost</b> impact framework derived from the preliminary analysis as a decision support tool and tests the framework using an expert system derived linguistic database. The test results support the functionality of the framework. The test linguistic database was developed through an interdisciplinary professional expert practitioner interview process using common green project planning, design and construction strategies. The qualitative, interpretative, multi-criteria {{analysis of the data}} used fuzzy set theory and presents findings helpful in understanding green project <b>first</b> <b>cost</b> drivers. The work concludes with an assessment and a discussion of parallel research, and ten recommended areas for further research. Ph. D.

5000|$|Radiant cooling systems offer lower energy {{consumption}} than conventional cooling systems {{based on research}} conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Radiant cooling energy savings depend on the climate, but on average across the US savings {{are in the range}} of 30% compared to conventional systems. Cool, humid regions might have savings of 17% while hot, arid regions have savings of 42%. Hot, dry climates offer the greatest advantage for radiant cooling as they have the largest proportion of cooling by way of removing sensible heat. While this research is informative, more research {{needs to be done to}} account for the limitations of simulation tools and integrated system approaches. Much of the energy savings is also attributed to the lower amount of energy required to pump water as opposed to distribute air with fans. By coupling the system with building mass, radiant cooling can shift some cooling to off-peak night time hours. Radiant cooling appears to have lower <b>first</b> <b>costs</b> [...] and lifecycle costs compared to conventional systems. Lower <b>first</b> <b>costs</b> are largely attributed to integration with structure and design elements, while lower life cycle costs result from decreased maintenance.

For commercial and industrial firms to turn to this alternate energy source, the <b>first</b> <b>cost</b> must be sharply reduced so that the annual savings that are achievable will provide an attractive return on the incremental investment. This paper discusses one proven method of combining the energy efficiency of high temperature industrial heat pumps with solar collectors that result in an installed <b>first</b> <b>cost</b> that approximates one half of that of conventional solar systems. This technology is now available for producing up to 220 F hot water for industrial process heat, space heating, and service hot water heating. The basic principles of the technology are reviewed, including the typical operating characteristics of the industrial heat pumps and the solar collectors, plus the generic application schematics comparing this approach with conventional solar collector only systems. Several case histories are reviewed, including an industrial plant, townhouse project, and hospital. Not only is a lower <b>first</b> <b>cost</b> demonstrated, but the combination uses small solar arrays, ideal where roof area is limited, and use less expensive solar collectors...|$|R

However, to date, there is no firm empirical data on the costs involved in copying. This is likely because, <b>first,</b> <b>costs</b> are hard to determine quantitatively and, second, because the entire field of mate choice copying is relatively new and, thus, has not yet received as much attention from scientists.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{explanations}} {{have been}} proposed as evidence for why mate desertion by males is more commonly observed in nature. <b>First,</b> <b>costs</b> in lost mating opportunities are higher in males than in females. Because males have greater variance in reproductive success, their lifetime reproductive success depends more on number of mating opportunities, and thus they often benefit more from desertion. Second, mode of fertilization often influences degree of parental care, which in turn influences which sex will desert. Generally speaking, male parental care is predicted by external fertilization, and female parental care is predicted by internal fertilization. This pattern of parental care is best explained by the “Association Hypothesis," [...] which argues that association with embryos predisposes a sex for parental care. For example, in species where mate desertion by males is prominent, females reproduce through internal fertilization and are thus responsible for carrying the eggs. While this intimate connection allows the female to offer better care for her offspring, the male's comparative separation makes him {{much less likely to}} be able to adequately care for his young. Furthermore, inherent to internal fertilization is the fact that it is impossible for females to desert because they are the sex bearing offspring. Under this theory, females are often not in a position to leave their young, while males can leave and have much less to offer by sticking around. Conversely, in organisms that practice external fertilization—including certain species of fish—males are often the primary caretakers for young.|$|E

By using a detailed computer simulation method, this study compared the energy consumption of a displacement ventilation system {{with that of a}} mixing ventilation system for three types of U.

The study showed that a displacement ventilation system might use more fan energy and less chiller and boiler energy than a mixing ventilation system. The total energy consumption is slightly less with a displacement ventilation system. The displacement ventilation system requires a larger air-handling unit and a smaller chiller than the mixing ventilation system does. The <b>first</b> <b>costs</b> are lower for displacement ventilation if the system is applied in the core region of a building.
