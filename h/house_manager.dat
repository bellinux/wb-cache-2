40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the meaning of professionalism in the {{occupation}} of housing management. It will explore the meaning of being a professional <b>housing</b> <b>manager</b> in a profession which has some of the traits of being a 'semi-profession' (Etzioni, 1969). It asks how <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> view professionalism and what is its relevance, if any, to their working lives. It is primarily concerned with four key aspects of professionalism: identity, knowledge, boundaries and accountability. Analysis of these four aspects of professionalism are informed by social constructionism, ethnomethodology and ethnography. The sociology of the professions is used as a substantive literature to illuminate fieldwork data and provide new directions for the evolution of theory relating to housing management. Qualitative methods of data collection and analysis have been used to provide detail and depth in presenting a picture of the issues under investigation. Data was primarily collected from forty-nine interviews, supported by data collected from three separate periods of participant observation. The thesis argues that professionalism in housing management is an individualised project of the self rather than a collective project. Professionalism is expressed as an individualised response to, and a mediation of, competing managerial demands. <b>Housing</b> <b>managers</b> work upon themselves {{to meet the demands of}} their customers and their employers. The 'professional project of the self is influenced by their backgrounds, specifically their own beliefs and values regarding what it is to be a professional <b>housing</b> <b>manager.</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>managers</b> engage in negotiating the boundaries of knowledge and emotions in order to deliver a professional service. Accountability is expressed as a component part of professionalism, i. e. the ability to give an account of their actions, as well a response to formal performance measures. The thesis identifies two categories of <b>housing</b> <b>managers,</b> 'pragmatists' and 'pro-activists', who are distinguished from each other in their construction of professionalism. This study suggests that the concept of professionalism continues to exert a considerable influence on the thoughts and behaviours of these <b>housing</b> <b>managers.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This research was therefore undertaken to discover how <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> viewed their world. More specifically, the aim was to examine the way in which <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> defined and delineated their role, and thus socially constructed the nature and scope of housing management in interaction with tenants and people from other occupational groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ideologies of care, or {{systems of}} {{beliefs about the}} {{importance}} of particu-lar goals and activities, help guide how care is provided. One currently pervasive ideology of care is that of normalization. In this paper, the ideologies of care of both <b>house</b> <b>managers</b> and direct care staff in group homes are contrasted. Results indicate that the ideology of d irect care staff is less differentiated than that of the <b>house</b> <b>managers.</b> In addition, <b>house</b> <b>managers</b> are more l ikely to subscribe to a normalizat ion ideology and less l ikely to subscribe to a family orientation ideology than are direct care staff. Ideological differences between <b>house</b> <b>managers</b> and direct care staff are only part ia l ly explained by differences in the demographic composition of the two groups. In the human service arena, certain principles and goals help guide how care is provided to clients. For example, normalization has been a guiding principle for the provision of services to individuals {{with a wide variety of}} disabilities, particularly individuals with developmental dis-abilities (DD) and mental illness (MI). Despite the pervasiveness of the concept of normalization as an ideology of care, much disagreement remains about he meaning of the term, and about how to operational...|$|R

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} Housing Department is {{to provide}} quality {{services}} to tenants and owners of public housing estates which include Public Rental Housing and Subsidized Home Ownership Housing. This dissertation is confined to study on the areas of direct-managed Public Rental Housing and Home Ownership Scheme Courts of which the property management duties are delegated to the Property Management Agents. Under this mode, the Housing Department is responsible for property and tenancy management of Public Rental Housing, the ownership management of owners {{as well as on}} the carving-out areas of the Home Ownership Scheme Courts. Following the rising demand of the residents/owners, the role of <b>housing</b> <b>manager</b> has changed from a mere service provider to both a service provider and a negotiator. By experience, most <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> are using conciliation and negotiation skills for dispute resolution in housing management. If complaints are not solved in the frontline, the complainants may escalate the issues to the higher level which will involve more follow-up actions and damage the harmonious relationship with our customers. Therefore, it is essential for <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> to improve their communication and negotiation skills. Surely, their management work will be smoother if they can work with the residents/owners in harmony. On the other hand, mediation is a negotiation process which is considered as one of the best Alternative Dispute Resolution methods. Mediation is conducted by an impartial third party, the mediator, to resolve parties’ disputes. Mediation process can provide a platform for the disputing parties to focus on perception and communication. Mediator will facilitate the parties to choose the most suitable options generated by them for dispute settlement which results in a win-win situation. In this way, relationship between the disputing parties can be improved. Nowadays, <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> also have the aim to maintain harmonious relationship with residents/owners. While I expect that <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> are using some of the mediation skills but not all, I would like to explore the types of mediation skills which can be used in housing management in the public sector. From the empirical literature review, I have introduced the development of mediation in different countries and Hong Kong and also the development of housing management in the public sector in Hong Kong. In the conceptual context, I have introduced mediation process, mediation skills and the core features of mediation. I have also explained the dispute resolution skills used by <b>housing</b> <b>managers</b> in the daily management.

40|$|Since {{the formal}} {{announcement}} of the guiding principles of sustainable development in the 1999 Policy Address, sustainable development has become a hot topic in various industries. Housing management {{is one of the}} fields that sustainable development principles could be taken place. It was believed that the diversified job natures of housing management give potential opportunities to enhance sustainable development. The aim of the project is to find absent the potential roles of housing manger in contributing the sustainable development. Before applying the concept of sustainable development into housing management, in order to study the rationale behind this concept, the emerge of this idea and its historical development would be discussed. While the functions of <b>housing</b> <b>manager</b> were differentiated in different countries and different properties, the fundamental job function would be discovered, followed by the evolution of change till the modern century. To investigate the prospective relationships between the living environment and sustainable development, residential property was chosen as the scope of this study. Six residential apartments with different scales and different management structures were selected for case studies. It was found that there are numbers of opportunities for <b>housing</b> <b>manager</b> to enhance the sustainable development in the housing estates, while most of these opportunities were related to the job functions of <b>housing</b> <b>manager.</b> The study found that <b>housing</b> <b>manager</b> could be a good facilitator to integrate the effort of all stakeholders in constructing a sustainable living community. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
