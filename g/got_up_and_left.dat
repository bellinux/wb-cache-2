5|$|The opening credit {{sequence}} {{was designed}} by graphic artist Robert Brownjohn, featuring clips of all James Bond films thus far projected on Margaret Nolan's body.

25|$|On 2 November 2012, as Henry {{was telling}} the story of how he had injured his finger the {{previous}} day, his co-presenters and crew slowly left the set, until Henry was left sitting on his own at the desk, in the dark. He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left,</b> before the show cut to a commercial break, after which everybody had returned.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy's {{assassination}} {{had always}} {{had a profound effect}} on Stone: [...] "The Kennedy murder was one of the signal events of the postwar generation, my generation." [...] Stone met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. Garrison stood up to Stone's questioning and then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left.</b> His pride and dignity impressed the director. Stone's impressions from their meeting were that Garrison [...] "made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept for}} the titles came from {{designer}} Robert Brownjohn, {{who worked on}} From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, before he fell out with producer Harry Saltzman and left the series. In creating the titles, Brownjohn was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> a cinema; he was also influenced by constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy projecting light on to clouds in the 1920s. Brownjohn also used the effect in the poster he created for Goldfinger. [...] Designer Maurice Binder, who had worked on the first Bond film, Dr. No, {{had been unable to}} work on either From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but returned for Thunderball, where he retained Brownjohn's concept for the titles. Binder eventually worked on thirteen Bond films and after his death in 1991, the opening credits were done by Daniel Kleinman. This changed for Quantum of Solace, with the studio MK12 taking control. Kleinman returned to direct the Skyfall title sequence, and the title sequence for Spectre.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} {{was not an}} easy one. According to Northrup, Hubbard began beating her when they were in Florida in the summer of 1946. Her father had just died and her grief appeared to aggravate Hubbard, who was attempting to restart his pre-war career of writing pulp fiction. He was struggling with constant writer's block and leaned heavily on Northrup to provide plot ideas and even to help write some of his stories. She later recalled: [...] "I would often entertain him with plots so he could write. I loved to make plots. The Ole Doc Methuselah series was done that way." [...] One night while they were living beside a frozen lake in Stroudsburg, Hubbard hit her across the face with his [...]45 pistol. She recalled that [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> the house in the night and walked on the ice of the lake because I was terrified." [...] Despite her shock and humiliation, she felt compelled to return to Hubbard. He was severely depressed and repeatedly threatened suicide, and Northrup believed [...] "he must be suffering or he wouldn't act that way".|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Roylake was nearest to me. I {{appealed to}} her womanly sympathies, and was {{answered}} by tears.

2500|$|It premiered at the 24th Telluride Film Festival on August 29, 1997. During the screening, {{numerous}} people <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> {{during the}} initial cat drowning sequence. Three months later, Werner Herzog called Korine to give praise to the film overall, especially the bacon taped to the wall during the bathtub scene. He told The New York Times, [...] "When I saw a piece of fried bacon fixed to the bathroom wall in Gummo, it knocked me off my chair. [...] a very clear voice of a generation of filmmakers that is taking a new position. It's not going to dominate world cinema, but so what?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, he {{was again}} accused of making {{insensitive}} jokes about cancer sufferers, blind people, {{a woman in}} a wheelchair, and the recent trial over the murder of Damilola Taylor, prompting a woman to walk out of the show in disgust. Davidson vehemently denied the charge, claiming that jokes about blind people and cancer sufferers would have merited a [...] "mass walkout". He also said the comments about the Damilola Taylor trial were taken out of context: [...] "My actual remark was that I thought the killers should be locked away forever. And if she objects to that then that is her prerogative. Davidson was also quoted as saying [...] "If what I was saying was true I would have <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> myself". There were no other complaints about his performance on that night.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, On the Waterfront {{received}} glowing {{reviews from}} critics {{and was a}} commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2million in rentals at the North American box office in 1954. In his July 29, 1954, review, The New York Times critic A. H. Weiler praised the film, calling it [...] "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film, stating that Brando and Kazan changed acting in American films forever and added it to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. In his autobiography, Brando was typically dismissive of his performance: [...] "On the day Gadg showed me the complete picture, I was so depressed by my performance I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> the screening room... I thought I was a huge failure." [...] After Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor, the statue was stolen. Much later, it turned up at a London auction house, which contacted the actor and informed him of its whereabouts.|$|E
50|$|In 1976 she and {{her sister}} Adoor Bhavani started a Theater troupe called Adoor Jaya Theaters. But later the sisters <b>got</b> split <b>up</b> <b>and</b> Bhavani <b>left</b> the Theater.

50|$|On {{the morning}} of October 24, Martin Risch <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early <b>and</b> <b>left</b> the house in his car for Logan Airport to catch an 8a.m. flight to New York City. It was a {{business}} trip he had planned earlier, and his intention was to stay overnight in Manhattan. Shortly after his departure, Joan woke the children and served them breakfast. She took her son {{across the street to}} the house of a neighbor, Barbara Barker, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> in her car, a blue 1951 Chevrolet, with Lillian for a dentist appointment in Bedford, whom Morton had recommended.|$|R
5000|$|After this, Sahu's heart becomes {{lighter and}} he is now ready to join his parents and take his cat. Big Bird and Snuffy then exit the museum, look up into the night sky, and see four stars in a {{straight}} line (representing Sahu, his parents, and his cat), and are glad that they reunited Sahu with his parents. When morning comes, Big Bird finds the group and Snuffy is not there. He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early <b>and</b> <b>left</b> to get to [...] "Snufflegarden." [...] Cookie Monster is promised anything on a hot dog stand as a special reward for not eating anything in the museum, and decides to eat the entire stand.|$|R
2500|$|On August 12, 2006 Timothy James Truett of Montgomery Village {{allegedly}} made a [...] "call to Ali's {{office in}} which he asked if Ali was a Muslim and made derogatory remarks about Islam to Ali's campaign manager." [...] Afterward, Truett drove to [...] "the cul-de-sac outside Ali's Gaithersburg home, which doubles as his campaign office." [...] There, {{he sat down in}} a lawn chair near the home [...] "with a hand-lettered sign bearing a crude denunciation of Islam" [...] Truett [...] "wore a T-shirt reading 'This mind is an Allah-free zone'." [...] Ali went out to look at the man and take pictures but did not speak to him, explaining [...] "I knew he was there to bait me." [...] Ali later recalled [...] "I felt like he was intimidating and trying to menace me and my family, similar to when people burned crosses in someone's front yard. I think it was the exact same message." [...] Ali's wife stepped outside and took pictures of Truett. [...] An older man approached Truett and offered him some water. Ali then spoke to the older man and the older man went back inside. Ali placed one of his campaign yard signs next to Truett and took a picture. [...] Truett then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left.</b> Ali followed him and got pictures of his license plate. Truett then phoned Ali's office again but was hung up on. [...] Ali later posted pictures of Truett, Truett's birth date and address on his campaign web site.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] {{has several}} key plot {{elements}} {{that differ from}} the theatrical release. The alien gestates in an ox rather than a dog, {{and one of the}} inmates discovers a dead facehugger. Ripley's unconscious body washes up on the shore of the planet in the Assembly Cut instead of being found in the ship's wreckage as in the theatrical cut. Some scenes are extended to focus more on the religious views of the inmates. The inmates succeed in their attempt to trap the alien, but it is later released by the disturbed inmate Golic. In this version, the alien Queen does not burst from Ripley's chest as she falls into the furnace. There is also a scene in the prison's assembly hall in which one of the inmates suggests to Dillon that they lead the creature to the furnace so that they can incinerate it. One notable scene that was not restored for the DVD or Blu-ray extended versions was the full autopsy scene. Greg Cannom, who worked on the special make-up effects, said in the Alien Quadrilogy special features that, [...] "I saw the rough cut of the film, uncut, and there were some scenes in there that were pretty gross. There was an autopsy scene on the girl [...] and I like certain gore in the films. I do it , and it made me sick. It really grossed me out and I remember people <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left,</b> walked out of the theatre and I was just thinking, 'This will never be in the film. They can't show this stuff.' It was just too much I thought. And when the film came out, it wasn't in the film." ...|$|E

60|$|Estella <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{abruptly}} <b>and</b> <b>left</b> the room. She {{was angry}} and jealous, {{but she thought}} Spencer would follow her. When he did not, she could not believe it. She waited on the porch for him, not knowing whether she were more angry or miserable. She would not {{go back into the}} room. Vivienne LeMar had stopped singing. She could hear a low murmur of voices. When she had waited there an hour, she went in and upstairs to her room with ostentatious footsteps. She was too angry to cry or to realize what had happened, and still kept hoping all sorts of impossible things as she sat by her window.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{discrepancies}} {{have been}} observed. Moltke {{notes that in}} his July 27, 1998, interview on Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell, Strieber said that the Master of the Key <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> abruptly <b>left</b> {{in the middle of}} the conversation. In 2001, he finished the conversation and gave Strieber a white liquid to drink. In one account, Strieber woke up the next day and his notes were [...] "lying on the table beside the bed", while in another account they were [...] "on the floor". In one account, the glass from which he drank the white liquid was [...] "clean" [...] with no trace of the mysterious white liquid, while in another, it was [...] "gone".|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> Dick <b>left</b> the library; {{but he did}} {{not sleep}} that night. It had been hard to meet his father and what he said had left a wound that would take long to heal. Now he must say good-by to Helen. This would need courage, but Dick meant to see her. It was the girl's right that she should hear his story, and he would not steal away like a cur. He did not think Helen was really fond of him, though he {{imagined}} that she would have acquiesced in her relatives' plans for them both had things been different. Now, of course, that was done with, but he must say good-by and she might show some regret or sympathy. He did not want her to suffer, {{but he did not}} think she would feel the parting much; and she would not treat him as his father had done.|$|R
60|$|Phineas Duge {{held out}} his hand, and in {{obedience}} to a gesture, the secretary <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> the room.|$|E

50|$|Daniels and {{the theater}} {{department}} {{were scheduled to}} start preparing sets for a production of Spamalot that fall. That night, she and Nichols decided to watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the film on which that musical is based, for inspiration and relaxation, after which the two retired to their bedrooms as they both had to work the next morning. At 5 a.m., Nichols recalled that he heard {{the door to the}} house open and close several times. He looked outside from his room, thinking it might be Daniels, but did not see her.When he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> later <b>and</b> <b>left</b> for work around 7 a.m., Daniels' car, a gray Toyota 4Runner, was gone. He assumed she, too, had gone to work. Her parents, however, say it was unusual for her to get up early; in situations where she had to, she would usually leave only right before the time she had to be wherever it was.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> brusquely, sighed, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> me, saying: [...] "We will dine {{in half an}} hour." [...] Without moving I {{listened to}} his quick steps resounding on the waxed floor of the next room, {{traversing}} the anteroom lined with bookshelves, where he paused to put his chibouk in the pipe-stand before passing into the drawing-room (these were all en suite), where he became inaudible on the thick carpet. But I heard {{the door of his}} study-bedroom close. He was then sixty-two years old and had been for {{a quarter of a century}} the wisest, the firmest, the most indulgent of guardians, extending over me a paternal care and affection, a moral support which I seemed to feel always near me in the most distant parts of the earth.|$|R
50|$|Police {{immediately}} became suspicious {{when they}} received information that Pfister had in fact, returned home early from vacation. Kathy Carpenter {{told them that}} she had picked Pfister up from the airport, driven her home, and was asked by Pfister if she could stay at the house over the weekend. After spending the weekend with Pfister, Carpenter <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early <b>and</b> <b>left</b> for work, leaving Pfister alone at the house. Carpenter left {{a note on the}} door for guests, saying that Pfister was sleeping, and to call her to see if she was awake enough to talk before entering the house. Another one of Nancy's friends, Billy Clayton, said {{that he did not want}} to bother Pfister while she was sleeping, so he sent her an email. Pfister never replied back. Things became even more strange on Wednesday, when Pfister's roommates, Trey and Nancy Styler, called Kathy Carpenter to tell them that they had recently moved out. They told her that they had moved into a motel in Basalt, Colorado, only returning to the home to clear out their belongings. Carpenter, as well as the police, found it odd that the Stylers had not once seen Pfister in her own home. Nancy Styler came upon Pfister's dog, Gabe. The dog had obviously been alone for a while, given that the dog's food and water dishes were empty. Carpenter drove over to pick <b>up</b> the dog, <b>and</b> decided to check up on her later that night, when she found Nancy's body in the closet.|$|R
