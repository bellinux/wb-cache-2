5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, <b>javelin</b> throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the <b>javelin</b> was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two <b>javelin</b> competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the <b>javelin</b> for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the <b>javelin</b> that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The <b>javelin</b> throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the <b>javelin</b> before the foul line.|$|E
5|$|The first Olympic men's <b>javelin</b> throw contest {{was held}} in 1908 and a women's {{competition}} was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow <b>javelin,</b> then a metal <b>javelin,</b> both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed <b>javelin</b> and throws reached in excess of 100m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and {{the increasing number of}} horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's <b>javelin</b> to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books. The women's <b>javelin</b> underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current <b>javelin</b> specifications are 2.6 to 2.7m in length and 800grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3m and 600g for women.|$|E

5|$|New Dennis <b>Javelin</b> {{coaches were}} {{introduced}} to route X43 by Stagecoach {{in response to the}} competition from Charterplan in 1992. The route was marketed as The Mancunian, with the vehicles carrying the name alongside Stagecoach corporate livery. The route was briefly operated with articulated coaches in 1996, but this proved short-lived owing to restrictions on their use in Rawtenstall, with services returning to <b>Javelin</b> operation.|$|E
5|$|Andreas Thorkildsen (born 1 April 1982) is {{a retired}} Norwegian track and field athlete who competed in the <b>javelin</b> throw. He was the Olympic Champion in 2004 and 2008, European Champion in 2006 and 2010, and World Champion in 2009. He is the first male <b>javelin</b> thrower in history to {{simultaneously}} be European, World and Olympic Champion. He was also a three-time silver medalist at the World Championships, placing second in 2005, 2007 and 2011. His personal best of 91.59 m, set in 2006, is the Norwegian record.|$|E
5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle line, behind hastati of the first line {{and in front of}} the triarii in the third. In a pitched battle, the leves, <b>javelin</b> armed light infantry would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with <b>javelin</b> fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen.|$|E
25|$|The Almogavars were a {{class of}} Aragonese infantrymen armed with a short sword, a shield and two heavy <b>javelins,</b> known as azcona. The {{equipment}} resembled that of a Roman legionary {{and the use of}} the heavy <b>javelins</b> was much the same.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 132 <b>Javelins</b> were {{purchased}} during 1971 and 1972. The <b>Javelins</b> came with 401 CID L [...] AMC V8 engines.

5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The <b>javelin</b> throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The <b>javelin</b> throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the <b>javelin</b> has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E

With a best mark distance of 56.27, Evans ranked thirtieth overall. She did not advance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Javelins</b> were {{employed}} as a powerful ranged weapon by many cavalries. They were easy to handle on horseback. Two to ten <b>javelins</b> would be carried, depending on their weight. Thrown <b>javelins</b> have less range than composite bows, but often prevailed in use nevertheless. Due to {{the mass of the}} weapon, there was a greater armour-piercing ability, and they thus caused fatal wounds more frequently. Usage is reported for both light and heavy cavalry, for example, by Numidia and the Mongol's light cavalry and the heavy cataphracts, Celtic cavalry and the Mamluks during the Crusades. The Celtic horsemen's training was copied by the Roman equites. A significant element learned from the Celts was turning on horseback to throw <b>javelins</b> backwards, similar to the Parthian shot in archery.|$|R

50|$|Javelineers are {{generally}} considered to be an archer/melee hybrid, using powerful <b>javelins</b> at range and a spear/buckler combination in melee combat. The <b>javelins</b> have the shortest range of all archer weapons and they are the hardest to aim, but they are fast and deal high amounts of damage.|$|R
