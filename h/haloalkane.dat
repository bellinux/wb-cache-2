25|$|Because {{halogenated}} ethanes can undergo further {{free radical}} halogenation, this process {{results in a}} mixture of several halogenated products. In the chemical industry, more selective chemical reactions are used for the production of any particular two-carbon <b>haloalkane.</b>|$|E
25|$|The α-carbon is {{important}} for enol- and enolate-based carbonyl chemistry as well. Chemical transformations affected by the conversion to either an enolate or an enol, in general, lead to the α-carbon acting as a nucleophile, becoming, for example, alkylated {{in the presence of}} primary <b>haloalkane.</b> An exception is in reaction with silyl -chlorides, -bromides, and -iodides, where the oxygen acts as the nucleophile to produce silyl enol ether.|$|E
25|$|Tetrafluoromethane, {{also known}} as carbon tetrafluoride, is the {{simplest}} fluorocarbon (CF4). It has a very high bond strength {{due to the nature}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. It can also be classified as a <b>haloalkane</b> or halomethane. Because of the multiple carbon–fluorine bonds, and the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon in tetrafluoromethane has a significant positive partial charge which strengthens and shortens the four carbon–fluorine bonds by providing additional ionic character. Tetrafluoromethane is a potent greenhouse gas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haloalkanes</b> undergo free-radical {{reactions}} with elemental magnesium to give alkylmagnesium compounds: Grignard reagents. <b>Haloalkanes</b> also {{react with}} lithium metal to give organolithium compounds. Both Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds behave as the R− synthon. Alkali metals such as sodium and lithium {{are able to}} cause <b>haloalkanes</b> to couple in the Wurtz reaction, giving symmetrical alkanes. <b>Haloalkanes,</b> especially iodoalkanes, also undergo oxidative addition reactions to give organometallic compounds.|$|R
2500|$|From the {{structural}} perspective, <b>haloalkanes</b> {{can be classified}} according to the connectivity of the carbon atom to which the halogen is attached. In primary (1°) <b>haloalkanes,</b> the carbon that carries the halogen atom is only attached to one other alkyl group. An example is chloroethane (...) [...] In secondary (2°) <b>haloalkanes,</b> the carbon that carries the halogen atom has two C–C bonds. In tertiary (3°) <b>haloalkanes,</b> the carbon that carries the halogen atom has three C–C bonds.|$|R
25|$|<b>Haloalkanes</b> {{can also}} be {{classified}} according {{to the type of}} halogen on group 7 responding to a specific halogenoalkane. <b>Haloalkanes</b> containing carbon bonded to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine results in organofluorine, organochlorine, organobromine and organoiodine compounds, respectively. Compounds containing more than one kind of halogen are also possible. Several classes of widely used <b>haloalkanes</b> are classified in this way chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These abbreviations are particularly common in discussions of the environmental impact of <b>haloalkanes.</b>|$|R
500|$|Between 1928 and 1933, Conant {{published}} 55 papers. Much of his research, {{like his}} double thesis, combined natural product chemistry with physical organic chemistry. Based on his exploration of reaction rates in chemical equilibria, Conant {{was one of}} the first to recognise that the kinetics of these systems is sometimes straightforward and simple, yet quite complex in other cases. Conant studied the effect of <b>haloalkane</b> structure on the rate of substitution with inorganic iodide salts which, together with earlier work, led to what is now known as either the Conant-Finkelstein reaction or more commonly simply the Finkelstein reaction. [...] A recent application of this reaction involved the preparation of an iodinated polyvinyl chloride from regular PVC. A combination of Conant's work on the kinetics of hydrogenation and George Kistiakowsky's work on the enthalpy changes of these reactions supported the later development of the theory of hyperconjugation.|$|E

25|$|While most <b>haloalkanes</b> are human-produced, non-artificial-source <b>haloalkanes</b> {{do occur}} on Earth, mostly through enzyme-mediated {{synthesis}} by bacteria, fungi, and especially sea macroalgae (seaweeds). More than 1600 halogenated organics have been identified, with bromoalkanes {{being the most}} common <b>haloalkanes.</b> Brominated organics in biology range from biologically produced methyl bromide to non-alkane aromatics and unsaturates (indoles, terpenes, acetogenins, and phenols). Halogenated alkanes in land plants are more rare, but do occur, as for example the fluoroacetate produced as a toxin by at least 40 species of known plants.

50|$|Before {{they became}} {{strictly}} regulated, {{the general public}} often encountered <b>haloalkanes</b> as paint and cleaning solvents such as trichloroethane (1,1,1-trichloroethane) and carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane), pesticides like 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB, ethylene dibromide), and refrigerants like Freon-22 (duPont trademark for chlorodifluoromethane). Some <b>haloalkanes</b> are still widely used for industrial cleaning, such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane), and as refrigerants, such as R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).|$|R
2500|$|The haloalkanes (also {{known as}} halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are {{a group of}} {{chemical}} compounds derived from alkanes containing one or more halogens. They are {{a subset of the}} general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially and, consequently, are known under many chemical and commercial names. They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes which contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter.

2500|$|<b>Haloalkanes</b> {{generally}} {{resemble the}} parent alkanes in being colorless, relatively odorless, and hydrophobic. Their boiling points {{are higher than}} the corresponding alkanes and scale with the atomic weight and number of halides. This {{is due to the}} increased strength of the intermolecular forces—from London dispersion to dipole-dipole interaction because of the increased polarity. Thus carbon tetraiodide (...) is a solid whereas carbon tetrafluoride (...) is a gas. As they contain fewer C–H bonds, halocarbons are less flammable than alkanes, and some are used in fire extinguishers. <b>Haloalkanes</b> are better solvents than the corresponding alkanes because of their increased polarity. <b>Haloalkanes</b> containing halogens other than fluorine are more reactive than the parent alkanes—it is this reactivity that is the basis of most controversies. Many are alkylating agents, with primary <b>haloalkanes</b> and those containing heavier halogens being the most active (fluoroalkanes do not act as alkylating agents under normal conditions). The ozone-depleting abilities of the CFCs arises from the photolability of the C–Cl bond.|$|R
