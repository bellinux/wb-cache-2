Conventional formulas, based on annual temperature range (A) and latitude (??), have adjustment constants to give limits to the index. Conrad's formula, K = (1. 7 A/ sin(?? + 10 ??)) - 14, is most widely used. RADRIC, the ratio of annual and daily temperature ranges, has been proposed by Professor Arnold Court as a simple <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>continentality,</b> using no adjustment factors except division by ten to make it numerically similar to other indices.

40|$|Evaluation {{of climate}} continentality, {{an attempt to}} create new method This {{bachelor}} thesis deals with the thermal climate continentality of Europe and exclusively and more thoroughly of the Czech Republic. Various definitions of continentality are stated in the beginning. The thesis offers {{an overview of the}} most notorious known indexes yet discovered which determine a degree of the continentality. The goal of the thesis was to find a new method of expressing the continentality degree and its verification in praxis. This method is based on a time shift of one-year air temperature development from development of extraterrestrial radiation. It was proved through a research of data from 443 european and 151 Czech meteorological stations that the time shift of average air temperatures and that of the extraterrestrial radiation gets smaller the more inland location of the survey station is and in contrary gets bigger with the altitude of the survey station. Therefore the initial hypothesis was verified and a new C <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>continentality</b> was defined. It was proved through this index that for the area of Europe the continentality depends mostly upon the distance from the coast and the more thorough research of continentality of Czech Republic proved mainly its dependency on altitude.

40|$|The {{identification}} of different climatic zones {{can be an}} important factor for decision-makers in various fields such as urban planning and agricultural alternatives. In order to characterize the climates of the region of Bahía de Banderas (BB) Mexico, we adopted a methodology that combines the use of the Köppen climate classification modified by Garc. a for Mexico and methods of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We used simple regression between temperature (dependent variable) and height as independent variable. Multiple regressions were applied for rainfall (dependent variable) and geographical data as independent variables (thermal continentality, thermopluviometric index and slope). The temperature and precipitation data were obtained from the Comisión Nacional del Agua, and ERIC III, 2006 database. Information from geographical variables was obtained from a Digital Elevation Model and Gorzynski’s <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> <b>Continentality.</b> The coefficients of simple and multiple regressions were used to construct digital maps of annual temperature and precipitation via GIS. With these maps and using the CCK-EG tool, we generated the final map of climatic characterization. The result was highly representative. The determination coefficients were 0. 82 and 0. 39 for temperature and precipitation respectively. The resulting classification for each of the stations was located in their corresponding climate zone on the final map. Zones and climatic limits were identified for this study region...|$|E
40|$|This thesis' {{topics are}} {{measurements}} <b>of</b> climate's <b>continentality</b> and evaluations <b>of</b> relations between various <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> thermic and ombric continentalities. All indexes are plotted on <b>continentality</b> maps <b>of</b> Europe created using the ArcGIS application. Important {{part of the}} thesis consists of practical validation of relevancy of the new method for measuring degree <b>of</b> <b>continentality</b> based on research of phase shift (delay) of annual temperature diagram {{in relation to the}} sum of extraterrestrial radiation. This thesis deals mainly with the proof of closest relation between newly purposed <b>index</b> <b>of</b> thermic <b>continentality</b> and the pre-existing ombric indexes in comparison to the <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> thermic <b>continentality</b> currently in use. Furthermore the thesis dwells into explanations of causes for territorial differences in new continentality index values related to circulatory and radiatory ratios of the Indian summer subseason.

Previous work established the unexpected result that a mean annual climate warming of c. 0. 6 °C since the 1940 's has not led to upward movement of the forest limit. Here we explore {{the relative importance of}} summer and winter climatic conditions on growth and age-class structure of the treeline forming species, Dracophyllum longifolium and Dracophyllum scoparium over {{the second half of the}} 20 th century. The relationship between climate and growth and establishment were evaluated using standard dendroecological methods and local climate data from a meteorological station on the island. Growth and establishment were correlated against climate variables and further evaluated within hierarchical regression models to take into account the effect of plot level variables. Winter climatic conditions exerted a greater effect on growth and establishment than summer climatic conditions. Establishment is maximized under warm (mean winter temperatures > 7 °C), dry winters (total winter precipitation < 400 mm). Growth, on the other hand, is adversely affected by wide winter temperature ranges and increased rainfall. The contrasting effect of winter warmth on growth and establishment suggests that winter temperature affects growth and establishment through differing mechanisms. We propose that milder winters enhance survival of seedlings and, therefore, recruitment, but increases metabolic stress on established plants, resulting in lower growth rates. Future winter warming may therefore have complex effects on plant growth and establishment globally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Globularia alypum is a {{perennial}} shrub typical of western Mediterranean thermophilous shrublands. Nine populations of G. alypum located in different localities of Catalonia (NE Spain) were surveyed for flowering phenol-ogy. Flower-head buds {{were present in}} all the populations in July. Flowering time in the area spans from the late summer–early autumn to the next spring depending on the populations; there are two groups of populations, early and late flowering. Early populations grow mostly in coastal localities and flower from September to November, whereas late flowering populations grow in inland localities and flower from February to April. The flowering order of the populations correlated with minimum temperature of most months except the warmest ones, and correlated with maximum and mean temperatures of the coldest months. Correlations were similar when tested with annual climate. The flowering order also correlated with the thermic interval for most months except the coldest and with the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>continentality.</b> Early populations alone did not present correlations with any variable, whereas late pop-ulations alone correlated similarly to all populations together. Flowering order did not correlate with precipita-tion. Late populations are proposed to be regulated by temperature according to our results whereas early pop-ulations could be regulated by timing in precipitation after summer drought, according to published results. We discuss the possibilities of the two flowering patterns, early and late, being due to phenotypic plasticity or to genetic adaptation to local climates. We also discuss the consequences at the plant and ecosystem level of climate warming causing shifts from late to early patterns, a possibility that is likely in the warmest of the late populations if flowering is modulated phenotypically...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{availability}} {{is considered}} limiting for plant growth at the forest-tundra ecotone, {{and it might}} modulate ecosystem response to climate warming. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare the impact of climate, vegetation cover, and soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry on N mineralization rates at the forest-tundra ecotone. We therefore estimated N mineralization in mountain birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. czerepanovii) forest and tundra soil across a broad-scale latitudinal gradient in Fennoscandia, which incorporated 4 research sites (Dovrefjell, Vassijaure, Abisko, and Joatka). During the summer period, ammonium was the dominant form of mineralized nitrogen in forest soils, while nitrate mineralization rates were higher at tundra sites during the winter. A negative regression relationship between an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> climatic <b>continentality</b> and N mineralization was found. Further, summer NH 4 + mineralization rates increased with total N content in soils, while NO 3 - mineralization seemed to be associated with C availability. Our study showed markedly contrasting inorganic N release in forest and tundra soil, and that, although mineralization rates differed between the summer and winter period, the winter activity was relatively high and should not be ignored. We conclude that a shift in the forest-tundra ecotone in response to climate warming will have stronger effects on nitrogen availability at these sites than the direct effects of warming. © 2005 Regents of the University of Colorado...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the statistical analysis of biomass and NPP estimates from vast forest areas in relation to climatic conditions. The analysis was based on biomass data in 1236 sample plots as well as both NPP and biomass estimates in 480 sample plots that were established in mixed spruce and fir stands. Data were available for the entire Eurasian territory from the UK to South China and Japan, and included information on both total biomass and various biomass components. The climatic conditions of the sampled forests were characterized by using specific <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> zonality and <b>continentality.</b> A system <b>of</b> recursive equations was fitted to the data using standard regression analysis. For both the aboveground and total NPP, we found a statistically significant increase from the North to the South, but also a decrease from both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts towards the continental center of Siberia. We also found that lower upper-story NPP is compensated by higher understory NPP and vice versa. On the other hand, inconsistencies were identified concerning the share of root biomass in relation to the continentality index...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to a new aspect {{in the study of}} {{biological}} productivity of forest ecosystems on a geographical basis, expressed indirectly by climate parameters. Some features of change of specific net primary production (SNPP) of forest–forming species in Eurasia in the transcontinental gradients are shown for the first time using the voluminous factual material. SNPP represents the ratio of net primary production (NPP) to biomass and is expressed in relative units or percentage (by analogy with the percentage of the current stem volume increment that is used in traditional forest mensuration). An overview of methods and results of studying the percentage of the current stem volume increment and relationships between NPP and biomass involving into SNPP as the numerator and the denominator correspondingly is given. The database on biomass and NPP of forest ecosystems (t/ha) in a number of 920 definitions for 2 -needled pines (subgenus Pinus), 116 – for larches (Larix Mill.), 480 – for spruce-fir forests (Picea Dietr., and Abies Mill.) and 230 definitions for birch forests (Betula L.) on the territory from Britain to South China is compiled. Using multiple regression analysis technique, the statistically significant changes in SNPP of aboveground, underground and understorey biomass according to two transcontinental gradients, namely by zonal belts and <b>continentality</b> <b>of</b> climate, are stated. The age dynamics of different species SNPP has a common pattern of decline with the age of a tree stand, but various quantitative parameters. Regularities of SNPP change according to zonal belts and in relation to the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> climate <b>continentality</b> are statistically significant, but substantial differences between woody species are found, to explain that is not possible yet. Because the term SNPP means «the rate of the transformation of organic substances» or, in other terms, the intensity of nutrient cycling, one apparently must include into the formula for SNPP the current biomass quantity plus all its litter, timber and root falls during the given time period, instead of biomass stock taken from the database formed.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} 381 phytosociological relevés describing predominantly ombrotrophic South Patagonian lowland peatland vegetation along a gradient <b>of</b> increasing <b>continentality.</b> Numerical methods such as cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were carried out to explore the data set. Cluster analysis resulted in nine vegetation types that were also distinctly separated in DCA ordination. The major floristic coenocline along the first DCA axis reflected a gradient <b>of</b> <b>continentality</b> ranging from pacific blanket bogs dominated by cushion plants to Sphagnum-dominated continental raised bogs. Increasing continentality along the first axis was parallel with decreasing peat decomposition and increasing peat depth and acidity. In contrast, floristic variation along the second DCA axis represented a water level gradient. The typical sequence of vegetation types along the hollow-hummock moisture gradient that is well established for north hemispherical peatlands could also be observed in Sphagnum-dominated South Patagonian raised bogs with a surprising similarity in floristic and structural features. Concerning the gradient <b>of</b> <b>continentality</b> significant differences {{in comparison with the}} northern hemisphere could be established. Most obvious was the dominance of cushion building plants (e. g.

40|$|A {{long-term}} (1960 - 2013) {{assessment of}} the variability <b>of</b> <b>continentality</b> and aridity conditions over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region was undertaken. Monthly gridded temperature and precipitation data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) (TS 3. 22 version) were used to compute the Johansson Continentality Index (JCI) and the Marsz Oceanity Index (MOI). In addition, the De Martonne index and the Pinna index were employed to assess recent changes in aridity conditions. All indices revealed a statistically significant increase in continental influences over the region, particularly in the Nile Basin and the Fertile Crescent. For aridity, the results suggested a generally statistically insignificant increase, with the most rapid changes occurring over the most humid regions (i. e. the Ethiopian Highlands and the Fertile Crescent). In order to explain the observed changes in the continentality and aridity conditions, we assessed the relationship between aridity and continentality indices and {{a wide range of}} large-scale circulation patterns. Results indicate that the spatial variability <b>of</b> <b>continentality</b> (as well as aridity) was closely coupled with the Atlantic modes of variability, e. g. the Eastern Atlantic pattern and the Atlantic Meridional Mode, compared to those of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean.

Coastal sage scrub appears more successful than chaparral on argillaceous soils where sage usually occurs in mixture with Quercus agrifolia forest. Fire, while killing most coastal sage shrubs is followed by a rapid recovery of the formation through the agency of the widely dispersed subligneou shrubs, and other disturbances are often followed by a similar invasion.
