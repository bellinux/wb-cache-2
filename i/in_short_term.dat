25|$|The South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter {{aircraft}} are also equipped with PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi. This all-weather radar system {{is capable of}} locating and identifying air targets 120km away and surface targets 70km away. It is also able to automatically track multiple targets in {{the upper and lower}} spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously (although the Air Force still lacks modern beyond visual range missile capability). When deployed operationally on combat missions and air patrols the aircraft can link their systems to the South African National Defence Force's digital network protocol, Link ZA, to share data with other radar systems to help create a wider picture as to the situation in the air and on the ground in order to rapidly adapt to a change <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>term</b> situations.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of government expenditure on private domestic investment in Indonesia. Based on the previous studies, there is no clear justification whether government expenditure is crowding in or crowding out the private investment. Using quarterly time series data during period 1985 to 2012, the empirical results show that government expenditure (total) is crowding out private domestic investment <b>in</b> both <b>short</b> <b>term</b> and long term. Specifically, government expenditure for public service is crowding out the private investment <b>in</b> both <b>short</b> <b>term</b> and long term. Unlike public services, the economic expenditure is crowding in the private investment in the long term. Moreover, health expenditure is crowding out the private investment <b>in</b> the <b>short</b> <b>term</b> while education expenditure is crowding out <b>in</b> the <b>short</b> <b>term</b> and crowding <b>in</b> in the long term...|$|R

This apparent inability to defend itself, also seen in the other recent and future conflicts the Commonwealth was involved in, increasingly invited foreign forces to prey on the Commonwealth.|$|E
