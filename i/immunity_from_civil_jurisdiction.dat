40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the evolution of the}} international rule on State <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in labor disputes. After having shed light on the notion and content of the international rule at issue, this {{article examines}} the relevant international legal instruments (such as the 1972 European Convention on State Immunity and the 2004 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property), the national practice of civil law and common law States, as well as the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and of the European Court of Justice. In light of this analysis, this papers illustrates that, although an important trend aimed at promoting in labor disputes stable criteria of jurisdiction of the State of the forum (such as the nationality or the residence of the worker and the place of the execution of the employment relationship), the criterion based on the distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis continues to be applied rather permanently in such disputes. As a result, in the conclusions, solutions are put forth so that the application of such criterion be subject to revision, at national and international levels, and that, as a consequence, an effective protection of workers be guaranteed in labor disputes against the need to safeguard State interests...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} {{focussed}} on {{the scope of}} State <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in actions for damages alleging the violation of human rights. The attention of the Author is drawn to investigate {{the question of the}} limits of State immunity having specific regard to official torture, in order to provide a safeguarding approach for the victims. This crime is the object of one of the UN Convention of 10 December 1984 against torture, which has enjoyed a particular success within the international contest, being rapidly ratified by a lot of States. The reason lies perhaps in the fact that governmental torture is a particularly hateful crime. It is then extremely important to allow the courts of other States to assume jurisdiction in civil proceedings brought against the State and its agents or servants, personally liable for the torture acts. Only in this way, it is possible to give relief to the victims and to provide an effective deterrent against the spread of governmental torture. In order to achieve these results, it is necessary to overcome the bar to the exercise of civil jurisdiction represented by the immunity. The Author after having offered a preliminary inquiry {{on the grounds of the}} customary rule of immunity and on the different ways in which it can be implemented in internal law, ask himself whether the exercise of civil jurisdiction in torture cases can actually represent an effective means against the spread of this crime. The answer of the Author is positive. He points out that such an exercise will lead to a judgment awarding damages against both the functionaries liable for the crime and their State. The judgment will have not only an important symbolic effect, but will also be enforceable, either in the State where it was entered into, or in a third State in which there are sufficient assets of the State or of the officials concerned. Therefore the victim can obtain a concrete restore for the pains suffered. Moreover that will determine an internalization of the economic cost of official torture, which should represent a good deterrent for the future. The analysis then goes on examining in detail the judgements given in the case Jones and Mitchell v. Saudi Arabia, dealing with the question of the limits of immunity in respect to civil claims for damages for alleged torture. At this regard, the possible solutions are three, each of them taken into consideration in the decisions. The first is based on the acceptance of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture, representing then a rule from which no derogation is permitted. That should entail that a State, allegedly violating it, could not invoke hierarchically lower rules to bar the exercise of civil jurisdiction. The second position is the most conservative. It denies that the prohibition of torture has generated an ancillary procedural rule which, by way of exception to state immunity, entitles or even requires States to assume civil jurisdiction over other States in cases in which torture is alleged. The third solution distinguishes between the action against the State and that against its officials. In the former, the rule of immunity could be successfully invoked; while in the latter it could not, since it would not be possible to define the State functionaries inflicting torture as people acting in their official capacity. The Author considers each of these three solutions unsatisfactory and proposes a different one in order to avoid the applicability of the rule on immunity in civil suits, in which official torture is alleged. This result can be achieved taking in due consideration the UN Convention against torture of 10 December 1984. The success that it has enjoyed in terms of ratifications witnesses that the practice of official torture was totally disqualified and “banished” by the community of States, which “has expressed a will” to partially repeal the customary rule on immunity as regards civil proceedings brought by the victims of official torture. There is then an argument to hold that the customary rule on State immunity has been modified and limited in relation to this crime. That is confirmed also by Article 14. 1 Convention under which «each State party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation». All these considerations lead the Author to the conclusion that the UN Convention against torture has had the same effect both in civil and criminal proceedings concerning governmental torture: the inapplicability of State immunity. So it is for the national rules of each State to determine whether its courts are competent to adjudicate tort claims alleging torture...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the principle of state <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> the <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of national courts {{as it has been}} applied to officials. In Jones v Saudi Arabia the House of Lords held that individual officials should have the benefit of immunity, notwithstanding the possibility of criminal prosecution as agreed by states parties to the United Nations Convention Against Torture. It is incontrovertible as a matter of international and English law that the state itself is immune from suit in torture claims but there was scant authority prior to Jones requiring the extension of immunity to individual officials. There are two key hurdles for the torture victim to surmount: first, it must be demonstrated that the forum state has jurisdiction to make and adjudicate rules regarding the relevant conduct and, secondly, that any claim to immunity should be denied. It is argued that the assertion of <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over torture which has taken place in another country is permissible under English rules on conflict of laws and would not be excessive in view of the recognition of criminal jurisdiction by states parties to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and under customary international law. It is further argued that to allow civil suit against the torturer (but not the state) would not offend the principles of public international law that relate to immunity, nor should it breach the State Immunity Act 1978...|$|R

40|$|Article 10 of the Italian Constitution {{incorporates}} {{generally recognized}} principles of international law. Thus, State <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>civil</b> suit {{in the domestic}} courts of another State—a principle generally recognized in international law—would apply in Italy. However, the protection of fundamental human rights is another generally recognized principle in international law and the ostensible conflict between these two principles {{has resulted in a}} series of controversial rulings issued by the Italian Court of Cassation. These rulings allow for the abrogation of State <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>civil</b> suit in the domestic courts of another State for alleged violations of jus cogens or peremptory norms —what this paper will refer to as the Ferrini doctrine. Although the central premise behind the Court’s reasoning appeals to the values underlying international law, {{it is by no means}} authoritative under the international law regime in which rules and principles are developed through consensus of what is generally recognized. As such, the Italian Court of Cassation’s decisions are not just controversial they are technically unlawful under customary international law. However, such deviation is the sole means through which customary international law changes and evolves. Were the Italian Court of Cassation to make its reasoning logically consistent and, at this initial stage, less sweeping in breadth, the Ferrini doctrine arguably has the potential to be effectively exported to other States thereby furthering a change in customary international law on State immunity. This paper will: (1) provide a brief survey of some of the Italian Court of Cassation’s controversial rulings regarding State <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>civil</b> suit; (2) examine the responses to the decisions from other States and academia to evaluate the validity of such a rule; (3) propose a revised version of the Ferrini doctrine which would enhance its viability and impact on customary international law; and (4) reach a conclusion as to whether such a change is advisable...|$|R
