5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates <b>immunological</b> <b>memory</b> after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an <b>immunological</b> <b>memory,</b> and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{also known}} as the acquired immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates <b>immunological</b> <b>memory</b> after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|E

40|$|Over {{more than}} a century of {{research}} has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i. e., <b>immunological</b> <b>memories,</b> giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems...|$|R

Transplant rejection caused by non-self major histocompatibility complexes is frequently thought to be a byproduct with no evolutionary function, however Cremer cites cases (such as the colonial star ascidian (Botryllus schlosseri)) where recognizing foreign cells may have evolved as an adaptation - if so, then this could be analogous to the self-recognition systems in social insects which prevent brood parasitism and the worker policing behaviours which suppress 'social tumours'. Specific immune cells in animals 'patrol' tissues looking for parasites, as do worker-caste individuals in colonies.|$|E
25|$|Milstein's {{early work}} on {{antibodies}} {{focused on the}} nature of their diversity at the amino acid level {{as well as on the}} disulphide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and <b>immunological</b> <b>memory.</b> Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E

40|$|Since {{adaptive}} {{features such}} as memory were discovered in mammalian innate immunity, interest in the immunological status of primitive vertebrates after infections has grown. In this context, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio), a primitive vertebrate species suited to molecular and genetic studies to explore transcriptional memories {{of the immune system}} in long-term survivors of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus infections. Immune-gene targeted microarrays designed in-house, multipath genes, gene set enrichment, and leading-edge analysis, reveal unexpected consistent correlations between the viral-survivor phenotype and several innate multigene families. Thus, here we describe in survivors of infections the upregulation of the multigene family of proteasome subunit macropains, zebrafish-specific novel gene sets, mitogen activated protein kinases, and epidermal growth factor. We also describe the downregulation of the multigene families of c-reactive proteins, myxovirus-induced proteins and novel immunoglobulin-type receptors. The strength of those <b>immunological</b> <b>memories</b> was reflected by the exceptional similarity of the transcriptional profiles of survivors before and after re-infection compared with primary infected fish. On the other hand, the high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the blood plasma of survivors contrasted with the depletion of transcripts specific for most cell types present in lymphoid organs. Therefore, long-term survivors maintained unexpected molecular/cellular memories of previous viral encounters by modulating the expression levels of innate multigene families as well as having specific adaptive antibodies. The implications of the so-called "trained immunity" for future research in this field are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|CRISPR-Cas is an {{adaptive}} immune system unique to prokaryotes, which prevents infection by foreign genetic elements. Key to the function of CRISPR-Cas immunity {{is the ability to}} adapt to new threats in incorporating short segments, termed spacers, of invading DNA into the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) array of the host. Spacers constitute <b>immunological</b> <b>memories,</b> used by CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to mount a sequence-specific attack on subsequent infections. The immunisation of the host is called CRISPR adaption. Adaption requires the integration of new spacers at a precise site in the CRISPR array. Two proteins, Cas 1 and Cas 2, are essential for adaptation; however, the mechanisms of spacer integration remain poorly understood. The work described here focused on understanding adaptation in Sulfolobus solfataricus. Using biochemical assays, I aimed to characterise the activity of the Cas 1 and Cas 2 proteins in this organism in order to understand their role in the insertion of new spacers. Additionally, I aimed to investigate how the expression of CRISPR-Cas components is regulated in this organism in response to viral infection. The results presented here show that expression of Cas 1 was strongly upregulated in response to infection. A Csa 3 protein from S. solfataricus was found to bind to the promoter for transcription of cas 1, implying a role in the regulation observed. I reconstituted in vitro both the integration reaction performed by Cas 1 and Cas 2 proteins of S. solfataricus and the reverse of this reaction, disintegration. Cas 1 was shown to impose sequence specificity on these reactions, selecting sites similar to the leader-repeat junction of the CRISPR locus. Finally, I demonstrated that, in addition to the intrinsic specificity of Cas 1, there was a requirement for an additional host factor for site-specific integration in S. solfataricus...|$|R

Herein, we demonstrate that HDACi can be combined with immune-activating antibodies designed to promote the function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhance proliferation and survival of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) to stimulate a host antitumor immune response resulting in eradication of established solid tumors. This unique combination therapy was dependent on tumor cell apoptosis mediated by HDACi that stimulated the uptake of dead tumor cells by APCs. Tumor eradication was mediated by CD 8 + CTL that used perforin as the key immune effector molecule. This combination therapy was well tolerated and induced long-term <b>immunological</b> antitumor <b>memory</b> capable of mediating spontaneous tumor eradication upon rechallenge.

In contrast, such Ag-specific memory CD 8 + T cells were not detectable by peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimer staining in animals that had not previously received an antigenic challenge.

It has been recognized for many years that in vitro stimulation of T cells with irradiated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-bearing autologous cells results in T-cell proliferation with <b>immunological</b> specificity and <b>memory,</b> namely the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR). The nature of the major stimulants in the AMLR is still unclear. We investigated whether apoptotic fragments from irradiated cells act as antigenic stimulators for AMLR or nucleohistone-primed T cells. T-cell proliferation in the primary AMLR was significantly suppressed by the presence of a caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-CH 2 F (Z-VAD. fmk), indicating that apoptotic antigens released from irradiated autologous feeder cells act as stimulators of AMLR T cells. This inhibitory effect of Z-VAD was not caused by toxic effects, because the T-cell response to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was not inhibited by Z-VAD. A nucleohistone preparation was shown to contain antigens that are important in the AMLR, as culture with nucleohistone (but not with thyroglobulin or hen-egg lysozyme) primed T cells to respond with secondary kinetics in a subsequent AMLR that was also suppressed by Z-VAD.

It is essential to improve {{influenza vaccines}} by utilizing multiple arms of the immune system. Virus specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells responses are able to directly kill virus infected cells and co-ordinate local innate immune responses. Importanlty, T cells are able to react against different strains and subtypes of influenza. A novel vaccine has been developed using the immunogenic live vaccinia virus as a vaccine vector, containing multivalent influenza proteins derived from H 5 N 1, plus IL- 15 as an adjuvant. Previously, this vaccine demonstrated robust sterile cross-clade protection in mice for H 5 influenza viruses, and here its use has been extended to mediate heterosubtypic immunity towards more distant group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses. Materials and methods Heterologous protection by the vaccine was assessed in the BalbC and B 6 mouse models. T cell responses elicited after vaccination and following influenza virus challenge were measured by Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay. The T cell compartment was selectively depleted by monoclonal antibody treatments. Results The vaccine is able to induce robust <b>immunological</b> T cell <b>memory,</b> enabling the survival of mice against challenge with many different influenza viruses. The vaccine protected mice against lethal challenge by increasing survival and significantly reducing virus loads against the most recent human H 7 N 9, seasonal H 3 N 2, pandemic- 2009 H 1 N 1 and highly pathogenic H 7 N 7 influenza A viruses. Influenza-specific antibody responses were Sopable to mediate protection by passive transfer. Importantly, influenza specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses are elicited by the vaccine, and recruited following viral challenge in the lung and periphery. Selective depletion experiments for T cell subsets revealed an important role of CD 4 + T cells in heterosubtypic protection depsite low peptide MHC-II epitope sequence conservation across different influenza viruses. Memory T cell responses were found to act in synergy with higher viral loads in mice depleted of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses. Conclusions This study has illustrated the potential use of multivalent-vaccinia virus as a universal influenza vaccine. The vaccine established influenza specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses, which were significantly larger upon viral challenge.
