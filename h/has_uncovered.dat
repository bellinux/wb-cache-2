At {{the end of the}} episode, Debra turns on the television in Dexter's apartment and shows him the news: a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> over 30 garbage bags, each containing parts of Dexter's mutilated victims. As he watches, his heart races.|$|E

5|$|Later, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells Black that he <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> {{computer}} files from the Group, indicating that a virus discovered by bio-weapons {{scientists in the}} Soviet Union has been living dormant in bird species {{since the end of}} the Cold War, and may now be making a resurgence in the United States. Watts reveals that a vaccine has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; Watts and Black have already been inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells Watts to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, as he hopes to keep them safe in the cabin until the crisis resolves.|$|E
5|$|Research at the Asummiut {{excavation}} site {{near the airport}} <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> the changing settlement pattern, exhibiting transition from the single-family dwellings to tiny villages of several families. The types of dwelling varied from tent rings made of the hides of hunted mammals, to stone hearths, with no evidence of communal living in larger structures. In contrast, there is evidence for reindeer hunting as a coordinated effort of either villagers or groups of more loosely related individuals, with gathering places in proximity of the hunting grounds being found. Despite recent advances in DNA research based on hair samples from the ancient Saqqaq migrants (which gives insight into their origin), {{the reason for the}} decline and subsequent disappearance of the culture are not yet known.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> a secret {{chemical}} weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E

5|$|On {{the world}} of Therum, Shepard rescues Benezia's {{daughter}} Liara T'Soni, who joins Shepard's squad because of her biotic abilities and expertise of the Protheans. On the colony of Feros, Shepard fights off Saren's forces and learns that his flagship, Sovereign, possesses unique mind-control capabilities. On {{the world of}} Noveria, Shepard tracks down and defeats Benezia, who reveals that she and Saren are being indoctrinated by Sovereign. After completing these missions, the Council informs Shepard that a salarian infiltration unit <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> Saren's main base on Virmire. Upon arrival, Shepard learns that Saren has discovered a cure for the krogan genetic disease, the genophage, and plans to breed an army of unstoppable krogan warriors. Wrex clashes with Shepard over whether to destroy it, which results in him either standing down or being executed. After this conflict, Shepard assists the salarians in destroying the base by planting a bomb in it. Inside, Shepard is confronted by Sovereign, who reveals itself to be an actual Reaper.|$|E

The historic Port Collinson Whaling Station remnants are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.|$|E
25|$|Research {{by several}} {{investigators}} {{around the world}} <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> how ancient peoples encountered and used the camera obscura principle {{for a variety of}} purposes. In a darkened chamber, light passing through a small opening can create haunting and ephemeral moving images, which could have triggered and reinforced ground breaking modes of thought, forms of representation, and belief in otherworldly realms.|$|E
25|$|Research {{into how}} many moves are {{required}} to win certain endgames continued. Exhaustive retrograde analysis using faster computers to build endgame tablebases <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> many more such endgames, often of previously unsuspected length. In 2008, the record was 517 moves (assuming optimal play by both sides) to make a piece capture or exchange that achieves a simpler and more obviously winnable sub-endgame, for a particular position involving a queen and knight versus a rook, bishop, and knight. In 2009, this record was improved to 545 moves.|$|E

25|$|Excavation at Delphi, {{which was}} a post-Mycenaean {{settlement}} of the late 9thcentury, <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> artifacts increasing steadily in volume beginning with {{the last quarter of}} the 8th centuryBC. Pottery and bronze as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in contrast to Olympia. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.|$|E
25|$|The new {{excavation}} <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> the agora's northern gate. It {{has been}} concluded that embossed {{figures of the}} goddess Hestia found in these digs were {{a continuation of the}} Zeus altar uncovered during the first digs. Statues of the gods Hermes, Dionysos, Eros and Heracles have also been found, as well as many statues, heads, embossments, figurines and monuments of people and animals, made of marble, stone, bone, glass, metal and terracotta. Inscriptions found here list the people who provided aid to Smyrna after the earthquake of 178AD.|$|E
25|$|Max Müller {{applied the}} new science of {{comparative}} mythology {{to the study}} of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. Claude Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world. Evans himself, while studying the Minoan world, drew regularly on Egyptian and Near Eastern evidence for comparison, and the discovery of the Hittite and Ugaritic civilizations <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> texts as well as monuments which offer comparative material for ritual and mythology.|$|E

A Chinese team with the Palace Museum, a team from India with Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR) are jointly working at the Kollam Port site for the treasure hunt. The archaeologists and historians said that the discovered coins and artifacts {{had the potential to}} tell the story of a bygone India-China link, and even strong trade links of Kollam city with other ancient empires.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of Tatars was notably attested through {{the works of}} Berber traveler Ibn Battuta, who passed through the area in 1334. In Ibn Battuta's time, the region {{was regarded as a}} westernmost possession of the Tatar Golden Horde, a khanate centered on the Eurasian Steppe. Archeology <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> that another Tatar group, belonging to the Golden Horde, came to Dobruja during the rule of Nogai Khan, and were probably closely related to the present-day Nogais. Following Timur's offensives, the troops of Aktai Khan visited the region in the mid-14th century and around 100,000 Tatars settled there.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{research}} <b>has</b> <b>uncovered</b> {{more about}} the manuscript. In 1977, librarian Father Kallistos Dourvas removed the two pages containing the text from the book to photograph and re-catalog them. However, the re-cataloging never happened; Kallistos later told Charles W. Hedrick and Nikolaus Olympiou that the pages were then kept separately alongside the book at least {{until his retirement in}} 1990. Some time after that, however, the pages were put elsewhere, and various attempts to locate them since that time have been unsuccessful. Olympiou suggests that individuals at the Patriarchate Library may be withholding the pages due to Morton Smith's sensational use of them. Father Kallistos gave his color photographs of the manuscript to Hedrick and Olympiou, who published them in The Fourth R in 2000.|$|E
