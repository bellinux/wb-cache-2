This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there <b>is</b> <b>substantial</b> evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There <b>is</b> <b>substantial</b> data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light <b>is</b> <b>substantial</b> matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there <b>is</b> <b>substantial</b> evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in the camas pocket gopher have been studied. Although there are no subspecies, there <b>is</b> <b>substantial</b> genetic diversity within the species. Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited inbreeding within specific populations. This is similar to patterns described in Botta's pocket gopher and the southern pocket gopher, {{both of which are}} members of the same genus. However, it contrasts with patterns noted in Baird's pocket gopher and the plains pocket gopher, members of a separate genus, Geomys, which showed a higher degree of inbreeding.|$|E

5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book <b>is</b> <b>substantial.</b> The accounts, whether all true or false against him, {{are a source of}} information to write Recuerdos as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a 'true account' of autobiography.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with light and dark spots above, but there <b>is</b> <b>substantial</b> {{variation}} in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there <b>is</b> <b>substantial</b> evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
