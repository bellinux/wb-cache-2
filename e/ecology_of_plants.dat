40|$|Methods {{to assure}} the health of crops owe their {{efficacy}} {{to the extent to}} which we understand the <b>ecology</b> and biology <b>of</b> environmental microorganisms and the conditions under which their interactions with plants lead to losses in crop quality or yield. But in the pursuit of this knowledge, notions <b>of</b> the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathogenic microorganisms have been reduced to a plant-centric and agro-centric focus. With increasing global change, i. e. changes that encompass not only the climate but also biodiversity, geographic distribution of biomes, human demographic and socio-economic adaptations and land use, new plant health problems will emerge via a range of processes influenced by these changes. Hence, knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathogens will play an increasingly important role in anticipating and responding to disease emergence. Here we present our opinion about the major challenges facing the study <b>of</b> the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathogenic bacteria. We argue that the discovery of markedly novel insights into the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathogenic bacteria is most likely to happen in a framework of more extensive scales of space, time and biotic interactions than those that currently guide much of the research on these bacteria. This will set a context that is more propitious for discovery of unsuspected drivers of survival and diversification <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathogenic bacteria, <b>of</b> the factors most critical for disease emergence, and will set the foundation for new approaches to sustainable management <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> health.

50|$|Ecological {{research}} is the central activity of the Konza Prairie {{which is also a}} Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site of the National Science Foundation. The site was established to provide a natural laboratory for the study of ecological patterns and processes in native tallgrass prairie ecosystems.

Thus, these processes are the focus of much of the long-term research.

50|$|Botanical {{research}} by Monge-Nájera has focussed on two areas, {{the evolution of}} chloroplasts and the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> that grow on other plants. As part of an international team led by USDA's K.C. Vaughn, {{he found that the}} anthocerote chloroplast is unique among the embryophytes and can be used in taxonomy at the generic level. Experiments with artificial leaves answered the old question of whether epiphyllous plants extract nutrients from their host and found that driptips kept leaves dry enough for epiphyllous plants to develop. He also tested a long-standing hypothesis about epiphyte distribution matching the Holdridge Life Zone System, and found that the correlation is poor. At the 100th anniversary of Picado's theoretical model of bromeliad colonization, he measured experimentally the effect of rain and fallen debris on macroinvertebrates that reached artificial water tanks in a forest.|$|E

40|$|Seasonally dry {{tropical}} forests are worldwide recognized as important ecosystems for biodiversity conservation.

This book presents the analysis on plant and Lepidoptera (caterpillar) communities and their species turnover along forest succession and along a gradient from dry to humid seasonal forests in the Southern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We discuss the contribution of climate zones, forest age and seasonality to the comunity structure of plant and Lepidoptera assemblages. The study of these environmental gradients may serve to understand and forecast future changes in species diversity in response to increasing human activities and climate change.

40|$|Variation in {{inflorescence}} development patterns is {{a central}} factor in the evolutionary <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants.</b> The genetic architectures of 13 traits associated with inflorescence developmental timing, architecture, rosette morphology, and fitness were investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant system. There is substantial naturally occurring genetic variation for inflorescence development traits, with broad sense heritabilities computed from 21 Arabidopsis ecotypes ranging from 0. 134 to 0. 772. Genetic correlations are significant for most (64 / 78) pairs of traits, suggesting either pleiotropy or tight linkage among loci. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping indicates 47 and 63 QTL for inflorescence developmental traits in Ler x Col and Cvi x Ler recombinant inbred mapping populations, respectively. Several QTL associated with different developmental traits map to the same Arabidopsis chromosomal regions, {{in agreement with the}} strong genetic correlations observed. Epistasis among QTL was observed only in the Cvi x Ler population, and only between regions on chromosomes 1 and 5. Examination of the completed Arabidopsis genome sequence in three QTL regions revealed between 375 and 783 genes per region. Previously identified flowering time, inflorescence architecture, floral meristem identity, and hormone signaling genes represent some of the many candidate genes in these regions...|$|E
40|$|Leaves surfaces, which {{represent}} an interface with {{plants and the}} environment, have several structures with specific functions. Some foliar properties, including wettability and mechanical containment, are inferred in terms of cellular adaptation and {{the presence or absence}} of cuticular wax. Various morphological parameters, ranging from macro- to nano scales, are analyzed and contribute to the study of taxonomy, pharmacognosy, and <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants.</b> The aim of this paper was to analyze the effect and influence of epicuticular wax granules on the hydrophobicity of Anacardium occidentale L. leaf surfaces. Leaf specimens were directly examined with an environmental scanning electron microscope without metal coating. Images revealed epidermis ornament, stomata type, was, and trichomes. Static contact angle between water and the surface was also measured on both sides. On the adaxial side, an angle of 104. 09 ° ± 0. 95 ° was found, suggesting that adaxial surface is hydrophobic. On the abaxial side, the angle was 62. 20 ° ± 1. 60 °, which indicates a hydrophilic nature, probably because of the greater amount of epicuticular wax on the adaxial leaf surface. The present investigation provided an important contribution to morphological and ultrastructural characterization of leaves of cashew tree, which is a plant of great medicinal and economic importance. ...|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} current human-induced climate change, the Holocene is notable for its stable climate. In contrast, the {{preceding}} age, the Pleistocene, {{was a time of}} intensive climatic fluctuations, with temperature changes of up to 15 °C occurring within a few decades. These climatic changes have substantially influenced both animal and plant populations. Until recently, the prevailing opinion about the effect of these climatic fluctuations on species in Europe was that populations survived glacial maxima in southern refugia and that populations died out outside these refugia. However, some of the latest studies of modern population genetics, the fossil record and especially ancient DNA reveal a more complex picture. There is now strong evidence for additional local northern refugia for a large number of species, including both plants and animals. Furthermore, population genetic analyses using ancient DNA have shown that genetic diversity and its geographical structure changed more often and in more unpredictable ways during the Pleistocene than had been inferred. Taken together, the Pleistocene is now seen as an extremely dynamic era, with rapid and large climatic fluctuations and correspondingly variable ecology. These changes were accompanied by similarly fast and sometimes dramatic changes in population size and extensive gene flow mediated by population movements. Thus, the Pleistocene is an excellent model case for the effects of rapid climate change, as we experience at the moment, on the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> and animals...|$|E
