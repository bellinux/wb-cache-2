It includes two aspects: low-coherence <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors</b> (LCI) and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. For LCI sensors, author’s work mainly focuses on the interrogation and multiplexing methods for Fizeau and Fabry-Perot <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors</b> at the University of Kent at Canterbury (UKC), UK, and study on novel Fabry-Perot <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors</b> and their multiplexing methods at Chongqing University (CQU) and University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (UESTC), China, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work described in this thesis was to investigate the interrogation of fibre optic sensors using "off the shelf optical components and equipment developed mainly for the telecommunications industry. This provides a cost effective way of bringing fibre optic sensor systems to within the price range of their electro-mechanical counterparts. The research work focuses on the use of an arrayed waveguide grating, an acousto-optic tuneable filter and low-coherence interferometry to measure dynamic strain and displacement using fibre Bragg grating and <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors.</b> Based on the intrinsic properties of arrayed waveguide gratings and acousto-optic tuneable filters used in conjunction with interferometry, fibre Bragg gratings and <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors</b> a number of novel fibre optic sensor interrogation systems have been realised. Special single mode fibre, namely, high-birefringence fibre has been employed to implement a dual-beam interrogating interferometer. The first interrogation scheme is based on an optical channel monitor, which is an arrayed waveguide grating with integral photo-detectors providing a number of amplified electrical outputs. It is used to interrogate fibre Bragg grating and <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors.</b> Using the properties of polarisation maintainability in high-birefringent fibre an interrogating interferometer was realised by winding a length of the fibre around a piezoelectric modulator generating a low-frequency carrier signal. The system was used to interrogate both fibre Bragg grating and <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors.</b> Finally, the use of an acousto-optic tuneable filter is employed to interrogate fibre Bragg gratings. The device is used to generate a very high frequency carrier signal at the output of an optical interferometer. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) to interrogate both fibre Bragg grating (FBG) and <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors.</b> A broadband light source is used to illuminate both the FBG and <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors.</b> Reflected spectral information is directed to an AWG with integral photodetectors providing 40 electrical outputs. To interrogate <b>interferometric</b> <b>sensors</b> we investigated the dual wavelength technique to measure the distance of a Fabry-Perot cavity, which produced a maximum unambiguous range of 1440 μm with an active sensor. Three methods are described to interrogate FBG sensors. The first technique makes use of the reflected light intensity in an AWG channel passband from a narrow bandwidth grating, giving a usable range of 500 με and a dynamic strain resolution of 96 nε/√Hz at 30 Hz. The second approach utilises wide gratings larger than the channel spacing of the AWG; by monitoring the intensity present in corresponding AWG channels an improved range of 1890 με was achieved. The third method improves the dynamic range by utilising a heterodyne approach based on interferometric wavelength shift detection providing a dynamic strain resolution of 17 nε/√Hz at 30 Hz...|$|R
