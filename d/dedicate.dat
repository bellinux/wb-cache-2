A three-step <b>dedicated</b> channel estimation procedure is derived which exploits all the existing pilot sequences as well as the structured dynamics of the channel. In the first step, least squares (LS) estimates of the channels associated with <b>dedicated</b> and common pilots are built. In the second step, an improved unbiased minimum mean square error (UMMSE) estimate of the <b>dedicated</b> channel is obtained by optimally combining the initial LS estimates exploiting the correlation between <b>dedicated</b> and common pilot channels. In the last step, the improved <b>dedicated</b> channel estimate is further refined via Kalman filtering by exploiting the channel temporal correlation. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{conversation}} {{poems are}} {{a group of}} eight poems composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) between 1795 and 1807.

5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to <b>dedicate</b> {{herself to her}} humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed {{for the use of}} an exclusively Khmer cast and script. Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned {{in the city of}} Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To <b>dedicate</b> the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E

5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will <b>dedicate</b> itself to organic farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E

This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation.
