This study {{is grounded in}} case study methodology: questionnaire and interview data from teachers and pupils was collected across a sample of secondary schools in the UK, along with a thorough analysis of current health policy materials within selected schools. This has been achieved through analyses of 90 in depth interviews and questionnaire responses from 1176 young people across a diverse range of backgrounds aged between 9 - 16 years old. 19 Interviews with teachers and staff were also conducted across the 8 schools. In addition to this, at each school, copies of health and PE programmes, school policies, textbooks, websites and other relevant resources were collected. Project description: This research project will explore how health measures relating people's weight, physical activity and diets (such as annual weight checks, <b>fingerprint</b> <b>screening</b> in school canteens, removal of vending machines) are being re-contextualized in schools, and impact young people’s and teacher’s identities, health, well being and rights.

There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a <b>fingerprint</b> examination <b>screen,</b> a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|R
50|$|The similarity-based virtual {{screening}} (a kind of ligand-based virtual screening) {{assumes that}} all compounds in a database {{that are similar}} to a query compound have similar biological activity. Although this hypothesis is not always valid, quite often the set of retrieved compounds is considerably enriched with actives. To achieve high efficacy of similarity-based screening of databases containing millions of compounds, molecular structures are usually represented by molecular screens (structural keys) or by fixed-size or variable-size molecular <b>fingerprints.</b> Molecular <b>screens</b> and <b>fingerprints</b> can contain both 2D- and 3D-information. However, the 2D-fingerprints, which are a kind of binary fragment descriptors, dominate in this area. Fragment-based structural keys, like MDL keys, are sufficiently good for handling small and medium-sized chemical databases, whereas processing of large databases is performed with fingerprints having much higher information density. Fragment-based Daylight, BCI, and UNITY 2D (Tripos) fingerprints are the best known examples. The most popular similarity measure for comparing chemical structures represented by means of fingerprints is the Tanimoto (or Jaccard) coefficient T. Two structures are usually considered similar if T > 0.85 (for Daylight fingerprints). However, it is a common misunderstanding that a similarity of T > 0.85 reflects similar bioactivities in general ("the 0.85 myth").|$|R

The Archaeal assemblages at each of these time points {{were found to be}} significantly different (AMOVA, P< 0. 01), and the nature of this difference was dependent on taxonomic rank. For example, the cosmopolitan genus g_Ca. Nitrososphaera (I. 1 b) was detected at all time points, but within this taxon the abundance of s_SCA 1145, s_SCA 1170, and s_Ca.

Methods: We developed a new method to study the electrochemical behavior of dGTP utilizing carbon multiwalled nanotube (MWNT) -modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs). RAPD was applied for amplification of DNA samples from healthy controls and patients with pancreatic cancer under the same conditions to determine the different surplus quantity of dGTP in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thereby determining the difference/quantity of PCR products or template strands. Using this method we generated a genetic fingerprint map of pancreatic cancer through the combination of electrochemical sensors and gel electrophoresis to screen for genetic alterations. Cloning and sequencing were then performed to verify these gene alterations. Results: dGTP showed favorable electrochemical behavior on the MWNTs/GCE. The {{results indicated that the}} electrical signal and dGTP had a satisfactory linear relationship with the dGTP concentration within the conventional PCR concentration range. The MWNTs/GCE could distinguish between different products of RAPD.

Different types of molecular markers such as RFLPs, AFLPs, SSRs, CAPS, RGAs, ESTs, and COSs have been developed and mapped onto the 12 tomato chromosomes. Markers have been used extensively for identification and mapping of genes and QTLs for many biologically and agriculturally important traits and occasionally for germplasm <b>screening,</b> <b>fingerprinting,</b> and marker-assisted breeding. The utility of MAS in tomato breeding has been restricted largely due to limited marker polymorphism within the cultivated species and economical reasons. Also, when used, MAS has been employed mainly for improving simply-inherited traits and not much for improving complex traits. The latter has been due to unavailability of reliable PCR-based markers and problems with linkage drag.

A smaller characteristic length scale of a re-entrant surface topography, tighter weave and a coating with inherently low wettability are better for producing omniphobic surfaces that resist wetting by liquids with low surface tension. This framework is applied to textile fabrics and bird feathers to test their wettability. Using this framework, wettability of low surface tension liquids on a polyester fabric is tuned or switched using either thermal annealing or biaxial stretching. Army Combat Uniform fabrics are rendered oleophobic, thus opening the way to optimize omniphobic army uniforms. The wettability of molecules similar to fluorodecyl POSS is investigated by measuring the contact angles with liquids of a broad range of surface tension and polarity. Of the molecules tested so far, fluorodecyl POSS has the lowest solid surface energy (9. 3 mN/m) and the lowest increment in solid surface energy (7 mN/m). The wetting aspects of the hierarchical topography of bird feathers are captured using contact angle measurements in terms of a spacing ratio. Thermodynamics of the wetting of feathers and the robustness against wetting {{during the course of a}} dive are correlated to the wing spreading behavior. Our understanding of surface wettability of woven meshes is applied to optimize their fog collection ability. A business case for fog harvesting is developed and strategies to decrease asset and cash flow risks are proposed. The contributions presented here provide means to better characterize surfaces with complex topography, tune and a priori predict their wettability and recommend a design strategy both at a molecular and a macroscopic level to maximize their non-wettability. by Shreerang S.

40|$|Vibrio spp., natural {{inhabitants}} of aquatic environments, {{are one of}} the most common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis in the world, being spread to humans via the ingestion of seafood, contaminated drinking water or exposure to seawater. The majority of Vibrio spp. are avirulent, but certain strains may sporadically be human pathogenic. Vibrio cholerae may cause cholera and fatal wound infections, Vibrio parahaemolyticus may cause gastroenteritis and Vibrio vulnificus may cause wound infections and sepsis. To expand current knowledge of the occurrence, ecological niche and persistence of potential human pathogenic Vibrio spp. in aquatic environments, occurrence and laboratory studies were performed. The seasonal variation of Vibrio spp. in clams and mussels from Mozambique and Sweden were studied, with isolated strains characterized and compared with those isolated from water samples collected in India. Results showed that the numbers of Vibrio spp. in Mozambican clams peaked during the warmer rainy season and that the dominating species was V. parahaemolyticus. Biochemical <b>fingerprinting</b> and virulence <b>screened</b> by PCR revealed a high similarity among strains from the different aquatic environments. However, isolate functional hemolytic analyses and antibiotic resistance patterns differed between strains; Swedish and Indian strains were less sensitive to the tested antibiotics and had a lower hemolytic capacity than those from Mozambique. Molecular analysis of bacterial DNA from Swedish mussels showed the presence of the three Vibrio spp. most commonly linked with human illness, as well as their associated virulence genes. The strains isolated from marine and clinical environments were equally and highly harmful to the tested eukaryotic cells. The persistence of clinical V. cholerae in aquatic environments was investigated in vivo. Strains were exposed to mussels, with bacterial uptake and elimination then examined. The mussels were able to avoid the most potent strain by complete closure of shells. The less potent strain was accumulated in mussel tissue in low levels and one marine control strain to a higher degree. Mussels eliminated the pathogenic strain less efficiently than they did the marine strain. One clinical and one marine strain were then exposed to 4 °C for 21 days, with the temperature then increased to 20 °C. The clinical strain was more prone to lose culturability than the marine strain at 4 °C, the former performed significantly better in regaining culturability after the temperature up-shift. Subsequently, the persistence of the clinical strain in natural bottom sediment, incubating as above, was studied and results showed a similar decrease in culturable numbers in the sediment as in the water. As the clinical V. cholerae strains did not carry any of the standard set of virulence genes, the ability to change from non-culturable to culturable may be of great importance to strain pathogenicity. The results also show that natural bottom sediment may be a potential reservoir of human pathogenic Vibrio spp...|$|R
