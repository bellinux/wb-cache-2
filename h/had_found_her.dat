She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.|$|E
5|$|Carol Park {{went missing}} on 17 July 1976, {{and was never}} seen alive again by her family. In 1997, her body was {{discovered}} by divers in Coniston Water and Gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder. Reputedly he said 'oh dear', after being informed they <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> body. The charges were subsequently dropped but in 2004 Gordon was arrested again and found guilty of his wife's murder. The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment and recommended that he should serve a minimum of 15 years before being considered for parole. He was held at Garth prison, Leyland, Preston.

Confident that she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> calling, she {{enrolled}} in the New York School of Philanthropy in New York City (later part of Columbia University School of Social Work) from 1908 to 1909. She then moved to Spokane, Washington where, after briefly serving as a social worker, she attended the University of Washington and became involved in the women's suffrage movement. She helped organize the New York Women's Suffrage Party and worked as a lobbyist for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). In November 1910, Washington voters approved an amendment to their state constitution permanently enfranchising women, the fifth state in the Union to do so.|$|E
25|$|Formal witness {{testimony}} {{began on}} July 20, 1970. The first two witnesses to testify were Beineman's two roommates; {{each of whom}} discussed Beineman's character, and her movements {{on the day of}} her disappearance. These two witnesses were followed by the individual who <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> body on July 26, and the medical examiner called to the crime scene, Dr. Craig Barlow. Barlow testified as to the fact that although Beineman had been deceased for almost 72 hours, her body had only lain in the location where she was found for 24 hours before discovery. The following day, Washtenaw County Sheriff Douglas Harvey testified as to the discovery of Beineman's body, her subsequent autopsy, and his obtaining an updated composite drawing of the suspect with whom Beineman had last been seen alive from Mrs. Joan Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding. Both women had agreed this composite drawing was accurate, and only disagreed as to the structure of the suspect's chin. Furthermore, Goshe had identified a photograph shown to her of Collins as being the man she had seen with Beineman.|$|E
500|$|In 1904 Romaine Brooks, {{the name}} she preferred, became {{dissatisfied}} with her work, {{and in particular}} with the bright color schemes that she had used in her early paintings. She travelled to St. Ives on the Cornish coast, rented a small studio, and began learning to create finer gradations of gray. When a group of local artists asked her to give an informal show of her work, she displayed only some pieces of cardboard on which she had dabbed her experiments with gray paint. From then on, nearly all of her paintings are keyed to a gray, white and black color scheme with touches and tints of ochre, umber, alizarin and teal. By 1905 she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> tonal palette and would continue to develop these harmonics her whole career.|$|E

Norwood also stated how Frank Ocean inspired her on this album: [...] "We've always had that great chemistry, and we both understand music in the same ways, to work with him on this album was great as well, and I hope I can get in [...] with him some more because his music is just so moving; I'm inspired by him.

2500|$|Later in 1937, she toured South India and {{produced}} the famous South Indian trilogy of paintings Bride's Toilet, Brahmacharis, and South Indian Villagers Going to Market following her {{visit to the}} Ajanta caves, when she made a conscious attempt to return to classical Indian art. These paintings reveal her passionate sense of colour and an equally passionate empathy for her Indian subjects, who are often depicted in their poverty and despair. By now the transformation in her work was complete and she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> 'artistic mission' which was, according to her, to express the life of Indian people through her canvas.
