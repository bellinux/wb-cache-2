For example, the Republican Party of Utah opposes almost all abortions while Utah Democrats take a more liberal approach, although more conservative than their national counterparts. On Second Amendment issues, the state GOP has been {{at odds with the}} LDS Church position opposing concealed firearms in places of worship and in public spaces.|$|E
