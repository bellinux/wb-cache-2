5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian {{refugees}} fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling <b>in</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> {{in and around}} the city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.|$|E
