5000|$|BCP 47 {{defines a}} [...] "Scope" [...] {{property}} to identify subtags for language collections. However, {{it does not}} define any given collection as <b>inclusive</b> <b>or</b> exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous {{as to whether the}} collection is intended to be <b>inclusive</b> <b>or</b> exclusive.|$|R

40|$|In natural language, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 {{sometimes}} means 2 ̆ 2 <b>inclusive</b> <b>or</b> 2 ̆ 2 {{and sometimes}} means 2 ̆ 2 exclusive or 2 ̆ 2. To adequately describe commonsense and expert knowledge, {{it is therefore}} important to have not only t-conorms describing fuzzy 2 ̆ 2 <b>inclusive</b> <b>or</b> 2 ̆ 2 operations, but also fuzzy 2 ̆ 2 exclusive or 2 ̆ 2 operations f(a,b). Since the degrees of certainty are only approximately defined, {{it is reasonable to}} require that the corresponding operation be the least sensitive to small changes in the inputs. In this paper, we show that the least sensitive fuzzy 2 ̆ 2 exclusive or 2 ̆ 2 operation has the form f(a,b) =min(max(a,b),max(1 -a, 1 -b)) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} Peregrine and colleagues Richard Blanton, Gary M. Feinman, and Steven Kowalewski {{developed}} “dual-processual” theory, which Peregrine applied to Mississippian polities. Dual-processual theory posits that political leaders adopt strategies for implementing power ranging along a continuum from being highly exclusionary to highly <b>inclusive.</b> Exclusionary (<b>or</b> network) strategies are like those Peregrine argued {{were in place}} among Mississippian polities. Peregrine argued that <b>inclusive</b> (<b>or</b> corporate) ones were in place among some Ancestral Puebloan polities.

The growth, however, has neither been <b>inclusive</b> <b>or</b> equitable.

50|$|For n = 1 {{the median}} {{operator}} {{is just the}} unary identity operation x. For n = 3 the ternary median operator can be expressed using conjunction and disjunction as xy + yz + zx.
