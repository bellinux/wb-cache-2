There is a wide consensus that GI can deliver significant environmental, social and economic benefits (Mell 2008). The GI concept encompasses all spatial levels. It focuses on connectivity of urban green space, aims at multi-functionality, forges a link to the spatial provision of ecosystem services and highlights the need for close collaboration between scientific, political and administrative actors (cf.

40|$|As rapid urban {{development}} with its concomitant conversion {{of open space}} and added imperviousness increases the potential for adverse hazard impacts, the possible benefits of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> {{as a tool for}} hazard mitigation has become an emerging topic in landscape architecture and urban planning. However, research on this topic has been limited by the lack of effective tools for the identification and measurement of the specific dimensions of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the balance between <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and {{urban development}} particularly within highly developed urban environments. Consequently, there has been little empirical research conducted on the potential benefits of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for reducing streamflow, an indicator of runoff and potential flooding mitigation. This study seeks to further research <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> as a potential tool for hazard mitigation by examining its consequences for streamflow over a 2 -year period in 2004 and 2010 for two key urban areas subject to flooding in Texas (the Austin and Houston Metropolitan areas) by 1) utilizing high resolution (1 -meter) imagery to develop fine resolution assessments of the amount, form, type and placement of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in dense urban environments and then 2) utilizing these measures in panel models to assess the effectiveness of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for reducing runoff as assessed by using streamflow gauge data predicting annual peak flow and mean flow. More specifically, this study first identified an approach to employ the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify and develop high-resolution measures of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> particularly germane for assessments within dense urban environments. Second, the statistical models developed utilizing these new measure of the extent and spatial patterns of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> suggested that <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> indeed has consequences for streamflow reduction, particularly with respect to annual peak flow, in urban watersheds. Moreover, the analyses explained that <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in the Austin metropolitan area appears to be more effective on peak annual flow when compared to the Houston metropolitan area, suggesting that <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> has elevated consequences in areas with greater topographical diversity. These variations perhaps imply that depending on different geographical characteristics, diverse guidelines for <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> implementation should be applied. The effectiveness of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in critical places will help make a guideline for the balanced urban development with implementation of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> This dissertation shows the utility of the new data for developing high-resolution measures of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> as a different approach compared to the conventional approaches. The consequences of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for streamflow and potential flooding were clearly suggested. Also, this study begins to provide data that may well be used to establish guidelines for <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and effective runoff mitigation, and provides support for utilizing these data to guide research into <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> spatial characteristics and hazard mitigation. Overall, the outcomes of this study will be helpful for the strategic planning and implementation of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructure</b> with streamflow issues, thus building community resilience...|$|R
