50|$|Long {{distance}} {{seed dispersal}} (LDD) {{is a type}} of spatial dispersal that is currently defined by two forms, proportional and actual distance. A plant's fitness and survival may heavily depend on this method of seed dispersal depending on certain environmental factors. The first form of LDD, proportional distance, measures the percentage of seeds (1% out of total number of seeds produced) that travel the farthest distance out of a 99% probability distribution. The proportional definition of LDD is in actuality a descriptor for more extreme dispersal events. An example of LDD would be that of a plant developing a specific dispersal vector or morphology in order to allow for the dispersal of its seeds over a great distance. The actual or absolute method identifies LDD as a literal distance. It classifies 1 km as the threshold distance for seed dispersal. Here, threshold means the minimum distance a plant can disperse its seeds and have it still count as LDD. There is a second, unmeasurable, form of LDD besides proportional and actual. This is known as the non-standard form. Non-standard LDD is when seed dispersal occurs completely at random. An example of this would be if the lemur dependent dispersal of seeds from the deciduous trees of Madagascar were to wash ashore the coastline of South Africa via the attachment of mermaid purses laid by a shark or common skate.6 A driving factor for the evolutionary significance of LDD is that it increases plant fitness by decreasing neighboring plant competition for offspring. However, it is still unclear today as to how specific traits, conditions and trade-offs (particularly within short seed <b>dispersal)</b> <b>effect</b> LDD evolution.|$|E

For example, in the patch models of population dynamics [20], {{the rate of}} immigration into a patch from a particular other patch is usually taken as proportional to the local population, and the dispersal {{can be regarded as}} the extension of these ideas to a continuous media model. Such a diffusion mechanism also arises from physics processes with long range effect and other disciplines [13], and the dynamics of evolutionary systems with <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> has been widely studied in recent years; we refer to [13, 21 – 32] and the references cited therein.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEcoregionalization of {{the ocean}} is a {{necessary}} step for spatial management of marine resources. Previous ecoregionalization efforts were based either {{on the distribution of}} species or on the distribution of physical and biogeochemical properties. These approaches ignore the dispersal of species by oceanic circulation that can connect regions and isolates others. This <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> can be quantified through connectivity that is the probability, or time of transport between distinct regions. Here a new regionalization method based on a connectivity approach is described and applied to the Mediterranean Sea. This method is based on an ensemble of Lagrangian particle numerical simulations using ocean model outputs at 1 / 12 u resolution. The domain is divided into square subregions of 50 km size. Then particle trajectories are used to quantify the oceanographic distance between each subregions, here defined as the mean connection time. Finally the oceanographic distance matrix is used as a basis for a hierarchical clustering. 22 regions are retained and discussed together with a quantification of the stability of boundaries between regions. Identified regions are generally consistent with the general circulation with boundaries located along current jets or surrounding gyres patterns. Regions are discussed in the light of existing ecoregionalizations and available knowledge on plankton distributions. This objective method complements static regionalization approaches based on the environmental niche concept and can be applied to any oceanic region at any scale...|$|E

Twelve sites were used, with four sites each {{randomly assigned to}} one of three treatments: clearcut (complete canopy removal), shelterwood (partial canopy removal), and reference (no timbering). Population baselines were established the year before timbering began, by conducting night mark/recapture surveys of surface-active animals. Establishing a baseline is a vital step in studying timbering effects, as salamander distribution and dispersal patterns may be clumped, and without a preliminary reference point, it may not be possible to separate <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects</b> and individual site differences from timbering effects.

40|$|The {{majority}} of managed forests in Fennoscandia are younger than 70 years old but yet {{little is known}} about their potential to host rare and threatened species. In this study, we examined red-listed bryophytes and lichens in 19 young stands originating from clear-cutting (30 – 70 years old) in the boreal region, finding 19 red-listed species (six bryophytes and 13 lichens). We used adjoining old stands, which most likely never had been clear-cut, as reference. The old stands contained significantly more species, but when taking the amount of biological legacies (i. e., remaining deciduous trees and dead wood) from the previous forest generation into account, bryophyte species number did not differ between old and young stands, and lichen number was even higher in young stands. No <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> could be detected from the old to the young stands. The amount of wetlands in the surroundings was important for bryophytes, as was the area of old forest for both lichens and bryophytes. A cardinal position of young stands to the north of old stands was beneficial to red-listed bryophytes as well as lichens. We conclude that young forest plantations may function as habitat for red-listed species, but that this depends on presence of structures from the previous forest generation, and also on qualities in the surrounding landscape. Nevertheless, at repeated clear-cuttings, a successive decrease in species populations in young production stands is likely, due to increased fragmentation and reduced substrate amounts. Retention of dead wood and deciduous trees might be efficient conservation measures. Although priority needs to be given to preservation of remnant old-growt...|$|E
40|$|Serine proteases, such as {{alpha-chymotrypsin}} or elastase, {{caused an}} aggregation of rat ascites tumour cell lines, AH- 130, AH- 109 A and YS, in a protein free medium which preserved the cell viability. This aggregation, which was monitored spectrophotometrically, was {{dependent upon the}} protease activities and was resistant to treatment with either a calcium chelating reagent (EDTA) or neuraminidase. However, the tumour cell aggregates were redispersed by treatment with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I). This <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> was dependent upon the DNase activity. A possible relationship between the tumour cell aggregation and development of blood-borne metastasis was studied. An intravenous inoculation in rats of tumour cell aggregates performed by the alpha-chymotrypsin treatment resulted in significantly higher numbers of lung metastatic foci than an injection of single cells. When the re-separated single cells, prepared in vitro by treatment with DNase I following alpha-chymotrypsin treatment, were injected instead of the aggregates, the enhancement of metastasis was reversed. These enhancement and reversal effects were mimicked in vivo by intravenous injections of protease and nuclease following inoculation of a single cell suspension. That is, the number of metastatic foci caused by single cell inoculation followed by an intravenous alpha-chymotrypsin injection, was higher than that in a control group receiving PBS instead of alpha-chymotrypsin. Again, this augmentation was reversed by an injection of DNase I following alpha-chymotrypsin injection. Furthermore, an injection of DNase I alone itself reduced the starting number of metastases resulting from injection of the single tumour cell suspension. These {{data suggest that the}} metastatic behaviour of tumour cells may be increased by protease inducible DNA dependent cell aggregation should it occur in the blood stream...|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder. One of the characteristic hallmarks {{of the disease}} is infection of the lung. Over the life time of a CF patient, a number of pulmonary exacerbations occur which result in irreversible lung damage. Despite continuous treatment with antimicrobials, microorganisms continue to persist in the CF lung due {{to the formation of}} biofilms. The biofilm mode of growth can display up to a 1000 x greater tolerance to antimicrobial treatments than their free living planktonic counterparts. Hence, anti-biofilm therapy strategies are required to break up these tolerant microbial communities. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the proposed anti-biofilm therapies, which has been shown to successfully initiate biofilm dispersal {{of one of the most}} widely recognized CF pathogens, P. aeruginosa. The work in this thesis was undertaken to investigate the use of NO as a potential biofilm dispersing agent for the monospecies biofilms formed by other commonly identified CF microorganisms. The second chapter outlines the isolation of these microorganisms from CF sputum samples and describes the culture profiling results for the CF patient cohort sampled. The third results chapter examines the effect of NO on the monospecies biofilms formed the CF microorganisms isolated in chapter 2. A biofilm <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> was not observed across a range of NO concentrations; however intriguingly there was an effect on biofilm cell viability for NO concentrations ≥ 100 pM. Chapter 4 outlines a mixed species biofilm model composed of CF isolates for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and a method to recover and analyse genomic DNA from biofilms. Biofilm dispersal for this mixed species biofilm was not observed however a reduction in the S. aureus population fraction was noted.

40|$|Bromeliaceae is a morphologically {{distinctive}} and ecologically diverse family {{originating in the}} New World. Three centers of diversity, 58 genera, and about 3, 140 bromeliad species are currently recognized. We compiled all of the studies related to the reproductive biology, genetic diversity, and population structure of the Bromeliaceae, and discuss the evolution and conservation of this family. Bromeliads are preferentially pollinated by vertebrates and show marked variation in breeding systems, from predominant inbreeding to predominant outcrossing, as well as constancy in chromosome number (2 n = 2 x = 50). Autogamous or mixed mating system bromeliads have a high inbreeding coefficient (F IS), while outcrossing species show low F IS. The degree of differentiation among populations (F ST) of species ranges from 0. 043 to 0. 961, which can be influenced by pollen and seed <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects,</b> clonal growth, gene flow rates, and connectivity among populations.

The boom of tourism industry brought some benefit to the city, at meanwhile many social problems. The Government believed over-concentration at city center was the main reason for the side effects. To tackle the issue, the Government introduced some strategies including developing new tourism hub. Developing Lantau Island into another tourism center has been on government’s agenda for years. In the island’s concept plan, there are large amount of tourism provisions. In order to assess the effectiveness of the new developments on Lantau Island on diverting visitors outward urban core area, this study applied Lancaster’s Characteristic Framework. Study result suggested that Lantau Island could effectively disperse visitors after the completion of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and expansion of Hong Kong International Airport. To understand new development’s locational effect on visitor dispersal, factorial comparison was conducted between Lantau Island and an alternative site at Fanling. It is discovered Fanling has slight advantage in diverting visitors for its proximity to Mainland China, the largest tourist market. Improvement in transportation network could largely enhance <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect.</b> Since visitors demonstrate a declining interest in shopping activities in Hong Kong, more cross-boundary facilities would not divert general visitors, but is believed to be helpful in stopping same-day in-town visitors who come to Hong Kong for shopping only, especially the parallel traders, from entering city center. Nevertheless, making use of local lands to facilitate illegal activities involves planning ethical issue. The government is suggested to continuously improve transportation network, give careful consideration in cross-boundary shopping facility planning to cater visitor’s changing demand and local resident’s needs, and develop alternative tourism modes, such as cultural tourism, in the future to ensure a sustainable development of tourism industry. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of population size and genetic diversity in fragmented landscapes {{is the central}} issue in conservation biology. Functional connectivity between remnant habitat patches affects these parameters. However, the functional connectivity for genetic diversity would be characterised by a greater spatial scale than population size even within the same habitat network. The reason for this difference is that while dispersal frequency generally decreases with increasing distance, only a few immigrants may effectively contribute to gene flow, whereas {{a certain number of}} dispersers may be required to influence population abundance. Here, we investigated the effects of habitat network structures on population abundance and genetic diversity of the ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius, in remnant wetland ponds in northern Japan. We tested (i) whether both population abundance and genetic diversity are positively related not only to habitat size but also to connectivity and (ii) whether the <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> extends to greater spatial scales in genetic diversity than in population size. We employed a graph theoretical index to measure the degree of pond connectivity. This index can evaluate the connectivity threshold distance above which individuals cannot disperse and clarify the difference in the spatial scale of effective dispersal between population abundance and genetic diversity. Pond connectivity significantly affected the spatial variation of both population abundance and genetic diversity. In contrast, pond size was related only to population abundance. As we predicted, the connectivity threshold distance for genetic diversity was more than two times greater than that for population abundance (12. 5 km versus 5 km, respectively). Our findings indicate that the landscape managers should consider various spatial scales as a conservation unit for the {{management of}} a habitat network in accordance with the conservation targets that they establish. We also found that small artificial agricultural ditches and streams may play important roles in sustaining the population networks of wetland organisms...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{synchronization}} {{refers to}} similarity in temporal variations between spatially separated populations. Three mechanisms {{have been associated}} with the spatial synchrony of populations: Moran effect, dispersal and trophic interactions. In this study, we explored the degree of spatial synchrony of three wader species populations (Pied Avocet, Black-winged Stilt and Kentish Plover) using monthly estimates of their abundance in inland lakes of the Iberian Peninsula. The effect of several types of wetland variables (structural, hydroperiod and landscape) on spatial synchronization was explored. Groups of lakes with significant synchronization were identified for all three species. The lakes with wastewater input presented longer hydroperiods than those that did not receive these effluents, and this factor was positively related to the spatial synchrony of the Pied Avocet and Kentish Plover populations. The distance between lakes (used as an indicator of the <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> on synchronization) was significant only in Pied Avocet. No structural or landscape variables were related to spatial synchronization in any species. It was impossible to identify any variable related to the spatial synchronization of Black-winged Stilt abundance as a possible result of the high ecological plasticity of this species. Our data provides the first evidence for mechanisms that act on the spatial synchronizing of wader populations in temporary continental lakes in central Spain, and show that the hydroperiod of lakes acts as an important factor in the spatial synchronization of aquatic species and that its effect is mediated by the reception of urban wastewater.

Segmentina nitida, Anisus vorticulus and Valvata macrostoma {{are affected by}} habitat loss, ditch management and eutrophication, but <b>dispersal</b> and fragmentation <b>effects</b> have also been postulated. We used landscape ecological approaches to examine such effects on these and 17 other gastropods on four English marshes, specifically combining ordination to identify suitable habitat with spatially-explicit analysis of occupancy. Among all gastropods, the occupancy of suitable habitat declined significantly as {{the distance to the}} nearest occupied site increased. S. nitida and A. vorticulus were among the species most affected, with median nearest distances from occupied to unoccupied suitable sites significantly greater by 3 − 4 X than distances between occupied sites. V. macrostoma was not limited locally by dispersal, but was absent from three out of four marshes with suitable habitat. Eutrophication (elevated N) had no effects on distances between occupied and unoccupied sites and did not contribute to fragmentation. Although four non-threatened species were apparently also limited by dispersal, only two (Armiger crista; Gyraulus albus) showed some combination of the <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects,</b> low occupancy of suitable habitat (< 50 %) and small niche extent that characterized RDB species. While dispersal alone cannot explain unfavourable conservation status in these wetland snails, our data support the hypothesis that limited dispersal between (all species) and within marshes (S. nitida and A. vorticulus) affect all three RDB snails in their remaining UK range. Action is required to better understand the population and genetic consequences; to better understand dispersal mechanisms; and to evaluate re-introduction and reinforcement as aids to recovery.

It is, however, still unclear how <b>effects</b> of <b>dispersal</b> differ depending on the initial diversity of local communities. Here we implemented an experiment where we manipulated the initial diversity of natural freshwater bacterioplankton communities using a dilution-to-extinction approach as well as dispersal from a regional species pool. The aim was further to test whether <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects</b> on bacterial abundance and functional parameters (average community growth rates, respiration rates, substrate utilisation ability) differ in dependence of the initial diversity of the communities. First of all, we found that both initial diversity and dispersal rates had an effect on the recruitment of taxa from a regional source, which was higher in communities with low initial diversity and at higher rates of dispersal. Higher initial diversity and dispersal also promoted higher levels of richness and evenness in local communities and affected, both, separately or interactively, the functional performance of communities. Our study therefore suggests that dispersal can influence the diversity, composition and functioning of bacterial communities and that this effect may be enhanced if the initial diversity of communities is depleted...|$|R

These processes are influenced by birth, death, and dispersal events, and characterizing them requires careful accounting of both the deterministic and stochastic processes operating at both local and regional population levels. We combined ecological theory and observations on Allee effects by linking mathematical analysis and the spatial and temporal population dynamics patterns of a highly endangered butterfly, the high brown fritillary, Argynnis adippe. Our theoretical analysis showed {{that the role of}} density-dependent feedbacks in the presence of local immigration can influence the strength of Allee effects. Linking this theory to the analysis of the population data revealed strong evidence for both negative density dependence and Allee effects at the landscape or regional scale. These regional dynamics are predicted to be highly influenced by immigration. Using a Bayesian state-space approach, we characterized the local-scale births, deaths, and <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects</b> together with measurement and process uncertainty in the metapopulation. Some form of an Allee effect influenced almost three-quarters of these local populations.

40|$|Orthopaedic infections can be polymicrobial {{existing}} as a microbiome. Infections often incorporate staphylococcal species, including Staphylococcus aureus. Such infections {{can lead}} to life threatening illness and implant failure. Furthermore, biofilm formation on the implant surface can occur, increasing pathogenicity, exacerbating antibiotic resistance and altering antimicrobial mechanism of action. Bacteria change dramatically during {{the transition to a}} biofilm growth state: phenotypically; transcriptionally; and metabolically, highlighting the need for research into molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation. Metabolomics can provide a tool to analyse metabolic changes which are directly related to the expressed phenotype. Here, we aimed to provide greater understanding of orthopaedic infection caused by S. aureus and biofilm formation on the implant surface. Through metagenome analysis by employing: implant material extraction; DNA extraction; microbial enrichment; and whole genome sequencing, we present a microbiome study of the infected prosthesis to resolve the causative species of orthopaedic hip infection. Results highlight the presence of S. aureus as a primary cause of orthopaedic infection along with Enterococcus faecium and the presence of secondary pathogen Clostridium difficile. Although results were hindered by the presence of host contaminating DNA even after microbial enrichment, conclusions could be made over the potential increased pathogenicity caused by the presence of a secondary pathogen and highlight method and sample preparation considerations when undertaking such a study. Following this finding, studies were focused on an orthopaedic clinical isolate of S. aureus and a metabolome extraction method for staphylococcal biofilms was developed using cell lysis through bead beating and solvent metabolome extraction. The method was found to be reproducible when coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and bioinformatics, allowing for the detection of significant changes in metabolism between planktonic and biofilm cultures to be identified and drug mechanism of actions (MOA) to be studied. Metabolomics results highlight significant changes in a number of metabolic pathways including arginine biosynthesis and purine metabolism between the two cell populations, evidence of S. aureus responding to their changing environment, including oxygen availability and a decrease in pH. Focused investigations on purine metabolism looking for biofilm modulation effects were carried out. Modulation of the S. aureus biofilm phenotype was observed through the addition of exogenous metabolites. Inosine increased biofilm biomass while formycin B, an inosine analogue, showed a <b>dispersal</b> <b>effect</b> and a potential synergistic effect in biofilm dispersal when coupled with gentamycin. Changes in metabolism between planktonic cells and biofilms highlight the requirement for antimicrobial testing to be carried out against planktonic cells and biofilms. Untargeted metabolomics was used to study the MOA of triclosan in S. aureus. The triclosan target and MOA in bacteria has already been characterised, however, questions remain over its effects in bacteria. Although the use of triclosan has come under increasing speculation, its full effects are still largely unknown. Results show that triclosan can induce a cascade of detrimental events in the cell metabolism including significant changes in amino acid metabolism, affecting planktonic cells and biofilms. Results and conclusions provide greater understanding of orthopaedic infections and specifically focus on the S. aureus biofilm, confirming S. aureus as a primary cause of orthopaedic infection and using metabolomic analysis to look at the changing state of metabolism between the different growth states. Metabolomics is a valuable tool for biofilm and drug MOA studies, helping understand orthopaedic infection and implant failure, providing crucial insight into the biochemistry of bacteria for the potential for inferences to be gained, such as the MOA of antimicrobials and the identification of novel metabolic drug targets...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{structure}} and underlying assembly mechanisms of bacterial communities {{have been studied}} widely across aquatic systems, focusing primarily on isolated sites, such as different lakes, ponds and streams.

Furthermore, null model approaches were used to quantify the relative importance of different community assembly processes. We found that spatial variation in bacterial communities within the lake was structured by different assembly processes, including stochasticity, species sorting and potentially even dispersal limitation. Species sorting by abiotic environmental conditions explained more of the taxonomic and particularly phylogenetic turnover in community composition compared with that by biotic variables. Finally, we observed clear differences in alpha diversity (species richness and phylogenetic diversity), which were to a stronger extent determined by abiotic compared with biotic factors, but also by <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects.</b> In summary, our study shows that the biodiversity of bacterial biofilm communities within a lake ecosystem is driven by within-habitat gradients in abiotic conditions and by stochastic and deterministic dispersal processes...|$|R

Of all ecosystems, anthropogenically important estuaries represent a â��melting potâ�� of environmental stressors, typified by extreme salinity variations and associated biological complexity. Although existing models attempt to predict macroorganismal diversity over estuarine salinity gradients, attempts to model microbial biodiversity are limited for eukaryotes. Although diatoms commonly feature as bioindicator species, additional microbial eukaryotes represent a huge resource for assessing ecosystem health. Of these, meiofaunal communities may represent the optimal compromise between functional diversity that can be assessed using morphology and phenotypeâ��environment interactions as compared with smaller life fractions. Here, using 454 Roche sequencing of the 18 S nSSU barcode we investigate which of the local natural drivers are most strongly associated with microbial metazoan and sampled protist diversity across the full salinity gradient of the estuarine ecosystem. In order to investigate potential variation at the ecosystem scale, we compare two geographically proximate estuaries (Thames and Mersey, UK) with contrasting histories of anthropogenic stress. The data show that although community turnover is likely to be predictable, taxa are likely to respond to different environmental drivers and, in particular, hydrodynamics, salinity range and granulometry, according to varied life-history characteristics.

We used a Bayesian framework to parameterize a patch occupancy model to 23 species censused in 46, 596 permanent plots in a 1 × 1 km grid across most Spanish forests. For most species, dispersal was the single best predictor of colonization, whereas climate and dispersal were equally important as predictors of extinction. Precipitation was positively correlated with the colonization rate of 12 out of 13 deciduous broad-leaved species, and negatively correlated with the extinction rate of nine of them. In contrast, precipitation equally decreased colonization and extinction of five out of eight of needle-leaved species (Juniperus and Pinus spp.). There was, however, marked variation among species in the magnitude of these effects, with some species exhibiting contrasting patterns for the colonization and the extinction process. Abundance of competing tree species (= summed plot basal area) was consistently correlated with decreased colonization of all needle-leaved species, and it increased the extinction rate of 6 out of 8 of these species. It had, nonetheless, weak facilitative effect on some broad-leaved species by promoting colonization (3 of 13 species) and decreasing extinction (7 of 13 species). With local colonization and extinction data, non-equilibrial and dynamic species distribution modelling can be improved by incorporating measures of biotic interactions and <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects,</b> along with traditional climate variables.

The hazards of silicic volcanism are judged to be negligible; hazards of basaltic volcanism are judged through research approaches combining hazard appraisal and risk assessment. The NTS region is cut obliquely by a N-NE trending belt of volcanism. This belt developed about 8 Myr ago following cessation of silicic volcanism and contemporaneous with migration of basaltic activity toward the southwest margin of the Great Basin. Two types of fields {{are present in the}} belt: (1) large-volume, long-lived basalt and local rhyolite fields with numerous eruptive centers and (2) small-volume fields formed by scattered basaltic scoria cones. Late Cenozoic basalts of the NTS region belong to the second field type. Monogenetic basalt centers of this region were formed mostly by Strombolian eruptions; Surtseyean activity has been recognized at three centers. Geochemically, the basalts of the NTS region are classified as straddle A-type basalts of the alkalic suite. Petrological studies indicate a volumetric dominance of evolved hawaiite magmas. Trace- and rare-earth-element abundances of younger basalt (< 4 Myr) of the NTS region and southern Death Valley area, California, indicate an enrichment in incompatible elements, with the exception of rubidium. The conditional probability of recurring basaltic volcanism and disruption of a repository by that event is bounded by the range of 10 {sup - 8 } to 10 {sup - 10 } as calculated for a 1 -yr period.

40|$|Although {{climate change}} and its {{implications}} are a freequent subject of detailed study, {{the effects of these}} changes on species' geographic distributions remain little explored. We present a first crossspecies analysis of the effects of global climate change on the distributions of one bird family, the Cracidae, in Mexico, based on projecting models of ecological niches freom present conditions to modeled future conditions taken freom general circulation models of climate change. Based on two different scenarios of {{climate change and}} on three assumptions regarding species' <b>dispersal</b> abilities, <b>effects</b> on species' distributions range freom drastic reduction to modest increases. These results illustrate the complex nature of species' geographic responses to environmental change, and emphasize the need for detailed analysis of individual species' ecological requirements.

40|$|This book {{investigates the}} {{mathematical}} analysis of biological invasions. Unlike purely qualitative treatments of ecology, it draws on mathematical theory and methods, equipping {{the reader with}} sharp tools and rigorous methodology. Subjects include invasion dynamics, species interactions, population spread, long-distance <b>dispersal,</b> stochastic <b>effects,</b> risk analysis, and optimal responses to invaders. While based on the theory of dynamical systems, including partial differential equations and integrodifference equations, the book also draws on information theory, machine learning, Monte Carlo methods, optimal control, statistics, and stochastic processes. Applications to real biological invasions are included throughout. Ultimately, the book imparts a powerful principle: that by bringing ecology and mathematics together, researchers can uncover new understanding of, and effective response strategies to, biological invasions. It is suitable for graduate students and established researchers in mathematical ecology...|$|R
40|$|Using {{analytical}} tools from game theory, {{we investigate}} {{the relevance of}} a series of hypotheses concerning natal dispersal, focusing in particular on the interaction between inbreeding and kin competition, {{as well as on the}} components of mating and social systems that are likely to interfere with these phenomena. A null model of pure kin competition avoidance predicts a balanced equilibrium in wich both sexes disperse equally. Inbreeding costs have the potential to destabilize the equilibrium, resulting in strongly sex-biased <b>dispersal.</b> This <b>effect</b> is mostly evident when the peculiarities of the mating system induce asymmetries in dispersal and/or inbreeding costs, or when kin cooperation counteracts kin competition. Inbreeding depression, however, is not the only possible cause for sex biases. The relevance of our results to empirical findings is dicussed and suggestions are made for further empirical or modelling work...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{conceived}} {{in the context}} of post- 2000 proliferation of Australian low-cost carriers and regional dispersal policy of the Australian government. The broad aim of this thesis is {{to examine the effects of}} low-cost carriers on regional dispersal of domestic visitors. Based on existing theoretical frameworks of tourists&# 146; spatial behaviour and multi-destination travel itinerary, two theoretical constructs - intra-modal and inter-modal effects &# 150; were developed to conceptualise the regional <b>dispersal</b> <b>effects</b> of low-cost carriers. The former refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other models of airline business, and the latter refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other modes of transport. Logit models and national-level revealed preference data were used to examine the intra-modal effects, while stated choice method was used to examine the inter-modal effects on two representative regional tourism destinations - Ballina-Byron and Cairns - in Australia. This thesis provides evidence that suggest low-cost carrier air arrivals tend to disperse for reasons that are different from network carrier air arrivals, supporting the significance of intra-modal <b>effects</b> on regional <b>dispersal.</b> It is claimed that the intra-modal effect is one reason why some destinations observe high growth in airport activity as a result of low-cost carrier entry, but the levels of tourism activities do not match that extrapolated from the level of growth in the incoming air traffic. Two case studies have shown that (1) ground transport policy can completely offset the negative effects on tourists&# 146; dispersal propensity stemming from pre-determined trip characteristics, although the effectiveness of such policy variables varies significantly across destinations; and (2) significant discounts in airfares are sufficient to trigger a modal switch, even in situations when a car is the most suitable mode for the trip, suggesting a real possibility of a bypass of ground-mode-reliant regions. The findings should be of interest to regional destination managers with low-cost carrier services as much as for managers in peripheral destinations without low-cost carrier services...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of recent}} climate change {{have already been}} {{detected}} in many species, and, in particular, in insects. The present paper reviews the key impacts of global warming on insect development and <b>dispersal.</b> The <b>effects</b> of climate change appear {{to be much more}} complex than a simple linear response to an average increase in temperature. They can differ between seasons and bioclimatic regions. Earlier flight periods, enhanced winter survival and acceleration of development rates are the major insect responses. Differential response of insects and hosts to warming up might also lead to disruption of their phenological synchrony, but adaptive genetic processes are likely to quickly restore this synchrony. In a number of cases, warming results in removing or relocating the barriers that limit present species’ ranges. It is also likely to facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive alien species. Finally, knowledge gaps are identified and future research interests are suggested...|$|R

The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a spatially explicit simulation experiment {{designed to assess}} relative impacts of macroecological traits on patterns of biological diversification under changing environmental conditions. Using a simulation framework, we assessed impacts of species' niche breadth (i. e., the range of their abiotic tolerances) and dispersal ability on resulting patterns of speciation and extinction and evaluated how these traits, in conjunction with environmental change, shape biological diversification. Simulation results supported both niche breadth and dispersal ability as important drivers of diversification {{in the face of}} environmental change, and suggested that the rate of environmental change influences how species interact with the extrinsic environment to generate diversity. Niche breadth had greater effects on speciation and extinction than dispersal ability when climate changed rapidly, whereas <b>dispersal</b> ability <b>effects</b> were elevated when climate changed slowly. Our simulations provide a bottom-up perspective on the generation and maintenance of diversity under climate change, offering a better understanding of potential interactions between species' intrinsic macroecological characteristics and a dynamic extrinsic environment in the process of biological diversification...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{disturbance}} often causes {{changes in}} communities. However, the mechanistic {{basis of these}} changes remains elusive. As all patterns in community ecology {{can be understood as}} a result of four processes (speciation, selection, drift, and <b>dispersal),</b> the <b>effect</b> of disturbance should depend on how disturbance disrupt these processes. We studied the effects of disturbance and productivity on species richness, community composition, and community dispersion (i. e., variation in community composition) in the vegetation of 120 boreal peatlands using null-model approach to determine whether community assembly processes differ between pristine and disturbed sites. Sites represented three peatland ecosystem types, each with two levels of productivity. Half of the sites were disturbed by drainage and half are pristine. Pristine and disturbed sites showed similar species richness. However, their community composition differed indicating a directional selection due to disturbance, whereas dispersion of disturbed and pristine communities did not differ suggesting no change in the relative strength of selection and drift. Our results suggest that understanding the combination of landscape level community changes and local selection pressures is important when restoration of degraded ecosystems is undertaken...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters describing my investigation of the behavioral ecology of burrowing owls (Speotyto cuniculariai) in southwestern Idaho. The purpose of my field research was to (1) determine how an environmental factor, such as food availability, could influence the behavior and dispersal movements of young owls, (2) develop a descriptive model of the post-fledging dispersal of juvenile burrowing owls, and (3) characterize habitat variables associated with burrowing owl nest sites and roost sites. Information contained in this thesis should be particularly useful to those interested in the proximate causes of <b>dispersal</b> or the <b>effects</b> of food availability on dispersal behavior, and to those involved and/or concerned with the management and conservation of burrowing owls...|$|R
40|$|Predicted {{climate change}} implies warmer weather {{and a higher}} {{frequency}} of extreme weather situations. The consequences of the warm July in 2003 was investigated {{in contrast to the}} cold July in 2004 in southern Sweden with focus on the dispersal rate of two species of burnet moths (Zygaenidae). During an extensive mark-release-recapture program in metapopulations of burnet moths substantial differences in inter habitat patch dispersal rates were observed. For two species of Zygaena it was 2. 14 and 2. 18 times higher during the warm year. Measured patch dispersal rate significantly declined towards the edges of the large study-area, suggesting that individuals disperse outside the study-area. No significant differences in dispersal rates were found between the two species studied. The dispersal rates were similar for both females and males, and no density dependent <b>effects</b> on <b>dispersal</b> or <b>effects</b> of amount of nectar rich flowers were found. Dispersal events appeared as distinct movements, often reaching several kilometres. We conclude that dispersal depend on climatic conditions. Exceptionally warm years may be especially important for survival of certain species in metapopulation systems and this may be crucial for the survival of populations during scenarios of climate change...|$|R
