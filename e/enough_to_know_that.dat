5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E
25|$|Langley {{arrived in}} Pittsburgh in 1867 {{to become the}} first {{director}} of the Allegheny Observatory, after the institution had fallen into hard times and been given to the Western University of Pennsylvania. By then, the department was in disarray – equipment was broken, there was no library and the building needed repairs. Through the friendship and aid of William Thaw, a Pittsburgh industrial leader, Langley was able to improve the observatory equipment and build additional apparatuses. One of the new instruments was a small transit telescope used to observe the position of the stars as they cross the celestial meridian. He raised money for the department in large part by distributing standard time to cities and railroads. Up until then, correct time had only occasionally been sent from American observatories for public use. Clocks were manually wound in those days and time tended to be imprecise. Exact time had not been especially necessary. It was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> at noon the sun was directly above the head. All that until railroad tracks were installed.|$|E

Talking to Sirius XM Radio in December 2013, where she gave an in-depth analysis of each song from the album, Gaga further expanded on the concept of new-wave feminism: [...] "The record's all about being comfortable underneath, because you are strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you don't have to be on top to know you're worth it," [...] she concluded.|$|E

500|$|Other themes {{prevalent}} in the episode include Lori's pregnancy. After getting into a heated argument, Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy. Although he didn't question who the biological father was, Robert Kirkman felt that Rick was [...] "smart <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the kid's either his or Shane's and {{there may not be}} any way of ever finding out that definitively." [...] He continued: [...] "Bringing that up to his wife, who he loves, is only going to be painful for her. I think that’s him being a good husband and him showing his tremendous leadership ability in that he can put his self aside for the betterment of someone else." ...|$|E
500|$|On 9 August 1942, {{his orders}} were {{abruptly}} changed. MacArthur, now Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area, had requested that a corps headquarters {{be sent to}} his command. Major General Robert C. Richardson, Jr., had originally been detailed for the assignment, but as Marshall informed MacArthur, [...] "Richardson's intense feelings regarding service under Australian command made his assignment appear unwise." [...] Eichelberger's I Corps headquarters was ready for overseas service and had training in amphibious warfare, and Eichelberger had experience working with MacArthur, so Marshall selected him for the job instead. Eichelberger was {{not happy with the}} assignment, especially when he found out about Richardson, and [...] "knew General MacArthur well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{he was going to be}} difficult to get along with".|$|E
500|$|It was {{met with}} general acclaim from {{television}} critics. Calling it engaging, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly opined that A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was [...] "disarmingly direct, sincere, and unpretentious." [...] Tucker praised Lady Gaga's performances in the television special, expressing {{that they were a}} [...] "warm, low-key collection of solid performances of her hits and pop standards." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the television special as a [...] "dream or a hallucination." [...] The Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman wrote, [...] "It was all inoffensive, silly and knowing, and laid down the groundwork for what looks likely to be the singer's next career: as America's in-house eccentric, fearless enough to satirize the country's traditions but canny <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> while you can deface as many Irving Berlin songs as you like, the turkey is non-negotiable." [...] In contrast, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was critically panned by Jen Carlson of Gothamist, who felt that it was a [...] "very transparent marketing ploy for the new Gaga holiday release." ...|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell’s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went back to find the door open and walked right in. Megan's intelligent <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E
2500|$|During the album's production, Vaughan {{appeared}} at the Houston Astrodome on April 10, 1985, where he performed a slide guitar rendition of the US national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner"; his performance was met with booing. Upon leaving the stage, Vaughan acquired an autograph from Mickey Mantle, who was a former player for the New York Yankees. Astrodome publicist Molly Glentzer wrote in the Houston Press: [...] "As Vaughan shuffled back behind home plate, he was only lucid <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he wanted Mickey Mantle's autograph. Mantle obliged. 'I never signed a guitar before.' Nobody asked Vaughan for his autograph. I was sure he'd be dead before he hit 30." [...] Critics associated his performance with Jimi Hendrix's rendition at Woodstock in 1969, yet Vaughan disliked this comparison: [...] "I heard they even wrote about {{it in one of}} the music magazines and they tried to put the two versions side by side. I hate that stuff. His version was great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Published {{as one of}} {{four stories}} (78 pages {{out of a total}} 239), [...] "The Bab Deception" [...] in The Hidden Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by non-Bahá'í William [...] "Bill" [...] Paxton (not the actor Bill Paxton) was {{published}} in 2000-1. A published synopsis: Set in August, 1896, Sherlock Holmes expounds at great length on his occult beliefs and invites Watson to a (spiritualism based) séance. Lestrade & Macintosh take Holmes & Watson to the home of Sir Randolph Gretzinger, former Ambassador to Persia, who has been murdered along with his servant. Holmes finds a copy of the Bayán in Gretzinger's hand, and he expounds at length on Bábism. Side note: Holmes is presented as having a high regard for the religion and being current on its situation <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Abo ol-Baha" [...] is a political prisoner at that time and knowing full well that the religion would never associate with such a plot having already suffered many martyrs and known to not organize any rebellion and instead maintained a peaceful, unified vision with all mankind. He deduces that the men have been injected with poison (from small wounds in their thumbs), and expounds at length on snake venom. The following day they are summoned to the Diogenes Club, where Mycroft expounds at great length on the politics of petroleum and how this may be the true reason for the murder. After visiting the dead man's widow and urging her to continue his oil negotiations with the Shah of Persia Holmes is visited by representatives of the Bahá'í Faith who fear that the book was planted on the body to implicate them. They expound at length on the assassination of the last Shah and feel an effort is being made to frame them, but Holmes assures them he is well aware of the reputation of the Bahá'ís and believes in their innocence. Holmes & Watson are invited to a séance and Holmes expounds at length on the other guests. At the séance a spirit claiming to be Moriarty hurls a dagger at Holmes. Holmes organizes London Baha'is into a [...] "Baker Street Baha'i", including ones in the Russian Embassy, to locate Gretzinger's missing appointment book from which Holmes is able to learn the murderer's name and establish the innocence of the Bahá'ís.|$|E
