40|$|Introduction In recent years, {{most large}} {{companies}} {{and many other}} large organizations have implemented database systems called data warehouses and some have also implemented OLAP systems. OLAP is an abbreviation for Online Analytical Processing. Some organizations have implemented Business Intelligence Systems and some have created <b>Executive</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems.</b> Many managers and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> specialists are interested in learning more about these relatively new types of Data-Driven Decision Support Systems. For many years, the prospects and problems of providing managers with real-time management information have been discussed and debated (cf., Dearden, 1966). The debate about costs, advantages, problems and possibilities must continue. This chapter explains Data-Driven Decision Support Systems from both a managerial and a technical point of view.

Contemporary trend is to focus these systems on the Corporate Performance Management (CPM), in which special processes, methodologies and metrics necessary for measurement and management of the business performance are used. This thesis explores how principles and tools of Competitive Intelligence (CI) may be applied in these systems. CI is another discipline useful for strategic management of a company. In the theoretical part of this thesis are briefly described principles of BI, CPM and CI. The main aim is to analyze the possibility, whether we can extend a potential of the <b>executive</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> through the usage of Competitive Intelligence principles and technologies. This part is based especially on technical literature and other relevant sources. The practical part of the thesis explores these questions on a real system called the Business Navigation System (BNS).

The contribution of this thesis in the theoretic area is the consideration; whether it's possible to derive benefit from the principles of CI in the <b>executive</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> The practical contribution is an evaluation of BNS and the suggestions, how to involve technologies of CI to the some modules of this system...|$|R
