40|$|Fluid {{injection}} in deep geological formations usually induces microseismicity. In particular, industrial-scale {{injection of}} CO 2 may induce {{a large number}} of microseismic events. Since CO 2 is likely to reach the storage formation at a lower temperature than that corresponding to the geothermal gradient, both overpressure and cooling decrease the effective stresses and may induce microseismicity. Here, we investigate the effect of the stress regime on the effective stress evolution and fracture stability when injecting cold CO 2 through a horizontal well in a deep saline formation. Simulation results show that when only overpressure occurs, the vertical total stress remains practically constant, but the <b>horizontal</b> <b>total</b> stresses increase proportionally to overpressure. These hydro-mechanical stress changes result in a slight improvement in fracture stability in normal faulting stress regimes because the decrease in deviatoric stress offsets the decrease in effective stresses produced by overpressure. However, fracture stability significantly decreases in reverse faulting stress regimes because the size of the Mohr circle increases in addition to being displaced towards failure conditions. Fracture stability also decreases in strike slip stress regimes because the Mohr circle maintains its size and is shifted towards the yield surface a magnitude equal to overpressure minus the increase in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>total</b> stresses. Additionally, cooling induces a thermal stress reduction in all directions, but larger in the out-of-plane direction. This stress anisotropy causes, apart from a displacement of the Mohr circle towards the yield surface, an increase {{in the size of the}} Mohr circle. These two effects decrease fracture stability, resulting in the strike slip being the least stable stress regime when cooling occurs, followed by the reverse faulting and the normal faulting stress regimes. Thus, characterizing the stress state is crucial to determine the maximum sustainable injection pressure and maximum temperature drop to safely inject CO 2. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons LtdV.

The numerical methodology used to analyse soil penetration is described, together with results from strain path method analyses used to validate various aspects of these analyses. The method was used to investigate the influence of various soil and interface parameters on the stress-strain changes that occur within the soil adjacent to the penetrating ‘simple wedge’. The results of these analyses indicate that the stress-strain behaviour of the soil is sensitive to the shear modulus and undrained shear strength of soil.

40|$|The use of {{diaphragm}} walls {{has been}} increased substantially {{over the past}} two decades and most of them are constructed in congested urban areas. The construction has been observed to cause significant changes of the stress regime and ground deformations around the wall. However, current understanding of the installation effects is still fairly limited. The aims of this research are to investigate the installation effects of the wall on stress changes and deformations; and to study factors that govern the ground responses. A series of three-dimensional numerical analyses has been carried out. Computed results are compared with field measurements, centrifuge model tests as well as theoretical solutions. Construction of a diaphragm wall in stiff Gault Clay has been selected and modelled three-dimensionally. The size of the panel is 0. 6 m wide (W), 8 m long (L) and 16 m deep (D). After the first panel is installed, substantial reduction in lateral total stress is found behind the centre and above the toe level of the panel. However, an increase of lateral total stress occurs (greater than the initial k[[white circle]] pressure) at the edges of the panel after the construction. Beneath the toe of the panel, <b>horizontal</b> <b>total</b> stress which is larger than the initial condition is computed. It is concluded that stresses in the ground are transferred simultaneously in both horizontal (by horizontal arching mechanism) and vertical (by downward load transfer mechanism) directions during the construction. Substantial amounts of shear stresses are developed at the edges as well as at the toe of the panel. A settlement bowl occurs at about 0. 2 D behind the panel after concreting. The computed soil movements (both vertical and horizontal) are not significant at a distance of about 1. 5 D away from the panel. Two additional panels adjacent to the first one are modelled and the results of these three panels are used to interpret the installation effects of a diaphragm wall constructed in the stiff Gault Clay. At the end of the construction, a very non-uniform <b>horizontal</b> <b>total</b> stress distribution is calculated behind the wall. Earth pressure behind the centre of panels at the end of the wall installation is smaller than the initial K[[white circle]] condition. However, stress concentration occurs at the edges of panels where the lateral pressure increases well above the initial conditions before the wall construction. Yielding of soil may occur behind the edges of panels. The ground deformation pattern is very non-uniform behind the wall and the both vertical settlement horizontal movements are insignificant at a distance of 1. 5 D behind the wall. Further construction of the fourth and fifth panels does not affect the stress regime and ground deformation noticeably behind the first panel Effects of different initial stresses in the ground and panel lengths on ground responses during a single panel installation are also studied. It is found that both of them have strong influences on the ground responses. For diaphragm wall panel with a longer panel length or installed in ground with a higher initial stress, larger ground movements are computed. The zone of influence on stress regime around the panel is 1 / 3 D beneath the panel, 2 D behind it and 0. 2 D adjacent to it. Normalization charts are provided to estimate three-dimensional ground movements during the installation by means of a conventional two-dimensional analysis...|$|E
40|$|Geotechnical {{engineering}} guidelines mandate {{the use of}} {{the most}} onerous hydraulic criteria for the design of earth retaining structures below the water table. Consequently, favourable local conditions, including the geometry of the structure, are not usually exploited. This means that retaining walls in particular are typically designed to resist hydrostatic pressures below the water table. Investigations have shown however that pore water pressures, axial stresses and bending moments reduce when groundwater seepage is allowed through the segmented linings of shallow tunnels. Contiguous pile retaining walls, by their nature, are also permeable. Allowing for groundwater seepage through the gaps in a retaining wall formed from contiguous piles could result in the pore water pressures on the active side of the wall being less than behind conventional impermeable retaining walls such as diaphragm walls. Numerical simulations, laboratory flow tank experiments and long-term field monitoring were conducted to determine the impact of pile gaps on the hydraulic conditions around contiguous piles. A relationship between the resulting bulk permeability of the equivalent structure and the pile gap was derived from 2 D numerical analyses and verified by flow tank experiments. This expression can be used to calculate bulk permeability values for uniform retaining walls representing circular piles in 2 D numerical simulations. The permeability relationship was used to calculate and assign equivalent bulk permeability values for a continuous retaining wall of uniform cross-section during the back analysis of the hydraulic conditions around the contiguous pile retaining wall at CTRL, Ashford. Pore water pressures and <b>horizontal</b> <b>total</b> stresses from the back analyses were consistent with those from the field measurements but were much lower than behind retaining walls formed from secant piles in similar conditions.

40|$|THESIS 6915 In 1996, a site {{adjacent}} to Kinnegar Sewage Treatment Plant, near Belfast, was made available (by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment) to Trinity College Dublin to perform load tests on driven piles. Since 1997, investigations at Kinnegar have included lateral load tests on single piles (Phillips 2002) and vertical load tests (both static and cyclic) on single piles and small pile groups (reported in this Thesis). Extensive site investigation data {{has also been}} assimilated over this period. Vertical load tests were carried out single reference piles and groups of five piles (centre to corner spacing of s/B= 3). Each precast concrete driven pile was 250 mm square and with an embedded length of 6 m, much of its load was carried in shaft friction. Some of these piles contained internal instruments allowing load distributions and <b>horizontal</b> <b>total</b> stresses to be estimated. Slow static load tests (in tension and compression, for single piles and groups) were of the maintained load type with a final displacement rate of 0. 24 mm/hour for each load increment. One-way cyclic tension tests (on single piles and groups) were carried out {{at a rate of}} 1 cycle/minute for between 180 and 550 cycles. There are two distinct facets to group action in driven piles: (i) the effect of neighbouring installations and (ii) the effect of loading adjacent piles. Both effects are likely to determine how the load-displacement relationship of a pile within a group differs from that of an isolated single or reference pile. It is commonly assumed that the soil surrounding any group pile is stiffened due to adjacent piling (i. e. its shear modulus increases) leading to improved individual performance under load. However, although the maximum excess pore pressures and total stress associated with group installation are higher than for a single pile, these are transient and return to original values very quickly. In fact, total stresses immediately after the installation of a five-pile group fall below those expected for a single pile. Upon full equalization of horizontal effective stresses, the value for the group appears to fall slightly below that expected for a single pile. This suggests that adjacent pile installation may have a small negative effect on subsequent pile performance. Independent data also suggests either a neutral or small negative installation effect. Group action in Belfast soft clay appears to be governed predominantly by the load transferred between group piles when under load. Tests on tension and compression fivepile groups (s/B= 3) are consistent in indicating that on average, the stiffness of the group is typically ? 45 % that of a single pile at a typical working load per pile 1 (alternatively, the group has displaced by over twice the amount of a single pile). The relative stiffnesses of the centre and corner piles (corresponding to a working load per pile) are more difficult to determine due to inconsistent pile cap flexibility; nevertheless the centre pile is typically ? 65 %- 85 % as stiff as a corner pile at any stage 2 of group loading. While relative pile capacities depend upon the flexibility of the pile-cap, the ultimate load in the centre pile falls 25 - 30 % below that of a single pile for a rigidly capped group. A load test on one group pile (with settlement measurements on adjacent non-loaded piles) proved instructive. It provided data to show that non-linear superposition (of displacements) is unsuitable for predicting the response of closely spaced piles but may be acceptable when widely spaced. The importance of choosing non-linear soil models is emphasized, as linear elastic ?interaction factors? grossly overestimate the amount of load transferred between piles and may lead to inefficient piling solutions. This data also contributed {{to the development of a}} trendline relating the stiffness efficiency to the pile spacing/width ratio (s/B), a useful design guide for small groups of the Belfast configuration. Its use in tandem with a suitable indication of the cost of constructing a capped group indicates that the economy of the solution is relatively insensitive to spacing in the range 4 B 2) causes little cyclic degradation. Failure in one-way cyclic tension is governed by the accumulation of mean pile head displacements and is not amplitude-driven...|$|E
