40|$|There are 300 - 500 {{million cases}} of malaria {{each year and}} {{of the more than}} one million people that die each year from malaria, most are {{children}} under 5 years of age. The cloning of malaria antigens in 1983 offered great hope of developing a viable subunit vaccine. While some subunit vaccines have shown great promise in model systems, an efficacious human vaccine is still not available. Immunological studies have shown that numerous factors such as parasite's antigenic variation and polymorphism, <b>immunological</b> <b>non-responsiveness</b> to individual vaccine antigens, parasite-induced apoptosis of immune effector and memory cells, immune deviation as a result of maternal immunity and alterations of dendritic cell function can impede the development of vaccines. These findings indicate that alternative novel approaches are required to tackle the disease and induce protection against malaria. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) specific for epitope(s) {{within the}} circumsporozoite (CS) protein of malaria sporozoites {{have been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in protective immunity against malaria, at least in murine models. Their role in sporozoite immunity in the human host has, however, not yet been elucidated. <b>Immunological</b> <b>non-responsiveness</b> and antigenlc diversity within T cell epitopes of the CS protein have been identified as potential problems in producing a sporozoite vaccine. These factors may contribute to the widespread lack of sporozoite immunity in endemic populations. In this study, 137 individuals with a history of natural endemic exposure to falciparum sporozoites (119 resident in north west Thailand and 18 resident in coastal Papua New Guinea) were tested for a CTL response to the Plasmodium falciparum CS protein Fifty-four overlapping peptides, spanning the entire sequence of the CS protein of P. falciparum including most known variants, were studied. While most individuals had antibodies to the immunodominant B cell repeat, (NANP) â‚™, and while CTL specific for an influenza virus matrix synthetic peptide could be generated from five of 23 Karen Thai individuals tested, no CS protein-specific CTL could be detected in these populations. Our data have important implications for vaccine programs...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) is a Gram-positive {{bacterial}} pathogen {{responsible for a}} wide variety of diseases. To date, GAS vaccine development has focused primarily on the M-protein. The M-protein is highly variable at the amino (N) -terminus (determining serotype) but is conserved at the carboxyl (C) -terminus. Previously a 29 amino acid peptide (named J 14) from the conserved region of the M-protein was identified as a potential vaccine candidate. J 14 was capable of eliciting protective antibodies that recognized many GAS serotypes when co-administered with immunostimulants. This minimal epitope however showed no immunogenicity when administered alone. In an attempt overcome this <b>immunological</b> <b>non-responsiveness,</b> we developed a self-adjuvanting vaccine candidate composed of three components: the B-cell epitope (J 14), a universal helper T-cell epitope (P 25) and a lipid moiety consisting of lipoamino acids (Laas) which target Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2). Immunological evaluation in B 10. BR (H- 2 k) mice demonstrated that the epitope attachment to the point of lipid moiety, and the length of the Laa alkyl chain have a profound effect on vaccine immunogenicity after intranasal administration. It was demonstrated that a vaccine featuring C-terminal lipid moiety containing alkyl chains of 16 carbons, with P 25 located at the N-terminus, and J 14 attached to the side chain of a central lysine residue was capable of inducing optimal antibody response. These findings have considerable relevance to the development of a broad spectrum J 14 -based GAS vaccine and in particular provided a rational basis for peptide vaccin...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) have {{a potent}} antigen-presenting {{capacity}} for recruiting resting T cells into immune responses. They also promote expansion of already activated memory T cells. By contrast, macrophages (M phi) are only effective in stimulating memory responses. Infection and depletion of DC occur in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) -infected individuals and recruitment of T cells into primary responses is blocked. Here comparisons between DC and M phi in stimulating secondary T-cell responses in HIV infection were made. Adherent M phi, and DC isolated by a new method, were separated from peripheral blood of patients in different stages of HIV infection and from uninfected controls and added to allogeneic lymphocytes in mixed leucocyte reactions (MLR). Some were pulsed with influenza virus or tetanus toxoid and used to stimulate autologous T cells. Responses were measured from uptake of [3 H]thymidine in 20 microliters hanging drop cultures. DC, but not M phi, from normal individuals stimulated MLR but both populations stimulated secondary responses to recall antigens. DC from all HIV seropositive individuals caused little or no stimulation of any lymphocyte responses. However, M phi from HIV seropositive asymptomatic individuals and those with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy stimulated responses to recall antigens. There was no stimulation using cells from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Blocked DC but not M phi function may underlie progressive <b>immunological</b> <b>non-responsiveness</b> in HIV infection. Without recruitment of resting T cells, loss of memory T cells may be cumulative; failure of secondary activation (e. g. by M phi) would lead to lost T-cell activity. Identification and circumvention of the defect in DC could offer new therapeutic approaches...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} {{interest in the}} field of tumour immunology, and the development of vaccine based strategies for immunotherapy of tumours, results in patients with cancer have been disappointing. This is partly {{due to the lack of}} development of clearly defined anti-tumour immune responses. The basis for the induction of specific anti-tumour non-responsiveness is not known. Recently, the liver has been recognised as an important organ in the regulation of peripheral immunological responses. It is characterised by a remarkable ability to induce tolerance to antigens from a variety of sources. Oral tolerance to food antigens, antigens from gut flora and other antigens administered via the oral route is partly dependent upon local immunoregulation in the liver. Transplantation of liver tissue shows a remarkable ability to induce tolerance in some species, not only to liver tissue but also to other organs and tissues transplanted at the same time. This tolerance can be transferred by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes. It has been suggested that the establishment of persistent infection in the liver by hepatitis viruses, may partly depend on the tolerogenic environment of the liver, and that this may also play a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic infections with these viruses. The liver is also a common and an important site for the development of metastases from many primary tumours. This is partly dependent upon the anatomic location and structure of the liver, but may also partly reflect the exploitation of the tolerogenic environment in the liver, allowing micrometastases to colonise and grow. This may account for the fact that the liver is such a common site for metastasis. Furthermore, once tolerance to tumour antigens is established in the liver, tolerated lymphocytes may migrate from the liver back to primary tumours and exacerbate <b>immunological</b> <b>non-responsiveness</b> at tumour sites. Indeed, if this happens early in tumour development, liver dependent tolerance to tumour antigens may play a significant role in tumour progression, and may partly determine impaired tumour responses in vaccine based immunotherapy strategies...|$|E
