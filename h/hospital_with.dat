40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{evaluated}} {{clinical outcomes}} {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction (MI) treated with fibrinolytic therapy in <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> and without coronary revascularization capability. BackgroundPatients with MI may have better outcomes when admitted to certain <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> coronary revascularization capability. Development of regional heart care centers {{for the treatment of}} MI has been proposed. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of 25, 515 U. S. patients enrolled in the Global Use of Streptokinase and TPA (alteplase) for Occluded Coronary arteries (GUSTO) -I trial. Outcomes of patients admitted to <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> and without coronary revascularization capability were analyzed. We also analyzed patients who remained in hospitals without coronary revascularization capability compared with those transferred to <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> revascularization capability. ResultsBaseline characteristics and complications were similar between patients in the two hospital types. Patients in <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> coronary revascularization capability more often underwent cardiac catheterization (78. 1 % vs. 59. 2 %; p 48 h after hospital admission. ConclusionsPatients receiving fibrinolytic therapy for acute MI admitted to hospitals without coronary revascularization capability appear to have outcomes similar to those of patients admitted to <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> such capability when aspirin and beta-adrenergic blocking agents are given appropriately and transfer is available for angiography and angioplasty as needed...|$|R
40|$|Hospitalization {{for mental}} {{disorders}} (Major Diagnostic Categories 19 and 20) was examined using the 1980 Hospital Discharge Survey (HDS) data. We {{added to the}} HDS data by noting whether each hospital had a specialized psychiatric and/or chemical dependency unit, especially noting short-term specialty psychiatric and chemical dependency hospitals. Of the approximately 1. 7 million episodes with MDC- 19 and - 20 diagnoses in the nation's nonfederal short-term hospitals in 1980, 13. 5 percent were in specialty hospitals. Of the remaining general hospital episodes: 31 percent occurred in <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> only psychiatric units, 5 percent in <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> only chemical dependency units, 31 percent in <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> both types of specialized treatment units, and 33 percent in <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> neither type of unit. The last figure is much less than previously thought. The five hospital types may be arrayed on a continuum of resource utilization and severity of cases treated, <b>with</b> general <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> no special units at one end, specialty hospitals at the other, and general <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> psychiatric or chemical dependency units intermediate. Presence or absence of a chemical dependency unit influences a hospital's profile in this regard, particularly for MDC- 20. Future studies should {{take into account the}} presence of a chemical dependency unit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} whether risk adjustment is evenly applicable to <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> various characteristics and case-mix. In this study, we applied a generic prediction model to nationwide discharge data from <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> various characteristics. Method We used standardized data of 1, 878, 767 discharged patients provided by 469 hospitals from July 1 to October 31, 2006. We generated and validated a case-mix in-hospital mortality prediction model using 50 / 50 split sample validation. We classified hospitals into two groups based on c-index value (<b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> c-index ≥ 0. 8; <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> c-index Results The model demonstrated excellent discrimination {{as indicated by the}} high average c-index and small standard deviation (c-index = 0. 88 ± 0. 04). Expected mortality rate of each hospital was highly correlated with observed mortality rate (r = 0. 693, p Conclusion The model fits well to a group of <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> a wide variety of acute care events, though model fit is less satisfactory for specialized <b>hospitals</b> and those <b>with</b> convalescent wards. Further sophistication of the generic prediction model would be recommended to obtain optimal indices to region specific conditions. </p...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on the {{hospital}} would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 per year for her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near Kilmainham and to build the new <b>hospital,</b> <b>with</b> the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building.

The remainder of the <b>hospital,</b> <b>with</b> space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.|$|E
