50|$|While Poetic {{was just}} {{beginning}} his formal hip hop career in 1987-89, Brainstorm was attending college at the State University of New York at Farmingdale, Long Island, {{where he was the}} roommate of Brooklyn’s own Super DJ Richie Rich (who had been in Third Base, Clark Kent’s Supermen, and the movie Juice). The college-based MC-DJ party collective called The Group Home Posse was loosely formed with Brainstorm and DJ Richie Rich to include his childhood friend The DJ-Rapper J.A.T. (Thomas Allen James), DJ Nike, Diamond Jay AKA “Americas Favorite DJ” (EPMD, Gravediggaz, Beyoncé Knowles), and <b>Diamond</b> <b>Shell</b> (Biz Markie’s brother) - all of whom attended Farmingdale University between 1987 and 1989. The university was host to many hip hop artists as visitors for parties and to do shows like Rakim, EPMD, Producer-Super DJ Clark Kent, and Biz Markie.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{explosion}} of 1973 and 1988, {{a group called the}} Concerned Citizens of Norco has attempted to engage in open discussions with Shell Chemical LP. The group has tried to resolve difference with Shell regarding the Voluntary Property Purchase program, “a program designed to create greenbelt space along the fence lines of the Shell and Motiva Enterprises (Motiva) facilities in Norco, Louisiana that was offered to residents living on two of the four streets that make up the tight-knit and historic Diamond neighborhood.” The discussions have resulted in Shell having a greater appreciation for the Diamond community. Both sides have also talked about the Shell and Motiva Good Neighbor Initiative, which contains programs that aim to enhance {{the quality of life for}} the citizens of Norco and <b>Diamond.</b> <b>Shell</b> has created a program that consists of a Property Purchase Component and a Home Improvement Component. The Property Purchase Program gives residents of Diamond the opportunity to stay in the community and take advantage of the Good Neighbor Initiative. The program is designed to improve the lives of the citizens, help the community grow, and preserve the history of the community. The Property Purchase Component allows Diamond residents to sell their property to Shell at a fair price and leave the community. The difference between the two community of Diamond and Shell has been solved and both sides have agreed to more open discussion if the need arises. The agreement was signed into effect of June 11, 2002.|$|E

40|$|Diamond has {{a unique}} {{combination}} of physical properties for the inertial confinement fusion ablator application, such as appropriate optical properties, high atomic density, high yield strength, and high thermal conductivity. Here, we present a feasible concept for fabrication of <b>diamond</b> ablator <b>shells.</b> The fabrication of diamond capsules is a multi-step process which involves diamond chemical vapor deposition on silicon mandrels followed by polishing, microfabrication of holes, and removing of the silicon mandrel by an etch process.

40|$|Synchrotron powder X-ray {{diffraction}} {{data are}} {{used to determine the}} core electron deformation of <b>diamond.</b> Core <b>shell</b> contraction inherently linked to covalent bond formation is observed in close correspondence with theoretical predictions. Accordingly, a precise and physically sound reconstruction of the electron density in diamond necessitates the use of an extended multipolar model, which abandons the assumption of an inert core. The present investigation is facilitated by negligible model bias in the extraction of structure factors, which is accomplished by simultaneous multipolar and Rietveld refinement accurately determining an atomic displacement parameter (ADP) of 0. 00181 (1) Å 2. The deconvolution of thermal motion is a critical step in experimental core electron polarization studies, and for diamond it is imperative to exploit the monatomic crystal structure by implementing Wilson plots in determination of the ADP. This empowers the electron-density analysis to precisely administer both the deconvolution of thermal motion and the employment of the extended multipolar model on an experimental basis...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) study of ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) materials produced by detonation technique. Analysis of the 13 C and 1 H NMR spectra, spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times in purified UNCD samples is presented. Our measurements show that UNCD particles consist of a diamond core that is partially covered by a sp 2 -carbon fullerene-like shell. The uncovered part of outer diamond surface comprises a number of hydrocarbon groups that saturate the dangling bonds. Our findings are discussed along with recent calculations of the UNCD structure. Significant increase in the spin-lattice relaxation rate (in comparison with that of natural diamond), as well as stretched exponential character of the magnetization recovery, are attributed to the interaction of nuclear spins with paramagnetic centers which are likely fabrication-driven dangling bonds with unpaired electrons. We show that these centers are located mainly at the interface between the <b>diamond</b> core and <b>shell.</b> Comment: 25 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
