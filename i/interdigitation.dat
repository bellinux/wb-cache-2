Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no <b>interdigitation</b> exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals.

40|$|Molecular {{mechanisms}} {{governing the}} plasticity of cellular boundaries in confluent epithelial monolayers are poorly characterised. In this thesis, we report a drastic reorganisation of cellular boundaries, provoked by the prolonged withdrawal of EGF from non-malignant mammary epithelial cells, MCF 10 A and HMT- 3522 cells. EGF withdrawal induces actin-rich <b>interdigitations</b> that protrude into neighbouring cells and are enriched in desmosomes. These protrusions allow the cellular sheets to resist mechanical and osmotic perturbation. Mobility {{of the cells}} within monolayers is also restricted. Overexpression of constitutively active Rac opposes <b>interdigitations</b> and induces membrane ruffling. EGF application reverses the <b>interdigitations</b> rapidly {{in a process that}} requires actin polymerisation and actomyosin contraction. We report here a simple in vitro system that can be utilised as a visual readout to dissect novel signaling pathways specific to EGFR activation and mammary morphogenesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT Placentas from {{pregnant}} cows {{with different}} gestation periods were used. Placental fragments of all groups were processed and evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. After fragment analysis, bovine placenta was observed to be epitheliochorial type in early pregnancy, becoming progressively sinepiteliocorial {{at the beginning}} of the second trimester. There are no ultrastructural evidences of inflammation in the region of caruncles throughout gestation, despite the invasion of caruncle proper lamina by trophoblast cells. However, throughout pregnancy and especially at the end, there were evident signs of cell degeneration in both trophoblast and the uterine epithelium. The active trophoblast cells intensely phagocytize cellular debris. There are complex <b>interdigitations</b> between the surface of the trophoblast and the uterine epithelium, which is related to the increase of the exchange surface between mother and fetus.

40|$|At chondral {{ligament}} insertions the calcified fibrocartilage interdigitates deeply {{with the}} lamellar bone. The shape of this interface is formed under physiological loading conditions. For {{the purpose of}} morphological comparison between different ligament entheses in the rabbit knee, the number and frequency of <b>interdigitations</b> and thickness of calcified fibrocartilage were quantitated at the femoral insertion of the medial collateral ligament, both insertions of the cruciate ligaments, and the tibial insertion of the patellar ligament. Among the insertions, the femoral insertion of the medial collateral ligament showed the lowest frequency and depth of <b>interdigitations</b> at the soft tissue-bone interface, but had the thickest zone of calcified fibrocartilage. An inverse relationship was found at the insertion interface of the cruciate and patellar ligaments. The frequency and depth of interdigations at the bone-soft tissue interface at different chondral entheses seem {{to be related to}} the mechanical strength of the respective ligament; meanwhile it may be hypothesised that the thickness of the calcified fibrocartilage might be more related to the amount of motion which takes place at an insertion...|$|R

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the lamprin {{family of}} proteins consists of several lamprin proteins from the Sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. Lamprin, an insoluble non-collagen, non-elastin protein, {{is the major}} connective tissue component of the fibrillar extracellular matrix of lamprey annular cartilage. Although not generally homologous to any other protein, soluble lamprins contain a tandemly repeated peptide sequence (GGLGY), which is present in both silk moth chorion proteins and spider dragline silk. Strong homologies to this repeat sequence are also present in several mammalian and avian elastins.

50|$|Vesosome multicompartment {{structure}} encapsulates unilamellar liposomes {{within a}} second bilayer. For this purpose, it’s necessary to form bilayers {{that can be}} opened and closed at will, without disrupting the inner content.

These are steady to removal of the residual ethanol until heated above the lipid chain melting temperature (Tm). The bilayers become flexible, and the sheets spontaneously close on themselves to form unilamellar vesicles. During the closure, the sheets can entrap whatever is around in suspension. By adding the vesicles aggregates including drug-loaded vesicles to the pelleted sheets before heating the mixture, encapsulation is carried out to form vesosomes.|$|E

50|$|Diffusive {{forces are}} {{somewhat}} like mechanical tethering {{at the molecular}} level. Diffusive bonding occurs when species from one surface penetrate into an adjacent surface while still being bound to the phase of their surface of origin. One instructive example is that of polymer-on-polymer surfaces. Diffusive bonding in polymer-on-polymer surfaces {{is the result of}} sections of polymer chains from one surface interdigitating with those of an adjacent surface. The freedom of movement of the polymers has a strong effect on their ability to interdigitate, and hence, on diffusive bonding. For example, cross-linked polymers are less capable of diffusion and <b>interdigitation</b> because they are bonded together at many points of contact, and are not free to twist into the adjacent surface. Uncrosslinked polymers (thermoplastics), on the other hand are freer to wander into the adjacent phase by extending tails and loops across the interface.|$|E
50|$|Some {{hypotheses}} {{contend that}} the <b>interdigitation</b> of canopy branches leads to “reciprocal pruning” of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbors until disturbed by mechanical abrasion. If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps. This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement. By this explanation, variable flexibility in lateral branches has a large bearing on degree of crown shyness.|$|E
50|$|Laminitis {{literally}} means {{inflammation of}} the laminae, and while it remains controversial whether this is the primary mechanism of disease, evidence of inflammation occurs very early in some instances of the disease. A severe inflammatory event is thought to damage the basal epithelial cells, resulting in dysfunction of the hemidesmosomes and subsequent reduction in adherence between the epithelial cells and the basement membrane. Normal forces placed on the hoof are then strong enough to tear the remaining laminae, resulting in {{a failure of the}} <b>interdigitation</b> of the epidermal and dermal laminae between the hoof wall and the coffin bone. When severe enough, this results in displacement of the coffin bone within the hoof capsule.
