25|$|International {{standard}} ISO 8601, {{which was}} accepted as European Standard EN 28601 and incorporated into various typographic style guides (e.g., DIN 5008 in Germany), brought about a new standard using the hyphen. Now all official European governmental documents use this. These norms prescribe writing dates using hyphens: 1789-07-14 is the new way of writing the first Bastille Day. This is also the typical <b>date</b> <b>format</b> used in large parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen.|$|E
25|$|This {{method has}} gained {{influence}} within North America, as most common computer filesystems make {{the use of}} slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \ and / as directory separators, but / {{is also used to}} introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \ is legal in filenames, it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an escape character. Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches. Apart from the separator used the non-year form of the <b>date</b> <b>format</b> is also identical to the standard American representation.|$|E

40|$|For {{most new}} SAS programmers SAS dates can be confusing.

50|$|The date {{argument}} can be given as a literal <b>date,</b> in MM/DD/YYYY <b>format</b> (other <b>date</b> <b>formats</b> are not accepted). Alternatively, the date {{argument can}} be given as a number, in which case it is taken to mean an age in days (i.e., the day date days before the present date).|$|R
40|$|In our work, {{we often}} receive {{administrative}} and research data in Microsoft Excel workbooks. This data {{is used for}} developing standardized approaches to administrative reporting and for research projects. A lot of it contains dates that don’t conform to either Excel or SAS ® <b>date</b> <b>formats,</b> and are rarely entered consistently in the Excel workbook. In the past, a secretary would spend hours going through these workbooks reformatting dates so {{they were in a}} form that SAS could understand. In SAS® 9, SAS introduced the ANYDATE INFORMAT that can read data in a variety of <b>date</b> <b>formats.</b> This has its limitations, too. To accommodate these limitations, we developed a SAS macro. With our SAS macro, we have converted reading dirty date data from non-SAS sources from a labor-intensive process into an easy routine task, saving hours of time and reducing data entry errors resulting from the manual re-entry of dates. This macro is robust and expandable {{to a wide variety of}} <b>date</b> <b>formats</b> that SAS programmers might encounter...|$|R
2500|$|Pi Day is {{an annual}} {{celebration of the}} {{mathematical}} constant [...] (pi).

2500|$|The entire {{month of}} March 2014 (3/14) was {{observed}} {{by some as}} [...] "Pi Month". [...] In the year 2015, Pi Day had special significance on 3/14/15 (mm/dd/yy <b>date</b> <b>format)</b> at 9:26:53 a.m. and also at p.m., with the date and time representing the first 10 digits of [...] Pi Day of 2016 was also significant because its mm/dd/yy represents pi rounded to the first five digits.|$|E
2500|$|The problem started {{because on}} both {{mainframe}} computers and later personal computers, storage was expensive, from {{as low as}} $10 per kilobyte, to in many cases as much as or even more than US$100 per kilobyte. It was therefore very important for programmers to reduce usage. Since programs could simply prefix [...] "19" [...] to the year of a date, most programs internally used, or stored on disc or tape, data files where the <b>date</b> <b>format</b> was six digits, in the form MMDDYY, MM as two digits for the month, DD as two digits for the day, and YY as two digits for the year. As space on disc and tape was also expensive, this also saved money by reducing the size of stored data files and data bases.|$|E
5000|$|Such ordinal <b>date</b> <b>formats</b> {{are also}} used by many {{computer}} programs (especially those for mainframe systems). Using a three-digit Julian day number saves one byte of computer storage over a two-digit month plus two-digit day, for example, [...] "January 17" [...] is 017 in Julian versus 0117 in month-day format. OS/390 or its successor, z/OS, display <b>dates</b> in yy.ddd <b>format</b> for most operations.|$|R

This is the {{recommended}} short <b>date</b> <b>format</b> for government publications. The first two digits of the year are often omitted in everyday use and on forms (e.g., 30/09/01).|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Data {{cleansing}} is {{an essential}} part of data mining and has become a pre-requirement before analysing any kind of data. The data collected by an organisation is enormous and full of errors and inconsistencies, which degrades the quality of data and affects the results of mining. Many algorithms have been proposed by several authors to deal with such inconsistencies. But, a little work has been done on the date type field. Being an integral part of any data we need to ensure that the date field associated with a database is consistent in all aspects. This paper addresses the various problems related with date type fields and different types of errors that can occur due to different <b>date</b> <b>formats.</b> We propose an algorithm DFT for the transformation of varying <b>date</b> <b>formats</b> into a unique consistent format to avoid any ambiguities. The data set for implementation of the algorithm is taken from the causelists of Supreme Court of India. The algorithm shows good results and transforms each date record into a unified format to avoid noise in the database...|$|R
