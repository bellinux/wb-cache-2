5|$|After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Port Authority was sued by {{survivors}} of the attack for negligence in not making security upgrades to known flaws that could <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> the attack. The Port Authority was ruled to be negligent.|$|E
5|$|Between 2007 and 2012 {{an average}} of 30,000 {{visitors}} came to the tower each year, with non-English speaking visitors making up a high proportion. The architecture of the tower has made it a challenging site to operate as a tourist attraction; the fluctuating heat and humidity, and capacity constraints, <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> it being adapted to house more delicate historical artefacts or accommodate additional visitor numbers.|$|E
5|$|Brønnøysund Airport {{installed}} the SCAT-I satellite-based landing system on 29 October 2007. Avinor's Steinar Hamar stated {{at the opening}} ceremony that the system would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> both Flight 710 and Flight 744 at Namsos Airport in 1993. The roll-out, taking place at most of Avinor's regional airports, is scheduled for completion in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> it.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1243, an {{uprising}} ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, {{was put on}} the throne. Scholars have argued that Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing opposition that led to Vladislav's deposition after the death of Asen. If he had been alive, Asen might <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> the coup.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, he could not <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> {{the launch of the}} American attack.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for The Progressive voluntarily {{underwent}} {{security reviews}} and were granted Q clearances {{that allowed them}} to access restricted nuclear information. Morland and The Progressives editors declined to obtain clearances, as {{they would have had to}} sign non-disclosure agreements that would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> them from publishing the article. This resulted in the lawyers being restricted in their communications with their clients.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} several {{proposals}} for connecting the SIR with the subway system (including the incomplete Staten Island Tunnel and a possible line along the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), as it uses B Division-sized cars and loading gauge, but various economic, political, and engineering difficulties <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> this from happening.|$|E

5|$|The Eurymedon was {{a highly}} {{significant}} victory for the Delian League, which probably ended {{once and for all}} the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece. It also seems to <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC. The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon's campaign there.|$|E
5|$|The warriors {{retreated to}} Prophetstown where, {{according}} to one chief's account, the warriors confronted Tenskwatawa. They accused him of deceit because of the many deaths, which his spells were supposed to <b>have</b> <b>prevented.</b> He blamed his wife for desecrating his magic medicine and offered to cast a new spell; he insisted that the warriors launch a second attack, but they refused.|$|E
5|$|About 36hours {{prior to}} the {{hurricane}} making landfall, {{when it was still}} south of Cuba, the Miami Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert for South Florida. About 18hours before landfall, the alert was replaced by a hurricane warning. The advance warning time was believed to <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations, such as securing windows.|$|E

5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E
5|$|Carolingian support {{may have}} been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E

5|$|Concussions are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees, and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques {{which could have}} led to a faster identification, as well as techniques which could have reduced its impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which could <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite could serve as a base for all TLS implementations.|$|E
