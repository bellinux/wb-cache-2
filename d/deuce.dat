5|$|In {{the next}} match, Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter faced <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino for the WWE Tag Team Championship. <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match and mocked the champs because of their feud over the United States Championship, which MVP held. <b>Deuce</b> N' Domino took advantage of Hardy and MVP's fight {{with each other and}} isolated Hardy. Hardy tossed MVP out of the ring and delivered a Twist of Fate to <b>Deuce</b> and pinned <b>Deuce.</b> In result, MVP and Matt Hardy retained the WWE Tag Team Title.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} an open {{challenge}} by <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino to any tag team for the WWE Tag Team Championship, which was accepted by Jimmy Snuka and Sgt. Slaughter.

5|$|On February 2, London and Kendrick {{suffered}} a non-title {{loss to the}} rookie team <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino. A further tag team match loss and a singles loss for Kendrick to <b>Deuce</b> led to a championship match at No Way Out, in which London and Kendrick were victorious. They retained the championship against MNM on SmackDown in March, and then retained the championship against <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino again in April, after <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino were disqualified. In a rematch the following week on the April 20 episode of SmackDown!, London and Kendrick lost the championship to <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino. During the match London missed a moonsault from the ring apron to the floor kayfabe injuring his ribs, leaving Kendrick to battle <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino alone. London and Kendrick's reign was the longest in the championship's history at 331 days until it was surpassed by The New Day in 2016. Selling his storyline injured ribs, London was absent from physical action until the May 11 episode of SmackDown, when he defeated Domino in singles competition. London and Kendrick unsuccessfully competed for the title on June 1 in a triple threat tag team match, which also involved Regal and Taylor, and lost a rematch on June 15 in a standard tag team match.|$|E

Three weeks later, London and Kendrick competed against William Regal and Dave Taylor. <b>Deuce</b> 'n Domino interfered, causing Regal and Taylor to be disqualified.
