40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetAlthough {{the number}} of wood-boring beetles attacking fruit trees is {{relatively}} small and their infestations are sporadic, four species found in New York are capable of seriously damaging or killing trees. They differ some in biology and life history, but they are addressed here as a group because their general activities as a pest class are similar. Taken in order of importance and frequency as a pest, they are the roundheaded appletree borer, flatheaded appletree borer, broad necked root borer, and tilehorned prionus. With {{the exception of the}} flattheaded appletree borer, which is a buprestid (metallic woodboring beetle), they belong to the cerambycid (long-horned beetle) family, and the last two are closely related species in the group known as prionus root borers. All are native to and widely distributed throughout the United States and southern Canada. They all damage deciduous fruit and shade trees by tunneling as larvae in to the conducting tissue of the lower trunk, crown, and roots and compounding the injury by providing an entryway for destructive fungi. Each of these pests attacks a broad range of host plants. All four species attack apple, cherry, peach, and plum, and the roundheaded and flatheaded borers also occur in quince, pear, flowering crabapple, mountain ash, shadbush, cotoneaster, and hawthorn. The <b>flatheaded</b> <b>borer</b> and {{one or both of the}} two Prionus species are also serious pests of numerous other trees, including pecan, hickory, poplar, willow, chestnut, oak, maple, dogwood, linden, and several shrubs...|$|E
50|$|Dicerca tenebrica (commonly {{known as}} <b>flatheaded</b> wood <b>borer)</b> is a brassy to black {{coloured}} beetle from Chrysochroinae subfamily {{which can be}} found in Canada and both Southern and Northeastern United States.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{species of}} <b>flatheaded</b> <b>borers</b> {{of the family}} Buprestidae feed on spruce and fir, but hemlock is their {{preferred}} food source (Rose and Lindquist 1985). As with roundheaded borers, most feeding occurs in dying or dead trees, or close to injuries on living trees. Damage becomes abundant only where a continuing supply of breeding material is available. The life history of these borers {{is similar to that}} of the roundheaded borers, but some exceedingly long life cycles have been reported under adverse conditions. Full-grown larvae, up to 25 mm long, are characteristically flattened, the anterior part of the body being much broader than the rest. The bronzed adults are usually seen only where suitable material occurs in sunny locations.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem is}} {{concerned}} with the infestation of coniferous logs by barkbeetles and wood-boring insects during the first season following the felling of the tree. The meristem and wood insects concerned in this study were all members of the order Coleoptera, families Cerambycidae (roundheaded <b>borers),</b> Buprestidae (<b>flatheaded</b> <b>borers),</b> Scolytidae(barkbeetles and ambrosia beetles), and Curculionidae (weevils). The coniferous logs under consideration were cut from tree species of pine, spruce, balsam, and hemlock, all found in Eastern Canada. The present study considers the attractiveness of such logs to oviposition by the barkbeetles and woodborers as influenced by a number of factors enumerated below. Furthermore it investigates the effect of some of these factors upon the subsequent development of these insects after establishment. Of necessity, such a field experiment can only indicate a number of trends but since most of the operating factors cannot be considered independently with any accuracy, the writer believes that an extensive rather than an intensive survey is all that is justified at present.

50|$|The hickory {{bark beetle}} (Scolytus quadrispinosus) feeds in the cambium and seriously weakens or even kills some trees. Adults of the hickory spiral borer (Agrilus arcuatus torquatus) feed on leaves, but the larvae feed beneath the bark {{and can be}} very {{destructive}} to hickory seedlings. The <b>flatheaded</b> appletree <b>borer</b> (Chrysobothris femorata) likewise is a foliage-feeder as an adult, but its larvae feed on the phloem and outer sapwood.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine various host and microclimatic {{influences}} affecting the survival and development of the <b>flatheaded</b> fir <b>borer,</b> Melanophila drummondi (Kirby) in Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco residues. It also expands current knowledge of the biology, bionomics, life history, ecology, and biotic potential for decomposition of forest residues by this insect. The primary study objective was to determine the optimum host and microclimatic conditions for development of the <b>flatheaded</b> fir <b>borer</b> by measuring the rate of beetle development with an index employed in other studies on forest insects. The monthly rates of development of larvae from clearcut and partial cut (shelterwood system) logs and from 15. 6 °, 21. 1 °, and 26. 7 °C controlled-temperature rearings were determined over the development season. Inner phloem moisture content and pH were monitored monthly from four quadrants (south-top, south-bottom, north-bottom, and north-top) on logs from each treatment throughout the season. Measurements of ambient air temperature and precipitation for the two field sites were used to correlate the microclimate of the host to these physical factors of weather. In addition, various other studies examined the relationship between inner phloem temperature and ambient air temperature on cloudy and clear days and also between logs of different bark thicknesses, and at the top and bottom of a log. Forest residues are attacked immediately after they become available from timber cutting or tree mortality in the spring and summer. Tops down to 7. 62 cm in diameter are utilized by this beetle, although thinner bark of small diameter residues afford less protection from temperature extremes, parasites and avian predators than thick-barked residues. Eggs are typically deposited on the tops or upper sides of logs and residues by woodborers, and they also prefer clearcuts over partial cuts. Furthermore, larval densities are higher on the tops and sides of residues and on clearcuts, compared to other locations. The top portion and upper sides of residues are characterized by warmer inner phloem temperatures, lower moisture contents, and less acidity than the bottom half of logs and residues on the ground. In addition, clearcut logs are generally characterized by these qualities. Temperature and moisture differences around the logs are believed to affect the distribution of the flatheaded woodborers within logs. Although the <b>flatheaded</b> fir <b>borer</b> invades residues on both clearcuts and partial cuts, the clearcuts are preferred because of warmer temperatures. The rate of development is also greatest on clearcuts, and maturity to adult is reached sooner due to faster accumulation of heat units on these sites. The clearcut represents optimal conditions for development and survival of this insect. Larvae reared at three different constant temperatures in the laboratory failed to develop past the 3 rd instar (pre-pupa), presumably because of the lack of a cold period which is required to break diapause in this resting stage. Parasitism accounts for the greatest proportion of woodborer mortality. Other mortality factors include resinoisis, predation, and unknown causes. Various parasites were reared and identified as mortality factors, but Atanycolus longifemoralis Shenefelt was most frequently observed. Other parasites and predators are discussed in their role as natural enemies of the <b>flatheaded</b> fir <b>borer.</b> An accurate and precise linear regression method is described which enables the estimation of inner phloem surface area of larval galleries from measurements of the gallery length. Its use in estimating woodborer-caused deterioration in forest residue surveys is emphasized...|$|R
