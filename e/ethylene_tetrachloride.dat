40|$|Preparation of TiO 2 nano―particles with {{controllable}} surface {{charges for}} electrophoretic display {{was investigated in}} <b>ethylene</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> Isopar H and dodecylbenzene, in which TiO 2 nano―particles were modified by anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and polymers, respectively. The research results showed that TiO 2 nano―particles modified by cationic surfactants had negative charges in <b>ethylene</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> while it had positive charges in Isopar H and dodecylbenzene, the nano―particles modified by anionic surfactants had the opposite character. The influence of concentration of charge control agents on TiO 2 nano―particles surface charges was discussed, in which TiO 2 nano―particles were modified by sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and styrene/divinylbenzene, respectively. It was shown that &xi; potential of TiO 2 nano―particles had a minimum value near the critical micelle concentrations of the charge control agents, and a regular change with the increasing concentration, while the property of &xi; potential was still maintained. So, preparation of controllable surface charges of TiO 2 nano―particles can be achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{research}} for this dissertation uncoated, silane-coated and UV-modified nanoscale zinc oxides with a high surface area (130 m²/g) have been synthesised for the first time. These nano-porous materials are more robust than the so far described zinc oxides. Also the UV treated material is more effective than nanoscale titanium dioxide for the photocatalytic mineralisation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. Uncoated and silane-coated nanoscale zinc oxides are synthesised by a sol-gel process in solvents containing a high zinc-ion concentration. Such high zinc concentrations in the sol-gel process have not been used before because of the strong aggregation of zinc oxide particles that result. To affect the aggregation alkoxyalkylsilanes with organic functional groups were used as coating molecules. Previously known formulations of the synthesis of uncoated nanomaterials were optimized and the use of silanes was adjusted as coating substrates. Special for the synthesis of coated zinc oxide is the presence of the coating substrate during the precipitation of the zinc oxide particles. Thus a surface modification of the primary particles takes place in statu nascendi. In this state a competition takes place between primary particle aggregation and the reaction of the surface of the primary particles with the silane coating molecules. The high reactivity of the ZnO particle surface is used to form covalent bonds between the silanes and the zinc oxide surface. Depending on the silane concentration different types of bonds between the silanes and the surface of the particles (T 0, T 1 and T 2) have been characterised by spectroscopical techniques. (e. g. 13 C- and 29 Si solid state NMR-studies) In a second step the silane-coated surface is photooxidized by UV-irradiation. This results in a high BET-surface (130 m 2 /g), purely inorganic porous oxidic network composed of polycyclic silasesquioxane-bridged zinc oxide particles. Furthermore, properties of the obtained material, like pH-stability and storage stability, as well as the possible use as an heterogenous photocatalyst for the photo-oxidative mineralisation of chlorinated hydrocarbons (e. g. <b>ethylene</b> <b>tetrachloride)</b> and in photovoltaic application (e. g. thin films in Graetzel-cells) have been investigated...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{study results}} {{addressing}} the carcinogenicity of six compounds related to vinyl chloride (vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, carbon <b>tetrachloride,</b> <b>ethylene</b> dibromide and epichlorohydrin) are reviewed. The study results suggest an increased carcinogenic risk among workers exposed to epichlorohydrin and to dry {{cleaning and degreasing}} solvents. Although several studies report no significant excess of cancer mortality, {{an evaluation of the}} design of these investigations demonstrates that these negative cohort studies consisted of populations of insufficient sample size and latency to permit any meaningful conclusions regarding carcinogenic risk. Therefore, experimental studies must be relied upon to determine whether several of these substances pose a potential carcinogenic risk to humans. Available evidence indicates that all of these substances have demonstrated a carcinogenic response in experimental animals and most are mutagenic in experimental test systems...|$|R
40|$|Feshbach-Fano {{resonance}} theory (FFRT) is used {{to determine}} the energy dependence of the complex energy shift function, consisting of the real energy shift and the resonance width, and the background phase shift for several simulated molecular shape resonances. Attention is paid to the way the choice of the quasibound state (QBS) function required in the FFRT affects these energy dependencies. An overlap criterion for choosing an optimal QBS function is proposed. Using our treatment on t-butylchloride, carbon <b>tetrachloride,</b> <b>ethylene,</b> and benzene, we give numerical results for specific cases of l = 1 through 4. We find that the real energy shift function does not vary greatly over the width of the resonance, although the magnitude of the shift can be fairly large. We also find that the behavior of the background phase shift due to orthogonality scattering is sensitive to the presence of long-range potentials...|$|R
40|$|Chlorinated solvents, {{especially}} trichloroethylene (TCE), are {{the most}} widespread groundwater contaminants in the United States. Existing methods of pumping and treating are expensive and laborious. Phytoremediation, the use of plants for remediation of soil and groundwater pollution, is less expensive and has low maintenance; however, it requires large land areas {{and there are a}} limited number of suitable plants that are known to combine adaptation to a particular environment with efficient metabolism of the contaminant. In this work, we have engineered plants with a profound increase in metabolism of the most common contaminant, TCE, by introducing the mammalian cytochrome P 450 2 E 1. This enzyme oxidizes a wide range of important pollutants, including TCE, <b>ethylene</b> dibromide, carbon <b>tetrachloride,</b> chloroform, and vinyl chloride. The transgenic plants had a dramatic enhancement in metabolism of TCE of up to 640 -fold as compared with null vector control plants. The transgenic plants also showed an increased uptake and debromination of ethylene dibromide. Therefore, transgenic plants with this enzyme could be used for more efficient remediation of many sites contaminated with halogenated hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{association}} between NHL (Non Hodgkin Lymphoma), solvents and occupation {{are reported in}} several studies. Our italian national case-control study was inserted within the INTERLYMPH consortium for the GWAS protocol and to examine new etiological hypothesis of NHL, studying the role of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs), occupational and personal factors such as diet, location of house, smoke. The study is ongoing. Methods 109 cases of lymphoma and 43 healthy controls were recruited in a research unit of Bari and Taranto within an, since 2007. Cases and controls were invited to blood sample drowning for serum measurement of xenobiotic and DNA analysis of SNPs and to administration of a questionnaire. In this phase we only produce a description of different subtypes of lymphoma recruited in our research unit and {{to carry out a}} preliminary assessment of the role of occupational factors using CAREX job exposure matrix, for the lack of haematic and genetics data Results The found subtypes of lymphoma, according the fifth level WHO 2008 classification, among blue collars, showed an higher proportion of NHL, mainly represented by Diffuse Large B- subtype (DLBCL) and Follicular lymphoma (FL). In the multivariate analysis an higher risk of lymphoma was reported among the blue collars [OR= 4, 06 (1, 03 - 15. 96) ]. Moreover, the exposure to some carcinogenic solvents (Benzene, carbone <b>tetrachloride,</b> <b>ethylene</b> dichromate, dibromoethane), adjusted by several variables in a multiple unconditional regression model, resulted associated to lymphoma [OR= 3, 29 (1, 36 - 7, 94) ]. Discussion Benzene is a carcinogenic to humans (group 1, IARC); trichloroethylene is classified as probably carcinogenic to humans (group 2 b); carbon tetrachloride, used as a solvent, is related to an excess risk for NHL for women; dibromoethane is considered as a carcinogen by the IARC (Class 2). In scientific literature the associations between these carcinogenic solvents and NHL are still weak and unknown, because of the different subtypes distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} reactivity of the halogenoalkylsilicon compounds has been reviewed and the published quantitative {{work on the}} decomposition of 2 -halogenoalkylsilicon compounds outlined. The gas phase thermal decomposition of 2 [...] chloroethyltrichloro-silane has been investigated in a static system between 356 and 417 C at initial pressures of 12 - 138 mm. Hg. Use {{has been made of}} pressure measurement, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to obtain kinetic data and to establish the mechanism of the reaction. The over-all reaction scheme is, 1. ClCH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3 [right arrow] CH 2 =CH 2 + SiCl 4, 2. ClCH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3 [right arrow] CH 2 =CH. SiCl 3 +HCl 3. ClCH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3 [right arrow] CH 2 =CHCl+ HSiCl 3, 4. CH 2 =CHCl + HSiCl 3 [right arrow] CH 2 =CH. SiCl 3 +HCl, 5. CH 2 =CH 2 + HSiCl 3 [right arrow] CH 3. CH 2. SiCl 3 where <b>ethylene</b> and silicon <b>tetrachloride</b> account for 72 % of the reaction products. A brief study of the subsidiary reactions, 4 and 5, has been made and approximate kinetic data obtained. These reactions are suppressed by nitric oxide and cyclohexene. Reactions 1, 2 and 3 are shown to be simultaneous unimolecular eliminations and the Arrhenius equation for the major reaction, ethylene elimination, is: k 1 (Sec. - 1) = 1011. 26 + 0. 16 e- 45, 5000 + 500 /RT The low pre-exponential term corresponds to ?S 1 = - 8. 0 + 0. 7 e. u., which suggests a cyclic transition state. In particular, a "quasiheterolytic" transition state may be involved, as in the thermal decomposition of alkyl halides and carboxylic esters, and this possibility is discussed, although accurate correlation cannot be made until more results are available on other 2 -halogenoalkylsilicon compounds. An analogous study has been carried out on 2 -chloroeth 1 -dimethlphenylsilane between 236 and 390 C. It has been shown that the reaction, ClCH 2 CH 2 SiMe 2 Ph [right arrow] CH 2 =CH 2 + ClSiMe 2 Ph accounts for more than 99 % of the reaction products. However, the reaction is very sensitive to surface condition and it was not found possible to isolate the homogeneous decomposition. Suggestions for resolving this difficulty are made...|$|R
