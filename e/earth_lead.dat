The wind picks up dust and other particles which, when they collide with the terrain, erode the relief and leave deposits (eolian processes).

40|$|Long-term space voyages pose {{numerous}} {{known and}} unknown health hazards, {{to the human}} immune system. Well-studied clinical examples of secondary immunodeficiencies created on <b>Earth,</b> <b>lead</b> one to predict that the conditions of prolonged space flight would weaken the human immune responses that normally hold infection and cancer in check. From evidence gathered from humans flown for prolonged periods in space and from human models of space flight studied on Earth {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that space travelers to the planet Mars would experience a weakening of immunity. Subtle defects of immune cell structure and function have been observed in astronauts, such as weakening of specific T-lymphocyte recall of specific antigens. Ground-based models also have demonstrated alterations of immune function, such as the elevation of neuroendocrine immune system messengers, interleukin- 6, and soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor in sleep deprivation. Since severe immune compromise the clinical consequences of reactivation of latent virus infections and the development of cancer, has yet to be seen in space flight or in the Earth models, it is extremely important to begin to quantify early changes in immunity to predict the development of immune system collapse with poor clinical outcomes. This approach is designed to validate a number of surrogate markers that will predict trouble ahead. Inherent in this research is the development of countermeasures to reduce the risks of infection and cancer in the first humans going to Mars...|$|E

Wall paintings are documented by photographs and drawings. It was aimed to determine the application technique and material properties of the paintings. Wall {{paintings of the}} Taxiarhis Church were executed in two different periods. Hence, samples including all periods were collected. Basic physical properties, raw material compositions, chemical and mineralogical compositions and micro structures of the plaster layers were determined. Chemical and mineralogical compositions and the microstructure of the painting layers and weight loss of the binder due to heat were determined. These studies were carried out by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope, thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Wall paintings were executed on fine lime plaster by using vegetable oils (linseed, walnut, poppy seed, etc.) by oil painting technique. Wall paintings of both periods were executed on fine lime plasters. Vegetable oil mixed with ZnO was used in the preparation of binding media. Priming layer over binding layer is composed of Anglesite (PbSO 4) and vegetable oil. Pigments that gave the color to the paintings were executed on the priming layer and may be defined as green <b>earth,</b> <b>lead</b> red and iron oxide. Vandalism is an important effect in the deterioration of the paintings. Beside this, crack formation on the paint surfaces and disintegration of the fine plaster and paint layers due to the wetting drying cycles are observed. Deteriorations observed on paintings will be prevented by the consolidation of the structure and the control of the dampness.

40|$|We use a time dependent, microphysical cloud {{model to}} study the {{formation}} of carbon dioxide clouds in the Martian atmosphere. Laboratory studies by Glandor et al. show that high critical supersaturations are required for cloud particle nucleation and that surface kinetic growth is not limited. These conditions, which {{are similar to those}} for cirrus clouds on <b>Earth,</b> <b>lead</b> to the formation of carbon dioxide ice particles with radii greater than 500 micrometers and concentrations of less than 0. 1 cm(exp - 3) for typical atmospheric conditions. Within the current Martian atmosphere, CO 2 cloud formation is possible at the poles during winter and at high altitudes in the tropics during periods of increased atmospheric dust loading. In both cases, temperature perturbations of several degrees below the CO 2 saturation temperature are required to nucleate new cloud particles suggesting that dynamical processes are the most common initiators of carbon dioxide clouds rather than diabatic cooling. The microphysical cloud model, coupled to a two-stream radiative transfer model, is used to reexamine the impact of CO 2 clouds on the surface temperature within a dense CO 2 atmosphere. The formation of carbon dioxide clouds leads to a warmer surface than what would be expected for clear sky conditions. The amount of warming is sensitive to the presence of dust and water vapor in the atmosphere, both of which act to dampen cloud effects. The radiative warming associated with cloud formation, as well as latent heating, work to dissipate the clouds when present. Thus, clouds never last for periods much longer than several days, limiting their overall effectiveness for warming the surface. The time average cloud optical depth is approximately unity leading to a 5 - 10 K warming, depending on the surface pressure. However, the surface temperature does not rise about the freezing point of liquid water even for pressures as high as 5 bars, at a solar luminosity of 75 % the current value...|$|E
40|$|Of vital {{significance}} for {{an understanding of}} the origin and evolution of the earth is investigation of the physical properties and stability relationships of minerals and rocks at high pressures and temperatures, and of the more volatile components such as water and carbon dioxide which affect the behavior of the minerals and rocks under these conditions. Geophysical techniques, particularly the methods of seismology, provide information about the properties of the material within the earth, and high-pressure studies of materials of known composition are important supplements to the seismological studies. Geological and petrological studies of rocks now exposed at the surface of the <b>earth</b> <b>lead</b> to the formulation of hypotheses for the origin and history of these rocks and deductions about the composition of the material at depth from which some of the rocks are derived. These hypotheses can be tested by reproducing the estimated conditions of formation within the laboratory. The important processes occurring in the outer part of the earth usually involve heterogeneous equilibria. Within the earth's mantle, solid-solid phase transitions may account for seismic and density discontinuities whose existence has been deduced from geophysical observations. The formation of magmas within the mantle involves solid-liquid and perhaps solid- liquid- vapor reactions. Solid- liquid-vapor, solid-solid and solid-vapor reactions are involved in the igneous and metamorphic processes which proceed within the earth's crust. The deformation, folding and faulting of rocks is a mechanical process, but interstitial gases or solutions may have a profound effect. Many reviews of high-pressure research and of the applications of high-pressure studies to the earth sciences have been published, and these are outlined in the next section. In view of the plethora of reviews already available, one might justifiably question the utility of one more. As the Editor, S. K. Runcorn, remarked in the preface to the first volume in this series, it is hoped that the chapter may be of value to those who wish to embark on research using unfamiliar techniques, and to those who, having read and possibly applied the results of high-pressure studies, wish to inform themselves more fully about the methods used. The available reviews are usually concerned mainly with one aspect of the field, with 'very high pressures', for example references 26, 105, 16 and 106, or with 'hydrothermal' systems at moderate pressures, or with physical properties of rocks and minerals, or with a limited range of applications. I recently published a review which attempted to cover the whole range of experimental results now available for application to the earth sciences, but I am not aware of a review in which the whole range of high-pressure techniques has been considered in detail (reference 95 provides an outline for 1956). This chapter brings together items which have been published previously in a variety of outlets. The justification for this is that the geophysicist and geologist are interested in the processes occurring within the earth from the highest of pressures and temperatures to the low values encountered at or near {{to the surface of the}} earth. The aim of the chapter is to sample the growing volume of literature, and to present it in a complete but condensed form for the general reader who has not the time to seek the information in the more specialized publications...|$|E
