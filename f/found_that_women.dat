5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> who identify as lesbian or bisexual {{are less likely to}} abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|John Frederick Conway's book, The Canadian Family in Crisis, explores {{effects of}} the double burden by gender. In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and {{psychological}} {{differences between men and}} women faced with the double burden in Canada. In these studies it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> who are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women who are just faced with one of the two burdens.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E

5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E

25|$|Krems, Neel, Neuberg, Puts and Kenrick (2016) also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> created {{larger social}} {{distance}} {{between themselves and}} a competing female, but only if she was ovulating and attractive. Similarly, this only occurred if the woman was partnered with a desirable mate. This is suggested to be because other females, especially those who are ovulating, {{are less likely to}} desire men that have limited resources.|$|E

Those who express anxious attachment styles are more likely to resist mate guarding via covert methods.|$|E

25|$|Jacobson et al. <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> report {{markedly}} {{higher rates}} of fear during marital conflicts.

Pimlott-Kubiak and Cortina found that severity and duration of abuse were the only accurate predictors of aftereffects of abuse; sex of perpetrator or victim were not reliable predictors.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that the utility of emotional approach coping varies by gender. In a longitudinal study, emotional approach coping was found to predict increased life satisfaction and decreased depressive symptoms over time in women; however, in men, emotional approach coping predicted poorer adjustment over time. Some samples have also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> report using emotional processing and expression more than men. However, research of infertile couples found no differences in the utility of emotional approach coping for men and women.|$|E
