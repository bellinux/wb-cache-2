5|$|The Buccaneers {{opened the}} Ray Perkins era by setting team records for points scored, total yardage, margin of victory, and {{touchdown}} passes thrown. Steve DeBerg was 24 of 34 for 333yards and five touchdowns, throwing touchdowns {{on each of}} the Buccaneers' first four possessions. DeBerg's five touchdown passes still stands as a Buccaneers record, having been tied by Brad Johnson in 2002. Perkins, who had played with Joe Namath in college and Johnny Unitas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pros,</b> and drafted Phil Simms with the Giants, said that DeBerg had one of the best games of any quarterback with whom he had been associated. In a completely dominating performance, the Buccaneers controlled the ball for 38minutes, allowed no sacks, and converted 14 of 16 third-down attempts. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers defense had four sacks and three turnovers. DeBerg did throw one interception, but on the very next play cornerback Bobby Futrell intercepted David Archer's overthrow of tight end Ken Whisenhunt.|$|E
