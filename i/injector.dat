5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the <b>injector,</b> which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the <b>injector,</b> and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main <b>injector</b> and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Titterton {{stepped down}} as Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences, and became an {{ordinary}} professor. Once again he spearheaded a proposal to upgrade the department's equipment, this time by using the tandem as an <b>injector</b> for a superconducting linear accelerator. Unable to secure funding in Australia, he managed to persuade the British Science Research Council to donate the required equipment to the ANU from facilities in England that were being closed down. It was installed and commissioned after his death. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1957, and was created a knight bachelor on 1 January 1970.|$|E
5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto <b>injector</b> and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E

5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the <b>injector</b> of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

A {{substantial}} {{decline of}} HIV prevalence {{has been observed}} in injection drug users (IDUs) from Rio de Janeiro, in recent years. Differential characteristics and behaviors of new (injecting for ?? 6 y) <b>injectors</b> may help to understand recent changes and to implement appropriate prevention strategies. recruited from different communities, interviewed, and tested for HIV. Contingency table analysis and t-tests {{were used to assess}} differences between new and long-term <b>injectors.</b> Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of HIV serostatus for long-term and new <b>injectors.</b> Results. HIV prevalence was 11. 7 % for 309 long-term <b>injectors</b> (95 % CI 8. 1 ??? 15. 3) and 4. 3 % for 300 new <b>injectors</b> (95 % CI 2. 0 ??? 6. 6). New <b>injectors</b> reported having engaged in treatment and having received syringes from needle exchange programs (NEPs) more frequently than long-term <b>injectors</b> in the last 6 months, but sharing behaviors remained frequent and even increased vis-a`-vis long-term <b>injectors.</b> For male new <b>injectors,</b> ??????sexual intercourse with another man?????? was found to be the sole significant risk factor for HIV infection (Adj OR?? 8. 03; 95 % CI 1. 52 ??? 42. 48). Among male long-term <b>injectors,</b> ??????to have ever injected with anyone infected with HIV?????? (Adj OR?? 3. 91; 95 % CI 1. 09 ??? 14. 06) and to have ??????ever been in prison?????? (Adj OR?? 2. 56; 95 % CI 1. 05 ??? 6. 24) were found to be significantly associated with HIV infection. Discussion. New <b>injectors</b> are seeking help in drug treatment centers or needle exchange programs. They differ from long-term <b>injectors</b> in terms of their risk factors for HIV infection and have lower prevalence levels for HIV.

25|$|The {{vaporizing}} fuel <b>injector,</b> {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the air blast <b>injector</b> in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{quantify}} all cause mortality among injecting drug users. DESIGN [...] This was a retrospective analysis of 1989 data on injecting drug users and mortality obtained from three independent agencies: the Procurator Fiscal's Office, the General Register Office, and the Scottish HIV-test register. SETTING [...] Greater Glasgow, Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] Drug <b>injectors,</b> estimated population 9424. MAIN RESULTS [...] 81 names were found using the three sources to identify deaths. After removing duplicates, 51 deaths were found. This represented a mortality rate of 0. 54 % in the estimated population. Among female <b>injectors</b> the mortality rate was 0. 85 %, {{significantly higher than the}} rate of 0. 42 % among male <b>injectors</b> (95 % CI for the true difference in mortality rates between female and male <b>injectors</b> was 0. 31 %- 0. 55 %). Over 90 % of deaths were attributed to overdose or suicide. Although AIDS caused only one death, 19 % of cases (5 / 27) whose HIV antibody status could be ascertained were positive. The mortality rate among HIV positive <b>injectors</b> (3. 8 %) was significantly higher than among HIV negative <b>injectors</b> (0. 49 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] Comprehensive coverage using three data sources revealed a far greater annual number of all cause deaths among <b>injectors</b> than would have been expected from previous research. The observed mortality rate was lower than in previous studies where the denominators used to calculate rates had an element of underenumeration. For the foreseeable future it is unlikely that AIDS will have much impact on mortality among <b>injectors</b> in Glasgow, because of the low prevalence of HIV infection among <b>injectors</b> in the city, and because HIV positive <b>injectors</b> are dying for reasons other than AIDS; rather, overdose and suicide will continue to be the main causes of death...|$|R
